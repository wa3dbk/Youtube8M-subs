00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.210
 hello everyone this is this is the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.330
 hundredth time I say this sentence 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.700
 make this hundredth video and you are 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.980
 so 5 thousand and 5 thousand are so many 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.050
 let's make a thank you video 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.460
 it seems to me like making one a month in 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.590
 actually I'm doing one a month because 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.500
 I don't know how to grow up like a mushroom boy 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.280
 you really are so many now when 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.120
 has begun 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.320
 I didn't think I would get to 5,000 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.140
 registered by the end of the year 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.370
 practically started in September e 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.530
 I thought I could reach a thousand by the end 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.030
 year the fact that the 75 thousand is a 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.309
 Incredible result of course is alone 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.320
 so your thanks then 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.360
 this video will be thank you only 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.789
 actually probably doing one 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.379
 special for my 5 but I didn't make it into 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.100
 time for holidays without 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.309
 commitments with dinners and various things then 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.200
 so sorry i do n't know what to do 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 honestly I can't do live on 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.080
 tweet because it would not emerge the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.000
 connection so I would say do a 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.350
 young by simply a fuck you 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.360
 time a bisi stuff call it like 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.420
 in short, you want those who say what they are 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.479
 you want and I will choose a few questions 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.210
 etc. and will give answers 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.460
 simply you are so many so me 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.170
 expect many questions take a while 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.380
 obviously it will come after the holidays later 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.840
 new year is everything 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.460
 when I don't know, that is what it is 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.079
 after new years the video reviews 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.290
 however they will arrive more frequently 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.380
 now there have been few because not 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.290
 there was time physically to do them 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.210
 so some news since 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.160
 however a two minute video is not a 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.260
 much we say that 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.390
 vangi said he will arrive at the end of the year 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.670
 a gift is not known what it will be but 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.430
 will be a gift for us for all 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.650
 destiny community so we hope so 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.590
 in something even decent 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.450
 decent because in short for each time 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.860
 that we give you a present were in 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.710
 big blue shit that gave stuff 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.990
 blue shit so pretty useless e 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.570
 you could see sadly I don't know if it's up to you 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.240
 also a glaze patch for January 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.370
 therefore to solve several problems 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.920
 first of all, the glitch due to crotta 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.260
 pretty ridiculous a crust fix 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.070
 why drop only energy for the boss 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.420
 final is quite ridiculous and maybe 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.390
 some arms class funding 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.510
 it would not hurt also because in short the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.370
 metal in today's target is totally 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.890
 dominated by the same weapons that dominate 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.660
 types and also pd and from the beginning of the game 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.550
 which is quite ridiculous if not 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.310
 were it for the curia that was threaded 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.720
 as the second strongest portable cannon 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.510
 and I agree and a great Roman 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.160
 some now therefore the video has managed 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.400
 fast today I should be able to put it 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.190
 another that will be a review let's say 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.900
 video 101 review of the lunar falcon e 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.280
 because now he couldn't find it 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.950
 I don't know what's happening in this 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.920
 period I am treating like never before and 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.030
 then they put it in the queue hopefully arrivals 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.840
 by today because the upload time of 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.250
 a video long enough for me then 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.100
 I hope you arrive by evening to honor 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.050
 fairly recent so I don't know 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.450
 let you see it by the end of the year 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.489
 particularly so do me several 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.900
 questions this will be the special video 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.739
 maybe before next year no 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.030
 I would know and see you in the next video 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.450
 which could then be colored 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.290
 thanks again to all 5 thousand and we are there 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.290
 the next hello video
