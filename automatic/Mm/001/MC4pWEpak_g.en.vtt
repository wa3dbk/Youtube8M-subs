 this appointment the 402 5 halls that me 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.730
 seems able to double the stake for 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.300
 his second attempt on the big 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.280

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.790
 had dropped on the occasion of his attempt 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.020
 last month but that ran well in 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.000
 last place ranking second he 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.410
 found opposition of the same caliber 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.720
 and should once again be in 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.790
 the shot the 6 in 3 heights horse 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.690

 leading roles 605 602 and 603 finally see 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.270
 the eighth the 802 in combat finds a 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.520
 lot within reach 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.840
 a great opportunity for him to play the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.110
 leading roles him who was deemed worthy 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.850

 402 605 2 and 3 and 802 concerning 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.850
 cordemais meeting two favorites 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.530
 the 400 m to be returned sylvain coup 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.240

 meeting iii in lyon parilly 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.810
 in the first I think the center 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.200
 odinga should confirm its success 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.609
 obtained on this route on April 3 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.040
 however, it will have to deal with the 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.660
 blood a little rogers who had won 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.430

 to rank second we are always at 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.210
 lyon at the beginning of the month so without 320 for 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.380
 a possible twinned order in this 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.419
 first meeting Lyon 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.070
