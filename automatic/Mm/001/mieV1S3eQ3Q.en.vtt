the most out of all four classes there's
just<00:01:38.549> something<00:01:38.670> about<00:01:39.000> playing<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.450> caster

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900

paths are kind of like side content that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.760 
paths are kind of like side content that
runs<00:02:27.150> parallel<00:02:27.239> with<00:02:27.660> your<00:02:27.930> primary<00:02:28.110> questing

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
to help break up the monotony that just

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.130 
to help break up the monotony that just
questing<00:02:31.290> alone<00:02:31.530> can<00:02:31.739> cause<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.810> Sedlar

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
questing alone can cause so the Sedlar

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.449 
questing alone can cause so the Sedlar
which<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.410> actually<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.800> first<00:02:34.830> path<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.430> I

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
which is actually the first path that I

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.670 
which is actually the first path that I
played<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> builder<00:02:36.599> path<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.470> find

you know get out of the red it should be

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
more for 25 second Telegraph's they

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.279 
more for 25 second Telegraph's they
would<00:05:15.880> go<00:05:16.030> off<00:05:16.150> within<00:05:16.300> one<00:05:16.599> to<00:05:16.630> two<00:05:16.750> seconds

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
would go off within one to two seconds

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.990 
would go off within one to two seconds
you<00:05:17.650> actually<00:05:17.800> also<00:05:18.159> start<00:05:18.520> seeing<00:05:18.759> a<00:05:18.849> lot<00:05:18.969> of

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
you actually also start seeing a lot of

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.180 
you actually also start seeing a lot of
variety<00:05:19.990> and<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.169> patterns<00:05:20.590> they<00:05:20.770> place<00:05:20.979> and

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
variety and the patterns they place and

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.010 
variety and the patterns they place and
how<00:05:21.250> they<00:05:21.370> work<00:05:21.610> for<00:05:22.270> example<00:05:22.659> one<00:05:22.840> enemy

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
how they work for example one enemy

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.930 
how they work for example one enemy
created<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.620> fork<00:05:23.949> like<00:05:24.130> Telegraph<00:05:24.669> on<00:05:24.849> the

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
created a fork like Telegraph on the

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.640 
created a fork like Telegraph on the
ground<00:05:25.150> I<00:05:25.360> mean<00:05:25.659> that's<00:05:25.750> pretty<00:05:25.990> basic<00:05:26.259> pretty

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
ground I mean that's pretty basic pretty

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.230 
ground I mean that's pretty basic pretty
easy<00:05:26.830> to<00:05:26.979> avoid<00:05:27.250> but<00:05:27.819> there<00:05:27.940> was<00:05:28.030> another

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
easy to avoid but there was another

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.809 
easy to avoid but there was another
enemy<00:05:28.569> not<00:05:29.139> too<00:05:29.349> far<00:05:29.560> away<00:05:29.590> that<00:05:30.280> puts<00:05:30.520> a<00:05:30.610> big

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
enemy not too far away that puts a big

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.249 
enemy not too far away that puts a big
red<00:05:31.120> circle<00:05:31.630> around<00:05:31.750> himself<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:33.250> basically

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
red circle around himself and basically

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.020 
red circle around himself and basically
it<00:05:35.259> acts<00:05:35.590> as<00:05:35.770> a<00:05:35.800> shock<00:05:36.130> wave<00:05:36.370> when<00:05:36.580> it<00:05:36.699> goes<00:05:36.849> off

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
it acts as a shock wave when it goes off

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.790 
it acts as a shock wave when it goes off
so<00:05:37.270> you<00:05:37.330> see<00:05:37.569> the<00:05:37.659> red<00:05:37.810> circle<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.409> you<00:05:38.620> move

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
so you see the red circle and you move

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.800 
so you see the red circle and you move
out<00:05:38.949> of<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:39.159> way<00:05:39.190> and<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.669> shock<00:05:40.330> wave<00:05:40.539> goes

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
out of the way and the shock wave goes

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.269 
out of the way and the shock wave goes
off<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.199> if<00:05:41.289> you're<00:05:41.380> not<00:05:41.469> prepared<00:05:41.620> for<00:05:41.949> it

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:42.279 
off and if you're not prepared for it

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:43.920 
off and if you're not prepared for it
BAM<00:05:42.580> you<00:05:42.789> get<00:05:42.909> smacked<00:05:43.180> you<00:05:43.449> take<00:05:43.599> a<00:05:43.630> ton<00:05:43.900> of

BAM you get smacked you take a ton of

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.050 
BAM you get smacked you take a ton of
damage<00:05:44.169> you<00:05:45.159> really<00:05:45.430> need<00:05:45.580> to<00:05:45.610> be<00:05:45.759> aware

people<00:06:12.490> say<00:06:12.669> man<00:06:13.210> this<00:06:13.690> game<00:06:13.990> looks<00:06:14.169> like

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
people say man this game looks like

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.620 
people say man this game looks like
World<00:06:14.590> of<00:06:14.680> Warcraft<00:06:15.099> and<00:06:15.370> I<00:06:15.639> mean<00:06:16.180> I<00:06:16.210> guess<00:06:16.300> at

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
World of Warcraft and I mean I guess at

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.620 
World of Warcraft and I mean I guess at
first<00:06:16.659> glance<00:06:17.169> I<00:06:17.380> could<00:06:17.560> see<00:06:17.770> that<00:06:17.949> but<00:06:18.340> I<00:06:18.630> mean

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
first glance I could see that but I mean

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.080 
first glance I could see that but I mean
let<00:06:19.750> me<00:06:19.810> after<00:06:20.139> playing<00:06:20.469> it<00:06:20.710> it<00:06:20.919> just<00:06:21.190> doesn't

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
let me after playing it it just doesn't

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.390 
let me after playing it it just doesn't
feel<00:06:22.270> like<00:06:22.330> wow<00:06:22.719> at<00:06:22.960> all<00:06:23.169> the<00:06:23.770> graphics<00:06:24.039> may<00:06:24.340> be

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
feel like wow at all the graphics may be

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.279 
feel like wow at all the graphics may be
similar<00:06:24.909> but<00:06:24.940> they<00:06:25.180> aren't<00:06:25.360> the<00:06:25.479> same<00:06:25.779> the

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
similar but they aren't the same the

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.010 
similar but they aren't the same the
combat<00:06:26.650> is<00:06:26.710> completely<00:06:27.550> different<00:06:27.759> I<00:06:28.180> guess

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
combat is completely different I guess

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.120 
combat is completely different I guess
everyone<00:06:29.380> will<00:06:29.529> have<00:06:29.620> differing<00:06:30.039> opinions

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
everyone will have differing opinions

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.309 
everyone will have differing opinions
but<00:06:30.789> it<00:06:31.120> really<00:06:31.389> just<00:06:31.690> didn't<00:06:31.930> feel<00:06:32.050> like<00:06:32.080> wow

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 
but it really just didn't feel like wow

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.740 
but it really just didn't feel like wow
to<00:06:32.380> me<00:06:32.680> which<00:06:32.949> is<00:06:33.159> really<00:06:33.639> important<00:06:34.180> I've

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
to me which is really important I've

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.629

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639
