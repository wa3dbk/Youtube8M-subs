one<00:01:24.759> that<00:01:24.909> I<00:01:24.939> think<00:01:25.060> will<00:01:25.329> take<00:01:25.539> from<00:01:25.719> it<00:01:25.960> was<00:01:26.530> a

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
one that I think will take from it was a

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.260 
one that I think will take from it was a
bit<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.799> a<00:01:26.890> rough<00:01:27.310> day<00:01:27.520> today<00:01:27.579> in<00:01:27.969> terms<00:01:28.119> of

bit of a rough day today in terms of

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.630 
bit of a rough day today in terms of
injuries<00:01:28.630> but<00:01:28.890> look<00:01:29.890> I<00:01:29.979> think<00:01:30.219> we'll<00:01:30.310> assess

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
injuries but look I think we'll assess

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.490 
injuries but look I think we'll assess
that<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:31.240> little<00:01:31.539> bit<00:01:31.630> later<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.020> see<00:01:32.200> how<00:01:32.350> they

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
that a little bit later and see how they

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.230 
that a little bit later and see how they
go<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:32.950> can<00:01:33.429> see<00:01:33.579> how<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.789> back<00:01:33.909> up<00:01:34.060> for
