00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.390 
it can be very difficult like for the
first<00:05:48.990> time<00:05:49.260> you<00:05:49.410> play<00:05:49.680> it<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:50.010> only<00:05:50.130> thing

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
first time you play it the only thing

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.730 
first time you play it the only thing
that<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:50.790> suggest<00:05:51.240> well<00:05:52.110> I'll<00:05:52.290> just<00:05:52.320> get<00:05:52.560> to<00:05:52.710> it

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
that I suggest well I'll just get to it

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.090 
that I suggest well I'll just get to it
later<00:05:53.630> I'll<00:05:54.630> tell<00:05:55.230> you<00:05:55.260> what<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.710> do<00:05:55.830> later

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
later I'll tell you what to do later

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.740 
later I'll tell you what to do later

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
when we actually get to it but this is

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.810 
when we actually get to it but this is
the<00:05:57.990> beginning<00:05:58.140> of<00:05:58.440> the<00:05:59.190> game<00:06:00.320> so<00:06:01.320> yeah

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
the beginning of the game so yeah

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.060 
the beginning of the game so yeah
getting<00:06:02.820> a<00:06:02.880> trophy<00:06:03.090> and<00:06:03.570> you<00:06:04.200> know<00:06:04.290> I<00:06:04.530> was

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
waiting for it to go down but then I

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.230 
waiting for it to go down but then I
realized<00:06:07.140> it<00:06:07.380> hey<00:06:08.160> I<00:06:08.190> guess<00:06:08.550> all<00:06:08.760> on<00:06:08.910> this<00:06:09.090> one

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
realized it hey I guess all on this one
