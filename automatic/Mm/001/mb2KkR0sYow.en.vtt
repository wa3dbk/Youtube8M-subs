actually<00:00:44.160> covering<00:00:44.489> your<00:00:44.820> CPU<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.260> see

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
actually covering your CPU you can see

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.080 
actually covering your CPU you can see
right<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> liquid<00:00:47.070> CPU<00:00:47.579> cooler<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
right here it's a liquid CPU cooler and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.790 
right here it's a liquid CPU cooler and
that's<00:00:48.539> pretty<00:00:48.690> much<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> side

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
that's pretty much it here on the side

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.580 
that's pretty much it here on the side
of<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> box<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> unit

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
of the box you can see that the unit

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.040 
of the box you can see that the unit
will<00:00:52.710> work<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.250> any<00:00:53.579> type<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.270> socket<00:00:54.780> that's

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
will work with any type of socket that's

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.939 
will work with any type of socket that's
out<00:00:55.170> there<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.680> AMD<00:00:56.610> Intel<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.320> here

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
out there be AMD Intel it's there here

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.470 
out there be AMD Intel it's there here
are<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> dimensions<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.090> all<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.449> way

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
are all the dimensions going all the way

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.219 
are all the dimensions going all the way
down<00:01:04.760> you<00:01:05.760> guys<00:01:05.939> all<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.420> using<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> 120

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
down you guys all know it's using a 120

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.420 
down you guys all know it's using a 120
fan<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.770> be<00:01:07.920> pretty<00:01:08.040> easy<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
fan so it's gonna be pretty easy to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.350 
fan so it's gonna be pretty easy to
integrate<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.909> most<00:01:09.060> systems<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.799> back<00:01:11.360> we

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
integrate in most systems on the back we

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.580 
integrate in most systems on the back we
have<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.479> little<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:12.869> more<00:01:12.960> nomenclature

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
have a little bit more nomenclature

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.770 
have a little bit more nomenclature
showing<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> some<00:01:14.790> specifics<00:01:15.270> about<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
showing you some specifics about the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.390 
showing you some specifics about the
size<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> unit<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.950> size<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.310> its

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
size of the unit the size of its

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.050 
size of the unit the size of its
radiator<00:01:19.070> like<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.189> said<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.520> unit<00:01:20.820> fit<00:01:21.000> in

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
radiator like I said this unit fit in

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
radiator like I said this unit fit in
almost<00:01:21.180> any<00:01:21.330> system<00:01:21.780> due<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.049> its<00:01:22.229> size<00:01:22.409> almost

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
almost any system due to its size almost

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.320 
almost any system due to its size almost
every<00:01:23.070> system<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.430> there<00:01:23.580> has<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.000> 120

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
every system out there has a 120

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.969 
every system out there has a 120
millimeter<00:01:24.869> fan<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> back<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.860> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
millimeter fan in the back so with that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.590 
millimeter fan in the back so with that
said<00:01:26.220> let's<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.640> ahead<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> take<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.060> out<00:01:27.330> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
said let's go ahead and take it out of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.450 
said let's go ahead and take it out of

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
focus on the unit itself I'm gonna go

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.689 
focus on the unit itself I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.090> pull<00:03:32.299> this<00:03:32.419> off<00:03:33.159> you<00:03:34.159> guys<00:03:34.310> can<00:03:34.519> see

we have a single 120 millimeter radiator
pwm<00:03:40.009> connection<00:03:41.560> on<00:03:42.560> them<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.859> flip<00:03:43.069> it<00:03:43.159> around

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
pwm connection on them to flip it around

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.849 
pwm connection on them to flip it around
here's<00:03:44.659> the<00:03:44.810> bottom<00:03:45.079> of<00:03:45.169> the<00:03:45.229> block<00:03:45.409> I'm<00:03:45.709> gonna

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
here's the bottom of the block I'm gonna
