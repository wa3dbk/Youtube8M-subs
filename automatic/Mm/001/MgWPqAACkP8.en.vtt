up<00:00:33.390> coming<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.690> short<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.410> think<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.280> show

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
up coming up short but I think this show

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.610 
up coming up short but I think this show
definitely<00:00:35.820> gave<00:00:35.940> me<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.149> little<00:00:36.300> extra

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
definitely gave me that little extra

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.139 
definitely gave me that little extra
drive<00:00:37.620> when<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> needed<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.460> go<00:00:38.760> out<00:00:38.879> hearing

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
drive when I needed it to go out hearing

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.389 
drive when I needed it to go out hearing
at<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.300> number<00:00:39.510> one<00:00:39.600> plate<00:00:39.860> last<00:00:40.860> week<00:00:41.070> did

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
at the number one plate last week did

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.889 
at the number one plate last week did
you<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.610> any<00:00:41.790> thought<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.149> wrapping<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
you have any thought of wrapping up the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.180 
you have any thought of wrapping up the
championship<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> would<00:00:43.680> seem<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:43.980> last

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
championship it would seem like last

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.680 
championship it would seem like last
week<00:00:44.370> was<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.730> normal<00:00:44.910> week<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
week was just a normal week going and to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.880 
week was just a normal week going and to
compete<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.079> really<00:00:46.410> wrapping<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
compete and really wrapping up the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590 
compete and really wrapping up the
championship<00:00:47.489> wouldn't<00:00:48.180> be<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.360> your<00:00:48.480> mind

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
championship wouldn't be on your mind

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.360 
championship wouldn't be on your mind
and<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.020> happened<00:00:49.410> yeah<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.250> mean

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and then it happened yeah like I mean

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.950 
and then it happened yeah like I mean
obviously<00:00:50.550> mathematically<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.420> was<00:00:51.510> possible

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
obviously mathematically it was possible

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
obviously mathematically it was possible
but<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:52.620> everything<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.219> actually<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.640> down

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
but for everything to actually go down

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.270 
but for everything to actually go down
like<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.239> went<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:55.530> guys<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.860> crash<00:00:56.070> out

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
like it went and for guys to crash out

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.279 
like it went and for guys to crash out
the<00:00:56.399> way<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:56.670> did<00:00:56.699> was<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.570> very<00:00:57.719> likely<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the way they did was not very likely and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.310 
the way they did was not very likely and
ended<00:00:58.890> up<00:00:58.980> happening<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.180> went<00:01:01.050> across<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
ended up happening so I went across the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.349 
ended up happening so I went across the
finish<00:01:01.590> line<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.949> first<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.460> mean<00:01:03.030> when<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> went

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
finish line the first I mean when I went

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.090 
finish line the first I mean when I went
across<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.870> was<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.409> how<00:01:04.799> long<00:01:04.979> the

across it was just like how long the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
across it was just like how long the
grace<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:05.850> once<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.930> got<00:01:06.960> down<00:01:07.260> there
