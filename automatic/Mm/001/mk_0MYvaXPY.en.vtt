 hello everyone with you harris with me 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.190
 Trogir today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hello everyone and you are watching the seventh part 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.250
 interesting facts from this about mincraft 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.260
 in which we will tell you a whole bunch 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.599
 interesting we start and enjoy 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.469
 view 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.660
 today we went let's start with a very simple 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.100
 but interesting secret in general case 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.779
 that if any wooden door 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.310
 put on one block of higher ground up 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.920
 zombies can break even 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.849
 it will be close to her so you can protect 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.279
 your house 2 secret quite interesting 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.320
 the judge is that if the field is 40 for you 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.390
 how the generation of the world is left empty then 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.280
 writes there for your time on the computer 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.570
 that's why every time the world 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.129
 generated differently 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.020
 by the way on the internet you can 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.129
 find a bunch of interesting species to 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.750
 diversify the game now she is a hundred 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.070
 percent will prove that the physics of minecraft 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.960
 defies no logic 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.129
 in general, if the flower falls on coval 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.350
 then it will break 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.539
 and the flower will continue to stand more than that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.010
 anvils are often intact so 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.969
 if you want to quickly break the anvil 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.969
 same insects on flowers 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.870
 The following fact about the trolley scientist 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.000
 pretty simple but I think not everyone 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.710
 knew about it in general if renamed 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.600
 anvil carriage after which 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.939
 put it and then break that name y 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.500
 it will remain that is, if such 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.450
 crank for example with a boat then you 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.220
 nothing will not be saved 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.630
 this fact can be applied 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.890
 somewhere mechanisms the next fact 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.750
 will be very useful in pvp 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.700
 its essence is that if we jump 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.180
 and at the same time attack her chance 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.159
 to crack 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.720
 and thereby cause double damage is 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.720
 works both on can and on players 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.009
 and so this secret will be very useful on 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.840
 different firms in short if u 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.329
 you have bad land near your house and 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.100
 it will rain it will get wet and how 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.590
 you know wet land is much better 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.360
 because not everything grows faster so 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.710
 open farm is always much better and 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.509
 more profitable by building from such a simple 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.039
 the design of the chests and water you have 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.630
 get a very cool original 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.039
 elevator and also this thing can 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.750
 use if you are very big 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.899
 warehouse you need to climb the top 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.899
 shelf 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.150
 the next secret will again be useful 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.920
 on the farm especially where there is a lot of snow in 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.260
 general and vase is that if the leash 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.640
 throw a snowball then he unhooks it 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.160
 pretty cool because you can 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.750
 to control the mind exactly the distance did 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.190
 just such a cool way you can easily 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.590
 and move quickly in a boat over 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.390
 by land it is very strange because 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.180
 do not require more than water and boats and 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:38.100
 this thing is done very quickly because 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.959
 same make a cool road on the very 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.570
 In fact, everything is very simple it can be done 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.610
 even survival for this you will need 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.740
 a pickaxe is enchanted by a silk touch 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.570
 you just leave goes through the block and 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.230
 melt it with a stone torch 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.230
 or fire 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.580
 the next secret is that 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.409
 paintings and carpets pass through 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.269
 light is it possible to apply money in 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.220
 scenery because it's not beautiful here 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.599
 if visible torch and so on and whom 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.599
 frame or baskets can be closed 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.400
 the next secret is very simple 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.890
 same time cool i'm thinking about 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.900
 He knew few people in general are usually very 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.180
 silverfish takes damage from the portal in 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.950
 ender world on her portal acts like 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.959
 spikes so if you find yourself in 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.610
 fortresses with a portal in and the just 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.970
 Stand on him and I can not ring 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.970
 you come 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.490
 The essence of the following fact is that 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.770
 the cover does not burn the fire is on top but 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.360
 at the same time the carpet burns most likely it 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:46.150
 an issue that is related to the fact that Mycroft 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:48.220
 takes a trick to a separate unit and so 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.350
 This feature will be very useful for the timing 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.480
 mechanical houses and maps on the passage 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.370
 its essence is that the usual dropper can 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.170
 hide the walls because if its 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.550
 put a block close dad items 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.230
 will still drop 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.510
 it can be used to build 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.510
 some secret places and so on 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.550
 a small fact about us version of minecraft 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.080
 namely 19 trying to get us 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.180
 the ability to take some item or 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.370
 thing second hand and what to watch for 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.169
 updates in my opinion it's very cool well 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.090
 and finally one more small secret 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.250
 did you know that obsidian is just 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.720
 replaced by gravel texture if 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.720
 take a closer look it can be easily noticed 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.700
 on this seventh part comes to an end 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.170
