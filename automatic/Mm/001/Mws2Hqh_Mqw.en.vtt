00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
I came up with the idea after looking at

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.740 
I came up with the idea after looking at
Pinterest<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.649> YouTube<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.340> blogs<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.149> just

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
Pinterest and YouTube and blogs and just

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.219 
Pinterest and YouTube and blogs and just
a<00:01:54.960> array<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.189> different<00:01:56.520> places<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:58.020> try

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
a array of different places to just try

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.350 
a array of different places to just try
to<00:01:58.259> find<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.619> solution<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.189> my<00:01:59.549> closet<00:02:00.090> space

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
to find a solution for my closet space

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.130 
to find a solution for my closet space
so<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.710> created<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.520> design<00:02:02.909> myself<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.960> it

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
so I created this design myself but it

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.170 
so I created this design myself but it
was<00:02:04.259> definitely<00:02:04.439> inspired<00:02:05.310> by<00:02:05.460> seeing<00:02:05.969> so

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
was definitely inspired by seeing so

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.839 
was definitely inspired by seeing so
many<00:02:06.299> other<00:02:06.540> people<00:02:06.930> do<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:08.399> will

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
many other people do this and I will

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.089 
many other people do this and I will
leave<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:10.259> descript<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
leave like the descript in the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.140 
leave like the descript in the
description<00:02:11.700> below<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.540> will<00:02:12.629> leave

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
description below I will leave

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.740 
description below I will leave
like<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.930> materials<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.799> I<00:02:15.099> used<00:02:16.090> but<00:02:16.420> it

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
like the materials that I used but it

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.020 
like the materials that I used but it
will<00:02:16.900> definitely<00:02:17.170> vary<00:02:17.890> depending<00:02:18.159> on<00:02:18.610> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
will definitely vary depending on the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.899 
will definitely vary depending on the
size<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.450> your<00:02:19.480> space<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:21.099> now<00:02:21.519> I'm<00:02:21.730> just

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
size of your space so now I'm just

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.390 
size of your space so now I'm just
showing<00:02:22.329> you<00:02:22.480> like<00:02:22.720> off<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.439> side<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:24.129> use

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
showing you like off to the side I use

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.640 
showing you like off to the side I use
some<00:02:24.610> shower<00:02:24.879> curtain<00:02:25.390> hooks<00:02:25.629> and<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.439> use

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
some shower curtain hooks and I use

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.160 
some shower curtain hooks and I use
those<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.189> put<00:02:27.340> my<00:02:27.610> belt<00:02:27.909> someone<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.689> it's

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
those to put my belt someone and it's

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.589 
those to put my belt someone and it's
been<00:02:29.439> so<00:02:29.859> convenient<00:02:30.370> because<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.970> don't<00:02:31.420> have

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
been so convenient because I don't have

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.929 
been so convenient because I don't have
to<00:02:31.750> go<00:02:31.900> searching<00:02:32.200> through<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.769> drawer<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.640> find

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
to go searching through a drawer to find

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.390 
to go searching through a drawer to find
my<00:02:34.209> belt<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.840> can<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.230> look<00:02:35.409> right<00:02:35.709> there<00:02:36.010> and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
my belt I can just look right there and

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.619 
my belt I can just look right there and
it<00:02:37.060> has<00:02:37.569> been<00:02:37.870> just<00:02:38.409> that<00:02:38.739> easy<00:02:39.099> but<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:40.060> great

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
it has been just that easy but a great

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.170 
it has been just that easy but a great
solution<00:02:41.379> when<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.890> am<00:02:42.189> trying<00:02:42.609> to<00:02:42.760> hurry<00:02:43.060> up

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
solution when I am trying to hurry up

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.660 
solution when I am trying to hurry up
because<00:02:43.629> I'm<00:02:43.870> usually<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.680> last<00:02:44.859> one<00:02:45.040> out<00:02:45.370> of

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
because I'm usually the last one out of

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.339 
because I'm usually the last one out of
the<00:02:45.879> house<00:02:46.060> when<00:02:46.450> we<00:02:46.480> have<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.870> go<00:02:47.019> somewhere

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
the house when we have to go somewhere

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.160 
the house when we have to go somewhere
and<00:02:48.120> right<00:02:49.120> here<00:02:49.389> I'm<00:02:49.510> just<00:02:49.569> showing<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.049> a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
and right here I'm just showing you a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.099 
and right here I'm just showing you a
tight<00:02:50.530> shot<00:02:50.889> of<00:02:51.220> some<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.120> pieces<00:02:52.329> I<00:02:52.690> used

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
tight shot of some of the pieces I used

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.640 
tight shot of some of the pieces I used
and<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:54.400> little<00:02:54.819> T<00:02:55.030> part<00:02:55.359> is<00:02:55.599> called<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.290> tee

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
and that little T part is called a tee

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.039 
and that little T part is called a tee
and<00:02:57.639> the<00:02:57.909> one<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.269> I'm<00:02:58.450> zooming<00:02:58.810> in<00:02:58.989> the

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
and the one that I'm zooming in the

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.830 
and the one that I'm zooming in the
circle<00:02:59.739> that<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:00.489> actually<00:03:01.150> called<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.810> believe

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
circle that is actually called I believe

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.470 
circle that is actually called I believe
a<00:03:02.109> flat<00:03:02.530> flank<00:03:02.980> if<00:03:03.370> I'm<00:03:03.819> pronouncing<00:03:04.000> that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
a flat flank if I'm pronouncing that

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.690 
a flat flank if I'm pronouncing that
right<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.109> that<00:03:05.500> was<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.859> most<00:03:06.010> expensive

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
right and that was the most expensive

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.670 
right and that was the most expensive
part<00:03:07.000> those<00:03:07.359> were<00:03:07.599> like<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:08.049> believe<00:03:08.349> ten

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
part those were like I believe ten

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.800 
part those were like I believe ten
dollars<00:03:09.159> and<00:03:09.519> I<00:03:09.909> know<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.209> varies<00:03:10.599> just

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
dollars and I know it varies just

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.690 
dollars and I know it varies just
depending<00:03:11.200> on<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.470> store<00:03:11.769> but<00:03:12.099> I<00:03:12.250> had<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.579> get

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
depending on the store but I had to get

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.360 
depending on the store but I had to get
four<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.030> those<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.540> was<00:03:13.810> 40<00:03:14.290> bucks<00:03:14.560> so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
four of those so that was 40 bucks so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.670 
four of those so that was 40 bucks so
that<00:03:15.970> was<00:03:16.329> where<00:03:16.569> a<00:03:16.840> lot<00:03:17.049> of<00:03:17.079> money<00:03:17.319> came<00:03:17.620> from

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
that was where a lot of money came from

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.629 
that was where a lot of money came from
I<00:03:18.310> just<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.180> quick<00:03:19.449> tip<00:03:19.780> if<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:21.010> get<00:03:21.220> your<00:03:21.400> pipes

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
I just a quick tip if you get your pipes

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.750 
I just a quick tip if you get your pipes
cut<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.989> don't<00:03:23.349> use<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.829> standard<00:03:24.340> size

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
cut you don't use the standard size

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.390 
cut you don't use the standard size
that's<00:03:25.180> already<00:03:25.540> cut<00:03:25.840> for<00:03:26.079> you<00:03:26.230> ask<00:03:26.470> them<00:03:27.099> to

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
that's already cut for you ask them to

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.520 
that's already cut for you ask them to
use<00:03:27.699> the<00:03:28.000> long<00:03:28.269> ones<00:03:28.599> and<00:03:28.870> cut<00:03:29.079> them<00:03:29.290> down

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
use the long ones and cut them down

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.860 
use the long ones and cut them down
because<00:03:29.889> that<00:03:30.340> was<00:03:30.519> a<00:03:30.549> lot<00:03:30.849> cheaper<00:03:31.209> for<00:03:31.449> me<00:03:31.690> to

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
because that was a lot cheaper for me to

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.039 
because that was a lot cheaper for me to
do<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.889> way<00:03:33.129> then<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.970> use<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.810> pieces

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
do it that way then to use the pieces

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.069 
do it that way then to use the pieces
that<00:03:35.560> were<00:03:35.889> already<00:03:36.129> pre-cut<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.720> just<00:03:37.959> a

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
that were already pre-cut so just a

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.860 
that were already pre-cut so just a
little<00:03:38.349> tip<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.919> another<00:03:39.760> tip<00:03:40.000> too<00:03:40.209> is<00:03:40.419> do<00:03:40.690> not

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
little tip and another tip too is do not

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.409 
little tip and another tip too is do not
use<00:03:41.079> PVC<00:03:41.530> because<00:03:42.159> it<00:03:42.310> will<00:03:42.430> not<00:03:42.669> hold<00:03:43.060> your

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
use PVC because it will not hold your

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.949 
use PVC because it will not hold your
clothes<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.560> plastic<00:03:45.190> will<00:03:45.400> bow<00:03:45.669> and<00:03:46.060> yes<00:03:46.750> it

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
clothes that plastic will bow and yes it

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.770 
clothes that plastic will bow and yes it
is<00:03:47.109> extremely<00:03:48.010> cheaper<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.729> lot<00:03:49.299> cheaper<00:03:49.569> but

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
is extremely cheaper a lot cheaper but

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.069 
is extremely cheaper a lot cheaper but
you<00:03:50.590> will<00:03:50.979> end<00:03:51.519> up<00:03:51.849> wasting<00:03:52.180> your<00:03:52.449> money<00:03:52.810> in

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
you will end up wasting your money in

00:03:53.079 --> 00:04:03.710 
you will end up wasting your money in
the<00:03:53.199> long<00:03:53.379> run<00:03:53.409> so<00:03:53.949> just<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.609> little<00:03:54.879> FYI

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.840 

and<00:04:03.840> this<00:04:04.470> was<00:04:04.650> just<00:04:04.860> a<00:04:04.980> easy<00:04:05.190> way<00:04:05.490> for<00:04:05.730> me<00:04:05.820> to

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
and this was just a easy way for me to
