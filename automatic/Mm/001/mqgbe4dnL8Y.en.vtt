00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
oh look it's another theory video yeah

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.599 
oh look it's another theory video yeah
whoa<00:00:03.240> what<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.780> surprise<00:00:04.290> I'm<00:00:05.069> sorry<00:00:05.400> if<00:00:05.549> you

whoa what a surprise I'm sorry if you
don't<00:00:05.730> like<00:00:05.819> these<00:00:06.089> three<00:00:06.330> videos<00:00:06.629> but<00:00:07.200> I

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
don't like these three videos but I

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.129 
don't like these three videos but I
promise<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:08.250> one<00:00:08.519> in<00:00:08.700> particular<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:09.480> going

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
promise this one in particular is going

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.169 
promise this one in particular is going
to<00:00:10.260> be<00:00:10.380> really<00:00:10.679> good<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.340> mean<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.820> other<00:00:11.940> ones

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
to be really good I mean the other ones

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.549 
to be really good I mean the other ones
were<00:00:12.330> great<00:00:12.570> they're<00:00:12.960> those<00:00:13.200> are<00:00:13.320> fine<00:00:13.530> but

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
were great they're those are fine but

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.350 
were great they're those are fine but
this<00:00:13.889> one<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.580> one's<00:00:14.849> really<00:00:15.000> going<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.269> make

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
this one this one's really going to make

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.540 
this one this one's really going to make
me<00:00:15.420> think<00:00:15.690> about<00:00:15.870> how<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.500> gameplay<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.369> going

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
me think about how the gameplay is going

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.090 
me think about how the gameplay is going
to<00:00:17.670> be<00:00:17.789> overall<00:00:18.420> because<00:00:19.289> earlier<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:19.980> were

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
to be overall because earlier we were

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.620 
to be overall because earlier we were
just<00:00:20.250> talking<00:00:20.520> about<00:00:20.699> kind<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
just talking about kind of like the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.090 
just talking about kind of like the
story<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.380> time<00:00:22.590> we're<00:00:22.740> going<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.949> talk

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
story but this time we're going to talk

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.400 
story but this time we're going to talk
about<00:00:23.220> how<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.789> game<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.449> going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.750> play<00:00:25.140> and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
about how the game is going to play and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.140 
about how the game is going to play and
how<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.529> animatronic<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.970> behave

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
how the animatronic is going to behave

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.550 
how the animatronic is going to behave
towards<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.230> vplayer<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:30.199> before<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.230> get<00:00:31.439> into

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
towards you vplayer so before I get into

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.950 
towards you vplayer so before I get into
this<00:00:31.679> theory<00:00:32.219> let's<00:00:32.640> recap<00:00:33.180> some<00:00:33.390> stuff<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
this theory let's recap some stuff a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.290 
this theory let's recap some stuff a
while<00:00:34.410> back<00:00:34.440> Scott<00:00:35.160> Cawthon<00:00:35.460> released<00:00:36.090> this

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
while back Scott Cawthon released this

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.780 
while back Scott Cawthon released this
picture<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.809> his<00:00:36.930> website<00:00:37.170> which<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
picture on his website which is just the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.600 
picture on his website which is just the
box<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.510> ominous<00:00:40.079> box<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> bunch<00:00:41.460> of

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
box the ominous box with a bunch of

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.000 
box the ominous box with a bunch of
parts<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.149> now<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> think<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.620> actually

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
parts in it now I think this is actually

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
parts in it now I think this is actually
really<00:00:44.250> important<00:00:45.120> obviously<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.780> it

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
really important obviously because it

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.229 
really important obviously because it
just<00:00:46.020> has<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> box<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.980> parts<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:48.000> I'm<00:00:48.090> gonna

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
just has a box of parts but I'm gonna

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.720 
just has a box of parts but I'm gonna
tell<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.600> why<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.559> box<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.489> in

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
tell you why this box is going to be in

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.779 
tell you why this box is going to be in
my<00:00:51.059> theory<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:52.530> not<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.680> my<00:00:53.160> theory<00:00:53.489> too

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
my theory it's not just my theory too

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.029 
my theory it's not just my theory too
it's<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.239> couple<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.079> couple<00:00:55.469> people<00:00:55.620> around<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
it's a couple a couple people around the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.709 
it's a couple a couple people around the
internet<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.730> been<00:00:57.149> talking<00:00:57.510> about<00:00:57.600> this

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
internet have been talking about this

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.080 
internet have been talking about this
little<00:00:58.140> theory<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.190> feel<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.879> one

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
little theory and I feel like this one

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.299 
little theory and I feel like this one
is<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> most<00:01:00.510> accurate<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.199> one<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.649> very

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
is the most accurate this one is very

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.630 
is the most accurate this one is very
very<00:01:02.670> likely<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:05.010> real<00:01:05.309> game

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
very likely to be in the real game

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.010 
very likely to be in the real game
because<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.240> sounds<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.689> it's

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
because it just sounds like it's

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.679 
because it just sounds like it's
something<00:01:07.320> Scott<00:01:07.740> would<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.790> yes<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.360> box

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
something Scott would do so yes this box

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.600 
something Scott would do so yes this box
filled<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.320> bunch<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.740> parts<00:01:11.040> has

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
filled with a bunch of parts has

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
filled with a bunch of parts has
something<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> do<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.170> theory<00:01:13.470> let's

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
something to do with the theory let's

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.920 
something to do with the theory let's
continue<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.970> course<00:01:15.030> we've<00:01:15.450> all<00:01:15.600> seen

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
continue so of course we've all seen

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.960 
continue so of course we've all seen
this<00:01:16.140> new<00:01:16.350> animatronic<00:01:17.100> which<00:01:17.310> people<00:01:17.700> say

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
this new animatronic which people say

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.969 
this new animatronic which people say
it's<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.270> golden<00:01:18.689> Bonnie<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.560> don't<00:01:19.860> really

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it's a golden Bonnie but I don't really

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.830 
it's a golden Bonnie but I don't really
see<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.549> mean<00:01:20.700> he<00:01:20.850> has<00:01:21.030> different<00:01:21.479> futures

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
see it I mean he has different futures

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.770 
see it I mean he has different futures
obviously<00:01:22.549> well<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.670> first<00:01:24.119> he's<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> different

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
obviously well up first he's a different

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.929 
obviously well up first he's a different
color<00:01:25.020> which<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.950> where<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.520> that's<00:01:26.759> where

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
color which of where is that's where

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.819 
color which of where is that's where
people<00:01:27.210> get<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> name<00:01:27.570> golden<00:01:27.930> Bonnie<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
people get the name golden Bonnie but it

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.560 
people get the name golden Bonnie but it
is<00:01:29.009> are<00:01:29.250> also<00:01:29.369> kind<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.909> different<00:01:30.360> than<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
is are also kind of different than the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.960 
is are also kind of different than the
more<00:01:30.750> spaced<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.590> skinnier<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
more spaced out and skinnier and the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.030 
more spaced out and skinnier and the
animatronic<00:01:33.960> overall<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.470> lot<00:01:34.619> skinnier

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
animatronic overall is a lot skinnier

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.069 
animatronic overall is a lot skinnier
he's<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> lot<00:01:35.460> more<00:01:35.610> agile<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.540> whatever<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
he's a lot more agile and whatever I

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.780 
he's a lot more agile and whatever I
don't<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.860> how<00:01:37.950> people<00:01:38.070> got<00:01:38.310> golden<00:01:38.640> bunny

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
don't know how people got golden bunny

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.249 
don't know how people got golden bunny
but<00:01:39.060> that's<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:39.390> what<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.600> theories<00:01:39.960> about

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
but that's not what this theories about

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.249 
but that's not what this theories about
theory<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.460> about<00:01:41.820> how<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.420> n<00:01:42.659> metronic<00:01:43.140> is

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
theory is about how this n metronic is

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.039 
theory is about how this n metronic is
going<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.649> behave<00:01:43.799> towards<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.939> think<00:01:45.780> as

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
going to behave towards you I think as

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.020 
going to behave towards you I think as
well<00:01:46.710> as<00:01:46.890> some<00:01:47.100> others<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.399> this

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
well as some others that this

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.090 
well as some others that this
animatronic<00:01:48.420> actually<00:01:49.290> doesn't<00:01:49.710> want<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
animatronic actually doesn't want to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.730 
animatronic actually doesn't want to
kill<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.659> well<00:01:51.659> he<00:01:52.079> doesn't<00:01:52.259> want<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.500> kill

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
kill you well he doesn't want to kill

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.670 
kill you well he doesn't want to kill
you<00:01:52.860> himself<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.540> box<00:01:54.750> behind<00:01:55.020> him<00:01:55.439> I

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you himself you see the box behind him I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.130 
you himself you see the box behind him I
think<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.909> only<00:01:57.090> reason<00:01:57.270> why<00:01:57.479> he<00:01:57.509> goes<00:01:57.810> into

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
think the only reason why he goes into

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.039 
think the only reason why he goes into
your<00:01:58.290> room<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.700> jump<00:02:00.060> scare<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.540> but

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
your room is to just jump scare you but

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.050 
your room is to just jump scare you but
not<00:02:01.229> kill<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.710> he'll<00:02:02.100> go<00:02:02.280> into<00:02:02.490> your<00:02:02.670> room<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
not kill you he'll go into your room and

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.510 
not kill you he'll go into your room and
he'll<00:02:03.600> take<00:02:03.810> apart<00:02:04.290> from<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> box<00:02:04.950> behind<00:02:05.219> him

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
he'll take apart from the box behind him

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.280 
he'll take apart from the box behind him
just<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:05.880> part<00:02:06.119> he<00:02:06.420> takes<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:06.930> part<00:02:07.140> at<00:02:07.229> a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
just one part he takes one part at a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.139 
just one part he takes one part at a
time<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.310> runs<00:02:08.399> away<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.819> goes<00:02:08.940> to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
time and then it runs away it goes to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.550 
time and then it runs away it goes to
wherever<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.599> hell<00:02:09.780> he's<00:02:10.020> building<00:02:10.440> this

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
wherever the hell he's building this

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.410 
wherever the hell he's building this
thing<00:02:10.619> when<00:02:11.340> i<00:02:11.370> say<00:02:11.610> building<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.150> because<00:02:12.390> i

thing when i say building is because i
think<00:02:12.569> every

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
think every

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.350 
think every
time<00:02:13.560> he<00:02:13.650> goes<00:02:13.800> into<00:02:14.100> your<00:02:14.250> room<00:02:14.460> he<00:02:15.060> snatches

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
time he goes into your room he snatches

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.300 
time he goes into your room he snatches
apart<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.440> goes<00:02:16.560> back<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.950> his<00:02:17.040> laboratory

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
apart and it goes back to his laboratory

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.090 
apart and it goes back to his laboratory
or<00:02:17.910> wherever<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.480> hell<00:02:18.510> he<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.230> he<00:02:19.770> starts

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
or wherever the hell he is and he starts

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.240 
or wherever the hell he is and he starts
constructing<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:21.230> monstrosity<00:02:22.230> he's<00:02:23.100> gonna

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
constructing this monstrosity he's gonna

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.580 
constructing this monstrosity he's gonna
make<00:02:23.490> this<00:02:23.730> big<00:02:24.200> animatronic<00:02:25.200> that's<00:02:25.380> going

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
make this big animatronic that's going

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.100 
make this big animatronic that's going
to<00:02:25.680> go<00:02:26.040> after<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.700> kill<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.450> don't

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
to go after you and kill you I don't

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.900 
to go after you and kill you I don't
think<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.380> animatronic<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:29.160> going<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.670> kill

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
think this animatronic is going to kill

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.490 
think this animatronic is going to kill
you<00:02:30.030> himself<00:02:30.210> but<00:02:30.570> he's<00:02:30.870> going<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.110> build<00:02:31.350> an

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
you himself but he's going to build an

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.040 
you himself but he's going to build an
animatronic<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.640> do<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.840> what<00:02:34.020> I

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
animatronic to do so and this is what I

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.200 
animatronic to do so and this is what I
think<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:35.040> here's<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.490> map<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.970> Scott

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
think so here's the map that Scott

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.720 
think so here's the map that Scott
Cawthon<00:02:36.480> currently<00:02:37.050> has<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.560> his<00:02:37.710> website<00:02:37.920> it

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
Cawthon currently has on his website it

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.250 
Cawthon currently has on his website it
is<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:39.120> have<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.420> know<00:02:39.510> those<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.900> office

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
is to have you know those the office

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.320 
is to have you know those the office
there's<00:02:40.530> hallways<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.460> then<00:02:41.670> there's<00:02:42.210> an

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
there's hallways and then there's an

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.030 
there's hallways and then there's an
arrow<00:02:42.600> at<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.840> top<00:02:42.960> and<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.380> think<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.740> arrow

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
arrow at the top and I think that arrow

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.670 
arrow at the top and I think that arrow
represents<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.940> one<00:02:45.330> animatronic<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.530> is

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
represents the one animatronic that is

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.740 
represents the one animatronic that is
trying<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.040> get<00:02:47.190> into<00:02:47.370> your<00:02:47.670> room<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.540> take

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
trying to get into your room to take

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.380 
trying to get into your room to take
apart<00:02:49.110> from<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.440> box<00:02:49.710> so<00:02:50.610> maybe<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.150> arrow

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
apart from the box so maybe that arrow

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.050 
apart from the box so maybe that arrow
will<00:02:51.930> move<00:02:52.170> from<00:02:52.440> time<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:52.830> time<00:02:52.860> did<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.910> you

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
will move from time to time did like you

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.880 
will move from time to time did like you
know<00:02:54.180> indicating<00:02:54.750> where<00:02:55.080> he<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.380> on<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.710> map

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
know indicating where he is on the map

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.040 
know indicating where he is on the map
I'm<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.760> sure<00:02:56.820> why<00:02:57.210> that<00:02:57.240> arrow<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.780> there

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
I'm not sure why that arrow is there

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.990 
I'm not sure why that arrow is there
maybe<00:02:58.860> that's<00:02:59.130> where<00:02:59.310> he's<00:02:59.340> building<00:02:59.910> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
maybe that's where he's building the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.420 
maybe that's where he's building the
animatronic<00:03:00.600> who<00:03:00.810> knows<00:03:01.020> but<00:03:01.920> let's<00:03:02.130> look<00:03:02.280> at

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
animatronic who knows but let's look at

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
animatronic who knows but let's look at
the<00:03:02.580> map<00:03:02.610> when<00:03:03.060> we<00:03:03.090> brighten<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.750> up<00:03:05.270> so<00:03:06.270> here's

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
the map when we brighten it up so here's

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.540 
the map when we brighten it up so here's
the<00:03:06.630> brightened<00:03:06.990> up<00:03:07.080> image<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:08.220> can<00:03:08.250> see

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
the brightened up image and you can see

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.630 
the brightened up image and you can see
all<00:03:08.730> these<00:03:08.880> weird<00:03:09.770> you<00:03:10.770> know<00:03:10.800> grayish

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
all these weird you know grayish

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.270 
all these weird you know grayish
greenish<00:03:12.320> rectangles<00:03:13.320> just<00:03:13.500> everywhere<00:03:13.920> and

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
greenish rectangles just everywhere and

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.479 
greenish rectangles just everywhere and
I<00:03:14.640> think<00:03:14.880> those<00:03:15.240> are<00:03:15.770> obviously<00:03:16.770> secret

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
I think those are obviously secret

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.610 
I think those are obviously secret
passages<00:03:17.880> but<00:03:18.060> not<00:03:18.239> judge<00:03:18.420> secret<00:03:18.750> passages<00:03:19.260> I

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
passages but not judge secret passages I

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.360 
passages but not judge secret passages I
think<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.370> is<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.700> ventilation<00:03:21.570> system

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
think that is the ventilation system

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.370 
think that is the ventilation system
okay<00:03:23.370> because<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:24.000> think<00:03:24.140> well<00:03:25.140> it's<00:03:25.290> supposed

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
okay because I think well it's supposed

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.540 
okay because I think well it's supposed
to<00:03:25.530> be<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.650> ventilation<00:03:25.950> that's<00:03:26.280> supposed<00:03:26.459> to

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
to be a ventilation that's supposed to

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.770 
to be a ventilation that's supposed to
be<00:03:26.610> kind<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:26.970> hidden<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.390> building<00:03:27.690> you

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
be kind of hidden in the building you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.540 
be kind of hidden in the building you
don't<00:03:27.959> really<00:03:28.170> see<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.590> well<00:03:28.920> she's<00:03:29.310> kind

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
don't really see it that well she's kind

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.190 
don't really see it that well she's kind
of<00:03:29.610> there<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.120> keep<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.420> place<00:03:30.600> cool<00:03:30.930> whatever

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
of there to keep the place cool whatever

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.740 
of there to keep the place cool whatever
but<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.010> think<00:03:32.190> those<00:03:32.340> are<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.640> air<00:03:32.820> ducts<00:03:33.180> the

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
but I think those are the air ducts the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.180 
but I think those are the air ducts the
way<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.959> animatronic<00:03:34.500> can<00:03:34.620> crawl<00:03:34.860> through

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
way the animatronic can crawl through

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.920 
way the animatronic can crawl through
and<00:03:35.370> get<00:03:35.520> through<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:36.450> know<00:03:36.570> without<00:03:36.750> you

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
and get through you know without you

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.479 
and get through you know without you
actually<00:03:37.560> seeing<00:03:37.800> him<00:03:37.950> on<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.190> cameras

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
actually seeing him on the cameras

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.940 
actually seeing him on the cameras
anywhere<00:03:38.850> which<00:03:39.600> is<00:03:39.810> what<00:03:40.110> leads<00:03:40.320> me<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.800> this

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
anywhere which is what leads me to this

exit button I don't know exactly what
these<00:03:56.280> could<00:03:56.760> do<00:03:57.030> but<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.050> do<00:03:58.230> have<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.590> theory

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
these could do but I do have a theory

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.400 
these could do but I do have a theory
that<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.310> ventilation<00:04:00.030> button<00:04:00.360> could<00:04:01.170> has

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
that the ventilation button could has

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.600 
that the ventilation button could has
something<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.739> do<00:04:01.890> with<00:04:02.160> these<00:04:02.280> secret

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
something to do with these secret

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.449 
something to do with these secret
passages<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:04.410> reason<00:04:04.709> why<00:04:04.890> I'm<00:04:05.220> bringing

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
passages and the reason why I'm bringing

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.550 
passages and the reason why I'm bringing
this<00:04:05.730> up<00:04:05.880> is<00:04:06.060> because<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.420> think<00:04:06.780> with<00:04:07.350> this

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
this up is because I think with this

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.720 
this up is because I think with this
menu<00:04:07.860> right<00:04:07.980> here<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.700> use<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.300> to<00:04:10.019> try<00:04:10.440> to

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
menu right here you use this to try to

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.090 
menu right here you use this to try to
keep<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.269> animatronic<00:04:12.989> away<00:04:13.350> from<00:04:13.680> your<00:04:13.860> room

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
keep the animatronic away from your room

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.860 
keep the animatronic away from your room
I<00:04:14.400> think<00:04:14.880> that's<00:04:15.030> what<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.209> do<00:04:15.480> during<00:04:15.750> the

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
I think that's what you do during the

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.539 
I think that's what you do during the
whole<00:04:16.140> night<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.680> just<00:04:16.859> try<00:04:16.980> to<00:04:17.040> keep<00:04:17.310> him

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
whole night is you just try to keep him

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.210 
whole night is you just try to keep him
at<00:04:17.730> bay<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:18.690> keep<00:04:18.900> him<00:04:19.049> away<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:20.010> he<00:04:20.130> doesn't

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
at bay you keep him away so he doesn't

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.180 
at bay you keep him away so he doesn't
steal<00:04:20.580> any<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:20.880> your<00:04:21.090> parts<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.750> if<00:04:22.320> he<00:04:22.919> steals

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
steal any of your parts and if he steals

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.800 
steal any of your parts and if he steals
too<00:04:23.400> many<00:04:23.580> parts<00:04:23.910> in<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.120> animatronic<00:04:24.660> comes

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
too many parts in the animatronic comes

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.850 
too many parts in the animatronic comes
after<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.229> your<00:04:25.530> screw

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
after you and your screw

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.649 
after you and your screw
kind<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.310> like<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.639> music<00:04:26.939> box<00:04:27.090> if<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:27.360> don't

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:27.659 
kind of like the music box if you don't

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.020 
kind of like the music box if you don't
keep<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:28.050> wound<00:04:28.259> up<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.770> puppet<00:04:29.639> comes<00:04:29.849> out

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
keep it wound up the puppet comes out

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.909 
keep it wound up the puppet comes out
and<00:04:30.210> he<00:04:30.330> kills<00:04:30.539> you<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:30.990> think<00:04:31.620> he's<00:04:31.740> going<00:04:31.860> to

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
and he kills you I think he's going to

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.129 
and he kills you I think he's going to
use<00:04:32.099> the<00:04:32.219> same<00:04:32.460> kind<00:04:32.699> of<00:04:32.789> mechanic<00:04:33.180> here<00:04:33.419> but

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
use the same kind of mechanic here but

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.230 
use the same kind of mechanic here but
really<00:04:34.860> innovated<00:04:35.400> off<00:04:35.520> of<00:04:35.669> that<00:04:35.789> and<00:04:35.969> made

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
really innovated off of that and made

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.809 
really innovated off of that and made
this<00:04:36.479> little<00:04:36.870> menu<00:04:37.020> audio<00:04:37.949> devices<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.520> camera

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
this little menu audio devices in camera

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.149 
this little menu audio devices in camera
system<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.210> don't<00:04:39.419> know<00:04:39.479> what<00:04:39.659> those<00:04:39.840> could<00:04:40.080> be

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:40.159 
system I don't know what those could be

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.619 
system I don't know what those could be
but<00:04:41.159> I<00:04:41.189> know<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.460> ventilation<00:04:42.000> could<00:04:42.150> help<00:04:42.419> to

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
but I know the ventilation could help to

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:45.230 
but I know the ventilation could help to
keep<00:04:42.810> him<00:04:42.990> out<00:04:43.139> of<00:04:43.169> there<00:04:43.469> so<00:04:44.069> that's<00:04:44.280> my<00:04:44.759> whole

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
keep him out of there so that's my whole

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.689 
keep him out of there so that's my whole
theory<00:04:45.599> about<00:04:45.810> this<00:04:46.139> thing<00:04:46.349> so<00:04:46.979> to<00:04:47.039> recap<00:04:47.280> I

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
theory about this thing so to recap I

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.730 
theory about this thing so to recap I
think<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.330> this<00:04:48.539> animatronic<00:04:48.930> actually

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
think that this animatronic actually

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.890 
think that this animatronic actually
doesn't<00:04:50.129> harm<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.610> but<00:04:51.210> every<00:04:51.479> time<00:04:51.629> he<00:04:51.689> goes

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
doesn't harm you but every time he goes

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.959 
doesn't harm you but every time he goes
into<00:04:52.169> your<00:04:52.199> room<00:04:52.469> he<00:04:52.680> takes<00:04:52.979> apart<00:04:53.430> from<00:04:53.789> the

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
into your room he takes apart from the

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.360 
into your room he takes apart from the
box<00:04:54.240> and<00:04:54.599> he<00:04:54.719> goes<00:04:54.930> back<00:04:55.259> to<00:04:55.469> wherever<00:04:55.650> he<00:04:56.099> was

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
box and he goes back to wherever he was

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.879 
box and he goes back to wherever he was
so<00:04:57.360> all<00:04:57.539> it<00:04:57.689> does<00:04:57.840> is<00:04:57.990> jump<00:04:58.289> scare<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.680> which

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
so all it does is jump scare you which

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.379 
so all it does is jump scare you which
of<00:04:58.919> course<00:04:59.189> that's<00:04:59.550> what<00:04:59.759> Scott's<00:05:00.060> going<00:05:00.300> to

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
of course that's what Scott's going to

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.269 
of course that's what Scott's going to
do<00:05:00.479> because<00:05:00.719> that's<00:05:01.680> how<00:05:01.830> he<00:05:01.889> gets<00:05:02.129> all<00:05:02.219> his

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:02.279 
do because that's how he gets all his

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:03.950 
do because that's how he gets all his
huge<00:05:02.729> reactions<00:05:03.300> is<00:05:03.419> by<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:03.599> jump-scares

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
huge reactions is by the jump-scares

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.839 
huge reactions is by the jump-scares
which<00:05:04.469> aren't<00:05:04.680> even<00:05:04.919> that<00:05:05.099> interesting

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
which aren't even that interesting

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.540 
which aren't even that interesting
anymore<00:05:06.060> I'm<00:05:06.449> just<00:05:06.479> playing<00:05:06.930> this<00:05:07.110> game<00:05:07.289> now

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
anymore I'm just playing this game now

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.950 
anymore I'm just playing this game now
because<00:05:08.550> I<00:05:08.580> liked<00:05:08.849> the<00:05:08.969> stories<00:05:09.449> too<00:05:09.659> much<00:05:09.840> I

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
because I liked the stories too much I

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.899 
because I liked the stories too much I
want<00:05:10.169> to<00:05:10.199> see<00:05:10.379> where<00:05:10.620> it<00:05:10.770> goes<00:05:10.979> so<00:05:11.789> the

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
want to see where it goes so the

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.580 
want to see where it goes so the
animatronic<00:05:12.479> goes<00:05:12.599> into<00:05:12.779> your<00:05:12.900> room<00:05:13.050> takes

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
animatronic goes into your room takes

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.980 
animatronic goes into your room takes
apart<00:05:13.919> he<00:05:14.370> goes<00:05:14.520> back<00:05:14.729> to<00:05:14.879> ever<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.479> hell<00:05:15.689> he

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
apart he goes back to ever the hell he

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.929 
apart he goes back to ever the hell he
wants<00:05:16.229> and<00:05:16.620> then<00:05:16.800> he<00:05:16.889> started<00:05:17.039> building<00:05:17.520> this

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:17.939 
wants and then he started building this

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:19.550 
wants and then he started building this
giant<00:05:18.360> animatronic<00:05:18.569> to<00:05:18.960> come<00:05:19.110> after<00:05:19.439> you<00:05:19.529> and

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
giant animatronic to come after you and

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.830 
giant animatronic to come after you and
kill<00:05:20.069> you<00:05:20.099> I<00:05:20.580> don't<00:05:21.060> know<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:21.389> just<00:05:21.479> think

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
kill you I don't know I just think

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.059 
kill you I don't know I just think
that's<00:05:21.990> how<00:05:22.169> it's<00:05:22.289> going<00:05:22.379> to<00:05:22.469> be<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.740> if<00:05:22.860> there

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
that's how it's going to be and if there

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.760 
that's how it's going to be and if there
is<00:05:23.099> a<00:05:23.250> 20<00:05:23.759> mode<00:05:23.969> 20<00:05:24.509> 20<00:05:24.750> 20<00:05:24.870> mode<00:05:25.139> whatever<00:05:25.529> I

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
is a 20 mode 20 20 20 mode whatever I

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.040 
is a 20 mode 20 20 20 mode whatever I
feel<00:05:26.250> exists<00:05:26.639> it's<00:05:26.969> just<00:05:27.150> going<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.330> be<00:05:27.389> this

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
feel exists it's just going to be this

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.779 
feel exists it's just going to be this
animatronic<00:05:28.409> that's<00:05:28.860> being<00:05:29.009> controlled<00:05:29.520> and

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
animatronic that's being controlled and

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.689 
animatronic that's being controlled and
it's<00:05:30.419> gonna<00:05:30.599> be<00:05:30.900> like<00:05:31.589> how<00:05:31.770> fast<00:05:32.099> he<00:05:32.339> is<00:05:32.370> or<00:05:32.669> I

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
it's gonna be like how fast he is or I

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.999 
it's gonna be like how fast he is or I
don't<00:05:32.879> know<00:05:33.060> but<00:05:33.599> that's<00:05:33.779> my<00:05:33.900> theory<00:05:34.169> let's

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
don't know but that's my theory let's

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.519 
don't know but that's my theory let's
recap<00:05:35.430> here's<00:05:35.879> the<00:05:36.060> Box<00:05:36.240> okay<00:05:36.539> he<00:05:37.020> goes<00:05:37.229> into

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 
recap here's the Box okay he goes into

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.529 
recap here's the Box okay he goes into
the<00:05:37.620> room<00:05:37.800> takes<00:05:38.159> a<00:05:38.310> box<00:05:38.550> just<00:05:39.029> jump<00:05:39.240> scares

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
the room takes a box just jump scares

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.360 
the room takes a box just jump scares
you<00:05:39.659> whatever<00:05:39.960> he<00:05:40.110> leaves<00:05:40.379> and<00:05:40.710> what<00:05:41.159> you<00:05:41.250> have

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
you whatever he leaves and what you have

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.550 
you whatever he leaves and what you have
to<00:05:41.460> do<00:05:41.610> is<00:05:41.789> with<00:05:41.969> this<00:05:42.270> menu<00:05:42.599> is<00:05:42.779> keep<00:05:43.110> him<00:05:43.289> away

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
to do is with this menu is keep him away

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.399 
to do is with this menu is keep him away
with<00:05:43.770> whatever<00:05:44.009> these<00:05:44.449> devices<00:05:45.449> are<00:05:46.020> the

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
with whatever these devices are the

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:47.869 
with whatever these devices are the
audio<00:05:46.710> devices<00:05:46.979> chemist<00:05:47.490> system<00:05:47.759> in

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
audio devices chemist system in

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.189 
audio devices chemist system in
ventilation<00:05:48.330> you<00:05:48.539> have<00:05:48.629> to<00:05:48.690> try<00:05:48.810> to<00:05:48.870> keep<00:05:49.050> them

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
ventilation you have to try to keep them

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.290 
ventilation you have to try to keep them
away<00:05:49.409> with<00:05:49.620> those<00:05:49.860> I<00:05:50.250> really<00:05:51.000> have<00:05:51.120> no<00:05:51.270> idea

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
away with those I really have no idea

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.779 
away with those I really have no idea
but<00:05:51.750> that<00:05:52.020> that<00:05:52.500> is<00:05:52.710> just<00:05:52.979> my<00:05:53.129> theory<00:05:53.400> okay

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
but that that is just my theory okay

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.149 
but that that is just my theory okay
don't<00:05:54.689> go<00:05:54.930> screaming<00:05:55.560> at<00:05:55.710> me<00:05:55.830> if<00:05:55.949> you<00:05:55.979> think

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
don't go screaming at me if you think

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.890 
don't go screaming at me if you think
I'm<00:05:56.370> wrong<00:05:56.580> if<00:05:56.879> you<00:05:56.909> think<00:05:57.000> I'm<00:05:57.330> wrong<00:05:57.539> just

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
I'm wrong if you think I'm wrong just

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.050 
I'm wrong if you think I'm wrong just
tell<00:05:58.199> me<00:05:58.349> why<00:05:58.589> you<00:05:58.650> think<00:05:59.039> I'm<00:05:59.279> wrong<00:05:59.490> and<00:05:59.550> give

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
tell me why you think I'm wrong and give

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.390 
tell me why you think I'm wrong and give
me<00:06:00.210> your<00:06:00.479> theory<00:06:00.870> give<00:06:01.020> me<00:06:01.110> your<00:06:01.349> side<00:06:01.650> this<00:06:02.219> is

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
me your theory give me your side this is

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.519 
me your theory give me your side this is
just<00:06:02.639> a<00:06:02.819> theory<00:06:03.210> but<00:06:03.389> i<00:06:03.839> think<00:06:03.900> this<00:06:04.259> one<00:06:04.319> is

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:04.529 
just a theory but i think this one is

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:07.640 
just a theory but i think this one is
pretty<00:06:05.039> damn<00:06:06.029> good<00:06:06.479> i<00:06:06.539> think<00:06:06.960> this<00:06:07.169> one<00:06:07.229> could

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
pretty damn good i think this one could

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.360 
pretty damn good i think this one could
very<00:06:08.430> possibly<00:06:09.020> be<00:06:10.020> in<00:06:10.379> the<00:06:10.650> actual<00:06:11.099> game<00:06:11.129> I

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
very possibly be in the actual game I

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.600 
very possibly be in the actual game I
think<00:06:11.819> this<00:06:12.029> is<00:06:12.089> what<00:06:12.419> Scott<00:06:12.750> is<00:06:12.930> doing<00:06:13.620> but

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
think this is what Scott is doing but

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.850 
think this is what Scott is doing but
nobody<00:06:15.449> really<00:06:15.719> knows<00:06:15.900> exactly<00:06:16.169> what<00:06:16.560> Scott

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
nobody really knows exactly what Scott

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.589 
nobody really knows exactly what Scott
is<00:06:16.889> up<00:06:17.159> to<00:06:17.310> he's<00:06:17.550> always<00:06:17.879> been<00:06:18.089> a<00:06:18.389> little

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
is up to he's always been a little

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.360 
is up to he's always been a little
trickster<00:06:19.080> he<00:06:19.289> just<00:06:19.469> pulls<00:06:20.159> out<00:06:20.339> of

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
trickster he just pulls out of

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.909 
trickster he just pulls out of
nowhere<00:06:20.699> and<00:06:21.089> yeah<00:06:21.870> that's<00:06:22.319> why<00:06:22.439> I<00:06:22.500> like<00:06:22.529> Scott

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
nowhere and yeah that's why I like Scott

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.589 
nowhere and yeah that's why I like Scott
he's<00:06:23.129> very<00:06:23.370> unpredictable<00:06:23.520> but<00:06:24.210> this<00:06:24.330> is<00:06:24.449> my

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
he's very unpredictable but this is my

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.019 
he's very unpredictable but this is my
theory<00:06:24.900> so<00:06:25.620> anyway<00:06:25.889> what's<00:06:26.550> your<00:06:26.729> theory

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:27.029 
theory so anyway what's your theory

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:28.850 
theory so anyway what's your theory
leave<00:06:27.330> it<00:06:27.449> in<00:06:27.539> the<00:06:27.629> comments<00:06:27.990> down<00:06:28.080> below<00:06:28.199> do
