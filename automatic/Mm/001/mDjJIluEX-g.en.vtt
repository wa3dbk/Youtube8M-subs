when cleaning the slide assembly it's

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.750 
when cleaning the slide assembly it's
very<00:03:12.870> important<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.829> make<00:03:14.010> sure<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.549> do

not bend either the slide or the blank
and<00:03:17.970> this<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.480> reason<00:03:18.870> why<00:03:19.049> Gabby<00:03:19.530> was

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
and this is the reason why Gabby was

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.729 
and this is the reason why Gabby was
cleaning<00:03:20.159> them<00:03:20.750> against<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.930> table<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.650> avoid

the next step is to clean the groove at

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.290 
the next step is to clean the groove at
the<00:04:52.229> front<00:04:52.650> edge<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:53.460> reedplate<00:04:53.700> which

cleaning fluid

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.050 
cleaning fluid
it's<00:05:00.180> only<00:05:00.720> necessary<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.860> remove<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.580> clean

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
it's only necessary to remove and clean

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.150 
it's only necessary to remove and clean
the<00:05:03.330> reed<00:05:03.539> plates<00:05:03.900> if<00:05:04.229> there<00:05:04.500> really<00:05:04.650> is<00:05:04.860> some
