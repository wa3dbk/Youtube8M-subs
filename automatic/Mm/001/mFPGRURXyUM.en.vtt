00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
with that I guess so let's go ahead and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.529 
with that I guess so let's go ahead and
hash<00:02:10.080> this

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
hash this

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.720 
hash this

calculator we breathing on DX with the

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.000 
calculator we breathing on DX with the
greenness<00:02:28.510> or<00:02:28.689> yes<00:02:29.349> we<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.650> chance<00:02:29.859> of

greenness or yes we have a chance of
getting<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.220> rabbit<00:02:30.489> axe<00:02:30.609> yes<00:02:31.060> we<00:02:31.209> would

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
getting the rabbit axe yes we would

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.330 
getting the rabbit axe yes we would
chance<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.629> getting<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.840> right<00:02:31.989> X<00:02:32.230> but<00:02:32.829> it's<00:02:33.069> a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
chance of getting the right X but it's a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.250 
chance of getting the right X but it's a
more<00:02:34.209> likely<00:02:34.540> chance<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:34.930> we'll<00:02:35.049> get<00:02:35.140> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
more likely chance that we'll get the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.020 
more likely chance that we'll get the
Rhine<00:02:35.500> X<00:02:35.739> then<00:02:36.040> get<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.340> rabbit<00:02:36.670> axe<00:02:36.819> look<00:02:36.939> at

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
Rhine X then get the rabbit axe look at

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.210 
Rhine X then get the rabbit axe look at
the<00:02:37.120> odds<00:02:37.269> for<00:02:37.569> this<00:02:37.720> thing<00:02:37.930> anyway<00:02:38.319> and<00:02:38.650> try

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
the odds for this thing anyway and try

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.809 
the odds for this thing anyway and try
elk<00:02:39.579> with<00:02:39.849> my<00:02:40.000> Tesla<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:41.159> see<00:02:42.159> what<00:02:42.310> we<00:02:42.400> get

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
elk with my Tesla and see what we get

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.300 
elk with my Tesla and see what we get
oh<00:02:42.849> that's<00:02:43.540> definitely<00:02:44.139> not<00:02:44.409> going<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.769> be<00:02:44.889> the

oh that's definitely not going to be the
rabbit<00:02:45.430> X<00:02:45.700> we<00:02:46.510> should<00:02:46.689> start<00:02:46.870> breeding<00:02:47.139> for
