00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
quickly so we can rub them down with a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.380 
quickly so we can rub them down with a
little<00:00:42.719> bit<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:43.020> olive<00:00:43.230> oil<00:00:44.059> regular<00:00:45.059> olive

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
little bit of olive oil regular olive

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.819 
little bit of olive oil regular olive
oil<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.750> now<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.620> do

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
oil and now what this is going to do

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.850 
oil and now what this is going to do
since<00:00:47.100> our<00:00:47.280> meat<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.640> dry<00:00:48.200> the<00:00:49.200> olive<00:00:49.620> was

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
since our meat is dry the olive was

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.990 
since our meat is dry the olive was
gonna<00:00:50.160> create<00:00:50.460> some<00:00:50.750> lubrication<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
gonna create some lubrication on the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.029 
gonna create some lubrication on the
grill<00:00:54.000> grates<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.780> when<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> heat<00:00:55.289> goes<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.890> it

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
grill grates so when the heat goes on it

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.560 
grill grates so when the heat goes on it
it's<00:00:56.340> gonna<00:00:56.520> bubble<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.270> that's<00:00:57.420> gonna

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it's gonna bubble up and that's gonna

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.529 
it's gonna bubble up and that's gonna
give<00:00:57.780> us<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.020> nice<00:00:58.199> dark<00:00:59.129> brown<00:00:59.370> sear<00:01:00.270> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
diagonally across the grates and we're

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.749 
diagonally across the grates and we're
clicking<00:01:16.290> indoors<00:01:16.920> we're<00:01:17.100> doing<00:01:17.280> an<00:01:17.369> indoor

clicking indoors we're doing an indoor
grill<00:01:17.939> today<00:01:18.470> specifically<00:01:19.470> because<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:20.009> have

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
grill today specifically because we have

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.670 
grill today specifically because we have
thinner<00:01:20.520> grill<00:01:20.970> grates<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.500> that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
thinner grill grates and I like that

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.249 
thinner grill grates and I like that
more<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:24.689> easier<00:01:25.140> to

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
more because it's it's just easier to

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.100 
more because it's it's just easier to
get<00:01:25.439> some<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:25.830> nice<00:01:26.659> been<00:01:27.659> cooking<00:01:27.960> our
