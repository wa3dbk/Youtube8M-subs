hasn't<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.610> caught<00:00:44.969> any<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.480> anymore

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
hasn't really caught any of that anymore

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.770 
hasn't really caught any of that anymore
because<00:00:47.309> they<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.910> set<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.690> the

because they do have to set up for the
619<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.710> they<00:00:50.010> don't<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
619 so you they don't have to be in the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
619 so you they don't have to be in the
second<00:00:51.270> world<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:51.960> them<00:00:52.110> clock<00:00:52.770> is

second world you can have them clock is

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.229 
second world you can have them clock is
standing<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.520> you'd<00:00:53.640> perform<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.090> Hulk

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
standing and you'd perform the Hulk
