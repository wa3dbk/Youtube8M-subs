a<00:00:04.819> lot<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.940> people<00:00:06.180> have<00:00:06.299> commented<00:00:06.839> on<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
a lot of people have commented on the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.440 
a lot of people have commented on the
sandpaper<00:00:07.589> cut<00:00:08.189> our<00:00:08.309> video<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.670> we<00:00:08.940> did<00:00:09.179> and

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
sandpaper cut our video that we did and

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.690 
sandpaper cut our video that we did and
one<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.200> comments<00:00:10.650> was<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.460> didn't

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
one of the comments was is you didn't

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.280 
one of the comments was is you didn't
give<00:00:11.849> any<00:00:12.000> dimensions<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.809> didn't<00:00:13.019> tell<00:00:13.170> us

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
give any dimensions you didn't tell us

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.740 
give any dimensions you didn't tell us
how<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.469> build<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.040> well<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.210> reason<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.540> didn't

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
how to build it well the reason I didn't

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.939 
how to build it well the reason I didn't
do<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.109> because<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.379> never<00:00:16.440> sit<00:00:16.800> down

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
do that is because I never sit down

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.790 
do that is because I never sit down
really<00:00:17.220> measured<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.670> out<00:00:17.880> until<00:00:18.720> now<00:00:19.140> so

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
really measured this out until now so

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.109 
really measured this out until now so
I'm<00:00:19.920> going<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.160> show<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.400> how<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.699> make<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
I'm going to show you how to make the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.099 
I'm going to show you how to make the
sandpaper<00:00:21.390> cutter

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
sandpaper cutter

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.109 
sandpaper cutter
the<00:00:22.740> first<00:00:23.010> thing<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.310> want<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.760> start<00:00:23.970> off

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the first thing you want to start off

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.179 
the first thing you want to start off
with<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.840> nice<00:00:25.050> thin<00:00:25.619> board<00:00:25.949> that's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
with is just a nice thin board that's

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.640 
with is just a nice thin board that's
about<00:00:26.430> eighth<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.820> an<00:00:26.910> inch<00:00:27.029> thick<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.650> this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
about eighth of an inch thick and this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.620 
about eighth of an inch thick and this
is<00:00:28.830> actually<00:00:29.160> wainscoting<00:00:29.609> something<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.510> had

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
is actually wainscoting something I had

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.849 
is actually wainscoting something I had
laying<00:00:30.810> around<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.109> house<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.560> want<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
laying around the house but you want a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.510 
laying around the house but you want a
nice<00:00:32.009> solid<00:00:32.279> board<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:34.219> 11<00:00:35.219> inches

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
nice solid board and this is 11 inches

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.930 
nice solid board and this is 11 inches
long<00:00:36.149> by<00:00:36.899> seven<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.620> half<00:00:37.649> inches<00:00:38.100> deep<00:00:38.160> now

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
long by seven and a half inches deep now

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.209 
long by seven and a half inches deep now
the<00:00:39.719> measurement<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.410> important<00:00:41.100> because

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the measurement is important because

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.310 
the measurement is important because
it's<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.760> help<00:00:41.910> us<00:00:42.059> build<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.750> but

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
it's going to help us build this but

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.170 
it's going to help us build this but
another<00:00:43.530> measurement<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.280> important<00:00:44.969> is

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
another measurement that is important is

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.240 
another measurement that is important is
you<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> consider<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.410> most<00:00:46.710> sandpaper

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
you have to consider that most sandpaper

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.680 
you have to consider that most sandpaper
comes<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.940> 11<00:00:48.450> by<00:00:49.129> 9<00:00:50.129> inch<00:00:50.489> sheets<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.270> so

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
comes in 11 by 9 inch sheets and so

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.389 
comes in 11 by 9 inch sheets and so
these<00:00:51.899> dimensions<00:00:52.530> work<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.070> size

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
these dimensions work with that size

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
these dimensions work with that size
paper<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.449> somehow<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> different

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
paper if you somehow get a different

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.840 
paper if you somehow get a different
size<00:00:55.469> paper<00:00:55.770> than<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.219> you're<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:56.789> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
size paper than that you're going to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.790 
size paper than that you're going to
have<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.180> adjust<00:00:57.270> all<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.140> measurements<00:00:58.680> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
have to adjust all the measurements and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.069 
have to adjust all the measurements and
dimensions<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.399> your<00:00:59.550> sandpaper<00:01:00.030> cutter<00:01:00.359> so

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
dimensions on your sandpaper cutter so

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.680 
dimensions on your sandpaper cutter so
we<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.129> board<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.820> first<00:01:03.059> thing<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.480> want

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
we get this board the first thing I want

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.649 
we get this board the first thing I want
to<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.739> want<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> pencil<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.700> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
to do is I want to get a pencil and I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.700 
to do is I want to get a pencil and I
want<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.110> draw<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.770> line<00:01:08.479> that<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.600> 1/2<00:01:10.409> inch

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
want to draw a line that is 1/2 inch

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.280 
want to draw a line that is 1/2 inch
from<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.760> edge<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.320> is<00:01:13.320> mark<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.400> so

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
from the edge so is mark this like so

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.840 
from the edge so is mark this like so
there's<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.380> half<00:01:17.630> cup<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.430> make<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.460> half

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
there's a half cup here and make it half

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.179 
there's a half cup here and make it half
and<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.180> broke<00:01:21.450> my<00:01:21.479> lid<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:22.110> why<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.409> 700

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
and I broke my lid that's why I have 700

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.719 
and I broke my lid that's why I have 700
pencils<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:24.979> turn<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.159> around<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
pencils in here turn this around and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.969 
pencils in here turn this around and
this<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> reference<00:01:28.110> line<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:28.650> making

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
this is a reference line that I'm making

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.640 
this is a reference line that I'm making
because<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.759> want<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:29.970> make<00:01:30.150> sure<00:01:30.409> that<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
because I want to make sure that the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.819 
because I want to make sure that the
cutting<00:01:32.070> part<00:01:32.360> of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.720> board<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.320> perfectly

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
cutting part of the board is perfectly

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.640 
cutting part of the board is perfectly
parallel<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.720> cutting<00:01:37.049> part<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.560> the

parallel and the cutting part of the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.539 
parallel and the cutting part of the
board<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.790> simple<00:01:39.299> hacksaw<00:01:40.049> blade<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
board is a simple hacksaw blade but it

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.740 
board is a simple hacksaw blade but it
has<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> couple<00:01:42.060> things<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.509> are<00:01:42.630> very

specific<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.189> ten<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.820> half<00:01:45.000> inch

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
specific this is a ten and a half inch

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.190 
specific this is a ten and a half inch
long<00:01:45.659> hacksaw<00:01:46.320> blade<00:01:46.649> with<00:01:47.369> eight<00:01:47.960> TPI

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
long hacksaw blade with eight TPI

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
long hacksaw blade with eight TPI
that's<00:01:49.590> teeth<00:01:50.399> per<00:01:50.790> inch<00:01:51.259> you<00:01:52.259> can<00:01:52.290> get<00:01:52.680> finer

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
that's teeth per inch you can get finer

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.340 
that's teeth per inch you can get finer
ones<00:01:53.520> or<00:01:53.759> coarser<00:01:54.299> ones<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> found<00:01:55.140> out

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
ones or coarser ones but I found out

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.649 
ones or coarser ones but I found out
that<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> 18<00:01:56.250> works<00:01:56.670> best<00:01:56.969> for<00:01:57.090> cutting<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
that the 18 works best for cutting the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.810 
that the 18 works best for cutting the
paper<00:01:57.840> cleanly<00:01:58.409> but<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.189> also<00:01:59.280> cuts<00:01:59.670> it

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
paper cleanly but it also cuts it

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.149 
paper cleanly but it also cuts it
officially<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.259> we're<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.740> take<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
officially so we're going to take the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.660 
officially so we're going to take the
blade<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.670> lay<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.719> down<00:02:03.750> right<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.340> line

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
blade and lay it down right on that line

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.510 
blade and lay it down right on that line
I<00:02:06.030> made<00:02:06.409> okay<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.649> I've<00:02:07.770> centered<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
I made okay and I've centered it on the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.630 
I made okay and I've centered it on the
board<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.200> will<00:02:10.200> go<00:02:10.319> back<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.979> pencil<00:02:11.520> that

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
board I will go back to a pencil that

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.670 
board I will go back to a pencil that
has<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> lead<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.450> we

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
has a lead in it that we

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.839 
has a lead in it that we
and<00:02:12.890> I'm<00:02:13.340> going<00:02:13.609> to<00:02:13.670> mark<00:02:13.909> over<00:02:14.329> here<00:02:15.849> that

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
and I'm going to mark over here that

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.970 
and I'm going to mark over here that
hole<00:02:17.239> so<00:02:18.019> I<00:02:18.049> know<00:02:18.200> where<00:02:18.349> that<00:02:18.469> hole<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.709> I'm

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
hole so I know where that hole is I'm

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.599 
hole so I know where that hole is I'm
going<00:02:19.099> to<00:02:19.159> go<00:02:19.219> back<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.609> other<00:02:19.760> side<00:02:20.030> and

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
going to go back to the other side and

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.280 
going to go back to the other side and
mark<00:02:22.609> that<00:02:22.939> hole<00:02:23.269> there<00:02:23.540> now<00:02:24.019> I'm<00:02:24.079> going<00:02:24.230> to

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
mark that hole there now I'm going to

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.380 
mark that hole there now I'm going to
take<00:02:24.409> this<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.859> drill<00:02:25.159> press<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.640> drill

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
take this to the drill press and drill

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.539 
take this to the drill press and drill
out<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.569> hole<00:02:26.689> that's<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.680> diameter<00:02:28.159> of<00:02:28.310> that

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
out a hole that's the diameter of that

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:40.900 
out a hole that's the diameter of that
hole

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.540 

okay<00:02:41.750> we<00:02:41.900> have<00:02:42.020> our<00:02:42.140> holes<00:02:42.380> drilled<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:43.070> I

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
okay we have our holes drilled and I

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.640 
okay we have our holes drilled and I
found<00:02:43.850> out<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.270> this<00:02:44.540> specific<00:02:45.110> paper<00:02:45.320> cutter

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
found out for this specific paper cutter

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.820 
found out for this specific paper cutter
I<00:02:45.860> needed<00:02:46.490> a<00:02:46.670> number<00:02:47.090> five<00:02:47.630> machine<00:02:48.440> screw

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
I needed a number five machine screw

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.530 
I needed a number five machine screw
because<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.640> fits<00:02:49.820> through<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.150> hole<00:02:50.270> in<00:02:50.480> the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
because it fits through the hole in the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.320 
because it fits through the hole in the
hacksaw<00:02:50.900> blade<00:02:51.190> in<00:02:52.190> addition<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:52.910> have

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
hacksaw blade in addition to that I have

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.900 
hacksaw blade in addition to that I have
a<00:02:53.360> little<00:02:53.600> tiny<00:02:53.900> lock<00:02:54.290> washer<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.640> neat

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
a little tiny lock washer and the neat

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.250 
a little tiny lock washer and the neat
thing<00:02:56.090> about<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.360> lock<00:02:56.540> washers<00:02:56.960> is<00:02:57.140> they

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
thing about the lock washers is they

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.930 
thing about the lock washers is they
hold<00:02:57.440> things<00:02:57.740> down<00:02:57.920> tight<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.550> won't<00:02:58.580> come

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
hold things down tight and it won't come

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.330 
hold things down tight and it won't come
loose<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.510> that's<00:03:00.170> where<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.530> bolt<00:03:00.770> go<00:03:01.130> or<00:03:01.310> a

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
loose and that's where the bolt go or a

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.400 
loose and that's where the bolt go or a
nut<00:03:01.520> goes<00:03:01.670> right<00:03:01.910> on<00:03:02.030> top<00:03:02.180> of<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.480> now<00:03:03.080> here's

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
nut goes right on top of that now here's

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.830 
nut goes right on top of that now here's
the<00:03:03.620> very<00:03:03.860> specific<00:03:04.550> thing<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:05.570> you<00:03:05.660> need<00:03:05.810> to

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
the very specific thing that you need to

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.440 
the very specific thing that you need to
know<00:03:06.020> this<00:03:06.380> is<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.590> quarter<00:03:07.240> washer<00:03:08.240> it's

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
know this is a quarter washer it's

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.180 
know this is a quarter washer it's
called<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.990> quarter<00:03:09.410> washer<00:03:09.740> it's<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.980> little

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
called a quarter washer it's a little

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.650 
called a quarter washer it's a little
more<00:03:10.310> than<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.430> half<00:03:10.550> inch<00:03:10.760> wide<00:03:10.850> but<00:03:11.540> the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
more than a half inch wide but the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.930 
more than a half inch wide but the
important<00:03:12.440> thing<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.620> it's<00:03:12.920> one<00:03:13.130> sixteenth<00:03:13.790> of

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
important thing is it's one sixteenth of

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.810 
important thing is it's one sixteenth of
an<00:03:14.060> inch<00:03:14.180> deep<00:03:14.690> or<00:03:14.960> thick<00:03:15.230> if<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:16.370> get<00:03:16.580> any

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
an inch deep or thick if you get any

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.030 
an inch deep or thick if you get any
thinner<00:03:17.300> a<00:03:17.600> smaller<00:03:18.080> washer<00:03:18.350> will<00:03:18.650> be<00:03:18.770> thinner

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
thinner a smaller washer will be thinner

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.800 
thinner a smaller washer will be thinner
a<00:03:19.250> bigger<00:03:19.550> washer<00:03:19.970> will<00:03:20.120> be<00:03:20.210> thicker<00:03:20.510> it

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
a bigger washer will be thicker it

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.290 
a bigger washer will be thicker it
affects<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.740> cut<00:03:21.980> when<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.370> pull<00:03:22.700> because<00:03:23.090> if

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
affects the cut when you pull because if

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.670 
affects the cut when you pull because if
it's<00:03:23.450> really<00:03:23.510> thin<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.080> can<00:03:24.200> only<00:03:24.290> get<00:03:24.500> one

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
it's really thin you can only get one

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.350 
it's really thin you can only get one
sheet<00:03:25.010> of<00:03:25.040> paper<00:03:25.130> under<00:03:25.640> there<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:26.120> want<00:03:26.300> to

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
sheet of paper under there you want to

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.210 
sheet of paper under there you want to
do<00:03:26.420> two<00:03:26.690> or<00:03:26.720> three<00:03:26.870> at<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.170> time<00:03:27.200> but<00:03:28.010> if<00:03:28.100> it's

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
do two or three at a time but if it's

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.980 
do two or three at a time but if it's
any<00:03:28.490> thicker<00:03:28.850> you're<00:03:29.390> going<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.570> have<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:29.870> much

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
any thicker you're going to have so much

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.840 
any thicker you're going to have so much
of<00:03:30.050> a<00:03:30.200> gap<00:03:30.410> in<00:03:30.590> there<00:03:30.710> it<00:03:30.800> won't<00:03:30.950> rip<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.610> cut

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
of a gap in there it won't rip and cut

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.970 
of a gap in there it won't rip and cut
cleanly<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:32.900> that's<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.290> one<00:03:33.440> specific<00:03:33.950> thing

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
cleanly so that's the one specific thing

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.890 
cleanly so that's the one specific thing
and<00:03:34.340> don't<00:03:34.700> worry<00:03:34.850> about<00:03:35.030> remembering<00:03:35.570> any<00:03:35.750> of

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
and don't worry about remembering any of

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.960 
and don't worry about remembering any of
this<00:03:35.960> stuff<00:03:36.260> because<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:37.400> video<00:03:37.670> description

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
this stuff because the video description

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.910 
this stuff because the video description
will<00:03:38.330> have<00:03:38.480> all<00:03:38.720> these<00:03:38.990> details<00:03:39.200> written<00:03:39.770> down

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
will have all these details written down

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.350 
will have all these details written down
so<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.310> don't<00:03:40.460> have<00:03:40.550> to<00:03:40.700> write<00:03:40.910> down<00:03:40.940> what<00:03:41.270> I'm

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
so you don't have to write down what I'm

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.450 
so you don't have to write down what I'm
saying<00:03:41.630> right<00:03:41.720> now<00:03:41.960> so<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:42.710> put<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.130> screw

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
saying right now so you put the screw

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.790 
saying right now so you put the screw
through<00:03:43.490> the<00:03:43.930> machine<00:03:44.930> bolt<00:03:45.380> through<00:03:45.650> and

be your number two mark and I'll show

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.379 
be your number two mark and I'll show
you<00:05:32.539> how<00:05:32.840> that<00:05:32.900> works<00:05:33.319> and<00:05:33.940> I<00:05:34.940> hope<00:05:35.210> you

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
you how that works and I hope you

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.820 
you how that works and I hope you
appreciate<00:05:35.449> me<00:05:35.960> doing<00:05:36.199> this<00:05:36.289> because<00:05:36.530> this

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
appreciate me doing this because this

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.010 
appreciate me doing this because this
involves<00:05:37.340> math<00:05:37.610> and<00:05:37.940> I'm<00:05:38.030> just<00:05:38.330> not<00:05:38.539> that<00:05:38.720> good

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
involves math and I'm just not that good

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.249 
involves math and I'm just not that good
at<00:05:39.289> it<00:05:40.090> you<00:05:41.090> take<00:05:41.300> your<00:05:41.479> paper<00:05:41.630> and<00:05:42.020> it's

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
at it you take your paper and it's

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:43.629 
at it you take your paper and it's
always<00:05:42.500> best<00:05:42.770> if<00:05:42.919> you<00:05:43.039> put<00:05:43.250> it<00:05:43.340> facedown

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
always best if you put it facedown

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.670 
always best if you put it facedown
because<00:05:44.539> if<00:05:44.810> you<00:05:44.900> have<00:05:44.990> the<00:05:45.080> grid<00:05:45.289> up<00:05:45.440> it'll

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
because if you have the grid up it'll

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.499 
because if you have the grid up it'll
wear<00:05:45.830> out<00:05:45.949> your<00:05:46.130> hacksaw<00:05:47.000> blades<00:05:47.240> just

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
wear out your hacksaw blades just

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.110 
wear out your hacksaw blades just
quicker<00:05:47.780> so<00:05:48.680> I'm<00:05:48.919> going<00:05:49.069> to<00:05:49.130> line<00:05:49.639> this<00:05:49.789> up<00:05:49.970> on

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
quicker so I'm going to line this up on

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.469 
quicker so I'm going to line this up on
the<00:05:50.240> one<00:05:50.449> correct<00:05:51.110> okay<00:05:51.680> now<00:05:52.280> put<00:05:52.909> my<00:05:53.030> fingers

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
the one correct okay now put my fingers

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.339 
the one correct okay now put my fingers
on<00:05:53.659> the<00:05:54.020> blade<00:05:54.259> press<00:05:54.740> it<00:05:54.919> down<00:05:55.039> and<00:05:55.220> pinch<00:05:55.550> and

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
on the blade press it down and pinch and

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.279 
on the blade press it down and pinch and
tear<00:05:57.380> if<00:05:57.590> you<00:05:58.130> don't<00:05:58.310> pinch<00:05:58.639> it<00:05:58.849> tears<00:05:59.150> a<00:05:59.659> rough

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
tear if you don't pinch it tears a rough

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.860 
tear if you don't pinch it tears a rough
edge<00:06:00.530> it<00:06:00.800> won't<00:06:01.729> be<00:06:01.820> as<00:06:01.940> good<00:06:01.969> you<00:06:02.210> want<00:06:02.389> now<00:06:02.780> to

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
edge it won't be as good you want now to

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.110 
edge it won't be as good you want now to

like this I'm glad I remember how to do
this<00:06:09.820> that's<00:06:10.820> why<00:06:11.000> I<00:06:11.030> have<00:06:11.150> numbers<00:06:11.509> on<00:06:11.630> here

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
this that's why I have numbers on here

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.080 
this that's why I have numbers on here
okay<00:06:12.259> so<00:06:12.440> now<00:06:12.770> we're<00:06:12.979> dividing<00:06:13.219> this<00:06:13.580> half<00:06:13.820> in

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
okay so now we're dividing this half in

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
okay so now we're dividing this half in
half<00:06:14.389> again<00:06:16.000> and<00:06:17.000> I'm<00:06:17.180> doing<00:06:17.449> two<00:06:17.599> sheets<00:06:17.930> of

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
half again and I'm doing two sheets of

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.870 
half again and I'm doing two sheets of
400<00:06:18.560> grit<00:06:18.740> right<00:06:18.949> now<00:06:19.130> but<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:19.430> neat<00:06:19.610> thing<00:06:19.639> is

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
400 grit right now but the neat thing is

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.089 
400 grit right now but the neat thing is
I'm<00:06:20.780> going<00:06:20.930> to<00:06:20.990> take<00:06:21.139> this<00:06:21.380> see<00:06:21.949> they're

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
I'm going to take this see they're

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.089 
I'm going to take this see they're
perfectly<00:06:22.870> matching<00:06:23.870> it<00:06:24.620> doesn't<00:06:24.889> have<00:06:24.979> to<00:06:25.039> be

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
perfectly matching it doesn't have to be

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:26.589 
perfectly matching it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:06:25.460> either<00:06:25.550> who<00:06:25.789> cares<00:06:26.090> of<00:06:26.270> your<00:06:26.389> sheets

going to use them for sanding put it on

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.279 
going to use them for sanding put it on
number<00:06:30.830> three<00:06:31.159> right<00:06:31.400> here<00:06:31.759> and<00:06:32.169> then<00:06:33.169> I'm

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
number three right here and then I'm

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:35.020 
number three right here and then I'm
going<00:06:33.409> to<00:06:33.440> push<00:06:33.650> down<00:06:33.680> again<00:06:34.159> you<00:06:34.669> can<00:06:34.819> see<00:06:34.969> how

going to push down again you can see how

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.520 
going to push down again you can see how
easily<00:06:35.270> that<00:06:35.630> cut<00:06:35.960> four<00:06:36.860> sheets<00:06:37.490> of<00:06:37.669> paper

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
easily that cut four sheets of paper

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.589 
easily that cut four sheets of paper
this<00:06:39.530> involved<00:06:40.099> a<00:06:40.190> lot<00:06:40.550> of<00:06:40.759> math<00:06:40.940> but<00:06:41.360> now<00:06:41.539> you
