amp speed control and to get to that I
put<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:43.320> sales<00:01:46.070> 3,300<00:01:47.070> amps<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.150> have

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
put in to sales 3,300 amps so I have

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.290 
put in to sales 3,300 amps so I have
them<00:01:48.510> in<00:01:48.720> parallel<00:01:49.020> today<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.310> amp<00:01:50.520> load<00:01:50.940> is

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
I run it the speed control gets a little

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.490 
I run it the speed control gets a little
bit<00:02:00.420> hotter<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> motor

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
bit hotter and the motor

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.820

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
hardware kit is all working together so

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.660 
hardware kit is all working together so
great<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.370> built<00:02:11.790> there<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:13.670> whole

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
simple production and also it's also

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.460 
simple production and also it's also
possible<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.569> buy<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:21.840> as<00:02:22.349> a<00:02:22.590> ready<00:02:23.580> made<00:02:24.470> kit

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
possible to buy this as a ready made kit

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.600 
possible to buy this as a ready made kit
to<00:02:26.310> make<00:02:26.489> it<00:02:26.760> more<00:02:27.290> ready<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.590> run<00:02:28.800> more<00:02:29.430> or

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
to make it more ready to run more or

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.010 
to make it more ready to run more or
less<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:32.040> part<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:33.030> controlled<00:02:33.750> with<00:02:33.990> a
