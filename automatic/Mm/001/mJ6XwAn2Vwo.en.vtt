00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.530 

see<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.420> looks<00:02:18.660> like<00:02:18.810> an<00:02:18.990> M<00:02:19.200> not<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> bird<00:02:20.540> but

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
see this looks like an M not a bird but

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.090 
see this looks like an M not a bird but
you've<00:02:21.720> learned<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.410> is<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> symbol

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
you've learned that that is the symbol

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.010 
you've learned that that is the symbol
for<00:02:23.340> what<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.700> bird<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.210> supposed<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.630> look<00:02:24.810> like

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
for what a bird is supposed to look like

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.050 
for what a bird is supposed to look like
since<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.410> kind<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.710> resembles<00:02:26.370> birds<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.970> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
since it kind of resembles birds in the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.900 
since it kind of resembles birds in the
distance<00:02:27.480> same<00:02:28.410> thing<00:02:28.590> with<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.860> Sun<00:02:29.070> that's

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
distance same thing with the Sun that's

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.580 
distance same thing with the Sun that's
a<00:02:30.090> symbol<00:02:30.480> for<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.750> Sun<00:02:30.960> even<00:02:31.290> though<00:02:31.380> we<00:02:31.560> both

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
a symbol for the Sun even though we both

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.670 
a symbol for the Sun even though we both
know<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.910> that's<00:02:33.330> not<00:02:33.540> what<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.230> Sun<00:02:34.440> looks

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
know that that's not what the Sun looks

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.490 
know that that's not what the Sun looks
like<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:36.600> Christmas<00:02:36.960> tree
