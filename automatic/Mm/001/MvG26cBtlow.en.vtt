00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.189
 hello to all this threshold to the max and we get 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.960
 found for a new video 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.150
 commented on gta 5 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.860
 today a little tutorial for you 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.660
 say to show you how to get in 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.849
 in the military base without having any 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.970
 star which will allow you to fly the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.920
 c 130 the bob cargo ship the times that the 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.150
 fighter planes like you want everything 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.830
 what's in the same military base 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.449
 visited the military base me what I have 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.260
 done because this military base she 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.540
 a little chelou 1 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.830
 it looks a bit like area 51 I 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.330
 nothing special but here you are 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.440
 can do what you want and that's 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.930
 not only in the military base 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.670
 it's everywhere on the map where you have 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.170
 stars when you go so 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.000
 also the other airport 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.049
 except that the other airport I do not know 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 if you know it but when you buy 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.739
 the shed a little bit later in the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.540
 game you can enter the airport 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.180
 as you want but there is also 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.290
 otherwise the prison ah bah when you there 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.430
 finally go to jail I think it's 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.960
 rather the human laboratory 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.059
 you have stoles when you go there 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.189
 down normally and there not at all so 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.420
 the glitch in quotes glide I 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.710
 know what actually 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.670
 it's during a game mission so 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.770
 must have a little before noon in 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.330
 the in the game it's the second mission 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.530
 hunting with trevor so the mission 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.840
 it's called pigeon shooting 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.690
 it's going to be very simple instead of following 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.760
 your teammate you'll let go 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.380
 purely and simply a plan you 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.600
 go call the taxi and you go him 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.750
 to say I mean do you bar yourself 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.670
 steer with the taxi where you want after 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.870
 I took the car I left 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.640
 in the military base 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.450
 and you will see no star I can 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.900
 do what I want in the base 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.460
 military I flew the 130j climb 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.690
 I climbed the waste I got but at 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.430
 side of the guards he did not care 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.420
 completely of me I did not steal the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.950
 fighter planes but it's the same 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.500
 thing to you can the shutter like you 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.080
 want to be brief it's really a pretty trick 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.190
 cool nice enough for those who are going 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.880
 say it can not do it because it's true 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.380
 that there c 130 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.580
 it's still pretty hard to 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.260
 take off because we have four 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.210
 stars directly he has quite slow to 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.450
 maneuver and bryce and can be a 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.010
 uncomplicated to have then I specify 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.200
 one thing all the same is that I did not 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.909
 could not keep it and in my guy it's up to 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.739
 say the pane purely and simply and 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.140
 have it in my vehicles 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.849
 because they were not available on 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.799
 then shed at ba if if it 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.810
 comes from the fact that it was during a 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.819
 mission and so we can not purely and 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.170
 simply or if it's because it was 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.590
 a mission that I had to replay the shot 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.569
 I had access to my properties down 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.189
 etc. 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.959
 that it is a mission that I play again and 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.549
 and that as soon as I finished the mission 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.290
 end as soon as I finish the mission as soon as 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.230
 I finished the mission roughly 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.120
 was coming back where I was currently 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.340
 I do not if you understand my basically about 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.689
 gta 5 there is the possibility of replay 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.340
 missions and once we finish the 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.780
 mission we go back to where we are and 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.139
 I hope you understand a little bit 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.489
 the delirium 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.379
 so I do not know if it's because of that 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.790
 or so if we can just everything 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.260
 just not he was parking in our 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.109
 commitment anyway we can bel and 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.030
 well the shutters and fly with and as much 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.219
 of time we want so for those who 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.810
 want to do a little trick 930 there you 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.939
 will do it for sure and without any 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.450
 problem here I hope this video you 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.579
 will have pleased 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.079
 I find you very very very 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.260
 quickly for a new video bye 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.260
 bye
