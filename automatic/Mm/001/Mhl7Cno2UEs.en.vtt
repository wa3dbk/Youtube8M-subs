00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
goes back to the 1600s when those guys

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.920 
goes back to the 1600s when those guys
ran<00:00:47.370> away<00:00:47.519> from<00:00:47.670> England<00:00:48.329> because<00:00:48.659> fat

drawers<00:00:49.199> are<00:00:49.409> saying<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.979> have<00:00:50.189> to<00:00:50.220> believe

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
drawers are saying you have to believe

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.299

this<00:00:50.909> no<00:00:51.510> need<00:00:52.049> to<00:00:52.080> call<00:00:52.439> him<00:00:52.680> names<00:00:52.890> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
this no need to call him names I

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.189 
this no need to call him names I
personally<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.360> there<00:00:54.659> should<00:00:54.689> not

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
personally think that there should not

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.229 
personally think that there should not
be<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.500> separation<00:00:56.159> between<00:00:56.369> church<00:00:56.729> and<00:00:57.089> state

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
be a separation between church and state

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.049 
be a separation between church and state

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
I think it's like it's tasty combination

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.490 
I think it's like it's tasty combination
it's<00:01:00.720> like<00:01:00.869> peanut<00:01:01.559> butter<00:01:01.589> and<00:01:02.059> peas<00:01:03.170> yeah<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
would you put together then as an

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.639 
would you put together then as an
analogy<00:01:40.069> maybe<00:01:41.069> a<00:01:41.159> peanut<00:01:41.999> butter<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.210> jelly
