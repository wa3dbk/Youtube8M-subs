00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
moment when we push into the stroke we

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.840 
moment when we push into the stroke we
push<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.380> first<00:02:56.740> on<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.010> knees<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.520> then

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
push it first on the knees and then

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.760 
push it first on the knees and then
slightly<00:02:58.150> onto<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.630> back<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.050> then<00:02:59.500> pull
