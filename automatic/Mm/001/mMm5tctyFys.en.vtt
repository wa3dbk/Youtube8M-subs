you're not familiar with that that is in

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.639 
you're not familiar with that that is in
this<00:01:22.590> case<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> key<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.400> E<00:01:24.259> for<00:01:25.259> measures

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
this case in the key of E for measures

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.030 
this case in the key of E for measures
of<00:01:25.759> what's<00:01:26.759> outlining<00:01:27.180> an<00:01:27.420> E<00:01:27.659> chord<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:28.229> then

of what's outlining an E chord and then

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.550 
of what's outlining an E chord and then
two<00:01:29.310> measures<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> what's<00:01:30.119> outlined<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:31.409> a

two measures of what's outlined in a
cordon<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.759> then<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.149> goes<00:01:33.240> back<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.750> e<00:01:34.460> for

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
cordon and then it goes back to e for

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.930 
cordon and then it goes back to e for
two<00:01:35.580> measures<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:37.080> for<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.549> turnaround

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
two measures and then for the turnaround

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.760 
two measures and then for the turnaround
it<00:01:39.420> outlines<00:01:39.960> an<00:01:40.110> E<00:01:40.350> chord<00:01:40.880> then<00:01:41.880> an<00:01:42.000> A<00:01:42.770> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
it outlines an E chord then an A and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.840 
it outlines an E chord then an A and
then<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.009> goes<00:01:44.130> back<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.460> e<00:01:45.080> for<00:01:46.080> two<00:01:46.259> minutes

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
then it goes back to e for two minutes

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.540 
then it goes back to e for two minutes
and<00:01:47.850> that's<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.179> basic<00:01:48.600> format<00:01:49.050> for<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.830> 12<00:01:50.280> bar

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
and that's the basic format for a 12 bar

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.790 
and that's the basic format for a 12 bar
blues<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.080> you're<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.320> familiar<00:01:52.440> with
