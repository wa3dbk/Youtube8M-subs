more<00:01:40.740> competitive<00:01:41.130> match<00:01:41.640> up<00:01:41.939> then<00:01:42.630> carl

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
more competitive match up then carl

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.980 
more competitive match up then carl
froch<00:01:43.860> vs<00:01:44.340> Chavez<00:01:44.729> Jr<00:01:44.759> Chavez<00:01:45.420> Jr<00:01:45.450> might<00:01:45.869> be
