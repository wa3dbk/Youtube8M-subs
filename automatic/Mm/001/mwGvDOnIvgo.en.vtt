 we need and that above all is very 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.340
 easy let's start 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.460

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.189
 that walks from the south goes for as I told you 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.170
 at the beginning of this video that we are going to 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.480
 do something very very easy that are these 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.129
 decorative villages that as you can see 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.180
 and how could you see the images 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.160
 previous 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.769
 I made four that say ay love new 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 york because I love new york is something 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.820
 what I wanted to do for a long time 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.890
 and that I really did not imagine that it was so 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.600
 easy and above all that it was so for 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.229
 know them I can tell you what it takes 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.489
 this maximum 50 pesos here in mexico 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.739
 so if I can do it if it's so 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.809
 easy clear that you can do it let's go 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.689
 to start you can do it for 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.759
 give them to you to decorate them as 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:07.890
 you want the idea then since 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.960
 see how and are willing to really 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.960
 do it if you liked it let's start 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.320
 ah 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.420
 I will begin by telling you that of course 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.549
 materials will vary since if you 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.619
 different beams will be different but what 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.560
 are the letters that you are going to 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.570
 put and pizza boxes 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.509
 you will need some paper to wrap me 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.520
 I will use black sheets and paper 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.520
 newspaper some glue like silicone 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.100
 cold warm paint or white glue 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.960
 The first thing we are going to do is line 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.240
 the boxes with the paper that you have 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.240
 chosen in my case is periodic 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.690
 to me this house I liked to put some 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.440
 black strips which I did with 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.440
 the black leaves 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.619
 good 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.869
 you are going to line all the boxes that you 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.990
 you are going to use as I told you either 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.910
 some sheet of newspaper or paper 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.090
 that you have chosen to cover your 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.160
 houses remember that here the important thing is 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.770
 that you use your imagination and good since 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.830
 have all the faces ready let's go 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.270
 move on to the next 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.180
 let's decorate the letters that you go 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.000
 to use with your initials or with 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.610
 classes that you see to put in your pictures 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.240
 I'm just going to paint the color ones 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.270
 black 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.760
 but I repeat that your imagination is the 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.170
 limit and I like it that way easier 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.750
 but you can decorate it with what 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.760
 you want for the heart of the blog I 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.370
 I used the red color on pipes 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.470
 I just made them spiral and the countries with 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.470
 hot silicone in the shape of the heart 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.220
 Now what you will have to do and almost 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.330
 the last thing will be to paste the letters with a 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.330
 little white glue 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.099
 now the last thing you have to do 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.159
 is the hole in the back 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:34.650
 to be able to hang what I did marking 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.650
 half and cutting with a knife 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.370
 and they sought to do the same with all your 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.629
 boxes 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.629
 that are now pictures 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.689
 me to make it as successful as possible 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:57.180
 take measurements on my wall pretty much 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:58.980
 like here and I proceeded to hang them 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.250
 and the truth is that it is an idea as 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.250
 I told you 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.560
 ah 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.980
 all 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.590
 and I say this 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.630
 this is all for today's video I hope 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.830
 that you liked it and if it was like that I hope 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.910
 also that you can leave some 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.910
