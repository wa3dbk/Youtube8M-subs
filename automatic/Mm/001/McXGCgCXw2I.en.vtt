no ports the laptop is connected to the

bottom using like a type of magnet kind

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.120 
bottom using like a type of magnet kind
of<00:03:53.120> force<00:03:53.360> it<00:03:54.020> can't<00:03:54.260> exactly<00:03:54.590> be<00:03:54.860> a<00:03:54.890> magnet

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
of force it can't exactly be a magnet

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.560 
of force it can't exactly be a magnet
because<00:03:55.400> it'd<00:03:55.670> be<00:03:55.700> too<00:03:55.910> close<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.360> hard

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
because it'd be too close to the hard

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.620 
because it'd be too close to the hard
drive<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.020> it<00:03:57.110> would<00:03:57.230> mess<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:57.920> hard<00:03:58.250> drive<00:03:58.459> up

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
drive and it would mess a hard drive up

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.440 
drive and it would mess a hard drive up
so<00:03:59.630> anyway<00:04:00.410> over<00:04:00.860> here<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.370> don't<00:04:02.180> know<00:04:02.270> if<00:04:02.360> you
