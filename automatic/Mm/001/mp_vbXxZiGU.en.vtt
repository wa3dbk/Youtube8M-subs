reason<00:00:59.730> we<00:01:00.059> raise<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.510> price<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.050> boots

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
reason we raise the price of the boots

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.830 
reason we raise the price of the boots
is<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.160> felt<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> low<00:01:03.359> price<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
is that we felt that the low price of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.109 
is that we felt that the low price of
the<00:01:03.960> boots<00:01:04.170> did<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.920> adequately<00:01:05.460> reflect<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the boots did not adequately reflect the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.570 
the boots did not adequately reflect the
high<00:01:06.270> strength<00:01:06.630> bonus<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.860> decided<00:01:08.430> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
high strength bonus so we decided to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.420 
high strength bonus so we decided to
raise<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.970> price<00:01:09.240> ok<00:01:10.140> then<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.830> why<00:01:11.070> did<00:01:11.310> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
raise the price ok then but why did you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.359 
raise the price ok then but why did you
choose<00:01:11.900> 75,000<00:01:12.900> coins<00:01:13.140> as<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> price<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.159> why

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
choose 75,000 coins as the price and why

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.310 
choose 75,000 coins as the price and why
did<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.670> set<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> ouch<00:01:15.390> price<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.080> high<00:01:16.290> that

billions of coins have probably entered
the<00:03:04.970> economy<00:03:05.510> from<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:05.900> while<00:03:06.349> we<00:03:06.560> looked

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
the economy from this while we looked

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.089 
the economy from this while we looked
into<00:03:07.099> this<00:03:07.220> before<00:03:08.060> we<00:03:08.209> released<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.780> update

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
into this before we released the update

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.430 
into this before we released the update
to<00:03:10.099> do<00:03:10.280> this<00:03:10.519> I<00:03:10.849> looked<00:03:11.329> into<00:03:11.540> my<00:03:11.690> runescape

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
to do this I looked into my runescape

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.920 
to do this I looked into my runescape
bank<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:13.099> saw<00:03:13.579> that<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:13.819> had<00:03:14.120> one<00:03:14.360> climbing

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.280 
bank and saw that I had one climbing
boot<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:16.250> proves<00:03:16.579> that<00:03:16.900> 100%<00:03:17.900> of

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290
