really<00:03:02.549> have<00:03:02.700> any<00:03:02.849> standard<00:03:03.239> lights<00:03:03.480> as<00:03:03.780> you

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
really have any standard lights as you

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.949 
really have any standard lights as you
probably<00:03:04.139> know<00:03:04.439> so<00:03:04.919> this<00:03:05.819> is<00:03:06.030> also<00:03:06.209> viable<00:03:06.750> for

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
probably know so this is also viable for

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.530 
probably know so this is also viable for
hanging<00:03:07.319> stuff<00:03:07.349> such<00:03:07.889> as<00:03:07.919> this<00:03:08.329> this<00:03:09.329> is<00:03:09.510> a

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
hanging stuff such as this this is a

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.250 
hanging stuff such as this this is a
china<00:03:10.349> ball<00:03:10.590> or<00:03:10.859> a<00:03:10.889> paper<00:03:11.159> lantern<00:03:11.840> big<00:03:12.840> globe

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
china ball or a paper lantern big globe

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.800 
china ball or a paper lantern big globe
here<00:03:13.620> what<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:13.829> do<00:03:13.949> with<00:03:14.099> this<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.810> will

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
here what you do with this is you will

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.009 
here what you do with this is you will
take<00:03:16.019> a<00:03:16.049> socket<00:03:16.530> at<00:03:16.620> light<00:03:16.799> like<00:03:17.129> this<00:03:17.370> and

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
take a socket at light like this and

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.809 
take a socket at light like this and
pretty<00:03:19.019> bright<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.739> put<00:03:19.949> it<00:03:20.040> inside<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.459> the

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
pretty bright you put it inside of the

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.250 
pretty bright you put it inside of the
China<00:03:21.060> ball<00:03:21.239> here<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.870> acts<00:03:22.109> as

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
China ball here and this acts as

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.080 
China ball here and this acts as
diffusion<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.949> create<00:03:23.220> some<00:03:23.430> cheap<00:03:23.729> soft

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
diffusion and create some cheap soft

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.899 
diffusion and create some cheap soft
light<00:03:24.500> it's<00:03:25.500> kind<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.799> very<00:03:26.040> old<00:03:26.280> trick<00:03:26.609> but

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
light it's kind of a very old trick but

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.599 
light it's kind of a very old trick but
it's<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.090> good<00:03:27.269> one<00:03:27.419> and<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:28.590> tricky<00:03:28.979> part<00:03:29.370> about

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
it's a good one and a tricky part about

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.309 
it's a good one and a tricky part about
this<00:03:29.849> however<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.449> how<00:03:30.659> do<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.840> hang<00:03:31.109> these

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
this however is how do you hang these

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.930 
this however is how do you hang these
without<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.709> C<00:03:31.949> stands<00:03:32.250> these<00:03:32.489> stands<00:03:32.760> are

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
without a C stands these stands are

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.430 
without a C stands these stands are
great<00:03:33.120> for<00:03:33.299> hanging<00:03:33.510> china<00:03:33.840> balls<00:03:34.079> but<00:03:34.319> if<00:03:34.379> you

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
great for hanging china balls but if you

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.379 
great for hanging china balls but if you
don't<00:03:34.620> have<00:03:34.769> them<00:03:34.949> or<00:03:35.280> if<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.819> tried<00:03:36.060> using

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
the PVC light stand just hasn't worked

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.530 
the PVC light stand just hasn't worked
well<00:03:38.129> for<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.549> because<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.120> tricky<00:03:39.389> and

caveat<00:03:49.349> about<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.859> of<00:03:50.010> course<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.489> if

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
caveat about this of course is that if

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:51.830 
caveat about this of course is that if
you've<00:03:50.790> ever<00:03:50.909> used<00:03:50.970> these<00:03:51.209> before<00:03:51.599> you<00:03:51.720> know

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
you've ever used these before you know

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.149 
you've ever used these before you know
that<00:03:52.019> these<00:03:52.199> have<00:03:52.409> to<00:03:52.530> hang<00:03:52.709> straight<00:03:53.040> down

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
that these have to hang straight down

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.589 
that these have to hang straight down
especially<00:03:53.669> if<00:03:53.970> you're<00:03:54.060> using<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.419> hot

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
especially if you're using a hot

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.479 
especially if you're using a hot
incandescent<00:03:54.930> bulb<00:03:55.379> because<00:03:55.709> if<00:03:55.859> that<00:03:56.189> bulb

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
incandescent bulb because if that bulb

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.939 
incandescent bulb because if that bulb
heat<00:03:57.299> gets<00:03:57.510> too<00:03:57.689> hot<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.139> touches<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.739> side

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
heat gets too hot and touches the side

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.159 
heat gets too hot and touches the side
of<00:03:59.099> this<00:03:59.280> paper<00:04:00.269> lantern<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.870> whole<00:04:00.989> thing

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
of this paper lantern the whole thing

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:02.360 
of this paper lantern the whole thing
will<00:04:01.290> burst<00:04:01.439> into<00:04:01.650> flame<00:04:01.919> that<00:04:02.159> will<00:04:02.250> just

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
will burst into flame that will just

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.089 
will burst into flame that will just
ruin<00:04:02.519> your<00:04:02.729> shoot<00:04:02.939> right<00:04:03.150> there<00:04:03.389> so<00:04:04.069> make<00:04:05.069> sure

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
ruin your shoot right there so make sure

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.949 
ruin your shoot right there so make sure
that<00:04:05.370> these<00:04:05.519> are<00:04:05.639> hanging<00:04:05.970> straight<00:04:06.209> down<00:04:06.449> now

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
that these are hanging straight down now

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.839 
that these are hanging straight down now
with<00:04:07.199> these<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.769> poor<00:04:07.919> man<00:04:08.069> see<00:04:08.310> Stan<00:04:08.579> doesn't

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
with these the poor man see Stan doesn't

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.569 
with these the poor man see Stan doesn't
extend<00:04:09.299> as<00:04:09.479> tall<00:04:09.810> as<00:04:10.139> a<00:04:10.169> full<00:04:10.620> rate<00:04:11.099> real<00:04:11.340> see

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
extend as tall as a full rate real see

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.939 
extend as tall as a full rate real see
Stan<00:04:11.879> so<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:12.750> is<00:04:12.840> probably<00:04:13.079> best<00:04:13.349> in<00:04:13.560> seeded

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
Stan so this is probably best in seeded

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.580 
Stan so this is probably best in seeded
situations<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:15.479> best<00:04:15.509> use<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.079> think<00:04:16.109> for<00:04:16.500> this

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
situations the best use I think for this

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.550 
situations the best use I think for this
thing<00:04:16.889> is<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.459> mount<00:04:17.669> these<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.389> is<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.599> LED

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
thing is to mount these this is a LED

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.080 
thing is to mount these this is a LED
light<00:04:19.919> this<00:04:19.979> is<00:04:20.250> my<00:04:20.279> fotodiox<00:04:21.000> LED<00:04:21.150> 98
