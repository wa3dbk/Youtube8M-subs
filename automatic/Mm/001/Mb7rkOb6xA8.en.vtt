five steps okay let's see I like to
focus<00:03:16.970> on<00:03:17.359> setting<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.260> full<00:03:18.470> rotation<00:03:18.889> of<00:03:19.489> a

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
focus on setting a full rotation of a

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.289 
focus on setting a full rotation of a
360<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:20.840> ollie<00:03:21.200> into<00:03:21.650> 180<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.579> just<00:03:23.060> use

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
360 so you ollie into 180 and just use

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.150 
360 so you ollie into 180 and just use
that<00:03:23.329> total<00:03:23.959> flex<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.349> your<00:03:24.470> boot<00:03:24.650> really

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
that total flex of your boot really

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.250 
that total flex of your boot really
press<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:25.819> noses<00:03:26.030> as<00:03:26.359> much<00:03:26.540> as<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.810> can<00:03:26.989> and

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
press the noses as much as you can and

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.879 
press the noses as much as you can and
kind<00:03:27.769> of<00:03:27.889> once<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.519> feel<00:03:28.880> that<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.680> press<00:03:30.680> of

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
kind of once you feel that the press of

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.710 
kind of once you feel that the press of
the<00:03:31.010> ski<00:03:31.250> just<00:03:31.549> kind<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.819> popped<00:03:32.060> back<00:03:32.269> out<00:03:32.480> and

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
the ski just kind of popped back out and

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.009 
the ski just kind of popped back out and
try<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:32.959> 180<00:03:33.829> back<00:03:34.069> in<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:34.609> it's<00:03:35.419> essentially

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
try to 180 back in so it's essentially

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.170 
try to 180 back in so it's essentially
think<00:03:36.200> of<00:03:36.349> it<00:03:36.470> as<00:03:36.650> doing<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.190> 180<00:03:37.579> s<00:03:37.760> versus

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
think of it as doing to 180 s versus

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.659 
think of it as doing to 180 s versus
trying<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.660> actually<00:03:38.870> butter<00:03:39.470> around<00:03:40.099> because

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
trying to actually butter around because

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.849 
trying to actually butter around because
if<00:03:40.849> you<00:03:40.970> just<00:03:41.269> try<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.480> butter<00:03:42.139> a<00:03:42.260> lot<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.650> times

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
if you just try to butter a lot of times

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.530 
if you just try to butter a lot of times
you'll<00:03:43.069> catch<00:03:43.250> your<00:03:43.280> get<00:03:43.849> your<00:03:44.030> edge<00:03:44.150> so<00:03:44.419> if

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
you'll catch your get your edge so if

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.150 
you'll catch your get your edge so if
you<00:03:44.630> jump<00:03:44.930> into<00:03:45.109> it<00:03:45.349> and<00:03:45.470> really<00:03:45.530> press<00:03:45.919> those

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
you jump into it and really press those

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.039 
you jump into it and really press those
noses<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:46.730> jump<00:03:46.970> out<00:03:47.090> you're<00:03:47.720> gonna<00:03:47.840> have<00:03:47.989> a

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
noses and jump out you're gonna have a

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.990 
noses and jump out you're gonna have a
better<00:03:48.260> better<00:03:48.980> chance<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.489> don't<00:03:49.730> know<00:03:49.849> if

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
better better chance I don't know if

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.240 
better better chance I don't know if
that<00:03:50.209> was<00:03:50.359> technically<00:03:50.900> five<00:03:51.380> steps<00:03:51.799> but

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
that was technically five steps but

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.979 
that was technically five steps but
that's<00:03:52.880> what<00:03:53.090> I<00:03:53.120> think<00:03:53.359> about<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.900> that's

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
that's what I think about and that's

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.569 
that's what I think about and that's
what<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.290> try<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.590> do<00:03:54.829> so<00:03:55.069> hopefully<00:03:55.400> that<00:03:55.549> helps

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
what I try to do so hopefully that helps
