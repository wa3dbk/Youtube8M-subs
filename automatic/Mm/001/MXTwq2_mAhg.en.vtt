00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
engagement as we can I thought it was

great<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:31.949> far<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> community<00:00:32.910> program

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
great as far as a community program

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.150 
great as far as a community program
because<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.870> really<00:00:34.110> felt<00:00:34.320> like<00:00:34.380> me<00:00:34.680> someone

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
because I really felt like me someone

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.790 
because I really felt like me someone
who's<00:00:35.340> been<00:00:35.520> dancing<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.210> over<00:00:36.960> 10<00:00:37.200> years<00:00:37.230> I

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
who's been dancing for over 10 years I

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.440 
who's been dancing for over 10 years I
got<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> great<00:00:38.280> experience<00:00:38.790> from<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.329> then

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
got a great experience from it and then

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.810 
got a great experience from it and then
also<00:00:39.660> dancers<00:00:40.230> who<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.829> maybe<00:00:41.129> only<00:00:41.280> taken

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
also dancers who have maybe only taken

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.490 
also dancers who have maybe only taken
one<00:00:41.969> or<00:00:42.000> two<00:00:42.210> classes<00:00:42.420> or<00:00:42.930> never<00:00:43.200> danced

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
one or two classes or never danced

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440 
one or two classes or never danced
before<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.010> think<00:00:44.430> they<00:00:44.550> got<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> lot<00:00:45.000> out<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.210> it

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
before I think they got a lot out of it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.049 
before I think they got a lot out of it
I<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> modern<00:00:47.039> dance<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
I like a modern dance because it's a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.600 
I like a modern dance because it's a
combination<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.980> everybody's<00:00:49.980> walk<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.430> life

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
combination of everybody's walk of life

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.760 
combination of everybody's walk of life
I<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.719> different<00:00:51.930> classes<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
I like to go to different classes to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.700 
I like to go to different classes to
kind<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.340> which<00:00:54.090> group<00:00:54.570> kind<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.199> chooses

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
a part of the performance I know from a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.460 
a part of the performance I know from a
neuroscience<00:01:30.060> standpoint<00:01:30.540> when<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:30.990> when<00:01:31.350> we

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
neuroscience standpoint when we when we

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.780 
neuroscience standpoint when we when we
know<00:01:31.650> something<00:01:31.680> when<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> bring<00:01:32.280> recognizing

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
know something when I bring recognizing

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.609 
know something when I bring recognizing
something<00:01:33.000> you've<00:01:33.090> set<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.420> pattern<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.020> so

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
something you've set up a pattern and so

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
something you've set up a pattern and so
when<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> again<00:01:35.360> there's<00:01:36.360> there's<00:01:36.780> an

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
when you see it again there's there's an

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.440 
when you see it again there's there's an
active<00:01:37.470> recognition<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:39.090> active

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
active recognition and that active

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.499 
active recognition and that active
recognition<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.490> is<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.850> little<00:01:42.210> internal

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
recognition is is a little internal

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.390 
recognition is is a little internal
reward<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.200> yourself

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
reward for yourself

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.660 
reward for yourself
I<00:01:44.780> think<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.930> definitely<00:01:46.260> that<00:01:46.590> taking<00:01:46.980> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
I think that definitely that taking the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.400 
I think that definitely that taking the
class<00:01:47.910> from<00:01:48.150> one<00:01:48.690> of<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.870> members<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
class from one of the members of the

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.520 
class from one of the members of the
company<00:01:49.560> will<00:01:50.450> definitely<00:01:51.450> resonate<00:01:51.900> with<00:01:52.380> me

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
company will definitely resonate with me

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.050 
company will definitely resonate with me
when<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> performance<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:53.910> you

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
when I see the performance because you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.050 
when I see the performance because you
have<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> better<00:01:54.450> grasp<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.320> style<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
have a better grasp of the style and the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.870 
have a better grasp of the style and the
initiation<00:01:57.510> of<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> movement<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:59.580> that<00:01:59.760> you

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
initiation of the movement so that you

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.340 
initiation of the movement so that you
can<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.450> reflected<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.200> their

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
can really see that reflected in their

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.120 
can really see that reflected in their
performance<00:02:01.890> visions<00:02:03.470> one<00:02:04.470> point<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.860> view<00:02:04.980> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
performance visions one point of view is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.790 
performance visions one point of view is
to<00:02:05.160> sit<00:02:05.550> in<00:02:05.730> the<00:02:05.820> audience<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.510> watch<00:02:07.440> the

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
show but another way is to attempt to do

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.210 
show but another way is to attempt to do
the<00:02:11.520> dance<00:02:11.820> yourself<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.040> that

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
the dance yourself you know and in that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.199 
the dance yourself you know and in that
