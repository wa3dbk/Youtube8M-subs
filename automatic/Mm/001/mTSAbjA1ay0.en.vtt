00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:48.359 
didn't solely incorporate one one thing
I<00:05:46.990> have<00:05:47.199> to<00:05:47.349> say<00:05:47.499> about<00:05:47.619> this<00:05:47.889> version<00:05:48.099> though

00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:48.369 
I have to say about this version though

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:50.790 
I have to say about this version though
is<00:05:48.879> that<00:05:48.969> it<00:05:49.240> is<00:05:49.360> extremely<00:05:49.719> easier<00:05:50.469> than<00:05:50.649> its

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
is that it is extremely easier than its

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.739 
is that it is extremely easier than its
arcade<00:05:51.159> counterpart<00:05:51.369> and<00:05:52.209> to<00:05:52.330> be<00:05:52.449> honest

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:52.749 
arcade counterpart and to be honest

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:54.899 
arcade counterpart and to be honest
hasn't<00:05:53.559> really<00:05:53.740> held<00:05:53.979> the<00:05:54.099> test<00:05:54.369> of<00:05:54.519> time<00:05:54.669> -

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909 
hasn't really held the test of time -

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.499 
hasn't really held the test of time -
well<00:05:55.080> it's<00:05:56.080> kind<00:05:56.379> of<00:05:56.559> too<00:05:57.069> easy<00:05:57.309> the<00:05:58.149> steering

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
well it's kind of too easy the steering

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.359 
well it's kind of too easy the steering
wheel<00:05:58.659> works<00:05:58.869> really<00:05:59.229> well<00:05:59.469> though<00:06:00.099> it<00:06:00.249> is<00:06:00.339> a

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:00.369 
wheel works really well though it is a

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:02.790 
wheel works really well though it is a
little<00:06:00.639> on<00:06:00.759> the<00:06:00.849> small<00:06:01.119> side<00:06:01.349> the<00:06:02.349> pedal<00:06:02.649> for

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
little on the small side the pedal for

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.829 
little on the small side the pedal for
the<00:06:02.889> game<00:06:03.039> also<00:06:03.309> worked<00:06:03.759> really<00:06:03.939> well<00:06:04.029> even

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:04.839 
the game also worked really well even

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.170 
the game also worked really well even
though<00:06:04.959> it<00:06:05.199> felt<00:06:05.619> a<00:06:05.860> little<00:06:06.039> cheap<00:06:06.399> and<00:06:06.610> was

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
though it felt a little cheap and was

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.629 
though it felt a little cheap and was
pretty<00:06:07.419> small<00:06:07.749> the<00:06:08.559> pedal<00:06:08.860> actually<00:06:09.159> attaches

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
pretty small the pedal actually attaches

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.009 
pretty small the pedal actually attaches
to<00:06:09.729> the<00:06:09.819> steering<00:06:10.119> wheel<00:06:10.149> for<00:06:10.509> easy<00:06:10.659> storage

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:11.019 
to the steering wheel for easy storage

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:13.409 
to the steering wheel for easy storage
when<00:06:11.439> the<00:06:11.830> pedal<00:06:12.009> is<00:06:12.159> in<00:06:12.279> use<00:06:12.490> however<00:06:12.729> the

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
when the pedal is in use however the

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.089 
when the pedal is in use however the
geniuses<00:06:13.930> that<00:06:14.019> Coleco<00:06:14.499> came<00:06:14.740> up<00:06:14.860> with<00:06:15.009> the

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
geniuses that Coleco came up with the

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:16.920 
geniuses that Coleco came up with the
idea<00:06:15.430> of<00:06:15.519> putting<00:06:15.729> your<00:06:15.939> control<00:06:16.389> pad<00:06:16.599> into

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
idea of putting your control pad into

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.170 
idea of putting your control pad into
that<00:06:17.499> space<00:06:17.860> so<00:06:18.639> you<00:06:18.699> can<00:06:18.909> use<00:06:19.059> the

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
that space so you can use the

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.079 
that space so you can use the
controller's<00:06:19.659> dial<00:06:19.899> as<00:06:20.139> a<00:06:20.199> shifter<00:06:20.860> I<00:06:21.089> really

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:22.089 
controller's dial as a shifter I really

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:23.939 
controller's dial as a shifter I really
recommend<00:06:22.539> this<00:06:22.629> accessory<00:06:23.169> to<00:06:23.289> anybody<00:06:23.800> who

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
recommend this accessory to anybody who

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.249

is<00:06:24.069> a<00:06:24.099> ColecoVision<00:06:24.819> collector<00:06:25.300> even<00:06:26.169> though

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
is a ColecoVision collector even though

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:27.899
