 introduce yourself to the boss and also a 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.059
 street fight that was very complicated 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.519
 so so be it if that was a pleasure 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.809
 for me to spend here in triple-a in a 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.759
 company that I do I forget that 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.619

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.590
 actually be here in front of all 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.350

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.600
