00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:10.270
 hello I'm flo you do now image and the 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.270
 Today's question is 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.460
 and given the time my recommendations of 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.070
 today they will be for how to go dressed to those 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.160
 Christmas parties if it is with friends 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.560
 the party of the company with the family 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.750
 with co-workers with 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.180
 classmates a dinner 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.130
 romantic with your boy or just 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.690
 let's go as a guest if we do not know 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.850
 no Christmas for the holidays 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.469
 let's take into account four aspects 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.510
 the weather the time the place and the 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.820
 guests are the attendees who are 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.100
 in that party really two types of 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.679
 Christmas parties the holidays of the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.499
 company that are usually with you 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.899
 boss and coworkers and the 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.510
 social parties which are with your 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.550
 friends with your family with your boy with 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.010
 the friends of the school with your surroundings 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.379
 let's start talking about the holidays 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.480
 of the company that may suddenly be what 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.550
 more stressful for you and according to what I 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.740
 have written if the day parties in a 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.659
 open place let's say it's in a club 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.630
 because in a farm the garments must be 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.880
 chords some more informal than others 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.439
 depending on the environment but taking into 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.479
 account always that those who are 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.579
 you are accompanying your fellow 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.850
 work and your boss so it's not the 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.979
 time to be the happiest 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.830
 if it is at night of course that the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.100
 brightness is going to make you 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.409
 get attention and you can use it but 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.930
 try to limit a little necklines and 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.909
 teach too much skin for diets 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.380
 of company you have to keep in mind 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.320
 as long as we can not lose the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.930
 composure ever so if that day you 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.180
 They give liquor seeks to drink little and if 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.970
 you want to eat a lot do it but drink little 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.690
 please if you drink little you take care of your image 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.909
 and you avoid a bad time and also that you take care 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.490
 your position for next year have the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.500
 day at a club on a farm in a field 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.500
 open these are my recommendations 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.990
 i 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:32.260
 at night on a disc in a 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.260
 restaurant the luxury can be higher 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.430
 for family parties do not fear 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.890
 to love and sophistication in these 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.590
 parties to be not to be in environments 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.140
 well more than that because of it in an environment 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.900
 family on a farm could give use 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.739
 these styles 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.739
 I do not see it 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.590
 now the showcases of all the 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.110
 warehouses dress not only luxury but 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.290
 also of winter clothes because 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.510
 this is dictated by trends but 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.940
 we can adapt that image that we 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.950
 they sell brands in our style to 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.709
 our climate and what we want 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.319
 communicate that you should avoid in the day if 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.319
 you are at a business or work party 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.129

 mirror and if you do not sit down to eat 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.220
 the world can not come out like that the attitude and 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.110
 the security is not given by the garments and 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.449

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.490
