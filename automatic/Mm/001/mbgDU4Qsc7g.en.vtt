00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.990
 m 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.330
 in one of my previous videos I 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.099
 already showed how to create this shell 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.529
 voluminous and I put the links in 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.450
 the separate info bar back wick of 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:30.580
 hair and torso delay twice in 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:32.260
 clockwise then add a 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.780
 lock of hair dropped in the arm 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.940
 lower 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.519
 gold section these delays in passing a 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.170
 wick over the other continue to 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.610
 to be that is by adding each time 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.000
 wicks from below to section 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.670
 1 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.519
 that's what it gives and now we 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.260
 will create a simple twist for him 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.420

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.030

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.100
 away from your face then turn sadc 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.289

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.310
 your face to bring the 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.810
 additional length 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.970

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.740
 natural in Glendale clips 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.240
 but to adopt this law also violates 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.770
 with medium-length hair you can 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.110
 tie the spikes in a small 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.060
