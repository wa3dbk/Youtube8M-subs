have<00:00:45.540> a<00:00:45.660> chain<00:00:45.930> breaker<00:00:46.080> basically<00:00:46.650> you<00:00:47.460> will

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
have a chain breaker basically you will

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.060 
have a chain breaker basically you will
not<00:00:47.880> be<00:00:48.060> able<00:00:48.150> to<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.770> well<00:00:49.770> how<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
not be able to do this well how the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.030 
not be able to do this well how the
chain<00:00:50.460> breaker<00:00:50.700> works<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.450> has<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> pin<00:00:52.040> that

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
chain breaker works it has a pin that

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.240 
chain breaker works it has a pin that
when<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.280> turn<00:00:53.490> it<00:00:53.910> push<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.500> pin<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.740> to<00:00:55.860> Gao

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
when you turn it push the pin up to Gao

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.760 
when you turn it push the pin up to Gao
so<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.480> will<00:00:57.630> be<00:00:57.750> able<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.050> remove<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.880> link

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.840 
worry about it because even though it's
metal<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:19.860> would<00:02:20.010> stretch<00:02:20.250> out<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.430> little<00:02:20.490> bit

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
metal it would stretch out a little bit

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.510 
metal it would stretch out a little bit
so<00:02:21.319> if<00:02:22.319> it's<00:02:22.470> tight<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.950> for<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.340> first

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
so if it's tight like that for the first

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.120 
so if it's tight like that for the first
time<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:23.940> fine
