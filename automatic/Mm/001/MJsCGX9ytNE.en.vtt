putting a piece of parchment paper down
at<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> bottom<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.780> gonna<00:01:54.930> put<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> layer<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
at the bottom I'm gonna put a layer of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.469 
at the bottom I'm gonna put a layer of
fudge<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.070> top<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.579> cake<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.149> give<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
fudge on top of the cake to give it a

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.319 
fudge on top of the cake to give it a
little<00:01:57.689> extra<00:01:58.290> texture<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.700> gonna<00:01:59.820> be<00:02:00.000> chewy

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
little extra texture it's gonna be chewy

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.170 
little extra texture it's gonna be chewy
and<00:02:00.630> delicious<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:02.399> I'm<00:02:02.490> using<00:02:02.549> what

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
and delicious so here I'm using what

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.850 
and delicious so here I'm using what
it's<00:02:03.360> called<00:02:03.570> an<00:02:03.719> offset<00:02:03.899> spatula<00:02:04.259> it's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
it's called an offset spatula it's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.600 
it's called an offset spatula it's
angled<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.790> get<00:02:05.939> inside<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:07.170> pan<00:02:08.129> down

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
angled so I can get inside the pan down

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.510 
angled so I can get inside the pan down
to<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
to the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.790 
to the
of<00:02:09.730> that<00:02:09.850> keg<00:02:10.210> if<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.900> didn't<00:02:11.110> have<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.380> angles

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
of that keg if I didn't have this angles

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.430 
of that keg if I didn't have this angles
or<00:02:12.100> offset<00:02:12.730> spatula<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.390> couldn't<00:02:13.870> get<00:02:14.050> right

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
or offset spatula I couldn't get right

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.400 
or offset spatula I couldn't get right
inside<00:02:14.950> his<00:02:15.490> pants<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.240> is<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.420> credible

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
inside his pants so this is a credible

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.940 
inside his pants so this is a credible
tool<00:02:18.360> next<00:02:19.360> step<00:02:19.570> is<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.990> add<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.170> ice<00:02:20.590> cream

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
tool next step is to add the ice cream

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.280 
tool next step is to add the ice cream
so<00:02:21.910> what<00:02:22.150> I'm<00:02:22.240> doing<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.570> taking<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.990> large

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
so what I'm doing is taking a large

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.060 
so what I'm doing is taking a large
spoon<00:02:23.740> and<00:02:24.540> taking<00:02:25.540> little<00:02:25.870> slivers<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.680> ice

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
spoon and taking little slivers of ice

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.680 
spoon and taking little slivers of ice
cream<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.720> just<00:02:30.150> putting<00:02:31.150> them<00:02:31.240> down<00:02:31.390> into

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
cream and just putting them down into

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.550 
cream and just putting them down into
the<00:02:32.470> pan<00:02:32.680> on<00:02:32.950> top<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.520> cake<00:02:33.730> layer<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:35.320> now

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
the pan on top of the cake layer so now

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.910 
the pan on top of the cake layer so now
I<00:02:36.240> fill<00:02:37.240> my<00:02:37.390> pan<00:02:37.660> but<00:02:38.200> I'm<00:02:38.320> going<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.530> use<00:02:38.590> that

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
I fill my pan but I'm going to use that

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.220 
I fill my pan but I'm going to use that
offset<00:02:39.340> spatula<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.300> this<00:02:40.570> one<00:02:40.780> has<00:02:40.960> about<00:02:41.170> a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
offset spatula and this one has about a

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.970 
offset spatula and this one has about a
four-inch<00:02:41.740> blade<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:43.120> am<00:02:43.360> going<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:44.020> push

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
four-inch blade and I am going to push

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.570 
four-inch blade and I am going to push
the<00:02:45.310> ice<00:02:45.460> cream<00:02:45.790> down<00:02:47.490> as<00:02:48.490> I<00:02:49.950> kind<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.040> maneuver

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
the ice cream down as I kind of maneuver

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.980 
the ice cream down as I kind of maneuver
it<00:02:51.900> flatten<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.340> get<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.460> to<00:02:54.610> just<00:02:54.910> take<00:02:55.570> up<00:02:55.720> all

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
it flatten it get it to just take up all

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.340 
it flatten it get it to just take up all
that<00:02:56.230> space<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.910> there<00:02:58.120> are<00:02:58.270> no<00:02:58.450> air<00:02:58.750> pockets

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
that space so there are no air pockets

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.620 
that space so there are no air pockets
that's<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.740> most<00:02:59.860> important<00:03:00.400> thing<00:03:00.510> see<00:03:01.510> how

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
that's the most important thing see how

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.760 
that's the most important thing see how
its<00:03:01.810> softening<00:03:03.210> I'm<00:03:04.210> taking<00:03:04.960> control<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.410> the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
its softening I'm taking control of the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.770 
its softening I'm taking control of the
ice<00:03:05.950> cream<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.790> now<00:03:06.850> it's<00:03:07.390> going<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:07.720> the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
ice cream and now it's going in the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.930 
ice cream and now it's going in the
freezer
