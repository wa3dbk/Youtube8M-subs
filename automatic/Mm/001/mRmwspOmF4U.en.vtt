five minutes all the way up to one hour
then<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.730> second<00:02:28.090> setting<00:02:28.329> is<00:02:28.540> zero<00:02:28.810> one<00:02:29.049> two

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
then the second setting is zero one two

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.690 
then the second setting is zero one two
three<00:02:29.439> or<00:02:29.530> four<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.829> that<00:02:30.069> just<00:02:30.340> shows<00:02:30.400> you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
three or four and that just shows you

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.789 
three or four and that just shows you
like<00:02:30.849> how<00:02:31.060> how<00:02:31.629> hard<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.109> want<00:02:32.319> it<00:02:32.379> to<00:02:32.530> blow

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.949 
like how how hard you want it to blow
and<00:02:33.159> then<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.849> third<00:02:34.090> setting<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.599> actually

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959
