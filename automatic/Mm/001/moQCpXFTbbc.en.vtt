00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.830
 shortage of videos I know 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.390
 time to do more than streaming 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.850
 once in a while and re upload them to the channel 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.100

 that is to be grateful and good we are going to 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.229
 explain already the bases of this new 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.810
 sign we start from a new account 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.960
 fut as always without coins but with a 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.149
 only player who Mr. Slatan 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.729
 ibrahimovic as it can not be otherwise 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.070
 form one of my favorite players of 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.770
 ultimate team and good let's get him out 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.000
 all the game or you can the idea 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.149
 is to make template bronze template 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.310
 silver and gold template with ibra 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.259
 always as the point of attack 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.860
 the goal as I can not play the 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.500
 Silver bronze tournaments marked me a 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.560
 target of 50 goals in the beginning with 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.390
 pound and maybe this is expandable 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.100
 depending on how they are going to be and the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.020
 time that you have and other things that we are going 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.950
 seeing improvement systems for 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.569
 update the team match won 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.630
 can i buy a new player hat trick 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.810
 with pound I can buy two players and 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.700
 skil ball long soto a decent goal I 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.920
 I will propose in the comments 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.110
 Vote if you vote or if you think it is worthy 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.000
 so that three players are 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.459
 improvements between quotes are not 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.040
 cumulative is to say if I win the match 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.260
 and I put hat-trick with ibra do not buy 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.360
 other players but I'll stay with 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.989
 the hat trick advantage alone and I'll buy 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.209
 two is worth saying that it happens that 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:47.100
 I have all the players the club 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.230
 non-transferable and I need to spend 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.840
 pound from my main account that is 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.330
 where I bought it from this account 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.540
 so what I'm going to do is play a 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.580
 match with this envelope template 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.590
 initiation to be able to at least take out 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.060
 the new ones needed to buy a 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.160
 about bronze put a player the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.990
 sale and bring me help starts the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.390
 party and as you can see I've had two 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.280
 opportunities there are at the beginning quite 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.380
 clear but the truth is that they are very bad 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.170
 they fail then a goal with font in that 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.380
 you have seen there before the break and 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.620
 nothing after the break right here already 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.190
 turned 0 is how good it happened to me in the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.740
 cuts and record one of the goals here not 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.970
 I know how in some strange way I get 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.070
 a penalty nor I had noticed the 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.070
 minute 90 and to the truth that the rival 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.480
 I had quite a bit at a level apart from a 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.180
 basically pretty good team basically 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.370
 as good as you see me hit her with 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.260
 that minute 90 there's no time for more 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.200
 ends the objective game achieved 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.050
 we have I do not know if they are 500 six hundred 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.810
 coins and I can buy an envelope of 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.660
 bronze and put this play 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:58.310
