 welcome to the worst hears I have data of pedrengo these weeks company of 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.230
 marco mazza that the most attentive among you will have got to know pine 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.789
 past the motor show episodes when we were compact but arguing 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.530
 of this not fomula agonistico of this rather intense calendar that 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.290
 is bringing I hear more people on the track cribs scooters and excuses erections 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.720
 two then 2 very long season that between trophy polini malossi trophy fb 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.940
 employee 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.900
 in the swimming pool 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.160
 many people 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.170
 all oasis. let's see what happened in these volume 2 power 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.900
 ok then we had the first re-check test 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.380
 under the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.260
 It is the first race that was held on April 7th 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.590
 it was a bit of a race 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.890
 or particular 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.610
 first of all it must have rained for two consecutive days during the period of the 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.840
 evidence that even now yara 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.610
 and the quest came on without ever giving up 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.200
 the slips were not lacking in these words but above all a race 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.170
 it started 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.400
 a ballet among the pilots who could not stay on the ground due to lack 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.920
 of grip 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.270
 regarding this test 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.640
 pieces to say that organization is successful and still maintain the 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.090
 tranquility is a good thing 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.040
 and we have seen performances that were already competitive in any case 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.439
 they were planned for this type of water show 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.900
 here with marco mazza but above all a few weeks ago we talked about 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.750
 a tattoo idea that of 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.490
 continues to bring people on the track and especially ds a little or a little bit 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.450
 our area people interested in running 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240
 and this correspondence 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.140
 mary's ponente was pretty good especially with regards to the fans 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.170
 which is the most awaited thing about samo that thanks also the three fairs we have 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.140
 made which is a province of ours we held about a hundred 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.410
 phone calls 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.460
 el where practically llamo can be sent back mastrota the stickers and all 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.190
 regarding our organization 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.280
 while in this period we are just selecting two new drivers from 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.060
 to introduce in the pm that is in this moment is already found with 4 guides 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.409
 and to see a moment perhaps with the first of May to be able to attend series with - a new e 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.409
 so be on the track with five familiar faces 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.349
 however, this long season is a challenge, it also presents itself as a challenge 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.490
 daddy payer 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.800
 cup to clean copa but I site it. challenge in some technique without then Easter 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.129
 private type are currently arch glass bricks 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.809
 after having succeeded 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:36.059
 reluctantly, something very special happened and we say that 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.679
 we have and the speech dry hand m 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:43.119
 they are practically the winners for two consecutive years 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:46.809
 and we also have beds in polini that fierce entry because it is a lot 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:51.229
 competitive - you are very strong in the middle years really up to par 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.400
 we say that in these two races we are the one of April 10th, which is it 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.599
 resolved re-finding and that which took place April 17th to mansion are high 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.010
 both two on the water 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.950
 neet marco mata scooter team is successful grace massimiliano ferrari out carry 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.660
 at home 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.850
 of the very important pre-season final points with a prepared scooter 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.360
 mallossi but from us at artisan level, therefore almost as a series 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.229
 the image you saw that you still have is related to the first test of 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.549
 this Malossi trophy but let's talk with massimiliano ferrari heard 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.130
 but then I spit that they are so easy to use every day on the track 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.499
 how it behaves 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.869
 it's true, keep in mind it's a little different 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:45.809
 with the lights on the road, the text ends here 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.579
 who wants a little more attention 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.579
 however, it is so much fun 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:56.229
 the tests we have done both as a film is that I personally stopped 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.499
 it is very difficult that it has been tests in wet conditions 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.759
 for which 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:05.609
 they had difficulties as asphalt as an estate 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.249
 and as a cycle of the scooter preview what is the most difficult thing is quesi 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.219
 take action scooters - they all have the same performance and from here to where 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.739
 earn where you lose 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.419
 nothing is a pilot of the 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.459
 if very careful 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.830
 scooters accelerates weight scooters that wet on 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.189
 having a lot of power 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:29.460
 power collapses 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.830
 suddenly, if one fails to accelerate or to disconnect HIV risk 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.830
 on earth to compromise the race 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.939
 clearly 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:41.349
 important to have a constancy what I in these two tests came out 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.840
 get a consistent race for all tips queen 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.309
 I have established 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:47.539
 beyblade 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.269
 in good eremon positions brought a good score a score than now 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:59.599
 is the third enchantment in Italian in front behind official menfi aum polini 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.990
 official red rubber 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.810
 as a private seller I can be very satisfied thanks to my skills 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.180
 My team's are also evolving more and more 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.530
 and they import me and the other drivers via being more competitive if you become 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.539
 to stay there and the almost physical direct discount the slips are to what of the day 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.559
 in direct confrontation, to say that I was an agenda 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.509
 although not if I always run on tracks 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.360
 with spaces 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.180
 remarkable but also on cathode - 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.910
 the kartodrome a1 escape space hey of path widths not much 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.930
 large so you are always in physical contact especially at departures and it is 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.309
 detached in curves 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:45.759
 in a curve so 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.930
 but I want to say it first of all the first gs always a name with the high ball after 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.639
 sicietÃ  always d 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.300
 will succeed flows in the best summer leaving the opponents behind 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.220
 Sunday, May 1st third round of the second championship halo badoo how much 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.530
 it counts to know tracks I think little parking 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.710
 in the morning try immediately speck potatoes and there are very few 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.279
 test minutes 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:13.009
 1 2 already install pro conviction to be prepared ready to face the 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:14.539
 race of the day 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.669
 next we try is a vast Saturday 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.099
 let's do qualification times 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.699
 then on the web starting on Sunday 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.300
 the most ancient Venetian 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.580
 clearly, pilots who carry on because they succeed in are 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.939
 make better use of the trajectories and lead a cleaner race 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:40.239
 cover of the Lungotevere championship prize everything started with the most 

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:42.139
 voted posted by points balance 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:43.889
 if constancy 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.789
 the desire to arrive 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:47.580
 her support 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.979
 of a solid theme like my the marco scooter scooter theme 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.740
 of friends around that 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.999
 they make me feel 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.129
 I am fine for which 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:59.430
 there is a desire to win
