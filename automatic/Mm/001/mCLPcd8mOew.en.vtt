going to be a copy of this in the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.170 
going to be a copy of this in the
description<00:01:04.879> below<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:08.649> first<00:01:09.649> things<00:01:09.890> first

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
description below so first things first

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.029 
description below so first things first
get<00:01:11.180> yourself<00:01:11.539> some<00:01:11.720> cobblestone<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:12.590> mark

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
get yourself some cobblestone and mark

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.080 
get yourself some cobblestone and mark
out<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:13.250> six<00:01:13.580> by<00:01:13.789> nine<00:01:13.820> area<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:15.380> 9<00:01:15.710> being<00:01:16.399> where

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
out a six by nine area the 9 being where

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.469 
out a six by nine area the 9 being where
the<00:01:17.240> doors<00:01:17.479> going<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.810> be<00:01:18.520> now<00:01:19.520> that<00:01:19.550> 6<00:01:20.270> by<00:01:20.450> 9

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
the doors going to be now that 6 by 9

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.180 
the doors going to be now that 6 by 9
footprint<00:01:21.110> doesn't<00:01:21.440> include<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.920> steps

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
footprint doesn't include the steps

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.540 
footprint doesn't include the steps
because<00:01:22.759> if<00:01:22.910> this<00:01:23.060> was<00:01:23.240> sunk<00:01:23.539> into<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.050> ground

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
because if this was sunk into the ground

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.410 
because if this was sunk into the ground
then<00:01:25.550> you<00:01:25.670> wouldn't<00:01:25.850> have<00:01:25.910> to<00:01:26.000> stare<00:01:27.700> so<00:01:28.700> next

just get a top-down look on that for
and<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:44.540> next<00:02:44.870> layer<00:02:45.110> we're<00:02:45.620> going<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.830> start

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
and the next layer we're going to start

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.330 
and the next layer we're going to start
implementing<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:47.120> bookshelves<00:02:47.599> so<00:02:48.340> first

implementing the bookshelves so first

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.399 
implementing the bookshelves so first
things<00:02:49.580> first<00:02:49.670> bring<00:02:50.239> them<00:02:50.390> corners<00:02:50.870> up<00:02:51.049> with

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
things first bring them corners up with

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.759 
things first bring them corners up with
the<00:02:51.530> cobblestone<00:02:52.069> again<00:02:53.200> on<00:02:54.200> each<00:02:54.409> of<00:02:54.650> the

ends bring your grass windows up another

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.479 
ends bring your grass windows up another
another<00:02:58.129> level

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
another level

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.069 
another level

then along the front and the back edges

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.470 
then along the front and the back edges
you're<00:04:04.310> going<00:04:04.489> to<00:04:04.549> want<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:04.760> put<00:04:05.090> down<00:04:05.269> your

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
you're going to want to put down your

you're going to want to put down your
wooden<00:04:05.750> stairs<00:04:06.639> and<00:04:08.230> this<00:04:09.230> roof<00:04:09.440> does

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
wooden stairs and this roof does

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.280 
wooden stairs and this roof does
overhang<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:10.519> my<00:04:10.669> own<00:04:10.780> original<00:04:11.780> footprint

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
overhang so my own original footprint

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.189 
overhang so my own original footprint
doesn't<00:04:12.769> actually<00:04:13.280> travel<00:04:13.639> this<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.199> it

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.199 
doesn't actually travel this and it

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:20.199 
doesn't actually travel this and it
covers<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.709> foundations<00:04:16.400> as<00:04:16.609> such

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.999 

and<00:04:21.209> this<00:04:21.329> is<00:04:21.449> a<00:04:21.540> very<00:04:21.750> easy<00:04:21.959> roof<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.560> build<00:04:22.770> so

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:23.009 
and this is a very easy roof to build so

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.469 
and this is a very easy roof to build so
the<00:04:23.070> next<00:04:23.340> one<00:04:23.610> you're<00:04:24.150> going<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.300> want<00:04:24.449> to

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
the next one you're going to want to

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.770 
the next one you're going to want to
come<00:04:24.690> in<00:04:24.900> one<00:04:25.169> with<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.500> steps<00:04:26.389> and<00:04:27.389> fill<00:04:27.660> in

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
come in one with the steps and fill in

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.390 
come in one with the steps and fill in
the<00:04:27.930> rest<00:04:28.080> with<00:04:28.289> cobblestone<00:04:28.889> and<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:32.190> same

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
the rest with cobblestone and the same

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.969 
the rest with cobblestone and the same
for<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.699> next<00:04:32.970> layer<00:04:33.199> come<00:04:34.199> in<00:04:34.470> one<00:04:34.680> again

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
for the next layer come in one again

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.689 
for the next layer come in one again
with<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.280> steps<00:04:35.870> on<00:04:36.870> each<00:04:36.990> side<00:04:37.370> fill<00:04:38.370> in<00:04:38.520> the

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
with the steps on each side fill in the

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.999 
with the steps on each side fill in the
stone<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:40.680> last<00:04:40.949> layer<00:04:41.310> is<00:04:41.699> just<00:04:42.389> stairs

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
stone and the last layer is just stairs

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.439 
stone and the last layer is just stairs
back<00:04:44.009> to<00:04:44.190> back<00:04:44.370> as<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:45.539> can<00:04:45.690> see<00:04:45.900> they're

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
back to back as you can see they're

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.920 
back to back as you can see they're
easy-peasy

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.029 

so<00:04:51.930> I've<00:04:52.410> also<00:04:52.710> got<00:04:53.190> here<00:04:54.410> how<00:04:55.410> you'd<00:04:55.620> find<00:04:55.889> it
