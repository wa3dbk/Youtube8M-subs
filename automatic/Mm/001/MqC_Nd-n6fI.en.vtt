this<00:00:42.360> keyboard<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.899> useful<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.860> mean<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
this keyboard is useful I mean it's the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.250 
this keyboard is useful I mean it's the
way<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.539> did<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.840> know<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.050> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
way to do it but did you know that you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.299 
way to do it but did you know that you
can<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.530> read<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.100> information

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
can actually read that information

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400 
can actually read that information
inside<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.360> computer<00:00:48.629> if<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.230> actually

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
inside the computer if you can actually

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.680 
inside the computer if you can actually
read<00:00:49.800> get<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> sim<00:00:50.610> card<00:00:50.640> reader<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.390> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
read get a sim card reader and a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
read get a sim card reader and a
software<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.320> will<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.070> basically

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
software that will do it so basically

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.979 
software that will do it so basically
all<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.850> really<00:00:54.180> need<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.840> we've

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
all I really need to do that is we've

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.260 
all I really need to do that is we've
got<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.410> Descartes<00:00:56.219> ah<00:00:56.460> sim<00:00:56.789> card<00:00:57.030> reader

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
got the Descartes ah sim card reader

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.389 
got the Descartes ah sim card reader
here<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.260> then<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.469> need<00:00:58.620> software<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.370> your

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
here and then you need software on your

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.939 
here and then you need software on your
computer<00:00:59.520> call<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> sim<00:01:00.420> manager<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.800> as

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
computer call the sim manager and as

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.100 
computer call the sim manager and as
AJ's<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.609> getting<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> sim<00:01:03.390> card<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.809> here

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
AJ's just getting the sim card out here

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.810 
AJ's just getting the sim card out here
Oh<00:01:04.140> perfect<00:01:04.470> that's<00:01:04.860> lovely<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.519> essentially

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
Oh perfect that's lovely so essentially

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.670 
Oh perfect that's lovely so essentially
what<00:01:06.030> happens<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.810> plug<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.290> into

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
what happens is you just plug that into

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.469 
what happens is you just plug that into
the<00:01:08.010> card<00:01:08.549> reader<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.939> looks<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.210> kind<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the card reader it looks like kind of

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.020 
the card reader it looks like kind of
like<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.659> mini<00:01:09.960> USB<00:01:10.200> or<00:01:10.770> micro<00:01:11.400> drive<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.820> sim

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
like a mini USB or micro drive the sim

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.090 
like a mini USB or micro drive the sim
card<00:01:12.060> goes<00:01:12.720> right<00:01:13.110> into<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.500> end<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.920> there

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
card goes right into the end of it there

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.520 
card goes right into the end of it there
I<00:01:14.340> don't<00:01:14.520> give<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.390> think<00:01:15.780> study

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
I don't give up that in I think study

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.469 
I don't give up that in I think study
and<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.130> got<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> little<00:01:17.520> last<00:01:17.880> symbol<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
and it's got a little last symbol on the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.730 
and it's got a little last symbol on the
back<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.290> which<00:01:19.470> way<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
back of it so you can see which way to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980 
back of it so you can see which way to
load<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> sim<00:01:20.310> card<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.670> November<00:01:21.420> mom<00:01:21.630> yeah

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
load the sim card in November mom yeah

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.460 
load the sim card in November mom yeah
it's<00:01:22.170> almost<00:01:22.619> foolproof<00:01:26.990> put<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.290> there

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
it's almost foolproof put that in there

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.440 
it's almost foolproof put that in there
so<00:01:28.950> basically<00:01:29.369> once<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.820> plugged<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.270> there

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
so basically once it's plugged in there

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.880 
so basically once it's plugged in there
the<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.659> green<00:01:30.960> light<00:01:31.200> goes<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the little green light goes on on the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.050 
the little green light goes on on the
top<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.340> tells<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.759> there<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
top so it tells you that there is a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060 
top so it tells you that there is a
connection<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.990> should<00:01:34.170> also<00:01:34.290> have

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
connection you should also have

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.800 
connection you should also have
pre-loaded<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.850> software<00:01:36.360> into<00:01:36.689> your

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
pre-loaded the software into your

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.780 
pre-loaded the software into your
computer<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.350> advance<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.920> we've<00:01:38.220> done<00:01:38.430> here

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
computer in advance like we've done here

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.609 
computer in advance like we've done here
and<00:01:38.970> then<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> two<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.049> them<00:01:40.170> speak<00:01:40.439> together

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and then the two of them speak together

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.469 
and then the two of them speak together
so<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.400> read<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.820> write<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
so that you can read and write to the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.940 
so that you can read and write to the
sim<00:01:42.630> card<00:01:42.659> yeah<00:01:43.110> some<00:01:43.380> kind<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.560> readers<00:01:43.799> are

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
sim card yeah some kind of readers are

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.080 
sim card yeah some kind of readers are
probably<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.250> little<00:01:44.340> bit<00:01:44.520> tricky<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.850> find

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
probably a little bit tricky to find

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.280 
probably a little bit tricky to find
you're<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:45.420> going<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.600> find<00:01:45.750> them<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.140> in

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
you're not going to find them like in

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.050
