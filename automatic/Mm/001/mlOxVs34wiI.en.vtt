00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
mean is they can do it well with

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.609 
mean is they can do it well with
everything<00:01:02.879> connected<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.409> not<00:01:04.559> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
everything connected but that's not a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.260 
everything connected but that's not a
good<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.159> not<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> good<00:01:05.519> movement<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:06.090> is

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
good it's not a good movement this is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.140 
good it's not a good movement this is
not<00:01:06.540> Wing<00:01:06.990> Chun<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.700> Wing<00:01:08.939> Chun

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
like that you don't do a timed are like

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.640 
like that you don't do a timed are like
this<00:02:41.330> do<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> Colorado<00:02:42.840> fish<00:02:43.170> right<00:02:43.410> on<00:02:43.560> the

moment<00:02:46.290> ago<00:02:46.319> about<00:02:46.470> laughing<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.550> don't<00:02:47.670> live

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
moment ago about laughing you don't live

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.880 
moment ago about laughing you don't live
here<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.390> then<00:02:48.900> pull<00:02:49.110> them<00:02:49.230> here<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.680> turn

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
here and then pull them here and turn

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.130 
here and then pull them here and turn
off<00:02:50.099> there's<00:02:51.030> no<00:02:51.239> point<00:02:51.480> implemented<00:02:52.019> it's

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
off there's no point implemented it's

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.479 
off there's no point implemented it's
much<00:02:52.290> better<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.650> follow<00:02:53.370> up<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.790> do<00:02:53.879> this<00:02:54.060> so

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
much better to follow up and do this so

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.699 
much better to follow up and do this so
it's<00:02:56.489> like<00:02:56.670> having<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.180> Terminator<00:02:57.690> with<00:02:58.680> a

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
it's like having the Terminator with a

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.640 
it's like having the Terminator with a
good<00:02:59.069> heart<00:02:59.310> that's<00:02:59.670> what<00:02:59.819> Wing<00:02:59.970> Chun<00:03:00.239> is

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
good heart that's what Wing Chun is

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.920 
good heart that's what Wing Chun is
robot<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.860> makes<00:03:02.099> no<00:03:02.310> mistakes<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.060> never<00:03:03.720> is

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
robot it makes no mistakes and never is

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.920 
robot it makes no mistakes and never is
good<00:03:04.340> because<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:05.670> too<00:03:06.150> connected<00:03:06.569> and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
good because it's too connected and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.750 
good because it's too connected and
powerful<00:03:07.349> and<00:03:07.470> understands<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.190> dynamics<00:03:08.340> of

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
powerful and understands the dynamics of

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.300 
powerful and understands the dynamics of
the<00:03:08.879> physics<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:10.019> enough<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.739> this<00:03:10.890> wrestling

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the physics so enough of this wrestling

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.520 
the physics so enough of this wrestling
time<00:03:11.519> he<00:03:11.700> comes<00:03:11.909> in<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.209> keep<00:03:12.390> coming<00:03:12.720> in<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.050> go

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
time he comes in to keep coming in I go

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.680 
time he comes in to keep coming in I go
like<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.830> if<00:03:14.159> he<00:03:14.280> comes<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.580> my<00:03:14.700> side<00:03:14.940> I'm<00:03:15.540> not

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
like this if he comes to my side I'm not

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.839 
like this if he comes to my side I'm not
looking<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.080> do<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:17.780> which<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:18.930> easy<00:03:19.409> to<00:03:19.530> do

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
looking to do this which is easy to do

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.390 
looking to do this which is easy to do
because<00:03:20.849> I<00:03:21.510> have<00:03:22.319> to<00:03:22.530> think<00:03:22.800> that<00:03:23.099> he<00:03:23.220> knows

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
because I have to think that he knows

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.970 
because I have to think that he knows
wait<00:03:23.670> time<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.360> it's<00:03:24.870> not<00:03:25.170> okay<00:03:25.590> for<00:03:25.620> me<00:03:25.890> to

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
wait time and it's not okay for me to

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.030 
wait time and it's not okay for me to
dumb<00:03:26.400> down<00:03:26.430> what<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.090> do<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.680> level

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
dumb down what I do to it the level

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.949 
dumb down what I do to it the level
compared<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> physics<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.569> Wing<00:03:30.750> Chun
