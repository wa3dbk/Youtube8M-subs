00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.840 

I'll<00:00:04.200> be<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.470> first<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.830> admit<00:00:04.920> that<00:00:05.399> I<00:00:05.609> have<00:00:05.819> a

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
I'll be the first to admit that I have a

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.059 
I'll be the first to admit that I have a
video<00:00:06.089> phobia<00:00:06.569> arachnophobia<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.679> even

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
video phobia arachnophobia and even

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.400 
video phobia arachnophobia and even
entomophobia<00:00:08.370> but<00:00:09.090> then<00:00:09.389> again<00:00:09.540> who<00:00:10.019> doesn't

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
entomophobia but then again who doesn't

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
entomophobia but then again who doesn't
however<00:00:11.010> luckily<00:00:11.340> for<00:00:11.610> us<00:00:11.730> they're<00:00:12.059> all

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
however luckily for us they're all

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.180 
however luckily for us they're all
ectotherms<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.260> in<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.470> winter<00:00:13.740> they<00:00:13.889> simply

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
ectotherms so in the winter they simply

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.860 
ectotherms so in the winter they simply
can't<00:00:14.430> sustain<00:00:14.639> their<00:00:14.940> body<00:00:15.120> heat<00:00:15.330> died<00:00:15.720> out

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
can't sustain their body heat died out

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.080 
can't sustain their body heat died out
and<00:00:16.019> go<00:00:16.170> extinct<00:00:16.650> right<00:00:17.099> well<00:00:17.580> as<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.970> can

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
and go extinct right well as you can

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.149 
and go extinct right well as you can
probably<00:00:18.300> guess<00:00:18.689> Ecuador's<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:19.679> spiders
