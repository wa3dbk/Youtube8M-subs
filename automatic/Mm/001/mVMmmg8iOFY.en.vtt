00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.760
 now client welcome back to me 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.650
 Glad to see you again here in 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.940
 this occasion to talk a little 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.940
 about ecosystems 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.670
 definition of ecosystem 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.820
 let's see the ecosystem formed 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.790
 by living beings the physical environment 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.280
 where they live and the relationships that they 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.460
 they establish between them 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.460
 We call this set 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.460
 ecosystem 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.890
 with this definition we can extract the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.110
 elements that ecosystems have by 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.990
 one side the physical environment of which you 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.000
 I will speak in a later video 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.560
 the video will be called the types of 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.890
 ecosystems in that 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.890
 we will talk 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.760
 that is one of the other elements 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.340
 element would be living beings 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.350
 the set of living beings and another 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.120
 element of every ecosystem is the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.130
 relationship that is established between those 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.590
 eros and those of living beings and their 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.230
 relationships let's talk in this video 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.340
 very well 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.820
 of living beings I'm going to give you some 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.159
 definitions or guidelines on 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.960
 way we have to group beings 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.700
 living from an ecosystem 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.180
 for this we are going to imagine a 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.650
 ecosystem such as a lake a wing 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.100
 hard 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.290
 in which we have then 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.570
 the ducks we want frogs 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.510
 vegetable kingdom we have no places 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.240
 we also have three species two of 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.820
 animal kingdom one of the vegetable kingdom ducks 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.110
 frogs and water lilies 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:03.090
 because we would call a single duck 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.090
 individual guy of that species 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.860
 to a single member of a kind of 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.310
 we raise individual 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.920
 or carefree a frog a water lily in that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.540
 let's say it's an individual of that 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.480
 species 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.659
 when we will talk about all the ducks by 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.120
 example we would call it the population 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.829
 of ducks from that ecosystem 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.969
 ecosystem in this case of our lake 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.010
 or lagoon 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:30.420
 we could the duck population of 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.360
 our lake 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.480
 500 ducks for example or the population of 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.370
 frogs is from x number or the population of 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.220
 water lilies at that time we are 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.710
 talking about all the members of a 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.920
 same species 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.980
 and finally the community the community 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.770
 of living beings from our ecosystem 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.920
 will be the sum of the frogs' ducks 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.360
 of the water lilies then to the whole 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.420
 of living beings we will call it the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.650
 community of that ecosystem 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.989
 very simple and alive population that are of 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.660
 the same species and community 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.519
 different species of a single ecosystem 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.480
 easy easy 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.090
 let's talk now about 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:23.150
 relationships that are established between 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.090
 different living beings from an ecosystem 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.330
 the relationships that are established between 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.830
 different species 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.930
 is usually for food because the 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.720
 living beings need to feed and for 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.910
 feed themselves make use of other beings 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.569
 alive at that time is established between 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.810
 them a relationship for food 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.480
 this I think you should know 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.790
 also that to this type of relationship or 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.710
 with this type of relationship, what is 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.140
 that we call the food chain 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.570
 you also have to know what it is if not 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.210
 you know a review of the courses 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.980
 previous 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.870
 we have our food chain 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.450
 and in our food chain there 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.159
 different levels than this possibly 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.280
 the names of those different levels is 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.420
 what is not yet 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.630
 I've seen 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.660
 we would have our first level 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.220
 would be the producers would be the beings 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.230
 alive that we would call producers and 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.100
 they are usually or usually belong to the kingdom 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.880
 of the vegetables 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.820
 this we would call a product is 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.409
 They serve food producers to 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.949
 first consumers 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.280
 at this level we would call them 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.840
 primary consumers 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.620
 that they would feed on the 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.620
 producers 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.490
 better primary ones would serve as food 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.490
 to secondary consumers 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.780
 to these this level we would call 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:59.000
 secondary consumers these 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.520
 secondary consumers would serve as 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.009
 food to tertiary consumers 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.270
 and so on we would have our 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.340
 producers our consumers 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.159
 primary secondary consumers 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.289
 our tertiary consumers and for 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.240
 last we would have another level to which 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.000
 we would call decomposers 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.820
 what are those who feed on the 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.850
 remains that remain of the other levels 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.550
 your decomposers in turn serve 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:35.900
 of food to the producers and of this 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:38.360
 way this food chain closes 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.800
 this cycle closes these would be the 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.500
 relationships that would exist between 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.210
 different living beings of any 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.090
 ecosystem 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.819
 some would serve elements to others and so 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.230
 Life could be flowing and continue 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:55.950
 all happy and happy feeding 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.600
 agree very well as the subject is 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.060
 easy enough I think they do not have 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.410
 complication none I leave a scheme 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.750
 summary as you see the ecosystems have 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.810
 three elements the physical medium of which 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.670
 I will speak to you in a video after the beings 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.440
 alive and the relationships that are established 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.410
 among them in terms of living beings 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.180
 the groups can be divided into either a 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.750
 individual of a single species a 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.100
 individual the population that are the sum 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.590
 of all the individuals of that same 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.980
 species or the community in an ecosystem 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.660
 all the living beings that compose it 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.820
 all these beings live the different 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.760
 we call them the community of 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.620
 that ecosystem and then the relationships 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.980
 that are established among them that usually 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.770
 be of food as they form the 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.379
 food chain 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.720
 a producer would be the base then 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:49.129
 primary consumer consumers are 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.349
 feeds the consumer producer 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:54.169
 secondary is fed from the primary the 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.940
 tertiary of the secondary etcetera and of 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:58.069
 they all feed the 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.530
 decomposers and these decomposers 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:03.110
 what they do is provide food to 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:06.229
 the producers very simple 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:09.020
 very simple you give a look if 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.370
 you need it you see it again but I think 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.389
 which is very very easy 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:16.650
 It's good to be careful, study and 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:19.220
 well behaved 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.220
 see you later
