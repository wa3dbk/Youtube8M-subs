but<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.790> have<00:03:50.480> noticed<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:51.260> purchased<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.280> masters

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
but I have noticed I purchased a masters

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.520 
but I have noticed I purchased a masters
Edition<00:03:53.329> which<00:03:53.569> was<00:03:53.780> like<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.900> extra<00:03:54.200> ten<00:03:54.500> bucks

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
Edition which was like a extra ten bucks

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.670 
Edition which was like a extra ten bucks
and<00:03:55.459> I<00:03:56.090> thought<00:03:56.269> I'd<00:03:56.450> just<00:03:56.690> begin<00:03:57.019> like<00:03:57.349> four

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
and I thought I'd just begin like four

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.670 
and I thought I'd just begin like four
courses<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.690> now<00:03:59.690> that's<00:03:59.930> pretty<00:04:00.200> much<00:04:00.380> it

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
courses and now that's pretty much it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.190 
courses and now that's pretty much it
but<00:04:01.130> what<00:04:01.459> I<00:04:01.489> did<00:04:01.940> notice<00:04:02.120> is<00:04:02.359> is<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:03.049> they

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
but what I did notice is is that they

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.670 
but what I did notice is is that they
give<00:04:03.349> you<00:04:03.440> masters<00:04:04.040> edition<00:04:04.220> clubs

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
give you masters edition clubs

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.150 
give you masters edition clubs
