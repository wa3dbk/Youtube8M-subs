00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.750
 you want decorations that in a way 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.000
 different well then in this video that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.910
 I have the perfect option is this 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.980
 decorated of a cat is very cute and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.869
 it's only going to take you a few minutes 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.869
 let's see what it is you need 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.150
 but as long as all you need is 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.430
 some chantilly I need fondant or 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.950
 anything white a bit of 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.440
 red coloring and of course in our 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.110
 cupcake the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.940
 paint our chantilly I will add 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.860
 two droplets of liquid dye and you 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.320
 I'm going to start moving until I get a 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.320
 intense red more or less like this red 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.410
 Well, I do not like this for me 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.350
 ojito if you want it more intense 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.420
 then they keep adding droplets now 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.210
 what we are going to do 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.460
 is to take the piece of paper out of our bread 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.869
 that he cited with care to not 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.520
 fall apart and now we 're going to cover it 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.909
 with our chantilly only in the part 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.909
 above 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.729
 with a little bit and now with an editor 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:32.759
 I'm placing it, I'm going to cover all the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.820
 surface since we cover well the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.030
 surface now as a final touch let's go 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.740
 to put some candies cited good I'm going 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.750
 to place two hits but you can 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.420
 put fondant or anything white 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.130
 as I told you in the ingredients for 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.130

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.869
 and 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.630

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.369

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.350

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.539
