00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.640
 hello guys and girls how I hope 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:09.380
 twizy welcome to garden we continue in 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.610
 the truth a beta that I personally go 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.460
 to miss very much when finished 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.809
 which is then a couple of days and 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.669
 of the days I was able to enjoy it 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.230
 I focused basically on how to 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.279
 heist game that yesterday some of 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.630
 you told me in several 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.460
 comments that is available in others 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.900
 maps but I really do not find 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.909
 servers on other maps other than the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.259
 of the bank and even so despite how much 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:30.050
 I could only play it on a map 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.130
 the truth is that it does not stop throwing waves 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.960
 today I have been testing the other mode of 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.190
 new game the game mode bridge and 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.449
 honestly I only find one 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.760
 defect and that is the fact that it gives me the 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.949
 feeling that this game mode calls 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.300
 shouting more players or at least that's 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.579
 the feeling that I have, I think with more 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.129
 players would be more dynamic more 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.699
 frantic would have a higher pace 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.839
 currently the maximum number of 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.469
 players for this game mode is from 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.910
 32 and I think with 48 or even 64 though 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.949
 maybe it would be a bit excessive 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.989
 time but good this map swallows 64 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.359
 conquest so I do not see why it is not 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.710
 will be able to swallow 64 bridge mode by the 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.390
 rest this game mode seems pretty 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.250
 pretty complete for the one who does not 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.020
 know what it is about, it is exactly 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.719
 just like a conquest but in this 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.810
 flags are vehicles and not worth 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.820
 be consumed and you already have to have it in 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.049
 movement to score what it does 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.340
 that the objectives are in constant 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.049
 movement if we take into account that in 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.299
 hard line practically any weapon 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.590
 inflicts damage to a vehicle 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.090
 we get some nice moving targets 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.890
 vulnerable that are quite 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.090
 attractive to the infantry and this is 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.020
 something like it could not be otherwise 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.219
 I love it, damn, I love it 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.209
 I basically devote myself to reappear 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.459
 as infantry looking for the first 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.810
 target captured by the enemy 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.819
 sew it to bullets and then if I get 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.989
 eliminate the pilot and try to steal the 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.110
 vehicle like this time that I 

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:43.159
 they hit a franchise and the truth is that 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.720
 it's a game mode that even though 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.489
 well what are you seeing the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.319
 recorded while playing alone then invites 

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:49.759
 very much to play with colleagues play with 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.709
 colleagues makes infinitely more fun 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.939
 playing with vehicles because you can not 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:54.500
 shoot while driving what 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.179
 convert your partners in your 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.890
 firepower and in your unique 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.479
 opportunity to defend you still not 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.400
 has had the opportunity is the storm 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.780
 of sand on this map 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.860
 on this map there is supposedly a 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.750
 sand storm but it gives me the feeling 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.730
 that is exclusive to the game mode 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.440
 conquest and not yet played conquest in 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.060
 this beta 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.560
 and I'm just saying maybe the game mode 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.380
 robbery because it had something to do 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.120
 this I love the way he let robbery 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.230
 damn it's called try but I want 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.090
 but to the conquest and I do not think that the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.950
 true without being able to prove it and returning the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.120
 hotwire theme because the truth is that it is 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.400
 a game mode that has amused me 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.720
 while I've played or the times I've 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.030
 played because the truth is that I had fun 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.410
 quite miss more players is 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.030
 the only downside that puts you this mode 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.580
 game that he missed more players 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.780
 of 32 are short and nothing more than 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.740
 add on my part I would like the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.940
 that you have tried this new mode of 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.510
 game, leave me your opinion in the 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.940
 comments 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.959
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.959
 next chao chao 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.750
 he gave me
