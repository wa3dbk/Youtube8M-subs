if<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> risk<00:01:52.950> sucks<00:01:53.189> gonna<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.700> is

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
if the risk sucks gonna be like this is

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330 
if the risk sucks gonna be like this is
this<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.689> pretty<00:01:54.960> pathetic<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.619> sure<00:01:56.310> enough

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340

it<00:01:56.759> looks<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.149> it's<00:01:57.329> definitely<00:01:57.600> gonna<00:01:57.869> be

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it looks like it's definitely gonna be

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.980 
it looks like it's definitely gonna be

an average if logging of what is it
three<00:02:41.250> point<00:02:41.850> two<00:02:42.090> per<00:02:42.900> store<00:02:43.670> if<00:02:44.670> all<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
three point two per store if all the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.690 
three point two per store if all the
source<00:02:45.690> are<00:02:45.810> gonna<00:02:45.930> get<00:02:46.170> an<00:02:46.410> annulment<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.100> if
