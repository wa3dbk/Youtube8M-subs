00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.550
 Welcome back to one 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.040
 Another round would be going on again 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.840
 explosive things and started immediately 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.630
 right in the middle of the rasta change and that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.800
 gamers 2 have a new one 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.420
 manager probably the most 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.150
 will know of you and that is the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.460
 the good in flames after flame the fire 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.380
 The coach of sk gaming has been then 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.660
 well, almost once I know kicked 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.269
 been gone out because now at 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.340
 Gamers too but not as a coach as before 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.840
 but as a manager also new 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.219
 is the hd carey and there it is 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.989
 probably the first huge one 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.850
 Surprise and knows that jenson that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.239
 is exactly the jazz of the one before 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.000
 year 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.789
 at sk gaming on the uhu as a meanin 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.590
 then played with then beikost 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.480
 Lena in keeping the new with longer 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.610
 will be park the before at millennium 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.590
 so played a lot of experience 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.719
 he is now mainly from sk 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.160
 gaming is considered in flames 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.949
 being self-confident was was before 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.239
 So what's up with sk gaming? 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.170
 he definitely has some things now 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.579
 to veteran at the start 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.530
 otherwise, what actually has not happened 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.060
 too many dlcs are changed for that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.170
 but some personalities too 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.600
 once stepped forward and indeed 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.430
 Well-known the fish and ident is so 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.310
 the coach of kockmann wulffs and the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.049
 kaarster by riot itself and that's it 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.040
 because a bit tricky because that 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.380
 has claimed that he has 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.060
 information of sea ​​fish over the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.640
 he has his own tactics from sk gaming 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.380
 said players and he is natural 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.640
 extremely bad if that was true 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.200
 Fischer would probably have his 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.880
 but losing a job can remember 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.829
 proved that the country is true though 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.360
 said these claims but not 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.579
 agreed and he just said that 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.390
 to have more authority in front of his team too 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.020
 Of course, that's a bit 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.670
 brazen the career of a dentist 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.210
 its typical is of course too 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.829
 take risk 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.240
 However , drove anyway 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.729
 bit crap being built are for 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.470
 you take it that way and that 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.270
 he has an offer of railway stations 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.280
 get a management position there 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.229
 assume that has not communicated and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.630
 so far would that if you have a 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.159
 job offer just gets this immediately 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.180
 Of course, that's not everywhere 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.770
 that's a bit odd for me anyway 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.540
 that one says that's bad of 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.829
 this is wrong here the fish that 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.960
 you did not tell us that 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.340
 I hate thinking of most of the others 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.869
 Films actually go and give that one 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.000
 the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.560
 does not tell if there may 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.450
 but other offers have apparently 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.739
 not the whole point, however 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.450
 that the fish apparently 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.760
 different players he through 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.730
 his previous playing career very well 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.620
 personally knows some talks 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.840
 led as in order to career decision 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.310
 and possibly also a career decision 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.650
 that must be in favor of the head 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.239
 can science players etc and that works 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.530
 of course, not clear as quarterly he 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.480
 exceeded in any case, the border 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.010
 so now the punishment of riot 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.140
 games for dentists and for the fish 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.489
 because that will not be a coach until week four 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.049
 At least one of you can be great 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.569
 not officially on stage and 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.519
 dante's vision of the course is 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.190
 four weeks may not cost more 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.140
 and also indefinitely none 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.290
 Kopenhagen plays more carsten 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.690
 He is also allowed to join until the end of 2016 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.970
 no lcs team as a coach player 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.760
 manager or owner will do that 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.109
 offer of the bulls is so so 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.370
 For the cat I am everyone must now 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.750
 decide for yourself a little bit like him 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.310
 this is punish record for me 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.739
 this fish does not punish anyone 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.030
 other lcs team is after the 2016 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.250
 maybe a little hard but good 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.599
 Contracts are there to comply 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.859
 be and he can definitely be happy 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.510
 that he does his job as a water polo player 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.040
 if we have another springer yet 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.810
 Although some things are done in one act 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.540
 huge new sponsor at the angel and 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.940
 though geico i am sure how to handle it 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.250
 pronounce on her gm coo that is one 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.470
 huge insurance company in the usa 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.090
 one of the biggest ever and yes the 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.919
 Sponsors first hard stone event 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.599
 Something like that in the resin sound but a lot 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:38.690
 more important for us of course you sponsor 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.000
 Sam himself, then , really gave me that 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.400
 clou of the year probably what 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.599
 sponsoring has done naturally 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.889
 you forget that already gives many 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.849
 other companies are not involved 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.750
 sports have to do now yes 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.699
 actually those are for example the 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.440
 airforce he sponsors believe that is also 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.489
 It is quite absurd but it is up 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.290
 every case a giant step in the 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.519
 right direction for the spots anyway 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.650
 I think I have to be careful 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.090
 because of course not nice if you are in now 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.010
 the lcs themselves on advertising for 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.780
 insurance companies do not forget 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.819
 may like 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.020
 the spectators are and how easy 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.940
 they let themselves be manipulated 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.950
 with the press not enough and that 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.440
 has now been announced where that 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.240
 lcs summer finale will take place 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.440
 this is nowhere else than in madison 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.520
 square garden 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.780
 many of you will become this 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.790
 probably already know and there 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.910
 was actually already well-known events 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.010
 like the nhl finales the nbl finales though 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.919
 also events like the grammys et cetera 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.470
 held so it is almost the place for 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.960
 events in new york par excellence and yes 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.430
 with 20,000 spectators 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.810
 In any case, you have a lot going on again 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.240
 potential for concentrated league of legends 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.560
 action committee sports news nonetheless 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.510
 but still a little news and indeed 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.340
 is on the pc server has a new one 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.930
 a hat seems to be just that 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.320
 what you see what your life beams 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.210
 indicates everything on yours 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.360
 static screen so minimap 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.550
 the layout are your players and 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.990
 new life blasphemes than that has and that 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.550
 was fundamentally changed to really 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.229
 the pw it looks completely different from the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.340
 position each other even the table 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.780
 has completely changed 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.100
 Here I show you also about pure 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.450
 Picture should now on the club 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.550
 Of course you could be bound 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.750
 So argue a bit about that 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.280
 you who looks better bad 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.810
 It is there, I think 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.860
 matter of taste, but still said it 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.330
 is still in development so there 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.470
 you should not take too seriously 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.060
 I hope that you yourself 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.740
 when it comes to the official server 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.030
 after some deeps have this option 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.310
 that one has the age at least one 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.840
 For a while it keeps because he has some 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.160
 just do not come with change 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.530
 Clear and I have to say I'm from the 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.820
 less of your habitual animals what 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.590
 Unfortunately, you have to get used to it 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.550
 is the fact that the news at that time too 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.050
 Thank you very much, of course 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.280
 anyway for watching and we see 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.450
 us all at the latest next week 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.870
 skin in again 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.870
 Until next time
