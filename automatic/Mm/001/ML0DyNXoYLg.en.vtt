00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
the body style for aerodynamics lower

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.350 
the body style for aerodynamics lower
road<00:00:38.200> noise<00:00:38.410> better<00:00:39.160> performance<00:00:39.789> they've

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
road noise better performance they've

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.590 
road noise better performance they've
actually<00:00:40.570> it's<00:00:41.350> longer<00:00:41.800> it's<00:00:42.250> wider<00:00:42.550> it's<00:00:43.480> got

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
actually it's longer it's wider it's got

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.240 
actually it's longer it's wider it's got
a<00:00:43.629> little<00:00:43.840> bit<00:00:43.930> of<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.530> better<00:00:44.739> ground

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
a little bit of a better ground

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.560 
a little bit of a better ground
clearance<00:00:45.579> they've<00:00:45.940> added<00:00:46.239> a<00:00:46.360> lot<00:00:46.539> more

they've added a lot of different things
outside<00:00:54.760> to<00:00:54.969> help<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.270> be<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.539> right

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
outside to help to be the right

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.290 
outside to help to be the right
straighter<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:57.309> be<00:00:57.430> smoother<00:00:57.910> they've<00:00:58.090> even

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
straighter to be smoother they've even

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.000 
straighter to be smoother they've even
changed<00:00:58.449> things<00:00:58.989> like<00:00:59.289> the<00:00:59.410> mirrors<00:00:59.710> to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
changed things like the mirrors to

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.279 
changed things like the mirrors to
reduce<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.789> road<00:01:00.940> noise<00:01:01.120> just<00:01:01.809> because<00:01:02.140> it's

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
reduce the road noise just because it's

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:03.959 
reduce the road noise just because it's
a<00:01:02.379> smaller<00:01:02.649> vehicle<00:01:02.890> doesn't<00:01:03.489> mean<00:01:03.640> you<00:01:03.820> have

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
a smaller vehicle doesn't mean you have

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.480 
a smaller vehicle doesn't mean you have
to<00:01:04.000> compromise<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:05.379> storage<00:01:05.770> or<00:01:06.010> utility

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
to compromise the storage or utility

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.110 
to compromise the storage or utility
space<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.930> they've<00:01:08.080> added<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.470> few<00:01:08.620> things<00:01:09.120> that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
space so they've added a few things that

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.790 
space so they've added a few things that
are<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.270> little<00:01:10.360> bit<00:01:10.600> different<00:01:10.840> on<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.770> inside

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
are a little bit different on the inside

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.060 
are a little bit different on the inside
you<00:01:12.700> can<00:01:12.880> actually<00:01:13.060> fold<00:01:13.660> down<00:01:13.990> every<00:01:14.830> seat

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
you can actually fold down every seat

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:23.100 
you can actually fold down every seat
except<00:01:15.400> for<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.640> drivers<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:22.330> these<00:01:22.480> seats

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
except for the drivers so these seats

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.320 
except for the drivers so these seats
will<00:01:23.290> all<00:01:23.530> fold<00:01:23.860> flat<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:24.490> can<00:01:24.730> put<00:01:24.940> up<00:01:25.150> to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
will all fold flat so you can put up to

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.410 
will all fold flat so you can put up to

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.070 

how<00:01:53.520> did<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.729> couple<00:01:53.909> shelves<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.540> here<00:01:54.570> that'll

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
how did a couple shelves in here that'll

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.030 
how did a couple shelves in here that'll
actually<00:01:55.259> go<00:01:55.619> 18<00:01:56.159> different<00:01:56.430> ways<00:01:58.040> to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
actually go 18 different ways to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.310 
actually go 18 different ways to
maximize<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.759> storage<00:02:01.729> this<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.320> cargo

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
higher space here to place if you're

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.860 
higher space here to place if you're
moving<00:02:23.940> or<00:02:26.120> have<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> little<00:02:27.390> bit<00:02:27.480> more<00:02:27.630> space

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
moving or have a little bit more space

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.970 
moving or have a little bit more space
there<00:02:31.220> one<00:02:32.220> thing<00:02:32.400> you'll<00:02:32.580> notice<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:34.380> shape

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
there one thing you'll notice the shape

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.710 
there one thing you'll notice the shape
of<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:36.030> back<00:02:36.239> here

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
of the back here

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.650
