 here is a naughty present such their click 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.880
 on the shell

 management will take the states of america in 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.920
 once again proved that a couple more 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.670
 years ago we considered science fiction already 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.589
 reality 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.170
 the agent again, he revealed not all 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:40.690
 maps of the super secret department n.b. 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.300
 but they are enough to understand us 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.219
 follow email everywhere 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.589
 read skype conversation u intercept 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.539
 and write to separate servers you 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.639
 bought a muffin and coffee or you bought 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.920
 drugs and nuclear warhead for 

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:56.499
 secret services are equivalent purchases 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.749
 in the sense that they would like to know and 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:01.059
 about the first and about the second and already on 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.049
 Based on this, make a conclusion whether it is worth 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.230
 liquidate you 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:07.390
 or not they want to know everything and when about 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.250
 This people say that level again 2 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.320
 hardly call you crazy with a cap 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.530
 foil on the head becomes absolutely 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.700
 clearly we are all under the hood as a joke 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.560
 someone in our editorial office 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.070
 better advertising for watch dogs and not 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.070
 think up 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.360
 in the new game ubisoft we encounter in 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.890
 In general, with the same phenomenon that 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.689
 describes mister snowden 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.670
 to fight crime and 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.740
 terrorists in single chicago 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.390
 states hand over a system which 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.579
 allows you to simultaneously control 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.320
 thousands of video cameras and also worked 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.350
 ATM train lights 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.950
 electricity in general for all this system 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.289
 answers 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.500
 and that's when she gets into the wrong hands 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.509
 people then the veil begins that adam 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.340
 pirz the protagonist of the game just 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.770
 trying to fight a group of mates 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.899
 which decided that the law does not play 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.259
 no longer any role that only they can 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.869
 decide who and when to do mr 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.789
 pier this fundamentally disagree to get 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.739
 access city ​​management system he 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.470
 actively uses it for their own purposes 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.930
 The most important thing in watch dogs is ours. 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.299
 opportunities more precisely the possibilities of the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.100
 systems for example it can define 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.540
 who are ordinary citizens 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.610
 potential victim and who 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.470
 potential offender watching 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.819
 these people we see in real 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.099
 time as a percentage of probability 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.750
 committing a crime grows like 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.570
 only this percentage approaches the type 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.070
 sheet the crime happens we have 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.769
 choice to warn him 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.200
 or let's go past let's say we decided 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.500
 play a superhero card you are fresh 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.970
 a girl who is about to be attacked 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.340
 being installed by a potential killer he 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.880
 here it is to escape from the crime scene 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.769
 chase begins 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.709
 it looks like it is and honestly great 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.180
 the animation here is top notch and here 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.370
 the most crucial moment 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.980
 the enemy is running past the switchboard 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.930
 explode his mission accomplished we him 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.329
 caught problem in only one 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.130
 while he was chased by a number of stupid 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.590
 called the police and told about 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.359
 what we saw now we need to hide from 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.519
 cops that much more difficult 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.350
 to get the police out of sight 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.459
 cars lift at the right time 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.260
 would become barrage 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.760
 police cars crash into them at 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.829
 we have a few extra 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.350
 seconds but what to do and stop 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.209
 the streets are not yours 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.130
 pillars then have to act 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.050
 in the old proven way 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.330
 action games sometimes the police after all 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.860
 gets to us in this case 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.940
 the only effective way 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.460
 getting black out 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.440
 chop off electricity throughout the area and 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.370
 while the cop is trying to understand what 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.800
 it happened 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.630
 neutralize and now it's time to hide with 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.410
 crime scenes for that excellent 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.050
 fits 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.390
 the car is true and there will not be 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.820
 without contact with the police your car will 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.150
 chase to the last but options 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.650
 how to dump the tail we have enough 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.780
 you can use the familiar 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.300
 or sharply switch the traffic signal and 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.160
 provoke an accident and you can drive 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.410
 on a different bridge and lift it 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.810
 during the race you find yourself on another 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.000
 side then to your pursuers with 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.940
 on the nose further the matter of technology 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.620
 looking for a garage and changing the car but 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.260
 use the system we can not only 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.540
 in their own selfish or not very goals here 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.580
 for example, we need money in watch dogs 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.830
 for this you can hack a passerby account 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.960
 and get the money and the nearest ATM 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.030
 then shop at the store 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.250
 weapons and supplies be really 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.470
 are careful we are looking for the police then 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.300
 photos of the pier will appear in the news about 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.530
 canopy can easily click on the alarming 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.530
 button and publish you 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.110
 and sometimes with the help of this miracle system we 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.000
 We will need to help your friends to 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.500
 to the example of the crazy programmer for whose 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.720
 evil guys came to the soul 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.240
 we do not participate in a fight or 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.580
 something like with cameras we are watching 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.310
 for enemies and our friend and suggest 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.130
 where to go when to stop and when 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.080
 vice versa 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.120
 all these ways to divert the attention of friends 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.759
 excellent help and in our own 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.069
 battles if we need to go somewhere 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.110
 unnoticed then something is enough 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.570
 interest until the security guard and will 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.400
 understand what happened there we can 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.900
 sneak up on him from behind and get him out 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.900
 from the game an excellent plan 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.020
 as for multiplayer and 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.300
 cooperative mode is still difficult 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.040
 say something definite looks all 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.410
 so that we can share with others 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.660
 by or against players 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.940
 system to drive them into a corner looks 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.160
 interesting but it is too early to draw conclusions 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.840
 how it will be played in reality 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.460
 find out after the release 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.280
 Generally watch dogs we look forward to 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.830
 and not because new brand yubisoft 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.380
 rather because it really seems 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.020
 fresh new look at action from 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.870
 the third person whether our hopes will come true 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.590
 and who knows good luck and see you on
