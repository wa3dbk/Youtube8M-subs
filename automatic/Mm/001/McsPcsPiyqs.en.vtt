from what I saw from our users from play

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.360 
from what I saw from our users from play
on<00:00:32.850> my<00:00:32.969> server<00:00:33.210> they<00:00:34.050> didn't<00:00:34.410> know<00:00:34.920> how<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.100> fix

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.350 
likely if you if you know the issue is
when<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.860> start<00:00:41.160> your<00:00:41.340> proxy<00:00:41.910> when<00:00:42.270> you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
when you start your proxy when you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.119 
when you start your proxy when you
downloaded<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.930> new<00:00:42.960> proxy<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.770> started

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and then you press login it will

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.069 
and then you press login it will
actually<00:00:47.010> stop<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:48.000> login<00:00:48.450> screen<00:00:48.870> and
