00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.229 
better if you just kind of sweep it over
it<00:02:55.080> can<00:02:55.319> kind<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:55.709> fall<00:02:56.129> off<00:02:56.160> but<00:02:57.090> then

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
it can kind of just fall off but then

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.000 
it can kind of just fall off but then
I'm<00:02:57.420> sweeping<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.959> over<00:02:58.200> any<00:02:58.349> areas<00:02:58.799> that<00:02:58.830> I

bringing<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.170> contour<00:03:56.530> down<00:03:56.799> either<00:03:57.099> side<00:03:57.280> of

bringing the contour down either side of
my<00:03:57.849> nose<00:03:57.909> and<00:03:58.390> that<00:03:58.989> will<00:03:59.170> just<00:03:59.200> define<00:03:59.680> my

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
my nose and that will just define my

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.589 
my nose and that will just define my
nose<00:04:00.190> because<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:00.640> have<00:04:00.909> a<00:04:00.940> bit<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.180> like<00:04:01.420> a

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
nose because I have a bit of like a

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.660 
nose because I have a bit of like a
bulbous<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.349> on<00:04:02.830> my<00:04:02.980> nose<00:04:03.159> which<00:04:03.400> really

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
bulbous and on my nose which really

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.789 
bulbous and on my nose which really
irritates<00:04:04.120> me<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:04.989> I'm<00:04:05.290> just<00:04:05.470> bringing<00:04:05.590> it

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
irritates me so I'm just bringing it

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.550 
irritates me so I'm just bringing it
straight<00:04:05.860> down<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.700> round<00:04:07.660> at<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.080> bottom<00:04:08.410> to

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
straight down and round at the bottom to

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.199 
straight down and round at the bottom to
make<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.860> kind<00:04:08.980> of<00:04:09.099> look<00:04:09.280> a<00:04:09.310> bit<00:04:09.489> more<00:04:09.519> pointed

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209
