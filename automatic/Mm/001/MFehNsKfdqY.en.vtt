a<00:00:18.060> fire<00:00:18.750> spread<00:00:19.170> flammability<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:20.160> pretty

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
a fire spread flammability it's pretty

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.490 
a fire spread flammability it's pretty
much<00:00:20.460> how<00:00:20.699> likely<00:00:21.180> flammability<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.320> how

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
much how likely flammability is how

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.620 
much how likely flammability is how
likely<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> catch<00:00:23.340> fire<00:00:23.580> fire<00:00:24.300> spread

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
likely it is to catch fire fire spread

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.200 
likely it is to catch fire fire spread
is<00:00:24.750> how<00:00:24.840> fast<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.439> spreads<00:00:25.529> um<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.029> see

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
is how fast it spreads um you can see

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.609 
is how fast it spreads um you can see
you<00:00:27.420> know<00:00:27.539> some<00:00:27.810> blocks<00:00:27.990> don't<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.470> it

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
you know some blocks don't have it

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.679 
you know some blocks don't have it
because<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.670> know<00:00:29.789> there's<00:00:30.029> really<00:00:30.269> nothing

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
because you know there's really nothing

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.020 
because you know there's really nothing
to<00:00:30.720> them<00:00:31.050> they're<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.260> blocks<00:00:31.710> some<00:00:32.640> boxes

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
to them they're just blocks some boxes

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.690 
to them they're just blocks some boxes
like<00:00:33.120> wood<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.719> more<00:00:34.710> would<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.489> fire

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
like wood and more would have fire

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.970 
like wood and more would have fire
spread<00:00:35.969> flammability<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:37.170> maybe<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.620> seed

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
spread flammability like maybe like seed

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.860 
spread flammability like maybe like seed
like<00:00:38.160> wood<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.730> less<00:00:39.120> likely<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> catch<00:00:39.629> fire

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
like wood is less likely to catch fire

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.740 
like wood is less likely to catch fire
than<00:00:40.410> planks<00:00:40.980> yeah<00:00:41.640> i<00:00:41.670> never<00:00:41.910> knew<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.270> but

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
than planks yeah i never knew that but

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.500 
than planks yeah i never knew that but
now<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> know<00:00:43.399> leaves<00:00:44.399> are<00:00:44.730> highly<00:00:45.360> likely

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
now I know leaves are highly likely

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.860 
now I know leaves are highly likely
catch<00:00:45.870> fire<00:00:46.110> what<00:00:47.100> else<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.690> mmm<00:00:48.690> i

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
catch fire what else do we have mmm i

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.439 
catch fire what else do we have mmm i

chant ability durability damage harvest

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.429 
chant ability durability damage harvest
level<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.299> hardest<00:01:24.780> level<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.080> where<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.320> can

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
level so hardest level is where you can

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.810 
level so hardest level is where you can
mine<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> or<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.430> what<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> can

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820

mine with it or like what you can
harvest<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.479> damage<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:29.460> know<00:01:29.549> just

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
harvest with it damage is you know just

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.730 
harvest with it damage is you know just
to<00:01:29.850> damage<00:01:30.210> how<00:01:30.329> much<00:01:30.420> damage<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.810> does<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.259> I'm

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
to damage how much damage it does so I'm

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.219 
to damage how much damage it does so I'm
in<00:01:31.890> trouble<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.340> 3<00:01:32.640> damage<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.600> iron<00:01:33.900> sword

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
in trouble just 3 damage but iron sword

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.859 
in trouble just 3 damage but iron sword
do<00:01:34.500> six<00:01:34.829> damage<00:01:35.070> um<00:01:35.540> what<00:01:36.540> else<00:01:36.659> do<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.810> have

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
do six damage um what else do you have

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.289 
do six damage um what else do you have
in<00:01:36.990> chant<00:01:37.320> ability<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.790> higher<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
in chant ability that is the higher it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.630 
in chant ability that is the higher it
is<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.799> more<00:01:41.009> level<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
is the I think the more level is you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.060 
is the I think the more level is you
require<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.390> enchant<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> also<00:01:43.860> get

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
require to enchant it but you also get

can wolf eat it all that kind of stuff
saturation<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.959> really<00:02:13.200> nice<00:02:13.319> though

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
saturation is really nice though

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.339 
saturation is really nice though
because<00:02:13.879> for<00:02:14.390> example<00:02:15.940> where<00:02:16.940> is<00:02:17.150> some<00:02:18.110> rotten

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
because for example where is some rotten

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.460 
because for example where is some rotten
flesh<00:02:18.640> saturation<00:02:19.640> 2<00:02:19.790> point<00:02:20.060> 0<00:02:20.150> but<00:02:20.959> for

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
flesh saturation 2 point 0 but for

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.680 
flesh saturation 2 point 0 but for
example<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:22.069> chicken<00:02:22.819> will<00:02:23.000> be<00:02:23.030> three<00:02:23.360> point<00:02:23.599> 0

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
example a chicken will be three point 0

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.800 
example a chicken will be three point 0
so<00:02:23.959> it'll<00:02:24.500> you'll<00:02:24.920> be<00:02:25.069> fuller<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.849> if<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.720> is

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
so it'll you'll be fuller and if that is

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.449 
so it'll you'll be fuller and if that is
that<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:26.989> word<00:02:27.170> it'll<00:02:27.739> be<00:02:27.799> fuller<00:02:28.099> for<00:02:28.400> longer

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
that a word it'll be fuller for longer

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.729 
that a word it'll be fuller for longer
so<00:02:28.909> you<00:02:28.970> won't<00:02:29.180> need<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.390> eat<00:02:29.569> as<00:02:29.750> much<00:02:29.959> just
