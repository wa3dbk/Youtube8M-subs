is<00:00:18.720> full<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.320> patients<00:00:20.029> so<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.060> think<00:00:21.300> there's<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
is full of patients so I think there's a

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.480 
is full of patients so I think there's a
greater<00:00:21.750> demand<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.560> cancer<00:00:22.949> treatment<00:00:23.100> it's

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
greater demand for cancer treatment it's

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.609 
greater demand for cancer treatment it's
not<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:23.880> much<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.359> cancer<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.380> more
