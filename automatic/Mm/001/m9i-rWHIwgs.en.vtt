00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.810
 a new video here again 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.029
 a canal 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.810
 and it is today about the corsa ak 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.150
 50 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.330
 it will not be unboxing but a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.250
 small alternative video and I hope 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.810
 you like it anyway we are here 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.130
 First, the packaging and very 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.490
 many colors we can represent at 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.490
 the keyboard 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.250
 Here we already see the keyboard 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.930
 my table and I have to say 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.310
 you have the video of the k 70 already 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.160
 It really is a beautiful one 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.710
 high quality keyboard aluminum beautiful 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.190
 Feel 17 inches and feel too 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.230
 good at 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.340
 of course, you can see in the background now 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.690
 already the colors we choose 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.700
 These are the standard colors 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.489
 Of course we can do it all the way 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.450
 others so up to i believe 16 8 or 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.950
 7 million colors 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.420
 this results in the one you can select the 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.200
 different color combinations you can 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.239
 show here 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.010
 Of course you can do it too 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.960
 still on this single modis place the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.550
 you may see on the top left 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.000
 we'll go for that a bit later 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.259
 more accurate and so you can just 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.910
 activate different profiles 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.590
 for example, with different 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.840
 colors or functions here we see 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.820
 now these three macro buttons left her 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.229
 above we can activate and us 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.720
 then in the software itself 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.780
 what we just behind it yes 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.000
 want to have available and we have 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.470
 We now have this control system and that 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.830
 we have three levels that we select 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.000
 can or 4 with the stage from what 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.340
 Of course, the keyboard is not missing 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.020
 may is the loudly quiet function or 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.869
 this beautiful feature of corsa with 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.200
 this wheel and the courage button as well 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.789
 the whole play break and next as well 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.110
 back function for music or 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.110
 multimedia application 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.470
 All in all, the keyboard is real 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.570
 very very nice top processed and 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.220
 very high quality what me 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.110
 Personally do not like the buttons 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.850
 because I do not actually use them 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.850
 and that just left unnecessary blog left 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.649
 but it is okay yes then I hope so 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.420
 Please write a comment 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.620
