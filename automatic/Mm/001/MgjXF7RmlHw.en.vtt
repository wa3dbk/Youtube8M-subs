gets<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.650> fourth<00:03:59.160> down<00:03:59.340> conversion<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.910> the

gets the fourth down conversion on the
final<00:04:00.240> drive<00:04:00.420> but<00:04:01.020> I<00:04:01.050> think<00:04:01.230> they're<00:04:01.350> going<00:04:01.500> to

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
final drive but I think they're going to

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.720 
final drive but I think they're going to
be<00:04:01.620> their<00:04:01.890> mindset<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.310> going<00:04:02.460> to<00:04:02.520> be<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.610> little

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
be their mindset is going to be a little

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.370 
be their mindset is going to be a little
bit<00:04:02.910> better<00:04:03.000> than<00:04:03.180> BYU's<00:04:03.720> because<00:04:04.140> their

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
bit better than BYU's because their

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.200 
bit better than BYU's because their
schedules<00:04:04.800> been<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:04.980> little<00:04:05.160> tough<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:06.000> I

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
schedules been a little tough and I

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.910 
schedules been a little tough and I
think<00:04:06.600> there<00:04:06.810> they've<00:04:07.380> still<00:04:07.500> got<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.710> really

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
think there they've still got a really

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.699 
think there they've still got a really
good<00:04:08.010> shot<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:09.270> salvage<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.140> season<00:04:10.530> if<00:04:10.620> you

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
good shot to salvage this season if you

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.290 
good shot to salvage this season if you
even<00:04:10.860> want<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.130> call<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.310> salvage<00:04:11.850> at<00:04:11.970> Central

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
even want to call it salvage at Central

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.540 
even want to call it salvage at Central
Florida<00:04:12.660> no<00:04:12.840> offense<00:04:13.470> against<00:04:13.830> them<00:04:13.980> but<00:04:14.130> you

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
Florida no offense against them but you

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.980 
Florida no offense against them but you
know<00:04:14.640> eight<00:04:14.820> wins<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.300> a<00:04:15.330> possibility<00:04:15.780> for

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
know eight wins is a possibility for

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.270 
know eight wins is a possibility for
this<00:04:16.230> football<00:04:16.380> team<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.980> I<00:04:17.010> think<00:04:17.220> they're

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
this football team and I think they're

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.070 
this football team and I think they're
