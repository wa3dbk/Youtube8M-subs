00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.380
 hair makeup done before the move 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.330

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.310

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:51.380
 all this so it's good even the final 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:55.720
 but rather that this is his first for pleasure 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.720
 defining the results 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.260
 well I do not know me I think I'm going 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.640
 not give me my maximum 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.660
 I try to give the best of 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:11.600

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:19.750
 I passed the contest including Galicia and 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.100
 then here I am in the final so small 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.090
 little adventure to live on three days 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.360
 we went the selections will rather 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.580
 well 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.770
 it was not going to make them a go 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.020
 back for a challenge if we were 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.360
 selected for the photos we went to 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.060
 makeup and we were doing a little 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.000
 shooting so here it was a first 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.430
 not in the universe if I can say 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.970
 you find the places so frankly 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.069
 super super spacious it's been seen that 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:57.300
 it is but it remains simple in chorus 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:58.690
 it's not bad so when you pray sees 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.690
 the result 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.130
 so I do not see it doing it myself 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.200
 pronounce it's an adventure notice I 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.130
 know something interesting that can 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.200
 bring us a lot of things even 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.200
 humanly because we are really a 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:17.830
 good team that is not looking for 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:20.500
