00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.680 
say or if they're the actual names I
don't<00:01:22.550> think<00:01:22.760> they<00:01:22.850> will<00:01:23.000> be<00:01:23.180> there<00:01:23.300> a<00:01:23.330> bit<00:01:23.510> too

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
don't think they will be there a bit too

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.450 
don't think they will be there a bit too
simple<00:01:23.870> although<00:01:24.560> they<00:01:24.710> will<00:01:24.830> all<00:01:24.980> involve

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
simple although they will all involve

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.370 
simple although they will all involve
something<00:01:26.060> to<00:01:26.390> do<00:01:26.570> with<00:01:26.750> this<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.140> for<00:01:27.170> example

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
something to do with this so for example

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.710 
something to do with this so for example
police<00:01:28.250> obviously<00:01:28.820> that's<00:01:29.000> going<00:01:29.180> to<00:01:29.270> evolve

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
police obviously that's going to evolve

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.150 
police obviously that's going to evolve
something<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.260> do<00:01:30.350> with<00:01:30.440> police<00:01:30.740> retrieve

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
something to do with police retrieve

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.980 
something to do with police retrieve
something<00:01:31.730> to<00:01:31.970> do<00:01:32.090> with<00:01:32.270> retrieving<00:01:32.660> a

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
something to do with retrieving a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.450 
something to do with retrieving a
package<00:01:33.410> from<00:01:33.560> someone<00:01:33.950> or<00:01:34.040> something<00:01:34.370> like

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
package from someone or something like

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.650 
package from someone or something like
that<00:01:34.520> so<00:01:34.820> again<00:01:35.060> we've<00:01:35.390> got<00:01:35.540> the

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
that so again we've got the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.890 
that so again we've got the
assassination<00:01:36.380> mission<00:01:36.860> names<00:01:37.130> we<00:01:37.430> also<00:01:37.670> have

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
assassination mission names we also have

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.480 
assassination mission names we also have
information<00:01:38.900> about<00:01:39.020> each<00:01:39.410> mission<00:01:39.980> as<00:01:40.310> well

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
information about each mission as well

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.920 
information about each mission as well
so<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.760> police<00:01:40.910> assassination<00:01:41.570> mission<00:01:41.810> will

so the police assassination mission will
have<00:01:42.080> something<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.560> do<00:01:42.680> with<00:01:42.710> lawyers<00:01:43.280> and

public execution you can see below he's

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.770 
public execution you can see below he's
also<00:01:46.340> put<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.760> code<00:01:46.970> in<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:47.240> we've<00:01:47.360> got<00:01:47.510> Leah

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
also put the code in so we've got Leah

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.350 
also put the code in so we've got Leah
door<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.170> public<00:01:49.100> execution<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.120> it's<00:01:50.240> also

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
given us the trigger location of where

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.800 
given us the trigger location of where
we<00:01:52.340> have<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.610> go<00:01:52.760> to<00:01:52.820> actually<00:01:53.270> start<00:01:53.600> this

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810
