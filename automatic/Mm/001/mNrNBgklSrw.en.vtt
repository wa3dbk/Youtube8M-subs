00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
splash damage of course they do have a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.170 
splash damage of course they do have a
strong<00:00:19.170> air<00:00:19.439> attack<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:19.949> well<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.520> mainly

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
strong air attack as well but mainly

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.170 
strong air attack as well but mainly
that<00:00:21.570> huge<00:00:22.410> flash<00:00:22.800> damage<00:00:23.279> from<00:00:23.460> utilize<00:00:23.910> and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
that huge flash damage from utilize and

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.170 
that huge flash damage from utilize and
as<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.869> all<00:00:24.900> know<00:00:25.050> when<00:00:25.949> muta<00:00:26.279> lists<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.789> close

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
as we all know when muta lists get close

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.200 
as we all know when muta lists get close
together<00:00:27.769> when<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.859> click<00:00:29.039> anywhere<00:00:29.760> they

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
together when you click anywhere they

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.690 
together when you click anywhere they
kind<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:30.660> bunch<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.070> one<00:00:32.369> big

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
kind of just bunch up in this one big

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.120 
kind of just bunch up in this one big
pile<00:00:33.090> which<00:00:33.480> just<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.110> pretty<00:00:34.530> much<00:00:34.649> cannon

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
pile which just is pretty much cannon

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.049 
pile which just is pretty much cannon
fodder<00:00:35.309> for<00:00:35.520> any<00:00:35.940> type<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.690> Thor<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.550> basis

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
fodder for any type of Thor so the basis

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.020 
fodder for any type of Thor so the basis
of<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.570> strategy<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.489> don't<00:00:41.790> want

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
of this strategy is that you don't want

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.510 
of this strategy is that you don't want
these<00:00:42.149> mutants<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.660> clump<00:00:42.989> up<00:00:43.200> now<00:00:43.860> anytime

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
these mutants to clump up now anytime

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.700 
these mutants to clump up now anytime
you're<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> click<00:00:45.230> they<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
you're going to click they are going to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.860 
you're going to click they are going to
tend<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> clump<00:00:47.520> up<00:00:47.730> wherever<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.719> them

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
tend to clump up wherever you have them

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.360 
tend to clump up wherever you have them
especially<00:00:49.079> if<00:00:49.440> they're<00:00:49.590> attacking<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.219> that

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
especially if they're attacking at that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.279 
especially if they're attacking at that
spot<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.530> want<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:54.390> stop<00:00:55.020> this

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
spot so what you want to do to stop this

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.060 
spot so what you want to do to stop this
nullify<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:57.360> your<00:00:57.660> set<00:00:57.930> mu<00:00:58.289> list<00:00:58.559> in

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
nullify this is have your set mu list in

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.849 
nullify this is have your set mu list in
this<00:00:59.219> demonstration<00:00:59.489> that's<00:01:00.180> 18<00:01:00.570> US<00:01:01.020> vs<00:01:01.530> for

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
this demonstration that's 18 US vs for

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.840 
this demonstration that's 18 US vs for
Thor's<00:01:03.080> you<00:01:04.080> want<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.409> right-click<00:01:04.739> pass<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
Thor's you want to right-click pass the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.649 
Thor's you want to right-click pass the
Thor's<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.960> they<00:01:07.049> don't<00:01:07.290> clump<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.040> attack

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
Thor's so they don't clump up to attack

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.090 
Thor's so they don't clump up to attack
instead<00:01:09.659> they're<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.110> moving<00:01:10.320> directly<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
instead they're just moving directly to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.670 
instead they're just moving directly to
that<00:01:11.130> point<00:01:11.580> pass<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.479> floors<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.990> once<00:01:13.470> they

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
that point pass the floors and once they

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.859 
that point pass the floors and once they
get<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.040> top<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.610> forest<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.509> want<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.750> use

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
get on top of the forest you want to use

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.980 
get on top of the forest you want to use
a<00:01:15.900> stop<00:01:16.320> command<00:01:16.619> or<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:18.210> hold<00:01:18.479> position

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
a stop command or the hold position

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.170 
a stop command or the hold position
command<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.770> use<00:01:19.920> either<00:01:20.100> s<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.850> H

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
command so you can use either s or H

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.090 
command so you can use either s or H
right<00:01:22.080> when<00:01:22.259> they're<00:01:22.380> over<00:01:22.500> top<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
right when they're over top of the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.190 
right when they're over top of the
Thor's<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:23.970> will<00:01:24.150> stay<00:01:24.450> spread<00:01:24.750> out<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
Thor's they will stay spread out and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.109 
Thor's they will stay spread out and
don't<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.590> clumped<00:01:25.979> up<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> floors

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
don't get clumped up so the floors

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.200 
don't get clumped up so the floors
splash<00:01:27.600> damage<00:01:27.869> will<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.290> nullified<00:01:29.210> now

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
splash damage will be nullified now

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.740 
splash damage will be nullified now
let's<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.350> go<00:01:31.560> ahead<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.770> give<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.369> shot

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
let's just go ahead and give this a shot

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.240 
let's just go ahead and give this a shot
what<00:01:33.750> I'm<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.229> take<00:01:34.680> my<00:01:34.829> group<00:01:35.130> of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
what I'm going to do take my group of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.539 
what I'm going to do take my group of
ulus<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.530> right<00:01:37.950> click<00:01:38.220> past

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
ulus and then just right click past

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.550 
ulus and then just right click past
Thor's<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.780> going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.960> use<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.290> stop

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
Thor's and I'm going to use the stop

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.679 
Thor's and I'm going to use the stop
command<00:01:40.979> when<00:01:41.490> they're<00:01:41.670> directly<00:01:42.090> over<00:01:42.420> top

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
command when they're directly over top

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.600 
command when they're directly over top
of<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.020> Thor's<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.890> let's<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.399> see<00:01:44.520> how

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
of the Thor's and let's just see how

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.569 
of the Thor's and let's just see how
this<00:01:44.790> works<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.329> again<00:01:45.750> 18<00:01:46.229> muta<00:01:47.009> lyst<00:01:47.189> vs.

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
this works and again 18 muta lyst vs.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.020 
this works and again 18 muta lyst vs.
for<00:01:47.850> Thor's<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.780> go

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.230 

and<00:01:56.290> if<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:57.440> look<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:58.010> did<00:01:58.280> hit<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.670> stop<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:59.120> me

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
and if you look I did hit the stop to me

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.740 
and if you look I did hit the stop to me
a<00:01:59.720> little<00:02:00.170> bit<00:02:00.350> past<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:01.130> muta<00:02:02.060> lists<00:02:02.240> tend<00:02:02.479> to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
a little bit past the muta lists tend to

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.859 
a little bit past the muta lists tend to
slide<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.710> extra<00:02:04.220> inch<00:02:04.510> but<00:02:05.510> I<00:02:05.540> don't<00:02:05.750> think

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
slide that extra inch but I don't think

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.930 
slide that extra inch but I don't think
it's<00:02:06.050> going<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.200> be<00:02:06.290> too<00:02:06.650> too<00:02:07.550> much<00:02:07.759> of<00:02:07.880> a

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
it's going to be too too much of a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.359 
it's going to be too too much of a
difference<00:02:08.330> just<00:02:08.660> for<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:08.929> demonstration

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
difference just for this demonstration

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.630 
difference just for this demonstration
so<00:02:10.369> as<00:02:10.490> you<00:02:10.640> see<00:02:10.910> we<00:02:11.180> have<00:02:11.420> 11<00:02:12.260> muta<00:02:12.680> lisk<00:02:13.130> left

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
so as you see we have 11 muta lisk left

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.810 
so as you see we have 11 muta lisk left
and<00:02:13.940> pretty<00:02:14.900> much<00:02:14.959> only<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.740> is<00:02:16.070> damaged<00:02:16.610> so

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
and pretty much only one is damaged so

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.890 
and pretty much only one is damaged so
we<00:02:16.940> have<00:02:17.120> 11<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.470> only<00:02:18.830> one<00:02:19.070> is<00:02:19.100> damaged<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.060> do

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
we have 11 and only one is damaged I do

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.630 
we have 11 and only one is damaged I do
have<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.260> same<00:02:21.500> scenario<00:02:22.190> I'm<00:02:22.280> just<00:02:22.489> going<00:02:22.610> to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
have the same scenario I'm just going to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.340 
have the same scenario I'm just going to
move<00:02:22.819> these<00:02:23.000> up<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.239> little<00:02:23.360> bit<00:02:23.690> just<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.170> case

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
move these up a little bit just in case

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.729 
move these up a little bit just in case
I<00:02:24.530> decide<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:24.950> attack<00:02:25.600> let's<00:02:26.600> see<00:02:26.870> here<00:02:27.260> now<00:02:27.709> I

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
I decide to attack let's see here now I

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.810 
I decide to attack let's see here now I
have<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.310> 18<00:02:28.730> verses<00:02:29.269> three<00:02:29.870> pores<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:31.190> what

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
have the 18 verses three pores and what

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.490 
have the 18 verses three pores and what
I'm<00:02:31.910> going<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.060> do<00:02:32.269> is<00:02:32.480> just<00:02:32.510> use<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.170> attack

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
I'm going to do is just use the attack

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.490 
I'm going to do is just use the attack
come<00:02:34.040> in<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.550> as<00:02:35.120> you'll<00:02:35.390> notice<00:02:35.660> once<00:02:36.290> they

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
come in and as you'll notice once they

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.680 
come in and as you'll notice once they
start<00:02:36.800> attacking<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.850> will<00:02:37.970> all<00:02:38.060> clump<00:02:38.390> up<00:02:38.570> in

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
start attacking it will all clump up in

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.360 
start attacking it will all clump up in
a<00:02:38.780> line<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.050> this<00:02:39.470> will<00:02:39.650> be<00:02:39.739> great<00:02:39.980> for<00:02:40.100> the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
a line and this will be great for the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.750 
a line and this will be great for the
force<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.940> just<00:02:40.970> get<00:02:41.330> off<00:02:41.480> some<00:02:42.050> easy<00:02:42.640> area<00:02:43.640> of

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
force to just get off some easy area of

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.420 
force to just get off some easy area of
effect<00:02:43.880> Splash<00:02:44.540> Damage<00:02:44.570> attacks<00:02:45.350> all<00:02:46.130> right

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
effect Splash Damage attacks all right

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.000 
effect Splash Damage attacks all right
here<00:02:46.640> we<00:02:46.700> go<00:02:49.989> All<00:02:50.989> Right<00:02:51.019> see<00:02:51.140> how<00:02:51.560> they<00:02:51.800> just

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
here we go All Right see how they just

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.220 
here we go All Right see how they just
kind<00:02:52.550> of<00:02:52.610> just<00:02:52.760> clump<00:02:53.330> up<00:02:53.480> right<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:53.870> front<00:02:53.989> of

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
kind of just clump up right in front of

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.110 
kind of just clump up right in front of
the<00:02:54.350> floors<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:55.310> floors<00:02:55.519> are<00:02:55.700> just<00:02:55.910> having

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
the floors the floors are just having

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.670 
the floors the floors are just having
their<00:02:56.390> way

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.520 

muta<00:03:01.680> lyst<00:03:01.970> coming<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.090> here

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
muta lyst coming in here

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.820 
muta lyst coming in here
even<00:03:05.530> going<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.709> be<00:03:05.800> able<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:06.010> take<00:03:06.190> this<00:03:06.310> out

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
even going to be able to take this out

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.670 
even going to be able to take this out
interesting

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
interesting

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.459 
interesting
now<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.159> looks<00:03:10.280> like<00:03:10.719> these<00:03:11.719> stores<00:03:12.290> are

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:12.469 
now it looks like these stores are

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:14.740 
now it looks like these stores are
actually<00:03:12.859> going<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.069> clean<00:03:13.250> up<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.430> new<00:03:13.700> list<00:03:13.969> so

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
actually going to clean up a new list so

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.309 
actually going to clean up a new list so
that's<00:03:15.319> a<00:03:15.439> pretty<00:03:15.859> big<00:03:16.719> significant<00:03:17.719> loss<00:03:17.900> so

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
that's a pretty big significant loss so

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.349 
that's a pretty big significant loss so
as<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:19.040> can<00:03:19.129> see<00:03:19.310> down<00:03:19.519> here<00:03:19.819> there's<00:03:20.090> two

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
as you can see down here there's two

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.709 
as you can see down here there's two
floors<00:03:20.719> left<00:03:21.159> whereas<00:03:22.159> up<00:03:22.340> here<00:03:22.370> we<00:03:22.909> have<00:03:23.120> 11

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:23.719 
floors left whereas up here we have 11

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.860 
floors left whereas up here we have 11
us<00:03:24.290> left<00:03:24.620> now<00:03:24.890> this<00:03:25.489> mainly<00:03:26.000> works<00:03:26.269> only<00:03:26.569> in

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
us left now this mainly works only in

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.679 
us left now this mainly works only in
big<00:03:27.049> numbers<00:03:27.459> if<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.639> is<00:03:28.790> small<00:03:29.090> numbers<00:03:29.480> it's

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
big numbers if it is small numbers it's

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.170 
big numbers if it is small numbers it's
not<00:03:29.840> going<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.049> be<00:03:30.139> as<00:03:30.319> effective<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.760> again

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
not going to be as effective and again

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.110 
not going to be as effective and again
it's<00:03:32.389> known<00:03:32.629> as<00:03:32.659> the<00:03:32.840> magic<00:03:33.349> box<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:34.189> didn't

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
it's known as the magic box I didn't

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.780 
it's known as the magic box I didn't
invent<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.719> I<00:03:35.930> just<00:03:36.349> tried<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.920> demonstrate<00:03:37.250> it

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
invent it I just tried to demonstrate it

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.609 
invent it I just tried to demonstrate it
for<00:03:37.939> my<00:03:38.090> youtube<00:03:38.980> viewers<00:03:39.980> thanks<00:03:40.430> guys
