00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.599
 come back from macho words 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.389
 go back to the sanchez to the commentator in the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.299
 American chain univision in the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.240
 mexico match against chile has done 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.359
 a statement verbatim that says 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.189
 venezuela before played white then 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.650
 of receiving both stick came out 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.810
 bloody and that's why your path is 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.150
 Vinotinto only declared yesterday in the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.390
 match between chile and mexico in the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.910
 American chain and basically what 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.280
 who said summarizing a sentence has been 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.260
 always half believe in what he said 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.719
 says Venezuelan players prefer 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.390
 Play for Spain or Portugal or crazy 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.129
 they play in venezuela is perhaps a lie 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.200
 that historically Venezuelans have 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.990
 been mediocre 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.490
 yet the words are very credible 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.770
 This man always talks about that 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.810
 way you can not just share your 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.940
 opinion I do not personally do not think it's 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.520
 that way those who are mediocre or 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.530
 they do not cross super high day 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.850
 to tie Brazil if you see the payroll 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.850
 from Brazil in dollars 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.810
 these statements 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:33.540
 these statements really is 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:37.470
 saying that mexico venezuela and everything 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:45.720
 what he says is a recurring theme he wants 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:47.340
 appear that image on the court when 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.600
 already retired from the court he started talking 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.270
 with the mouthpiece of the problem they were 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.020
 problems 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:57.039
 when you put a microphone you lose the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.229
 reason yes yes for many particular friend 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.420
 that says I mean a 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.670
 man who has triumphed to in fact what 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.289
 what has Mr. lord done we can 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.689
 or not agree or will have or not 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.879
 reason in some or many things but that 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.879
 many things he says and he's right 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.750
 that difference and everything is right and 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.750
 everything is against for my player 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.360
 technical and how is it now sanchez water 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.370
 and as law of the last years I believe 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.010
 that one continues to live in two would have 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.720
 to moderate their words a bit 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.079
 better because right now he's living the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.819
 best of the titles lives from a 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.319
 bicampeonato even more the only one that has 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.840
 managed to beat Real Madrid in 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.340
 the santiago bernabÃ©u beat the pachuca 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.200
 in a champion cup is to win four 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.790
 titles in a year that's what he did 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.940
 hugo sanchez that someone outside has 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.940
 fact
