00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
top to down on a beret on the tenth fret

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:20.310 
top to down on a beret on the tenth fret
so<00:01:58.960> II<00:01:59.140> B&amp;G<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:09.220> very<00:02:09.460> important<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:09.970> you

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.980 

that's<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:22.150> pull<00:02:23.150> offs<00:02:23.330> from<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.690> third

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
that's just a pull offs from the third

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:38.410 
that's just a pull offs from the third
second<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.590> 0<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:25.160> all<00:02:25.310> strings<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:28.270> go<00:02:37.420> and

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
second and 0 on all strings and go and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.200 
second and 0 on all strings and go and
as<00:02:39.380> again<00:02:39.860> important<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.520> mute<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.790> strings

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
as again important to mute the strings

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.790 
as again important to mute the strings
over<00:02:41.450> there<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.110> tend<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.470> give<00:02:42.620> this

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
over there I tend to give this

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:58.240 
over there I tend to give this
percussive<00:02:43.430> feel

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.320 

so<00:02:59.250> sliding<00:03:00.150> up<00:03:00.270> on<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.540> fifth<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.080> a.m

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
so sliding up on the fifth of the a.m

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.550 
so sliding up on the fifth of the a.m
create<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:04.280> over<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.430> index<00:03:05.640> finger<00:03:06.560> then

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
create and over the index finger then

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.810 
create and over the index finger then
you<00:03:07.680> fret<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.520> tens<00:03:09.000> from<00:03:09.510> here<00:03:10.580> slide<00:03:11.580> that

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
you fret the tens from here slide that

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:28.340 
you fret the tens from here slide that
up<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.270> troll<00:03:24.770> so<00:03:25.770> it's<00:03:26.510> 1050<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.810> tell

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
up to the troll so it's 1050 I tell

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.990 
up to the troll so it's 1050 I tell
cheap<00:03:28.830> ah<00:03:29.360> then<00:03:30.360> it's<00:03:30.510> 12<00:03:31.170> 10<00:03:31.530> 12<00:03:32.600> on<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.630> d<00:03:35.000> 10

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
cheap ah then it's 12 10 12 on the d 10

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.210 
cheap ah then it's 12 10 12 on the d 10
12<00:03:36.360> on<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.810> cheek<00:03:41.210> and<00:03:42.210> then<00:03:42.360> it's<00:03:42.540> time<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.780> be

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
12 on the cheek and then it's time to be

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.220 
12 on the cheek and then it's time to be
and<00:03:44.220> then<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.850> bend<00:03:45.090> up<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.450> 13<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.020> beach

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
and then you bend up the 13 of the beach

00:03:48.230 --> 00:04:09.110 
and then you bend up the 13 of the beach
so<00:03:49.230> just<00:03:49.680> slowly

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.120 

mm-hmm
