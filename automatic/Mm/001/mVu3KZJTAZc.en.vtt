00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
of the Year link up do you know the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.740 
of the Year link up do you know the
hybrids<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.670> could<00:01:35.880> make<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.390> did<00:01:36.600> that

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
hybrids we could make if they did that

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.240 
hybrids we could make if they did that
and<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.930> think<00:01:37.200> honestly<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.680> should<00:01:37.950> do<00:01:38.100> it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and I think honestly they should do it

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.080 
and I think honestly they should do it
because<00:01:38.579> they<00:01:38.909> are<00:01:39.119> considered<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.110> team

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
because they are considered a team

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.060 
because they are considered a team

it's not when I got hacked I lost one of
them<00:04:01.900> because<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.260> removed<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.740> account<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.220> I

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
them because I removed the account and I

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.530 
them because I removed the account and I
just<00:04:03.400> didn't<00:04:03.580> play<00:04:03.700> on<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:03.970> no<00:04:04.030> more<00:04:04.210> because<00:04:04.270> I

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
just didn't play on it no more because I

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.060 
just didn't play on it no more because I
couldn't<00:04:04.780> get<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.020> count<00:04:05.230> back<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:05.710> all

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
couldn't get the count back and all

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.350 
couldn't get the count back and all
right<00:04:06.280> sucked<00:04:06.730> yell<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.060> then<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.240> have

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
right sucked yell and then I have

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.880 
right sucked yell and then I have
another<00:04:07.390> one<00:04:07.900> but<00:04:08.110> then<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.350> started<00:04:08.620> thinking

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
another one but then I started thinking

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.590 
another one but then I started thinking
you<00:04:08.950> know<00:04:09.010> maybe<00:04:09.190> we<00:04:09.340> should<00:04:09.490> wait<00:04:09.850> until<00:04:10.330> the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
you know maybe we should wait until the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.720 
you know maybe we should wait until the
transfer<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.709> transfer<00:04:12.100> updates<00:04:12.490> when<00:04:12.640> they

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
transfer the transfer updates when they

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.430 
transfer the transfer updates when they
do<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.940> January<00:04:13.360> updates<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.930> then<00:04:14.020> we<00:04:14.290> can

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
do the January updates and then we can

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.530 
do the January updates and then we can
start<00:04:14.770> a<00:04:14.860> new<00:04:15.040> career<00:04:15.250> mode<00:04:15.640> so<00:04:16.060> I'm<00:04:16.299> there's<00:04:16.510> a

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
start a new career mode so I'm there's a

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.610 
start a new career mode so I'm there's a
lot<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.720> things<00:04:16.870> going<00:04:17.200> through<00:04:17.230> my<00:04:17.350> head<00:04:17.410> but

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
lot of things going through my head but

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.750 
lot of things going through my head but
it's<00:04:17.739> not<00:04:17.859> that<00:04:17.980> I<00:04:18.040> build<00:04:18.280> my<00:04:18.400> career<00:04:18.549> much

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
it's not that I build my career much

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.830 
it's not that I build my career much
that<00:04:18.910> I<00:04:18.940> lost<00:04:19.090> one<00:04:19.359> of<00:04:19.420> the<00:04:19.510> accounts<00:04:19.630> from

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
that I lost one of the accounts from

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.330 
that I lost one of the accounts from
getting<00:04:20.079> hacked<00:04:20.200> I<00:04:20.410> still<00:04:20.799> have<00:04:20.950> one<00:04:20.980> if<00:04:21.250> I

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
getting hacked I still have one if I

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.610 
getting hacked I still have one if I
think<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.609> lost<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.970> AC<00:04:22.180> Milan<00:04:22.630> one<00:04:22.870> maybe<00:04:23.560> I

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
think I lost the AC Milan one maybe I

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.200 
think I lost the AC Milan one maybe I
don't<00:04:24.010> know<00:04:24.070> what<00:04:24.190> you<00:04:24.250> are<00:04:24.310> lost<00:04:24.520> my<00:04:24.610> lost<00:04:24.940> one

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
don't know what you are lost my lost one

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.000 
don't know what you are lost my lost one
of<00:04:25.300> them<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.200> have<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.530> other<00:04:26.560> one<00:04:26.830> but<00:04:26.950> I

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
of them and I have the other one but I

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
of them and I have the other one but I
was<00:04:27.130> thinking<00:04:27.370> maybe<00:04:27.460> we<00:04:27.580> should<00:04:27.760> just<00:04:27.790> wait

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
was thinking maybe we should just wait

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.730 
was thinking maybe we should just wait
and<00:04:28.210> start<00:04:28.480> when<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.720> January<00:04:29.169> thing<00:04:29.410> happens

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
and start when the January thing happens

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.230 
and start when the January thing happens
but<00:04:29.860> either<00:04:30.190> way<00:04:30.490> y'all<00:04:30.700> haven't<00:04:30.970> really<00:04:31.120> made

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
but either way y'all haven't really made

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.060 
but either way y'all haven't really made
the<00:04:31.390> decision<00:04:31.840> when<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.290> updates<00:04:32.710> happen

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
the decision when the updates happen

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.380 
the decision when the updates happen
maybe<00:04:33.250> I'll<00:04:33.430> start<00:04:33.669> a<00:04:33.760> career<00:04:33.910> mode<00:04:34.150> again<00:04:34.240> but

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
maybe I'll start a career mode again but

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.090 
maybe I'll start a career mode again but
