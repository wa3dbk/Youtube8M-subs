00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
far behind but I think I would get there

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.920 
far behind but I think I would get there
and<00:00:54.470> all<00:00:55.470> these<00:00:55.680> stop<00:00:56.010> raves<00:00:56.339> and<00:00:56.699> your<00:00:56.970> that's

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and all these stop raves and your that's

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689 
and all these stop raves and your that's
kind<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.260> my<00:00:58.409> goal<00:00:58.589> I<00:00:58.619> got<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.189> just<00:00:59.280> want<00:00:59.610> to

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
same or with even more effort to get

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.580

go<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.770> worlds<00:01:37.280> we<00:01:37.490> have<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.149> prove<00:01:38.750> ourselves

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
go to worlds we have to prove ourselves

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.499 
at Worlds
and<00:01:40.479> I<00:01:41.479> think<00:01:41.960> afterwards<00:01:42.409> everyone<00:01:43.509> will

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
and I think afterwards everyone will

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.800 
and I think afterwards everyone will
just<00:01:44.659> eventually<00:01:44.929> respect<00:01:45.740> us<00:01:45.920> as<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.550> team<00:01:46.880> I

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.779 

think<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:51.110> got<00:01:51.440> lists<00:01:51.710> of<00:01:51.830> what<00:01:52.250> has<00:01:52.369> happened

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
think we got lists of what has happened

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.510 
think we got lists of what has happened
in<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.060> past<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.539> last<00:01:54.140> split<00:01:54.440> and<00:01:54.710> whatever

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
in the past and last split and whatever

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.290 
in the past and last split and whatever
people<00:01:55.940> say<00:01:56.390> I<00:01:56.690> think<00:01:57.410> in<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.100> end<00:01:58.300> everything

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
people say I think in the end everything

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
people say I think in the end everything
that<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.810> comes<00:02:00.020> down<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.289> is<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.830> results
