packet<00:02:14.410> from<00:02:14.770> on<00:02:15.310> how<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.210> this<00:02:16.510> goes<00:02:17.500> with

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
packet from on how to and this goes with

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.030 
packet from on how to and this goes with
Frederick<00:02:18.310> method<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:20.290> guess<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:20.980> a

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
Frederick method and I guess this is a

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.590 
Frederick method and I guess this is a
different<00:02:21.370> type<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.580> being<00:02:22.090> trained<00:02:22.300> day<00:02:22.420> by

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600
