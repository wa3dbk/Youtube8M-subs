00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.690
 Hello everyone and welcome the new video 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.910
 of the site of the testing today of what 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.150
 we're going to talk today we'll go to 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.150
 illustrate how a graft is inserted 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.840
 lemon because a lemon has a technique 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.030
 of graft a little particular and it is not 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.450
 very inclined to be headed with 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.850
 all kinds of grafts then the 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.870
 preferable period to perform the nose 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.879
 of lemon like all citrus fruits part 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.160
 from the beginnings from April to the beginning 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.530
 April and is performed with a graft or to 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.900
 vegetating bud or with grafting a 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.930
 crown now we're going to see how 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:01.730
 proceed in this case we must 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.500
 graft a lemon we are forced to 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.110
 capitulate our goalkeeper was 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:11.030
 about this height we will go to 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:19.990
 take a crown graft we take 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:19.990
 our secret is we are understood 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.140
 our rootstock at this height 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:49.460
 we are simply there to final cut 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:51.909
 on the graft port we raise slightly 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.909
 the bark 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.539
 and insert with the other vice of 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.539
 tangerine 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.630
 also this substance perfectly 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.630
 take the duct tape 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.060
 we apply a little bit of putty just a 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.750
 little close to the mans because then you will see 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:22.340
 that we need to do a little more technique 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:29.990
 particular for the lemon as for the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:32.590
 olive trees we close only close 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.590
 to the marches 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.600
 and above 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.790
 the particular thing in the triggering of the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:55.120
 citrus and that on the graft once 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.860
 covered with putty and we are tied 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.489
 we have to insert a bag of 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:06.410
 compound plastic for them as well 4 with 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:12.800
 with the bags of fertilizers we must 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:15.130
 put this bag we have 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.130
 forced 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.970
 this bag know how to protect 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:46.170
 grafting and now we're going to insert them 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.170
 insert yourself into the sandbag 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.700
 sure of the common red sand that goes 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.800
 to cover about half of ours 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.800
 moved from the length of our March 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:15.030
 this is to keep a video off 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.030
 to benefit the graft 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.659
 very well the graft is concluded came 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:41.149
 we have seen how the graft is performed 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:43.849
 for citrus fruits for lemons for 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:48.399
 orange trees we remember that the suitable period 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:51.289
 and goes from the beginnings from April to May 

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:54.339
 six centuries in it a vegetative crown 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:58.729
 and the gems and the scions must be 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:59.930
 taken on average adult citrus fruits 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.169
 why 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:06.530
 only in those plants we find the scions 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:09.080
 read me suitable for the graft we remember 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.750
 that we have created this new channel 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.850
 because we had technical problems 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.560
 problems with technical problems with the 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.710
 old so sign up for this 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.750
 because that is the old in the world of moles 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.539
 coming days will be eliminated 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.669
 nothing welcome in this video thanks 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.669
 in the vision, see you soon
