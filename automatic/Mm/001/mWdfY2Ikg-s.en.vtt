00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
shoot the other one on the floor and now

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.229 
shoot the other one on the floor and now
you<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.130> pass<00:00:32.279> up<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.610> get<00:00:32.700> over<00:00:32.730> there<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.120> do

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
you can pass up and get over there I do

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.840 
you can pass up and get over there I do
not<00:00:33.719> think<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.350> guys<00:00:34.530> understand<00:00:35.280> how<00:00:35.579> many

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
not think you guys understand how many

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.950 
not think you guys understand how many
takes<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.480> took<00:00:36.809> how<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.800> honestly<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.960> most

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
takes that took how is honestly the most

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.930 
takes that took how is honestly the most
retarded<00:00:40.340> commentating<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.610> ever<00:00:41.820> done

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
retarded commentating I have ever done

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.150 
retarded commentating I have ever done
now<00:00:42.360> we'll<00:00:42.540> go<00:00:42.809> over<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.170> again<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.710> slow

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
now we'll go over this again in slow

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
now we'll go over this again in slow
motion<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.760> because<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.239> chamber<00:00:45.899> is

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
motion just because this chamber is

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.799 
motion just because this chamber is
retarded<00:00:46.379> okay<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.940> basically<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.750> start

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
retarded okay so basically you start

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.840 
retarded okay so basically you start
this<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.410> off<00:00:49.440> by<00:00:49.739> shooting<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.250> portal<00:00:50.640> into

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
this one off by shooting a portal into

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.150 
this one off by shooting a portal into
the<00:00:51.059> other<00:00:51.510> room<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:52.110> fast<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the other room as fast as you can and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.400 
the other room as fast as you can and
then<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.969> shoot<00:00:54.149> another<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> floor

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
then you shoot another one on the floor

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.010 
then you shoot another one on the floor
and<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:56.940> pass<00:00:57.120> through<00:00:57.360> quickly<00:00:57.840> as

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and so you can pass through quickly as

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.959 
and so you can pass through quickly as
possible<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.649> they<00:00:58.770> shoot<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.670> left

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
possible and they shoot one on the left

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.479 
possible and they shoot one on the left
side<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.600> sir<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.829> pass<00:01:02.190> back

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
side of that sir and then you pass back

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.640 
side of that sir and then you pass back
through<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.750> shoot<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.170> blue<00:01:04.379> one

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
through like that you shoot the blue one

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.109 
through like that you shoot the blue one
on<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> floor<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:05.939> some

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
on the floor so you can get some

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
on the floor so you can get some
momentum<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.960> lot<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.380> momentum<00:01:07.619> actually

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
momentum a lot of momentum actually

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.280 
momentum a lot of momentum actually
passing<00:01:08.970> through<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.600> accelerate

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
passing through and then you accelerate

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.620 
passing through and then you accelerate
forward<00:01:10.590> hop<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.760> could<00:01:11.880> probably<00:01:12.030> find<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
forward hop you could probably find a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260 
forward hop you could probably find a
tutorial<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.290> youtube<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.040> somewhere<00:01:14.280> you

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
tutorial on youtube for it somewhere you

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.539 
tutorial on youtube for it somewhere you
shoot<00:01:15.540> an<00:01:15.720> exit<00:01:16.350> blue<00:01:16.590> portal<00:01:17.009> there<00:01:17.340> an

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
shoot an exit blue portal there an

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.760 
shoot an exit blue portal there an
entrance<00:01:17.939> orange<00:01:18.750> portal<00:01:19.080> there<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.590> can

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
entrance orange portal there so you can

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.260 
entrance orange portal there so you can
get<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.920> ball<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.369> pass<00:01:20.549> through<00:01:20.790> over<00:01:21.030> here

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
get the ball to pass through over here

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.999 
get the ball to pass through over here
and<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.780> want<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.049> stick<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> wall<00:01:22.799> as

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and you want to stick to the wall as

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.460 
and you want to stick to the wall as
fast<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.580> far<00:01:23.759> as<00:01:23.939> much<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:24.360> possible<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.049> you

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
fast as far as much as possible and you

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.080 
fast as far as much as possible and you
shoot<00:01:25.650> one<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> ceiling<00:01:26.400> first<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.000> then

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
shoot one on the ceiling first and then

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.760 
shoot one on the ceiling first and then
you<00:01:27.119> could<00:01:27.390> gauge<00:01:27.930> where<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> ball<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.619> going

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you could gauge where the ball is going

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.740 
you could gauge where the ball is going
to<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.310> shoot<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> second<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.630> then

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
to be and shoot the second one and then

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.719 
to be and shoot the second one and then
it<00:01:30.900> passes<00:01:31.079> through<00:01:31.290> both<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.860> them<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.579> can

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it passes through both of them you can

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.030 
it passes through both of them you can
shoot<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.210> portal<00:01:33.570> through<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.439> crack<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
shoot a portal through that crack and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
shoot a portal through that crack and
one<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.520> floor<00:01:35.850> again<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:36.840> you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
one on the floor again and then you

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.319 
one on the floor again and then you
shoot<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> ceiling<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:38.970> when

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
shoot one on the ceiling so that when

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.399 
shoot one on the ceiling so that when
you<00:01:39.420> pass<00:01:39.600> through<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.140> your<00:01:40.259> left

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you pass through the one on your left

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.539 
you pass through the one on your left
you<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.650> some<00:01:40.890> momentum<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:41.400> you're

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
you have some momentum when you're

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.580 
you have some momentum when you're
falling<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.630> want<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> shoot<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.170> orange

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
falling and you want to shoot the orange

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.950 
falling and you want to shoot the orange
one<00:01:43.829> while<00:01:44.100> you're<00:01:44.250> passing<00:01:44.729> through<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.210> over

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
one while you're passing through it over

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.749 
one while you're passing through it over
there<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> portals<00:01:47.220> over<00:01:47.430> there<00:01:47.579> but

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
there so that the portals over there but

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.130 
there so that the portals over there but
you're<00:01:47.909> still<00:01:48.149> passing<00:01:48.600> through<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.899> getting

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
you're still passing through and getting

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.359 
you're still passing through and getting
the<00:01:49.229> momentum<00:01:49.740> from<00:01:49.860> falling<00:01:50.189> through<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the momentum from falling through the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.370 
the momentum from falling through the
blue<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> ceiling<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.450> pat<00:01:52.110> shoot

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
blue one on the ceiling you pat shoot

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.780 
blue one on the ceiling you pat shoot
the<00:01:52.500> blue<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.890> again<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.610> pass

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the blue one again so you can pass

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.520 
the blue one again so you can pass
through<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> one<00:01:54.329> right<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.720> front<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
through the one right in front of the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.039 
through the one right in front of the
the<00:01:56.399> wall<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.570> pass<00:01:57.780> through

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
the wall like this so you pass through

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.780 
the wall like this so you pass through
and<00:01:58.290> then<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.500> shoot<00:01:58.740> another<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.369> against

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
and then you shoot another one against

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.480 
and then you shoot another one against
the<00:01:59.850> wall<00:02:00.119> over<00:02:00.360> there<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.250> pass

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the wall over there and you you pass

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.429 
the wall over there and you you pass
through<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.969> shoot<00:02:03.210> another<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
through you shoot another one here and

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.929 
through you shoot another one here and
then<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.159> portal<00:02:05.640> stand

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
then what you do is you portal stand

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.559 
then what you do is you portal stand
here<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:08.039> do<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.429> pretty<00:02:09.330> much

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
here and you just do this pretty much

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.809 
here and you just do this pretty much
through<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.530> one<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.099> then<00:02:11.370> through<00:02:11.670> this

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
through this one and then through this

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.770 
through this one and then through this
one<00:02:12.030> again

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
one again

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.809 
one again
and<00:02:12.870> when<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.530> want<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.770> portal<00:02:14.130> stand<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.580> this

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
and when you want a portal stand on this

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.580 
and when you want a portal stand on this
one<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.180> don't<00:02:15.300> want<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.569> pass<00:02:15.750> through<00:02:16.140> just

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
one you don't want to pass through just

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.290 
one you don't want to pass through just
yet<00:02:16.890> because<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.550> want<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.790> make<00:02:17.970> sure<00:02:18.030> that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
yet because you want to make sure that

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.690 
yet because you want to make sure that
you<00:02:18.600> shoot<00:02:18.900> another<00:02:19.260> portal<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.310> orange<00:02:20.610> one

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
you shoot another portal the orange one

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.390 
you shoot another portal the orange one
as<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.180> would<00:02:21.270> be<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.600> time<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.530> go<00:02:22.890> up<00:02:22.920> you

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
as it would be this time you go up you

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.280 
as it would be this time you go up you
shoot<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.000> orange<00:02:24.420> portal<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.020> fall

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
shoot the orange portal and you fall

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.080 
shoot the orange portal and you fall
back<00:02:25.530> down<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.830> actually<00:02:26.160> missed<00:02:26.580> at<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.880> time

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
back down I actually missed at that time

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.270 
back down I actually missed at that time
I<00:02:27.120> might<00:02:27.480> have<00:02:27.630> even<00:02:27.750> been<00:02:27.990> able<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.440> like<00:02:28.890> slim

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
I might have even been able to like slim

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.070 
I might have even been able to like slim
a<00:02:29.310> second<00:02:29.790> off<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.060> or<00:02:30.150> something<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.600> shoot

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
a second off it or something and shoot

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.720 
a second off it or something and shoot
the<00:02:31.200> orange<00:02:31.590> one<00:02:31.770> on<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.010> ground<00:02:32.280> there<00:02:32.520> so
