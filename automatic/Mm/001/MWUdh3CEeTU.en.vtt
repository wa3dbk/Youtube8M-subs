00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.980
 hi guys welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.509
 tiberius 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.240
 today we are going to make an easy dish 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.670
 simple for the whole family we are going to 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.800
 rest but then always at 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.800
 level kitchen style 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.010
 ah 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.030
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.680
 catch olive oil 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.309
 and take a splash 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.960
 At the base of the pan we take the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.960
 We spread all over the pan 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.750
 and we put it to heat 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.310
 we already have the hot oil we are going to 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.580
 take a little cayenne pepper oil that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.650
 I'm doing and I always like 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.320
 pour a little parsley into the oil 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.650
 turn on so you have a little more 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.650
 taste 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.509
 let's take the onion 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.109
 we have chopped an onion we have 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.109
 enough 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:59.799
 and always to cut the onion we throw 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.799
 a little salt on top 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:11.310
 and we wait for the onion to punch 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.200
 we have put the onion we will 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.510
 Take the risks, I know, I want to tell you 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.200
 I bought the grills already cooked 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.730
 in the frozen area these reds 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.040
 normally as baked albert does not 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.010
 lack 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.230
 gone through water like putting a pan on 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.950
 I like to put it in the pan for 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.780
 that to take the taste of the oil and 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.990
 of the onion 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.370
 in 2002 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.370
 and we take them 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.680
 and now while they are done 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.569

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.090
 little bit of water and 12 we are going to take 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.940
