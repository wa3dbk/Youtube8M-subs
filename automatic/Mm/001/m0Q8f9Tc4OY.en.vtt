00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.180
 our friend fernando el tiqui-taca no 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.489
 it's going to be like that what incognito I've been 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.739
 using supplements for years and with 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.210
 the time and lately that I follow your 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.059
 seminar your tips on youtube 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.310
 I am going to have more and more clear what is 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.590
 what should be taken and at what times and 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.050
 for what but there are two supplements in 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.420
 concrete that I continue to create doubts one 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.370
 so known is the common fat burning what 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.660
 which is a thermo gene that by my 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.190
 experience and most people and 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.500
 I usually take before the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.200
 trainings but in the prospects of 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.630
 the websites tell us that before the 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.140
 meals and in the omega 3 fatty acids 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.390
 either 3 6 or 9 they just tell you 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.340
 that are taken with meals but in what 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.689
 meals in all of the morning in 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.689
 fasting I wait for your answer 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.659
 and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.850
 the one with the most fat is always taken before 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.670
 of aerobic activity or before the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.079
 training when you say take it 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.850
 as a meal always appropriate 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.300
 taking with the food so that it does not 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.810
 damage affects the health of the stomach 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.610
 but we always do well to take it what 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.430
 what is involved during the training 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.100
 especially before about fatty acids 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.440
 omega 3 also becomes important 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.990
 important to take it with meals and in 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.650
 the most acceptable moments of the day that 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.740
 are when we get up with breakfast in the 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.740
 food after the post training and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.390
 at dinner will also help us 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.730
 recovery and cell regeneration 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.150
 which is when it is best carried out by 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.150
 the nights
