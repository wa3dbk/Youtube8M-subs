so<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:34.800> think<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.310> early<00:02:35.370> part<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.730> my

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
so I think in the early part of my

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.880 
so I think in the early part of my
career<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.120> did<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.420> few<00:02:36.630> times<00:02:36.870> do<00:02:37.230> things<00:02:37.560> that

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
career I did a few times do things that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.949 
career I did a few times do things that
didn't<00:02:38.819> believe<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.330> they<00:02:39.390> didn't<00:02:39.630> they

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
didn't believe in and they didn't they

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.930 
didn't believe in and they didn't they
weren't<00:02:40.200> successful<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.069> just<00:02:41.250> felt<00:02:41.520> so

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
weren't successful and I just felt so

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.540 
weren't successful and I just felt so
bad<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:43.410> compra<00:02:43.830> I'd<00:02:43.920> allowed<00:02:44.160> myself<00:02:44.190> to

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
bad that I compra I'd allowed myself to

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.839 
bad that I compra I'd allowed myself to
compromise<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.330> still<00:02:45.780> failed<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:47.370> i<00:02:47.400> think<00:02:47.730> i

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
compromise and still failed so i think i

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.520 
compromise and still failed so i think i
had<00:02:48.000> very<00:02:48.360> early<00:02:48.630> on<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:48.900> my<00:02:48.930> career<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.350> had

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
had very early on in my career I had

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.770 
had very early on in my career I had
this<00:02:49.650> kind<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:49.980> moment<00:02:50.340> where<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.700> said<00:02:51.000> that's

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
this kind of moment where I said that's

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.390 
this kind of moment where I said that's
it<00:02:52.050> no<00:02:52.319> more<00:02:52.350> I'm<00:02:52.709> just<00:02:52.770> going<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.069> do<00:02:53.220> what<00:02:53.370> I

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
it no more I'm just going to do what I

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.910 
it no more I'm just going to do what I
want<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.819> do<00:02:53.970> if<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.750> fails<00:02:55.110> at<00:02:55.530> least<00:02:55.770> I'm

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
want to do if it fails at least I'm

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:10.700 
want to do if it fails at least I'm
proud<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.220> it

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.960 

and<00:03:11.710> it<00:03:11.830> was<00:03:11.920> actually<00:03:12.220> ironically<00:03:12.670> at<00:03:12.820> that

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
and it was actually ironically at that

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.990 
and it was actually ironically at that
time<00:03:13.240> but<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.540> started<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.610> build<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.760> fan<00:03:15.970> base

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
time but I started to build a fan base

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.710 
time but I started to build a fan base
because<00:03:16.690> that<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.620> know<00:03:18.390> sometimes<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.540> can

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
because that you know sometimes you can

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.510 
because that you know sometimes you can
you<00:03:20.110> can<00:03:20.290> play<00:03:20.590> too<00:03:20.650> much<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.340> lowest

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
you can play too much to the lowest

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.070 
you can play too much to the lowest
common<00:03:21.850> denominator<00:03:22.420> you<00:03:22.690> don't<00:03:22.900> give<00:03:23.050> people

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
common denominator you don't give people

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.170 
common denominator you don't give people
credit<00:03:23.560> there's<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.400> lot<00:03:24.490> of<00:03:24.520> people<00:03:24.700> out<00:03:24.940> there

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
credit there's a lot of people out there

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.660 
credit there's a lot of people out there
that<00:03:25.330> do<00:03:25.510> appreciate<00:03:26.340> quality<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.490> do

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
that do appreciate quality and do

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.140 
that do appreciate quality and do
appreciate<00:03:28.350> some<00:03:29.350> intellect<00:03:29.830> behind<00:03:30.150> music

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
appreciate some intellect behind music

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:43.800 
appreciate some intellect behind music
and<00:03:31.300> art<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:42.790> began<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:43.270> realize<00:03:43.450> that

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
and art and so I began to realize that

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.780 
and art and so I began to realize that
the<00:03:43.960> more<00:03:44.170> self-indulgent<00:03:44.770> I<00:03:45.250> was<00:03:45.400> in<00:03:45.580> a<00:03:45.640> way

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
the more self-indulgent I was in a way

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.020 
the more self-indulgent I was in a way
the<00:03:46.060> more<00:03:46.770> people<00:03:47.770> kind<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.070> admired<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.730> in

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
the more people kind of admired that in

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.910 
the more people kind of admired that in
me<00:03:49.270> and<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.780> know<00:03:49.870> it's<00:03:50.020> not<00:03:50.140> been<00:03:50.320> easy<00:03:50.470> but

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
me and you know it's not been easy but

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.920 
me and you know it's not been easy but
over<00:03:51.310> 20<00:03:51.640> years<00:03:51.820> I've<00:03:51.970> built<00:03:52.270> up<00:03:52.450> an<00:03:52.600> audience

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.780 
over 20 years I've built up an audience
that<00:03:53.020> but<00:03:53.350> due<00:03:53.500> respect<00:03:54.010> I<00:03:54.280> guess<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.640> fact

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
that but due respect I guess the fact

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.449 
that but due respect I guess the fact
that<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:55.030> don't<00:03:55.270> I<00:03:55.650> don't<00:03:56.650> do<00:03:57.010> things<00:03:57.220> for<00:03:57.400> the

that I don't I don't do things for the

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.800 
that I don't I don't do things for the
