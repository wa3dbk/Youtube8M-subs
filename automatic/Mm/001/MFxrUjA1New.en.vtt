00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:06.109
 rocky martian defends its title this new york space September 17 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.109
 1954 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:16.429
 but Martian and new school income of the country and opposite one of the best 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.390
 heavyweights of all times those two hands 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.720
 of cincinati collects the cincinnati cobra 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.539
 a man born in the ur is vile 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.699
 in Georgia he died on July 7, 1921 he presented himself as a 32-year-old 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.590
 figure that this fight was staged on September 17 not like 1954 no 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.329
 it was taken was a rematch match 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.770
 I had already given him a martial on one occasion 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.360
 that chávez says that it was an accident here we are going to see if as 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.960
 twice they will have recognized already amply 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.750
 to the great Martian roque to the world champion 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.740
 the man with white complexion the man who clicked with the fourth defense of his 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.740
 champion title 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.550
 he was presented with an immaculate tax record 46 bouts 46 victories 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.300
 forty nocaos that seem impressive 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.350
 and with only 85 kilos of weight 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.690
 let's go back to second round 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.200
 the minister for his part of xaxars had weighed 84 225 slightly more 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.200
 high an 83 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.960
 and had been the nine times world champion 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.870
 at this moment as said Martian loera 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.710
 this brutal fighter 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.550
 aggressive hard 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.550
 and possessor of a devastating punch 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.250
 josé will see and arrives with all that tremendous right 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.940
 has done a lot of damage to that hike to the xxi that is retreating already takes the 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.590
 strings has hit him absolutely pont 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.590
 I think that almost almost advances by the knee 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.400
 that chance has risen quickly 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.590
 he has not even been deputy by the referee 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.740
 courageous uprisings 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.759
 and as a matrix or 42 combat without knowing the defeat 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.529
 when the second round has finished 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:16.269
 we go directly to the fifth we are extracting for you the best 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.609
 litigantes of extraordinary world championship we will quickly tell you that 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.989
 the professional record of those talks 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.780
 it was in that moment of 86 victories ponce defeat and a combat null 53 wins 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:30.699
 before the limit 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:35.169
 62% was not bad at all but had nothing to do 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.789
 with the impressive record 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.899
 Rocky Martian in terms of number of annotated 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:42.600
 you know that Martian 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.709
 I was always above 80 85 percent a man 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:52.139
 that skirted perfectly 88 89% 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.019
 depending on when you will develop the fight 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.599
 The truth is that Martian did three things well, but he did them 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.579
 perfect 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.930
 that way of attacking that way of shaping the figure 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.569
 the way he pulls out his left hand and then how to take advantage 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.049
 to take out the right 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.779
 it is curious this man with is stuck to so demolishing especially with the 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:21.620
 right hand 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.329
 and that when he tried to be a baseball player 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.819
 was unable to throw the ball beyond 5 6 meters did not have in 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.459
 absolute I do not know if power of the city ti 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.229
 with enough force 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.789
 on the other hand in the rich can appreciate was a real destroyer 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.259
 when radon has finished 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:43.309
 they have not heard the referee's bell altar 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:47.479
 has had to intervene quickly we go to the sixth round 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.119
 the combat agreed to 15 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:53.999
 at stake the crown 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.699
 that Martian possessed 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.699
 doing here the fourth defense 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:04.239
 voceado as we say is extraordinary is a Chávez 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.049
 I had won Walcott 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.399
 alex said born dad 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.489
 a fred and taxco 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.199
 I had won the very same me Luis 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.930
 to the ear you come 1950 in dispute the world crown beat you for 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.209
 points at 15 degrees 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.229
 to the baron lic 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.959
 ant 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.449
 to the mess 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.129
 alloco alcohol in the end you could not ask for more an extraordinary diver 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.559
 he had even been able to 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.999
 to beat the same me the simplest man 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:40.210
 the man with whom he tried the light heavyweight crown 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.740
 ray robinson and failure 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.050
 the rest yes 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.009
 lost by points since the memorable bout inside the heavyweight front 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.800
 this man in front of those talks 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.290
 an extraordinary posed that lost its title 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.949
 on July 16, 1951 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.550
 spokesman in seven rounds 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.620
 20 yesterday sealed a box 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.729
 another man for the legend another extraordinary boxer 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.289
 boycott 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.590
 Martian almost nothing 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.710
 let's go back to the seventh ramón virtual but to the voceadores together with the 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.969
 names that we have removed 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:16.250
 of its rivals 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.850
 those who sent in the highest category and remember once again that 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.629
 there was only one champion 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.919
 it did not happen like now with different organisms 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.620
 with the title chopped two of the Martian's attempts was the champion 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.259
 only 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.970
 to get to dispute a world crown was practically impossible 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.699
 for him more than 90% of the boxers 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.280
 Martian had not only achieved it if he did not win he had obtained the title 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.680
 and here he was 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.080
 this aggressive and brutal speaker making the fourth defense 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:53.550
 neither Martians has ever characterized 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.860
 johnstone appreciate josé an overly orthodox posed 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.550
 and too sporty 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.019
 he did not care at all North where he was going to hit even by the head 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.689
 the case was to subdue the rival 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.889
 and see him as soon as possible at his feet we will enter 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.889
 eighth historic assault 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:18.110
 when magical where to quickly remember those chances died on 27 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.449
 May 1975 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:23.729
 and rocky Martian as everyone knows a day before he turns forty and 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:24.559
 six years 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:27.839
 in a tragic aviation accident 

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:31.080
 we are seeing how Martian attacks with all the hardness of which he is capable 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.699
 that chance the cobra de cincinnati can not stand and is valued 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:39.639
 to miss you shells a protection account basically we are 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.349
 watching the stellar moments of eighths going to join we have that is your interest be 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:45.760
 tremendous that is accused 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.360
 it could not fit 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.569
 and if it has fallen like a dynamited building 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.969
 while Martian strap a corner of a meadow 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:55.289
 the referee 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.400
 with parsimony and looking at us and that seems to look at the corner 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.430
 of those areas 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.340
 olympics gloves 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.340
 it leaves him in condition to leave but it has already passed an easy prey 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:14.360
 for Roque Martciano Rossi is looking for just one final blow there has 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.039
 arrived by that combination two transports even up to a blow 

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:22.999
 in the back part of the neck in one place and arrive but this match hit you with 

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:25.580
 everything I could see again 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.110
 tell me the peaceful account of 10 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:33.169
 he was going to decree the victory for nocao de marty rocky in the eighth assault 

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:37.129
 we see the repetition observe you 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.259
 five regulatory hits 

00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:50.649
 anti-regulation but that I already come Martian is to Chad not to stay 

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:52.809
 simon n 

00:07:52.809 --> 00:07:55.809
