you to the backup sheet that you see

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.759 
you to the backup sheet that you see
here<00:03:56.370> let's<00:03:56.640> go<00:03:56.760> up<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.060> top<00:03:57.590> this<00:03:58.590> is

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
here let's go up to the top this is

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.020 
here let's go up to the top this is
called<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.040> continuation<00:03:59.430> sheet<00:03:59.880> it's

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
called the continuation sheet it's

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.430 
called the continuation sheet it's
basically<00:04:00.390> where<00:04:00.660> all<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.930> numbers<00:04:01.230> come

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
basically where all the numbers come

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.050 
basically where all the numbers come
from<00:04:01.470> on<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.890> first<00:04:02.070> page<00:04:02.310> I'll<00:04:02.610> just<00:04:02.850> pan

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
from on the first page I'll just pan

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.280 
from on the first page I'll just pan
over<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:03.420> can<00:04:03.540> see<00:04:03.690> these<00:04:03.840> are<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.049> dates

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290
