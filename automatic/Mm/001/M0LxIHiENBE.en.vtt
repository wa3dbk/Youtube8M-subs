00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.460
 here we are for a winter outing 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.650
 perfect the cloudy sky this night 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.199
 it has no ice cream and therefore it is a typical one 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.859
 day and winter that I love 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.960
 face the technique that is today 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.059
 I want to introduce you is not new 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.309
 I simply gave it a light name 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.930
 pitching but it is simply to understand each other 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.120
 do the fishermen do not invent anything 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.650
 again it is not a new technique 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.379
 simply a technique that gives me the 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.370
 possibility also for the winter of 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.480
 catch fish of size 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.030
 important 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.620
 I certainly see a lot less eaten but 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.760
 if you catch a fish usually 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.059
 always a little bit more 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.460
 demanding what is the pitching 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.140
 very simple is a primer with a lead 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.420
 much thinner than usual and classic 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.739
 texas trigger though with a lot lead 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.710
 prospects of the usual 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.800
 I usually go on an eighth quarter 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.560
 maximum a quarter uses a 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.039
 thread much thinner than usual when 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.320
 because in the summer 14 16 18 20 books also 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.280
 why to pitching while instead in 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.509
 this time of year 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.829
 I reduce myself to 10 maximum twelve books per 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.750
 regarding the reeds goes by 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.329
 use a much more cane 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.630
 parabolic and much less rapid than that 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.250
 which I use in the summer because precisely 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.930
 needs to manage the sealing 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.640
 much lighter 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.590
 the bait that should be used instead well 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.600
 or always the same will be a shrimp 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.979
 or it will be the creature like the one I am 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.939
 is giving a lot of satisfaction in this 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.659
 period which is the mighty og of 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.920
 of the soul that is not a creature 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.899
 great but still not much 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.360
 small that half way that I think 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.130
 it is perfect for attracting large fish 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.119
 size also in the iron of values 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.590
 what is the fishing technique you will want to do 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.420
 support recovery that thing 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.969
 fundamental as it changed later in the video 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.369
 of the catch the recovery I do is 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.380
 very slow or I make babies 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.090
 skip I will make small ones succeed 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.370
 jump phone on the bottom or others 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.280
 lying to drag it very slowly 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.109
 what is the key to all the breaks 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.120
 breaks are very important because the 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.070
 fish right now is a lot 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.510
 lethargic with very low metabolism 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.730
 therefore having metabolism in 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.970
 very slow it tends to wait 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.590
 precisely that the bait stops for 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.810
 but of course he is a payer 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.340
 then with our hops and doing 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.769
 from bottom to bottom we unleash in him 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.709
 also his predatory instinct 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.599
 so light pitching in my opinion is 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.400
 a technique that an excellent alternative to 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.930
 windows where perhaps finally there is the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.329
 possibility of catching some fish 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.829
 smaller however in greater quantity in 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.239
 winter as we know the previous a 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.470
 whiten then if we catch a 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.069
 fish we are there which is much easier 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.470
 capture another then light pitching 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.010
 no doubt used the creatures that 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.599
 you like both creatures the most 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.450
 small appendages or creatures 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.280
 compact as I use a viveur 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.870
 can certainly go well and some 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.730
 shrimp I recommend the shrimp not 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.769
 too intrusive, not too big or not 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.859
 against for vibrations because the fish in 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.959
 this period is quite a bacoli 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:20.359
 we look for areas rich in obstacles and 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.489
 where there is a big jump in depth 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.440
 in this case the fish usually passes 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.450
 from the great depth to the little 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.269
 depth to feed or 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.849
 simply to wait 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.919
 spring coming soon then dates 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.540
 also look at the recovery I do 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:39.650
 see now in the video of 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.269
 of the fishing action directly into 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.870
 water and let me know yours 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.319
 impressions 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.319
 Hello 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.080
 anything 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.080
 [Applause] 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.000
 Well 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.249
 [Music] 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.940
 is 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.949
 Yup
