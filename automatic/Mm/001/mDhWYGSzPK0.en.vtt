00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
cute I'm not so good

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.000 
cute I'm not so good
but<00:00:21.570> basically<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.199> double<00:00:22.590> Jim<00:00:22.769> and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
but basically it's just double Jim and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.210 
but basically it's just double Jim and
the<00:00:23.160> barbell<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.789> really<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.480> long<00:00:28.220> so

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the barbell is really really long so

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.639 
the barbell is really really long so

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
it for the top piece broke off so I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.869

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
this was actually the first thing i

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.190 
this was actually the first thing i
changed<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.799> after<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:36.240> took<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:37.170> my

changed it to after I took out my

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.600 
changed it to after I took out my
barbell<00:01:38.119> when<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.450> healed<00:01:40.340> was<00:01:41.340> probably

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
barbell when it is healed was probably

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.330 
barbell when it is healed was probably
not<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> best<00:01:41.880> idea<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.290> was<00:01:44.159> really
