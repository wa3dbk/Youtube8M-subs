here if you take a look at this one that

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.300 
here if you take a look at this one that
he<00:04:09.480> just<00:04:09.690> finished<00:04:10.079> it's<00:04:10.500> actually<00:04:10.680> rounded

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
he just finished it's actually rounded

he just finished it's actually rounded
all<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.519> way<00:04:11.610> around<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.150> can<00:04:12.299> run<00:04:12.450> your

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
all the way around and you can run your

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.990 
all the way around and you can run your
finger<00:04:12.930> on<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.739> won't<00:04:13.950> get<00:04:14.069> cut<00:04:14.340> or<00:04:14.579> bird

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
finger on that you won't get cut or bird

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.690 
finger on that you won't get cut or bird
or<00:04:15.540> scratched<00:04:15.959> by<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.410> how<00:04:17.040> can<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.250> handle<00:04:17.579> go

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
or scratched by it how can the handle go

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.670 
or scratched by it how can the handle go
on<00:04:17.820> one<00:04:18.000> side<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.389> grip<00:04:18.660> does<00:04:18.900> go<00:04:19.079> on<00:04:19.109> one<00:04:19.380> side

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
on one side a grip does go on one side

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.069 
on one side a grip does go on one side
why<00:04:19.979> would<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.190> do<00:04:20.370> both<00:04:20.549> sides<00:04:20.970> what<00:04:21.479> we<00:04:21.630> what

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
why would you do both sides what we what

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.540 
why would you do both sides what we what
we're<00:04:22.229> concerned<00:04:22.530> about<00:04:22.680> always<00:04:23.160> in<00:04:23.340> voting

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
we're concerned about always in voting

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.550 
we're concerned about always in voting
is<00:04:23.789> safety<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.389> if<00:04:24.780> it's<00:04:24.990> rough<00:04:25.260> on<00:04:25.470> the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
is safety and if it's rough on the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.740 
is safety and if it's rough on the
inside<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.460> grip<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:27.090> can<00:04:27.240> actually<00:04:27.539> cut

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
inside and the grip it can actually cut

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.180 
inside and the grip it can actually cut
through<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.050> grip<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.500> then<00:04:28.590> cut<00:04:28.800> someone's

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
through the grip and then cut someone's

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.890 
through the grip and then cut someone's
hand<00:04:29.400> so<00:04:29.490> we<00:04:29.580> make<00:04:29.760> sure<00:04:29.789> we<00:04:29.910> radius<00:04:30.419> both<00:04:30.660> ends

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
hand so we make sure we radius both ends

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.810 
hand so we make sure we radius both ends
so<00:04:31.050> it's<00:04:31.289> finished<00:04:31.680> always<00:04:32.160> where<00:04:32.520> does<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.639> go

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
so it's finished always where does it go

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.370 
so it's finished always where does it go
from<00:04:32.940> here<00:04:33.120> from<00:04:33.570> here<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:33.960> needs<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.260> be

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
from here from here it needs to be

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.950 
from here from here it needs to be
punched<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:35.039> this<00:04:35.789> is<00:04:35.970> our<00:04:36.090> punch<00:04:36.330> press<00:04:36.630> over

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
punched and this is our punch press over

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.270 
punched and this is our punch press over
here<00:04:37.610> what<00:04:38.610> will<00:04:38.729> happen<00:04:38.880> here<00:04:39.360> is<00:04:39.570> the

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
here what will happen here is the

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.310 
here what will happen here is the
aluminum<00:04:41.280> will<00:04:41.460> get<00:04:41.610> slid<00:04:41.970> inside<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.870> the

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
aluminum will get slid inside and the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.740 
aluminum will get slid inside and the
Machine<00:04:43.710> actually<00:04:44.430> presses<00:04:44.910> down<00:04:45.090> on<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.599> and

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
Machine actually presses down on it and

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.659 
Machine actually presses down on it and
puts<00:04:46.139> a<00:04:46.229> pattern<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.740> holes<00:04:47.010> on<00:04:47.220> it<00:04:47.340> depending

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
puts a pattern of holes on it depending

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.040 
puts a pattern of holes on it depending
on<00:04:47.760> what<00:04:47.910> type<00:04:48.060> of<00:04:48.090> handle<00:04:48.510> we're<00:04:48.690> building

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
on what type of handle we're building

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.600 
on what type of handle we're building
whether<00:04:49.590> it's<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.830> fixed<00:04:50.130> length<00:04:50.310> or<00:04:50.580> a

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
whether it's a fixed length or a

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.370 
whether it's a fixed length or a
telescoping<00:04:51.360> handle<00:04:51.419> and<00:04:51.930> that's<00:04:52.050> really<00:04:52.260> the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
telescoping handle and that's really the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.279 
telescoping handle and that's really the
whole<00:04:52.620> secret<00:04:53.580> behind<00:04:53.940> this<00:04:54.180> system<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.200> you

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
whole secret behind this system that you

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.860 
whole secret behind this system that you
have<00:04:55.500> is<00:04:55.680> that<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.360> attachments<00:04:57.360> lock<00:04:57.599> into

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
have is that the attachments lock into

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.900 
have is that the attachments lock into
the<00:04:58.050> handle<00:04:58.320> right<00:04:58.500> right<00:04:59.099> and<00:04:59.520> I'll<00:04:59.669> show<00:04:59.820> you

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
the handle right right and I'll show you

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.190 
the handle right right and I'll show you
where<00:05:00.030> we<00:05:00.150> finish<00:05:00.300> up<00:05:00.539> the<00:05:00.630> handles<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.020> some

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
where we finish up the handles and some

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.060 
where we finish up the handles and some
of<00:05:01.320> our<00:05:01.440> attached<00:05:01.710> okay<00:05:02.750> over<00:05:03.750> here<00:05:03.990> each<00:05:04.800> one
