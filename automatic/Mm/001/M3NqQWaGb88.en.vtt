00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:08.700
 rough boys good the other day like 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:10.880
 You know I told you about the pods 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.880
 of 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.869
 of the radishes that have the little seeds 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.140
 you know what you stop blooming what 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.660
 you stop growing and then when the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.820
 flower is throwing the pods these that of 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.939
 that the time comes and let's say 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.440
 dried up inside you saw that they had 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.820
 the seeds 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.820
 there you have the zucchini 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.630
 the bronco list you see here I'm going 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.550
 cutting each time I'm cutting you more 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.710
 I go 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.140
 cutting what is coming out and always 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.900
 what is emerging from below but already 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.390
 not normally 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.820
 it is difficult for the first one to come out very 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.820
 that fat girl who leaves but if they go out 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.320
 a few guys that good does not matter 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.940
 there are many few few many the final 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.130
 and what about broccoli, with the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.830
 broccoli happens exactly the same there 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.290
 you have the group read the business and here 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.190
 you have for example for you to do 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.660
 an idea step first there you see how 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.360
 for example broccoli is opening 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.350
 they are opening 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.350
 then they are blooming 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.270
 and the flowers here you see how the 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.210
 little flowers 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.970
 they are falling and they are leaving it then 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.270
 As to 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.420
 we saw in the radish a kind of pods 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.340
 here you see them 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.560
 and within these pods for like 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.799
 what 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.930
 in the radishes, inside these 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.289
 pods are the seeds of the 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.329
 broccoli here you see that it leaves west as it 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.850
 He explained a little bit then I say 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.009
 well then I leave it and this one is worth 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.799
 for seeds and as I told you about the 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.740
 radishes here we have broccoli seeds 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.590
 because he is forever a man for 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.700
 clear self-consumption if you want what you 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.790
 I tell you here 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.750
 the tobacco as it is being put can already 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.170
 have a look here you have the little arrow 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.960
 I've transplanted it a while ago 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.720
 of transplanted good 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.150
 let's see if he wants to grow 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.950
 and the good mint had it there in 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.290
 the bathtub and in between and then I'm going 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.510
 to put here in a cubit of this 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.750
 I already tell you if you remember here was where 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.680
 there was the cousin that I did not know if 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.930
 was male or female the truth is that 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.090
 maybe it has come back to me that it was 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.960
 let's say a little female but 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.850
 transplant it 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.950
 from the doors that had them 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.960
 big here to the cubito this and then the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.060
 I put the shade there because I did not want 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.550
 that she did not grow up like she was 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.620
 macho had her there a little to the shade 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.930
 and perhaps being so long at the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.330
 shadow may have been one of 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.170
 the reasons that he does good to you have 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.080
 fact of becoming female or of 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.260
 declaring itself was not yet declared 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.800
 there you have the little trees that you already see 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.620
 they are growing more and more 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.310
 of the pomegranate and I do not know if it's an apple tree 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.410
 and I have not looked at the leaves either 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.740
 because they are very similar to the web 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.740
 Here you have 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.460
 as an actress 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.600
 they are all carlitos 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.170
 the quote 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.360
 help then yes it looks good 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.920
 there you see 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.100
 down 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.300
 how do you see one already 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.300
 good boys 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:08.750
 the usual 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:11.920
 here we are putting four stories 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.150
 on four floors because for that 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.829
 to spend a little bit of is what we 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:23.099
 compels us to eat what they force us 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.650
 and even baby you know the waters 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.259
 they are all controlled so much 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.400
 we drink like we could use 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:36.330
 one way or another for entertainment 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:40.500
 or fun as you want to call it 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.060
 and so I'll tell you about this issue of the 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.979
 medicinal plants this we have 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.530
 started well then we will see that 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.169
 It's not just that, it's much more than 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.740
 what we could do with all these 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.840
 plants and maybe they would help us avoid 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.889
 many problems many diseases that 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.439
 Today, humanity suffers 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.680
 good guys you know murcia a 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:05.410
 Quick 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.979
 and that is what I tell you that we are one that 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.979
