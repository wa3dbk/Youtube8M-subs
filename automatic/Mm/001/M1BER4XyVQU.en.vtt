00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.270
 So 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.789
 itar tass therefore 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.159
 as it turned out cccc 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.120
 as 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.070
 continues 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.219
 so as it happened 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.950
 such a short bench this process 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.970
 passed quietly enough 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.590
 for someone what was expected that this 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.060
 an indicator of what it is 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.460
 Besides 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.650
 just what something is 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.670
 went up 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.049
 how today should lie on the lawn 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.049
 irritant 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.750
 tenge 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.399
 such an approach to work 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.289
 for this i am glad that this time 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:27.010
 so tough enough 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.290
 when this and that 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.290
 full pre-sale preparation 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.199
 date this machine usually works 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.249
 then experts 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.249
 for this when choosing 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.919
 the truth is so far only empty of it 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.379
 Opera and Ballet Theater Stage Project 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.280
 provocation 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.629
 as 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.629
 as Prime Tass reports 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.069
 to n 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.149
 toyota akio toyoda akio class 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:48.679
 so here's how to be 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.679
 lose like 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:54.959
 even if it is 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.250
 2 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.420
 square 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:03.559
 it's in the press 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.339
 to about this date in the pic area 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.479
 square 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.479

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.649
 n.korolevskaya in his career 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:27.089
 in that 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.039
 now this figure is also 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.119
 Yes
