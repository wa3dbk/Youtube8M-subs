00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello friends here and talk today about what it was 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.710
 emperor plated by what you 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.809
 That's it, folks? 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.340
 decided to change the tea chat here more or 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.080
 less how it was before then 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.670
 I played a match and recommended the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.960
 things during the game world 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.340
 making a vow 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.380
 I think it gets cooler, it gets more 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.570
 fun and more dynamic and sometimes 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.980
 I want to talk about the subject that does not last and 20 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.260
 minutes I do not have 20 minutes to talk 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.269
 on the subject then the blog can be 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.980
 the shorter it can more meet depends I 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.090
 I chose the size time I remember the type 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.660
 topic I want to comment on here 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.450
 with you 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.450
 beauty, but today I'm here to talk 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.129
 a very important thing that I think 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.260
 will bring a mouthful thing to the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.719
 channel is the face of many people 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.110
 Ask me about the year because you complain 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.480
 both of fifa and continues to play it 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.579
 It matters to you, clown and to talk to 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 truth is very simple staff is a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.270
 thing to have a simple man how to explain 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.410
 for you or videos 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.360
 but first you have to give a little 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.160
 background for you to understand where 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.140
 that comes from my ideas I did not have the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.609
 my head because I think so and no 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.830
 is most of you know but I'm 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.320
 trained in design and digital animation ta 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.130
 So I have a vision one 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.479
 little more technical of the games is not only 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.610
 because I'm a graduate I might be 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.590
 people have formed with me. 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.830
 vision too but how annoying I am and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.570
 everything I really like there has a 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.520
 passion is more for things now 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.250
 study now to understand the part 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.200
 technique of things is this course of 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.909
 design I did gave me a good view 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.829
 about games where some stuff was 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.890
 related to this kind of design thing 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.100
 games is so I became a little more 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.829
 boring 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.899
 in this matter of the games in that formation 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.640
 reason of enough class on how the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.420
 of the gaming industry really 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.759
 project and how it should be based on 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.439
 the game is good or a game is bad which 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.369
 are the limitations 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.549
 What are the things that you should 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.970
 put in the game was are the fundamentals 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.070
 basics of the game 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.750
 within this area or to strengthen 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.820
 idea I had ever before but right 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.800
 get a focused and understand 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.050
 better what does it mean that the 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.119
 games have something very different from 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.580
 any other type of media that is such 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.050
 inter skill I do not know if this 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.940
 word exists but I will use is 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.160
 any way it means what 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.080
 means that in games you have 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.740
 control over what is happening in the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.130
 screen 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.410
 water do not tell me that it control the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.450
 mouse keyboard or even really the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.040
 control of xbox play 4 when it 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.930
 any video game you're there or if 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.150
 is interfering directly with that 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.350
 It is happening on the screen usually by this 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.120
 experience is an experience 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.120
 rewarding you have to have a 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.370
 very large and almost total control 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.400
 what you have to do in the game and 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.980
 that's when this fifa fifa really 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:55.570
 worries and leaves me three unfortunately 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.520
 There are many things, dear, little ones. 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.800
 are not germ errors that I had in this 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.220
 day 15 but are many small mistakes 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.170
 face is too much bug is too much bath of physics 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.010
 is very bamboo of goalkeeper of growth 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.410
 initial 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.930
 then all this sum causes this 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.120
 sense of control is lost within the 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.360
 play and leaves us frustrated at least 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.610
 in my case but here comes the question whether 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.320
 so much so if you range if you think 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.530
 that you do not have total control that is 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.900
 doing it because you keep playing 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.230
 I do not know and here comes the simple part 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.049
 personal the basis of the fifa game is very well 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.420
 done okay when no band interfere 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.640
 with the gameplay kong in full play the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.380
 game was extremely well and is 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.390
 extremely fun extremely 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.670
 satisfactory are you playing there you 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.400
 really feels the contour of the player 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.900
 you feel that your skill does 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.910
 the difference in what khan is doing there 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.190
 What are these little moments that 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.220
 They make me 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.020
 keep playing if you play because it is too 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.820
 fun when you really hit 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.380
 that beautiful exchange of passes when 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.220
 you give that kick put that ball 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.620
 goes at the angle 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.750
 Do you know when you feel you are your 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.770
 ability makes the difference in what 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.810
 happened in the field 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.600
 I know it's a few moments but I 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.970
 I'm a retard not to tell me why 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.860
 I love soccer so when I can 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.260
 have this experience when I can have 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.019
 This fun inside the game that 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.340
 calls him much stronger than he 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.170
 anything else 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.210
 these people are the reason for 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.270
 keep playing fucks is the passion for 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.270
 soccer 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.490
 when from that moment to mid soccer 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.890
 genuine when you feel she suffers 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.980
 easy pretty that well put kick 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.920
 given there is of the one who is feeling that 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.070
 Feel good you stay with our lady who 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.860
 it is not this has nothing else to 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.390
 says it's a stupid passion and it's also 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.560
 this passion that can claim me 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.330
 I want every time the game is better. 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.090
 For that I have an experience 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.590
 better face so I can have this 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.620
 best experience of this experience 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.430
 more football possible and in the 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.870
 games 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.970
 but it was not this people I hope 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.350
 You understood my side, did you? 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.360
 also know your opinion leave 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.640
 the comments because you continued 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.190
 playing fax 15 is that there are species 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.870
 new format and with chlorine and such 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.720
 more comments you think too 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.669
 he did not want to let the 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.130
 young person here to help in the 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.310
 That's it, everyone , a hug to null and
