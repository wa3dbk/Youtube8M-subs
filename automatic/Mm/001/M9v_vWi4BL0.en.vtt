00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
from the factory but there's a reason

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.510 
from the factory but there's a reason
that<00:04:56.569> you<00:04:56.659> can<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:57.590> mid<00:04:57.740> plate<00:04:57.949> is<00:04:58.069> riveted<00:04:58.400> on

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
that you can the mid plate is riveted on

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.830 
that you can the mid plate is riveted on
to<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.759> chassis<00:04:59.150> it<00:04:59.240> provides<00:04:59.569> additional

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
to the chassis it provides additional

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.170 
to the chassis it provides additional
rigidity<00:05:00.199> to<00:05:00.680> pass<00:05:01.099> rigorous<00:05:01.580> job<00:05:01.759> testing

rigidity to pass rigorous job testing

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.100 
rigidity to pass rigorous job testing
I<00:05:02.449> mean<00:05:02.930> it's<00:05:03.050> built<00:05:03.229> like<00:05:03.289> a<00:05:03.409> tank<00:05:03.620> you<00:05:05.110> can

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
I mean it's built like a tank you can

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.230 
I mean it's built like a tank you can
also<00:05:06.289> install<00:05:06.650> an<00:05:06.949> air<00:05:07.189> cool<00:05:07.430> in<00:05:07.550> here<00:05:07.789> so<00:05:08.120> long

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
also install an air cool in here so long
