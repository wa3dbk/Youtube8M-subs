00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.059
 The MooMonitor + uses technology, which was primarily used for rocket and torpedo construction, 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.599
 to be able to precisely monitor a cow's behavior and movement. 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.860
 And with this we can determine whether a cow is resting, ruminating or eating, 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.060
 and what level of activity she has. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.009
 With this information we can see 24/7 what a cow is doing 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.960
 and we can send this information directly to the farmer's mobile phone so that he can make decisions directly 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.300
 on the basis of draft reports, see when a cow can best be inseminated. 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.559
 These matters are of the utmost importance for modern livestock farming 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.340
 We all know that herds are spreading everywhere, but it remains important to keep seeing a cow as an individual. 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.510
 So to remain profitable as a dairy farmer 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.090
 Particular attention should be paid to the health and fertility status of each individual animal within the herd. 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.770
 You can do this in two ways ... 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.920
 Or you hire more people to take on the time-consuming chore of bronze recognition. 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:09.580
 Both day and night and even a little longer to work. 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.100
 Or you are going to invest in technology. 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.360
 Dairymaster launches the MooMonitor + - the most accurate activity meter available. 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.000
 It looks at a cow's daily activity 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.210
 and on this basis it can recognize different behaviors. 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.409
 So it tells us when a cow is in heat, when she is eating, her resting behavior, 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.189
 When she's chewing, whether she's restless and when she's moving. 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.480
 So it has many such benefits. In principle, it functions as a sort of electronic cattle farmer 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.200
 in such a way that it takes the labor out of observing the cow. 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.540
 When a cow shows a low ruminant level and a lot of resting behavior, the MooMonitor + will measure this 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.579
 and then plotting down for the farmer and depending on the preference for the farmer 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.750
 Can a push message be sent to your smartphone where you will see it appear on your App, 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.340
 On your mobile, on the PC or anywhere. It says: "something is wrong with this cow" 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.289
 Then you can go to that cow to see if she is in good health. 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.850
 In this way, the MooMonitor + is a great help in finding potential problem animals 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.139
 Who are not doing as well as they should. So now you are anticipating the problems 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:25.639
 instead of constantly putting out fires and you can also react a little faster if problems arise. 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.760
 The amount of technology herein is really unimaginable. 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.850
 This is a 32-bit processor that you hang around a cow's neck, 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.790
 Until a few years ago, a 32-bit processor was the only home computer available. 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.840
 So much power ... and this technology can now be used on cow anywhere in the world.
