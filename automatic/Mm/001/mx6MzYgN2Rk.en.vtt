00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 in the ring 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.250
 that's it 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.330
 that loads and is off and the west 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.190
 but do not give 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.100
 My buddy just out of here and the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.700
 wheels 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.050
 osterath around 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.880
 Life is also the west's shop 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.509
 and the best 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.509
 Come on 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.360
 slept well but certainly again 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.260
 as long as he gave me that stuff 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.430
 was only still burning over mine 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.020
 sore look better 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:44.489
 Mister Marx knew he liked it there 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.930
 analogously, max 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.790
 Oh yes, not quite fit but we have 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.260
 the things are quite good 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.670
 they are a little better off though 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.310
 they should at least I still 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.110
 I will spare a bit more 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.030
 I'll do it now 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.700
 I look like how much further here 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.680
 come and so and my goal is yes 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.759
 actually still colorado and I have to 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.110
 see that I still somehow get there 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.550
 I definitely have to tell others 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.090
 We'll tell you a little further 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.830
 in front of him 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.869
 because of the bandit raid and all that 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.729
 I have to do that recently 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.560
 allegedly now with times in passing 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.880
 recently supposedly two bandits 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.210
 arrived here in the city with us 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.210
 his 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.959
 I do not know who they are 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.300
 has attacked how many were but 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:29.220
 supposedly there are two here under 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.330
 to be us somewhere but so far 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.530
 nobody found myself yet so i know 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.940
 not whether the kind with him 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.860
 Hang the maybe 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.539
 they should be able to identify 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.399
 watch out 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:43.020
 okay okay okay thank you first 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.450
 for this info i will be me then 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.800
 first look around and of course 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.660
 something and one of the sheriffs of it 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.860
 nothing learn everything clearly 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.630
 not not because I do not 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.940
 but he just wants to deny 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.729
 not all slats at the fence would have been 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.979
 The guest always completely out and the finds 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.229
 and he has weird reasons for her 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.310
 not no idea okay get that 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.750
 for the first time they say they are for themselves 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.069
 somehow arrived here and they do 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.450
 we already know everything 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.160
 ok i thought i thank you for yours 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.480
 Hospitality without you will be what 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.550
 lost the desert 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.099
 Take this with many thanks 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.260
 Thank you for traveling 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.989
 all right 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.370
 Thank you for your help and gave it 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.370
 well meet again bye 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.380
 okay okay okay I'm here now 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:38.510
 somewhere in a city by nobody 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:41.380
 know and seemingly too 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.380
 sleep is still early in the morning 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.390
 apparently the sheriff lives here 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:53.570
 he's just not there okay okay 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.240
 we wanted to do that now wanted like 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.800
 john and sf one has been this over 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.840
 three months on the escape okay then 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.220
 are probably the two bandits of 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.540
 I've been talking about the hammers 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.850
 actually, I would have to 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.890
 Laugh somewhere and try the horse 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.460
 to seek a way to Colorado 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.010
 I do not know where to go 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.950
 ask again if the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.500
 bandits are here now 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.180
 if that's really the bandits if 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.770
 they are somehow involved in the 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.870
 Raid on our carriage then should 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.410
 I actually make sure that I have them 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.280
 do not lose again 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.740
 and if not maybe they have 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.050
 both yes information about who the 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:44.400
 actual cause of this this 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:48.379
 stop were christina 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:53.569
 that will cost me in any case 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.569
 in these bandits for revenge
