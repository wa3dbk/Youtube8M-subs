the<00:00:13.679> term<00:00:14.040> 4G<00:00:14.849> thrown<00:00:15.210> around<00:00:15.330> whether<00:00:16.139> it's

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
the term 4G thrown around whether it's

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.990 
the term 4G thrown around whether it's
referring<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.949> LTE<00:00:17.810> WiMAX<00:00:18.810> or<00:00:19.369> HSPA+<00:00:20.369> there's

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.759 
referring to LTE WiMAX or HSPA+ there's
no<00:00:21.270> doubt<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.900> all<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> major<00:00:22.650> networks

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
no doubt that all of the major networks

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.089 
no doubt that all of the major networks
are<00:00:23.460> tatting<00:00:23.939> their<00:00:24.090> 4G<00:00:24.630> prowess<00:00:25.260> what<00:00:25.980> we've

18 he has an LTE network coming which

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.810 
18 he has an LTE network coming which
they're<00:00:48.899> gonna<00:00:49.020> increase<00:00:49.530> speeds<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.610> for

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
they're gonna increase speeds but for

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.900 
they're gonna increase speeds but for
right<00:00:50.940> now<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:52.399> HSPA+<00:00:53.399> which<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.789> what

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
right now we have HSPA+ which is what

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.540 
right now we have HSPA+ which is what
both<00:00:54.090> carriers<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.629> referring<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.230> 4G<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.460> I'm

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
both carriers are referring to 4G so I'm

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.680 
both carriers are referring to 4G so I'm
gonna<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.760> interesting<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> speed<00:00:57.660> test

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
gonna be interesting to do a speed test

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.990 
gonna be interesting to do a speed test
on<00:00:58.170> both<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.800> see<00:00:59.039> which<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.760> quicker

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
on both and see which one was quicker

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.090 
on both and see which one was quicker
now<00:01:00.660> certainly<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.320> going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.739> vary

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
now certainly this is going to vary

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.310 
now certainly this is going to vary
depending<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.730> where<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.270> are<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
depending on where you are in the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.109 
depending on where you are in the
country<00:01:04.530> right<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:05.489> I'm<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.820> Southern

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
country right now I'm in Southern

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.969 
country right now I'm in Southern
California<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.810> these<00:01:07.049> speeds<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.439> really<00:01:07.650> only

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
California so these speeds a really only

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.100 
California so these speeds a really only
representative<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:08.850> area<00:01:09.270> wherever<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
representative of my area wherever you

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.660 
representative of my area wherever you
are<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.560> signal<00:01:10.860> strength<00:01:10.890> might<00:01:11.369> vary

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
are your signal strength might vary

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.550 
are your signal strength might vary
string<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.689> signal<00:01:12.990> strength<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.439> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
string a little signal strength here is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.929 
string a little signal strength here is
pretty<00:01:13.799> even<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.159> actually<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.490> two<00:01:14.700> bars

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
pretty even we actually have two bars

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.859 
pretty even we actually have two bars
each<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.979> H+<00:01:17.580> icon<00:01:18.210> right<00:01:18.630> up<00:01:18.750> at

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
each you can see the H+ icon right up at

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.130 
each you can see the H+ icon right up at
the<00:01:18.900> top<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> inspire<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.220> its<00:01:21.060> 4G<00:01:21.390> icon

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the top on the inspire and its 4G icon

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.010 
the top on the inspire and its 4G icon
right<00:01:22.500> over<00:01:22.650> there<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.009> Galaxy<00:01:23.640> S<00:01:23.850> 4G<00:01:24.240> so

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
right over there on the Galaxy S 4G so

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.390 
right over there on the Galaxy S 4G so
we've<00:01:25.110> got<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> same<00:01:25.439> speed<00:01:25.740> test<00:01:25.979> app<00:01:26.159> here

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
we've got the same speed test app here

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.780 
we've got the same speed test app here
on<00:01:26.520> both<00:01:26.840> will<00:01:27.840> go<00:01:27.990> ahead<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.650> run<00:01:29.490> them<00:01:29.670> you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
on both will go ahead and run them you

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.920 
on both will go ahead and run them you
can<00:01:29.939> certainly<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> difference<00:01:30.750> here

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
can certainly see a difference here

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
can certainly see a difference here

running as long as we're testing the
network<00:01:44.460> speeds<00:01:44.790> here<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.600> we'll<00:01:45.750> go<00:01:45.840> ahead

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
network speeds here so we'll go ahead

and let these begin latency test was a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.380 
and let these begin latency test was a

little bit quicker on the Galaxy S 4G
and<00:01:52.490> we're<00:01:53.490> gonna<00:01:53.610> look<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:53.970> megabits<00:01:54.509> per

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
second t-mobile claims they can get up

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.499 
second t-mobile claims they can get up
to<00:01:57.299> 24<00:01:57.990> megabits<00:01:58.439> per<00:01:58.530> second<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.969> 18<00:02:00.149> teeth

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
to 24 megabits per second and 18 teeth

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.240 
to 24 megabits per second and 18 teeth
claiming<00:02:00.930> noticeably<00:02:01.560> slower<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.159> you

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
claiming noticeably slower here so you

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.870 
claiming noticeably slower here so you
can<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.579> there's<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.829> significant<00:02:04.829> difference

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
can see there's a significant difference

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.630 
can see there's a significant difference
here<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.329> was<00:02:06.509> speeds<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.190> one

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
here what that was speeds so this is one

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.850 
here what that was speeds so this is one

two two significant differences here let
me<00:02:31.530> go<00:02:31.620> ahead<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:31.830> I'll<00:02:31.980> change<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.430> settings

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
me go ahead and I'll change the settings

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.250 
me go ahead and I'll change the settings
so<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.330> can<00:02:33.480> see<00:02:33.600> what<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.780> looks<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.050> in

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
so you can see what it looks like in

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.290 
so you can see what it looks like in
megabits<00:02:34.650> per<00:02:34.770> second<00:02:35.250> but<00:02:35.940> those<00:02:36.090> results

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
megabits per second but those results

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.110 
megabits per second but those results
are<00:02:36.780> quite<00:02:37.530> astounding<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.850> see<00:02:39.000> that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
are quite astounding so you can see that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.500 
are quite astounding so you can see that
there's<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.600> giant<00:02:40.410> difference<00:02:41.040> now<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.270> one

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
there's a giant difference now is one

maybe<00:02:43.590> not<00:02:43.800> let's<00:02:43.980> go<00:02:44.100> ahead<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.490> run<00:02:44.730> more

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
maybe not let's go ahead and run more

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.670 
maybe not let's go ahead and run more
and<00:02:45.270> we'll<00:02:45.390> see<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.720> up<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:45.959> any<00:02:46.080> difference<00:02:46.470> I

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
and we'll see you up if any difference I

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.040 
and we'll see you up if any difference I
would<00:02:47.070> actually<00:02:47.220> have<00:02:47.430> now<00:02:47.790> one<00:02:48.090> extra<00:02:48.600> bar<00:02:48.780> of

that<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.340> still<00:02:53.580> have<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:54.120> two<00:02:54.480> mobiles<00:02:54.840> let's

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
that we still have on two mobiles let's

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.630 
that we still have on two mobiles let's
go<00:02:55.380> ahead<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.650> test<00:02:55.830> these<00:02:55.980> guys<00:02:56.190> again<00:02:56.610> and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
go ahead and test these guys again and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.880 
go ahead and test these guys again and
seek<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.090> speeds<00:02:57.360> give<00:02:58.320> us<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> same<00:02:58.740> results

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
seek the speeds give us the same results

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.410 
seek the speeds give us the same results
so<00:03:01.890> we'll<00:03:02.010> go<00:03:02.100> ahead<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.700> load<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.120> both<00:03:03.270> of

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
so we'll go ahead and load of both of

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.720 
so we'll go ahead and load of both of
these<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:04.670> already<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.880> can<00:03:06.060> see<00:03:06.240> that

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
these and already you can see that

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.430 
these and already you can see that
there's<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.790> difference<00:03:08.820> now<00:03:09.270> with<00:03:09.300> with<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> GE

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
there's a difference now with with a GE

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
how real-world usage varies so I'll go

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.960 
how real-world usage varies so I'll go
ahead<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.540> test<00:03:39.870> again<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:44.370> will<00:03:44.790> say

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
ahead and test again and I will say

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.300 
ahead and test again and I will say

certainly<00:05:32.990> you<00:05:33.410> know<00:05:33.470> we<00:05:33.590> can<00:05:33.740> read<00:05:33.920> load<00:05:34.070> web

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
certainly you know we can read load web

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.430 
certainly you know we can read load web

it's<00:05:36.590> only<00:05:36.680> going<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:36.890> show<00:05:37.070> one<00:05:37.640> time<00:05:37.850> in<00:05:38.090> one

instance<00:05:38.690> on<00:05:38.930> video<00:05:39.920> both<00:05:40.850> were<00:05:41.120> very<00:05:41.210> quick

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
instance on video both were very quick

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.770

both<00:05:42.470> were<00:05:42.680> notice<00:05:42.950> will<00:05:43.040> be<00:05:43.130> quicker<00:05:43.370> than<00:05:43.780> 3G

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
both were notice will be quicker than 3G

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.570 
both were notice will be quicker than 3G
