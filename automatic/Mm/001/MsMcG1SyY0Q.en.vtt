00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.100
 in general, this program 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.430
 we are designed to recover 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.410
 hard drive she 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.140
 restores bats the so-called bad 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.050
 hard drive sectors or damaged 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.360
 sector and generally signs of spoiled 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.790
 hard drive is creepy 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.970
 braking and suspension of the operating room 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.350
 system errors when starting up any 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.949
 programs and either errors when starting any 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.040
 of files 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.809
 well and so on so if your 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.190
 computer behaves in a similar way 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.350
 worth checking it out for bad sectors and 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.190
 so as you see when you start the program 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.780
 we have the next choice 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.270
 choose the hard drive itself which 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.440
 we will scan 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:12.039
 so but i choose the first item on 14 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.039
 gigabyte 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.890
 Next comes the choice that is, one is at 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.710
 scanning is just a display 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.080
 grandfathers sectors the second is normal 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.200
 and scan with setting and third 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.790
 it's easy to display this information 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.920
 again i need and check and 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.490
 install if there are faulty 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.490
 some 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.189
 sector so i choose 2 well and 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.079
 the last one is scan and 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.619
 restore the first second is 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.039
 scan but not restore and 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:51.679
 rewrite all sectors even if they 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.709
 have not been corrupted but will need here 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.049
 set personal area to third item 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.939
 never used at all but always use 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.799
 first that is scan and 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.939
 recovery and so it all went 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.860
 during the scanning program we have 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.769
 identifies damaged old and 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.010
 restores them in this screenshot 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:16.760
 It is clear that the program has found 112 bads and 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.010
 all 112 restored and after completion 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.400
 scanning process we have issued 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.880
 hard drive card where displayed 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.880
 recovered sectors 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.120
 I personally have been several over the past year 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.459
 once faced with poor quality 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.510
 hard drives with that produced 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.650
 they were literally a month ago and everything in 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.450
 new laptops but a friend even 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.079
 got a situation that he changed three times 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.450
 hard drive for three months in general life 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.120
 book that is the quality of modern 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.549
 hard drives for beech leaves 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.049
 want something better 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.370
 although of course it may be the seller himself 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.769
 trying to get rid of there 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.659
 poor quality product anyway 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.569
 each time the situation developed 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:06.019
 as follows the operating room flies 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.940
 system i'm trying to install another but 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.940
 the installation process is unrealistic 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.810
 slowly and even if i installed 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.750
 it terribly slows down the operating system 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.450
 Well, now starting to check the disk 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.519
 the presence of old-fashioned sectors and in the very 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.200
 At the beginning they start pouring in each 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.139
 friend and in an hour it turns out that 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.199
 programs of all checked there 50 megabytes 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.540
 out of 500 gigabytes from here it becomes 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:35.540
 it is clear that the hard drive is killed at all 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.750
 tight and no hdd regenerator 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.340
 does not help and it happens that in general 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.560
 hard drive verification process 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.660
 falls off and the program says that 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.910
 there is no hard disk somewhere 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.120
 further in that case 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.150
 pin one carry letters or hard disk 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.689
 service center and 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.090
 let them change it for us 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.840
 shelf life is already out then we go for 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.840
 new disc
