showing you how to do is create a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.560 
showing you how to do is create a
realistic<00:00:09.510> looking<00:00:10.200> terrain<00:00:11.240> just<00:00:12.240> by<00:00:12.389> using

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
realistic looking terrain just by using

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.930 
realistic looking terrain just by using
a<00:00:12.780> texture<00:00:13.110> now<00:00:13.830> obviously<00:00:13.950> firm<00:00:14.490> if<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.759> just

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
a texture now obviously firm if I just

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.430 
a texture now obviously firm if I just
render<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.240> out<00:00:15.420> I'll<00:00:15.660> show<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.109> what<00:00:16.379> I

very quick to do ok as you can see all I
have<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> plane<00:00:35.520> which<00:00:36.420> I've<00:00:36.600> added<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
have here is a plane which I've added a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.319 
have here is a plane which I've added a
noise<00:00:37.350> modifier<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.460> I've<00:00:39.829> up<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.820> x

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
noise modifier to and I've up the the x

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.420 
noise modifier to and I've up the the x
y&amp;z<00:00:43.110> strengths<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.250> made<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.760> fractal<00:00:46.430> I've

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
y&amp;z strengths and made it fractal I've

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.340 
y&amp;z strengths and made it fractal I've
added<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.789> year<00:00:48.059> an<00:00:48.149> omni<00:00:48.420> light<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.140> cast

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
added a year an omni light and cast

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.740 
added a year an omni light and cast
shadows<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.879> some<00:00:51.329> illumination

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
shadows just to have some illumination

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.229 
shadows just to have some illumination
in<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> scene<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:53.129> very<00:00:53.730> very<00:00:53.969> quick

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
in the scene and it's very very quick

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.880 
in the scene and it's very very quick
and<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.600> won't<00:00:54.809> believe<00:00:54.960> how<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.320> actually<00:00:55.590> do

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
this and to create a texture all you

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.130 
this and to create a texture all you
need<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.930> google<00:01:00.930> earth<00:01:01.460> ok<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.359> first<00:01:03.930> thing

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
all of these boxes ok for obvious

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.640 
all of these boxes ok for obvious
reasons<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.450> don't<00:01:09.720> want<00:01:09.930> place<00:01:10.320> names

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
reasons that you don't want place names

reasons that you don't want place names
and<00:01:10.920> borders<00:01:11.670> showing<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.200> want

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
to do is zoom in to find an area that

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.780 
to do is zoom in to find an area that
looks<00:01:15.780> quite<00:01:16.140> term<00:01:16.470> details<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.460> far<00:01:17.670> as

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
looks quite term details as far as

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.640 
looks quite term details as far as

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
terrain goes so sue mean quite for you

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.410 
terrain goes so sue mean quite for you
don't<00:01:25.770> want<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.009> too<00:01:26.189> far<00:01:26.430> out<00:01:26.759> because

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
don't want to be too far out because

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.030 
don't want to be too far out because
otherwise<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.049> won't<00:01:28.229> look<00:01:28.350> very<00:01:28.409> good<00:01:28.829> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
otherwise it won't look very good and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
otherwise it won't look very good and
you<00:01:29.369> also<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:29.970> too<00:01:30.210> far<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.720> because

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this is quite a good distance away from

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.609 
this is quite a good distance away from
the<00:01:41.340> ground<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.000> you'll<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.479> working<00:01:43.470> with

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
a plane a de noise modifier change the

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.099 
a plane a de noise modifier change the
early<00:03:15.660> x<00:03:15.780> y<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.290> z<00:03:17.389> strengths<00:03:18.389> just<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.720> make

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
early x y and z strengths just to make

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.860 
early x y and z strengths just to make
it<00:03:19.139> all<00:03:19.349> bumpy<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.799> uneven<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:21.450> then

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
it all bumpy and uneven and then

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.930 
it all bumpy and uneven and then
obviously<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.380> just<00:03:22.590> add<00:03:22.799> this<00:03:23.010> texture<00:03:23.549> to

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
obviously you just add this texture to

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.909 
obviously you just add this texture to
the<00:03:24.209> erm<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.569> plane<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.319> it's<00:03:25.500> that's<00:03:25.739> it

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
the erm the plane and it's that's it

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.120 
the erm the plane and it's that's it
that's<00:03:26.190> as<00:03:26.430> simple<00:03:27.060> as<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.419> goes<00:03:27.889> so<00:03:28.889> I<00:03:28.919> thank
