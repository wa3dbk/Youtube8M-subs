someone in on the sidewalk where maybe I

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.810 
someone in on the sidewalk where maybe I

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
straight into the light here it was more

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.360 
straight into the light here it was more
fun<00:00:35.019> to<00:00:35.140> try<00:00:35.320> and<00:00:35.409> figure<00:00:35.530> out<00:00:35.649> how<00:00:35.859> to<00:00:35.920> put<00:00:36.190> her

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
fun to try and figure out how to put her

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.790 
fun to try and figure out how to put her
in<00:00:36.519> this<00:00:36.640> tree<00:00:36.940> to<00:00:36.999> let<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.510> lines<00:00:38.409> and<00:00:38.679> the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
in this tree to let the lines and the

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:48.330 
in this tree to let the lines and the
shadows<00:00:39.249> work<00:00:39.640> as<00:00:39.850> an<00:00:39.999> element<00:00:40.359> on<00:00:40.510> her

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.950 

you

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.389 

it's<00:00:54.960> about<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.230> certain<00:00:55.649> elegance<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it's about a certain elegance and a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.549 
it's about a certain elegance and a
certain<00:00:56.670> grandeur<00:00:57.300> which<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.379> that's

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
certain grandeur which I you know that's

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.170 
certain grandeur which I you know that's
certainly<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.129> part<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.519> it<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.699> think<00:00:59.789> if<00:01:00.000> it's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
certainly a part of it I think if it's

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.660 
certainly a part of it I think if it's
hard<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> define<00:01:01.409> that<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.710> today's<00:01:01.949> world<00:01:02.370> so

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
hard to define that in today's world so

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.889 
hard to define that in today's world so
it's<00:01:02.789> something<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.210> always<00:01:03.329> attracts<00:01:03.750> my

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
it's something that always attracts my

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.749 
it's something that always attracts my
attention<00:01:04.070> but<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.129> think<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.430> makes<00:01:05.580> it

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
attention but I think what makes it

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.289 
attention but I think what makes it
unique<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.440> be<00:01:07.649> a<00:01:07.940> house<00:01:08.940> painter

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
unique is that it can be a house painter

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.960 
unique is that it can be a house painter
it<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.259> a<00:01:10.289> guy<00:01:10.710> playing<00:01:11.009> basketball<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
it can be a guy playing basketball it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.300 
it can be a guy playing basketball it
can<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.259> really<00:01:13.259> anything<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.979> creates

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
can be really anything that creates

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.649 
can be really anything that creates
something<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:14.909> visually<00:01:15.450> interesting

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
something that's visually interesting

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.719 
something that's visually interesting
you<00:01:16.170> know<00:01:16.289> one<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> things<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.159> has

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
you know one of the things like that has

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.100 
you know one of the things like that has
helped<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> site<00:01:18.299> evolver<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.899> knew

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
helped the site evolver that I knew

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.980 
helped the site evolver that I knew
really<00:01:19.530> from<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> very<00:01:20.039> beginning<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.610> that

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
really from the very beginning is that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.749 
really from the very beginning is that
with<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.020> internets<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.280> speak<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.670> an

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
with the internets you can speak to an

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.450 
with the internets you can speak to an
international<00:01:24.119> audience<00:01:25.069> and<00:01:26.069> even<00:01:26.369> though

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
international audience and even though

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.870 
international audience and even though
we're<00:01:26.640> separated<00:01:27.300> by<00:01:27.920> language<00:01:28.920> we're<00:01:29.729> not

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
we're separated by language we're not

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.550 
we're separated by language we're not
separated<00:01:30.600> by<00:01:30.869> visuals<00:01:31.740> here<00:01:32.840> it's<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.020> element

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
separated by visuals here it's a element

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.609 
separated by visuals here it's a element
of<00:01:34.649> the<00:01:34.740> lifestyle<00:01:35.280> here<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.929> just<00:01:36.990> looks

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
of the lifestyle here so it just looks

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.990 
of the lifestyle here so it just looks
different<00:01:37.709> in<00:01:38.039> photographs<00:01:38.549> you'll<00:01:38.909> have

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
different in photographs you'll have

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.120 
different in photographs you'll have
guys<00:01:39.209> dressed<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.990> suits<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.709> a<00:01:40.770> skateboard

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
guys dressed up in suits on a skateboard

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.120 
guys dressed up in suits on a skateboard
it<00:01:41.459> just<00:01:41.640> feels<00:01:42.030> different<00:01:42.209> here<00:01:43.130> where

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
it just feels different here where

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.219 
it just feels different here where
you'll<00:01:44.280> never<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:44.970> Milan<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.659> when

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
you'll never see that in Milan so when

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.260 
you'll never see that in Milan so when
I'm<00:01:46.319> shooting<00:01:46.670> one<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> things<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.090> did<00:01:48.240> in

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
I'm shooting one of the things I did in

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.699 
I'm shooting one of the things I did in
the<00:01:48.420> very<00:01:48.539> beginning<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.319> opposed<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
the very beginning is as opposed to

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:50.990 
the very beginning is as opposed to
putting<00:01:49.920> someone<00:01:50.159> up<00:01:50.340> against<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.729> law<00:01:50.880> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
putting someone up against the law and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.370 
putting someone up against the law and
just<00:01:51.179> taking<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.450> picture<00:01:51.659> that's<00:01:51.929> a<00:01:51.990> report<00:01:52.319> of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
just taking a picture that's a report of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.350 
just taking a picture that's a report of
what<00:01:52.530> they're<00:01:52.679> wearing<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.280> move<00:01:53.729> them<00:01:53.880> off<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
what they're wearing I move them off the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.569 
what they're wearing I move them off the
wall<00:01:54.539> more<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> street<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.430> get

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
wall more to the street so then you get

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.700 
wall more to the street so then you get
a<00:01:56.609> sense<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.060> street<00:01:57.990> furniture<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.590> each

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
when I started the blog there was really

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.130 
when I started the blog there was really
nobody<00:02:11.250> doing<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.820> as<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.090> business<00:02:12.359> at<00:02:12.780> that

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
nobody doing it as a business at that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.319 
nobody doing it as a business at that
point<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.709> know<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.100> was<00:02:14.220> almost<00:02:14.880> seven

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
point you know this was almost seven

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.770 
point you know this was almost seven
years<00:02:15.480> ago<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:17.299> you<00:02:18.299> know<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.420> think<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.690> was

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
years ago and you know I think it was

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.630 
years ago and you know I think it was
something<00:02:18.930> was<00:02:19.140> kind<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.590> hobby<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.579> know

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
something was kind of a hobby you know

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.220 
something was kind of a hobby you know
if<00:02:20.790> they're<00:02:20.940> easier<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.359> do<00:02:21.570> them<00:02:21.750> websites

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
if they're easier to do them websites

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.400 
if they're easier to do them websites
but<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.519> think<00:02:24.420> quickly<00:02:24.690> people<00:02:24.959> realize

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
but I think quickly people realize

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.620 
but I think quickly people realize
whether<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.799> was<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.040> fashion<00:02:26.489> or<00:02:26.670> political

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
whether it was in fashion or political

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.380 
whether it was in fashion or political
or<00:02:27.950> something<00:02:28.950> like<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.730> know

or something like that that you know

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.080 
or something like that that you know

think<00:03:54.769> fashion<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.370> shows<00:03:55.610> and<00:03:55.879> all<00:03:55.940> that

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
think fashion and shows and all that

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.930 
think fashion and shows and all that
seemed<00:03:56.420> very<00:03:56.690> elitist<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.410> very<00:03:57.790> far<00:03:58.790> away

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
seemed very elitist and very far away

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.350 
seemed very elitist and very far away
from<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.329> lot<00:03:59.420> of<00:03:59.480> people<00:03:59.599> now<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.920> think<00:04:01.360> people

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
from a lot of people now I think people

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.789 
from a lot of people now I think people
are<00:04:02.420> able<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.750> pick<00:04:02.900> up<00:04:02.989> a<00:04:03.110> camera<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:03.590> say<00:04:03.769> oh

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
are able to pick up a camera and say oh

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.680 
are able to pick up a camera and say oh
I<00:04:03.950> started<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.400> blog<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.640> go<00:04:05.209> stand<00:04:05.450> at<00:04:05.600> the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
I started a blog and go stand at the

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.720 
I started a blog and go stand at the
shows<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.079> they<00:04:06.170> somehow<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:06.829> feel<00:04:07.250> closer<00:04:07.579> to

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
shows and they somehow I feel closer to

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.370 
shows and they somehow I feel closer to
fashion<00:04:08.150> which<00:04:08.269> is<00:04:08.389> always<00:04:08.540> better<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:09.049> mean<00:04:09.260> it

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
fashion which is always better I mean it

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.990 
fashion which is always better I mean it
loses<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.769> little<00:04:09.980> bit<00:04:10.130> of<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.370> alon<00:04:10.670> in<00:04:10.880> the

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
loses a little bit of the alon in the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.319 
loses a little bit of the alon in the
mystery<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:11.829> alyssa<00:04:12.829> exclusivity<00:04:13.400> but<00:04:13.819> it's

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
mystery and alyssa exclusivity but it's

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.000 
mystery and alyssa exclusivity but it's
almost<00:04:14.690> like<00:04:14.930> if<00:04:15.049> there<00:04:15.230> was<00:04:15.260> baseball<00:04:15.859> and

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
almost like if there was baseball and

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.110 
almost like if there was baseball and
nobody<00:04:16.250> was<00:04:16.370> allowed<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:16.639> go<00:04:16.789> to<00:04:16.849> a<00:04:16.940> baseball

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
nobody was allowed to go to a baseball

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.870 
nobody was allowed to go to a baseball
game<00:04:17.389> except<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.959> few<00:04:18.109> people<00:04:18.859> now<00:04:19.220> yeah<00:04:19.700> and

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
game except a few people now yeah and

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.250 
game except a few people now yeah and
that's<00:04:20.060> why<00:04:20.180> sports<00:04:20.510> are<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:20.930> much<00:04:21.109> bigger

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
that's why sports are so much bigger

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.890 
that's why sports are so much bigger
than<00:04:21.410> even<00:04:21.739> fashion<00:04:22.250> because<00:04:22.970> so<00:04:23.360> many<00:04:23.510> people

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
than even fashion because so many people

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.420 
than even fashion because so many people
can<00:04:24.020> feel<00:04:24.200> included<00:04:24.620> they<00:04:24.979> can<00:04:25.099> either<00:04:25.220> go<00:04:25.400> to

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
can feel included they can either go to

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.370 
can feel included they can either go to
the<00:04:25.580> game<00:04:25.729> watch<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.120> on<00:04:26.210> TV<00:04:26.389> whatever<00:04:26.870> fee<00:04:27.289> at

the game watch it on TV whatever fee at

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.440 
the game watch it on TV whatever fee at
