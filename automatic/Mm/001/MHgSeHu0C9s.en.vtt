famine<00:04:40.590> which<00:04:41.010> my<00:04:41.220> throat<00:04:41.550> thanked<00:04:41.909> me<00:04:41.940> for<00:04:42.300> a

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
famine which my throat thanked me for a

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.790 
famine which my throat thanked me for a
lot<00:04:43.099> some<00:04:44.099> of<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.370> girls<00:04:44.580> have<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.030> little<00:04:45.360> more

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
lot some of the girls have a little more

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.439 
lot some of the girls have a little more
mature<00:04:46.800> side<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.580> them<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:47.970> they<00:04:48.030> don't<00:04:48.300> have

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
mature side to them and they don't have

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.140 
mature side to them and they don't have
to<00:04:48.840> deliver<00:04:49.250> quite<00:04:50.250> so<00:04:50.520> baby<00:04:50.789> girls

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
to deliver quite so baby girls

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.560 
to deliver quite so baby girls
specifically<00:04:51.780> eventually<00:04:53.030> because<00:04:54.030> without

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
specifically eventually because without

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.290 
specifically eventually because without
giving<00:04:55.050> away<00:04:55.139> too<00:04:55.260> much<00:04:55.470> Evangeline<00:04:56.370> is<00:04:57.000> not

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
giving away too much Evangeline is not

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.200 
giving away too much Evangeline is not
always<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.780> little<00:04:58.020> girl<00:04:58.380> eventually<00:04:58.680> and

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
always a little girl eventually and

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.300 
always a little girl eventually and
and<00:05:00.419> so<00:05:00.630> Laura<00:05:00.930> Bailey<00:05:01.350> really<00:05:01.710> gets<00:05:01.949> to<00:05:02.069> do

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
and so Laura Bailey really gets to do

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.340 
and so Laura Bailey really gets to do
something<00:05:02.729> she<00:05:02.940> never<00:05:03.150> got<00:05:03.449> to<00:05:03.690> do<00:05:03.810> in<00:05:04.139> the

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
something she never got to do in the

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.129 
something she never got to do in the
first<00:05:04.530> season<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.360> think<00:05:06.419> Lord<00:05:06.780> Bailey's

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
first season and I think Lord Bailey's

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.010 
first season and I think Lord Bailey's
brilliant<00:05:07.590> in<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.770> role<00:05:08.009> anyway<00:05:08.569> so<00:05:09.569> she's

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
brilliant in the role anyway so she's

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.540 
brilliant in the role anyway so she's
she's<00:05:10.979> got<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.430> stretch<00:05:11.729> a<00:05:11.759> lot<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:13.550> think

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
she's got this stretch a lot I think

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.760 
she's got this stretch a lot I think
Lucy's<00:05:15.000> gotten<00:05:15.389> to<00:05:15.569> go<00:05:15.990> a<00:05:16.229> little<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.680> little

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
Lucy's gotten to go a little a little

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.580 
Lucy's gotten to go a little a little
further<00:05:17.190> distance<00:05:17.699> with<00:05:17.940> with<00:05:18.500> Austin<00:05:19.500> ah
