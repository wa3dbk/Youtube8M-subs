using this keyboard for a glass of day
or<00:00:40.050> two<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.600> found<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.780> keyboard<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
or two and I found that this keyboard is

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.900 
or two and I found that this keyboard is
really<00:00:43.829> good<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.610> does<00:00:44.879> use<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> Cherry<00:00:45.480> MX<00:00:45.539> a

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
really good it does use the Cherry MX a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.729 
really good it does use the Cherry MX a
mechanical<00:00:47.910> keys<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.510> inside<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.559> the

cheese of course another feature on this
keyboard<00:02:43.579> is<00:02:43.879> is<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.140> keys<00:02:45.349> are

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
keyboard is is that the keys are

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.650 
keyboard is is that the keys are
actually<00:02:45.739> submerged<00:02:46.069> into<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.760> keyboard<00:02:47.150> you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
actually submerged into the keyboard you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.660 
actually submerged into the keyboard you
actually<00:02:47.810> can't<00:02:48.140> tell<00:02:48.470> but<00:02:49.250> i'll<00:02:49.400> show<00:02:49.579> you

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
actually can't tell but i'll show you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.349 
actually can't tell but i'll show you
what<00:02:49.760> i<00:02:49.819> mean<00:02:49.879> give<00:02:50.690> me<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.810> second<00:02:52.359> it's

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
what i mean give me a second it's

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.130 
what i mean give me a second it's
slightly<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.870> bit<00:02:53.959> off<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:55.700> keyboard<00:02:55.970> top<00:02:56.750> so

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
slightly a bit off the keyboard top so

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.720 
slightly a bit off the keyboard top so
this<00:02:57.379> is<00:02:57.530> gonna<00:02:57.680> be<00:02:57.829> a<00:02:57.890> bit<00:02:58.069> higher<00:02:58.370> than<00:02:58.400> most

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
this is gonna be a bit higher than most

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.970 
this is gonna be a bit higher than most
keyboards<00:02:59.060> as<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.569> guys<00:02:59.720> can<00:02:59.930> see<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.440> the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
keyboards as you guys can see and the

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.800 
keyboards as you guys can see and the
keys<00:03:01.220> are<00:03:01.250> bit<00:03:01.519> submerged<00:03:02.000> into<00:03:02.480> through<00:03:02.720> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
keys are bit submerged into through the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.220 
keys are bit submerged into through the
middle<00:03:03.079> and<00:03:03.260> up<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.120> is<00:03:05.150> another<00:03:05.420> it

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
middle and up so this is another it

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.839 
middle and up so this is another it
takes<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.680> lot<00:03:06.829> of<00:03:06.859> time<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.370> get<00:03:07.489> used<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.790> this

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
takes a lot of time to get used to this

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.610 
takes a lot of time to get used to this
keyboard<00:03:08.090> but<00:03:08.420> it's<00:03:08.629> definitely<00:03:09.019> one<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.500> the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
keyboard but it's definitely one of the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.800 
keyboard but it's definitely one of the
better<00:03:09.799> mechanical<00:03:10.790> keyboards<00:03:11.209> out<00:03:11.329> there<00:03:11.599> i

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
better mechanical keyboards out there i

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.899 
better mechanical keyboards out there i
would<00:03:12.079> highly<00:03:12.319> suggest<00:03:12.560> this<00:03:13.159> keyboard<00:03:13.609> for

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
would highly suggest this keyboard for

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.240 
would highly suggest this keyboard for
sure<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:16.250> just<00:03:16.489> another<00:03:16.910> overlay<00:03:17.540> or<00:03:18.250> overview

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
sure so just another overlay or overview

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.150 
sure so just another overlay or overview
of<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.700> keyboard<00:03:20.090> itself<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:24.530> we<00:03:24.650> do<00:03:24.799> have<00:03:24.829> the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
of the keyboard itself so we do have the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.330 
of the keyboard itself so we do have the
little<00:03:25.549> Lighting's<00:03:26.000> here<00:03:26.919> so<00:03:27.919> it's<00:03:28.069> nothing

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
little Lighting's here so it's nothing

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.309 
little Lighting's here so it's nothing
fancy<00:03:28.669> with<00:03:28.970> LED<00:03:29.389> lighting<00:03:29.720> at<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.139> back<00:03:30.290> of

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
fancy with LED lighting at the back of

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.900 
fancy with LED lighting at the back of
the<00:03:30.470> keyboard<00:03:30.799> this<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.069> a<00:03:31.099> very<00:03:31.280> classic

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
the keyboard this is a very classic

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.069 
the keyboard this is a very classic
looking<00:03:32.359> keyboard<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:36.470> retails<00:03:36.919> for<00:03:37.069> around

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
looking keyboard this retails for around

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.909 
looking keyboard this retails for around
ninety<00:03:39.079> dollars<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.910> 120<00:03:40.910> dollars<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:42.829> I

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
ninety dollars to 120 dollars and I

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.640 
ninety dollars to 120 dollars and I
think<00:03:43.129> this<00:03:43.190> is<00:03:43.250> definitely<00:03:43.549> worth<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:45.500> money

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
think this is definitely worth the money

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:54.930 
think this is definitely worth the money
this<00:03:46.579> will<00:03:46.879> last<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.209> for<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.510> long<00:03:47.810> time<00:03:48.910> I

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
used to because the keys are submerged

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.240 
used to because the keys are submerged
downwards<00:04:13.609> and<00:04:13.910> it<00:04:14.449> it<00:04:15.049> is<00:04:15.319> a<00:04:15.349> bit<00:04:15.620> hard<00:04:15.829> as<00:04:16.160> you

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
downwards and it it is a bit hard as you

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.529 
downwards and it it is a bit hard as you
get<00:04:16.400> them<00:04:16.519> see<00:04:16.760> my<00:04:17.269> wrist<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:18.019> has<00:04:18.139> to<00:04:18.289> go<00:04:18.440> up<00:04:19.539> so

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
get them see my wrist it has to go up so

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:21.789 
get them see my wrist it has to go up so
you<00:04:20.630> got<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.810> really<00:04:20.900> take<00:04:21.079> time<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.500> get<00:04:21.620> use

mechanical keyboard i would suggest that

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.680 
mechanical keyboard i would suggest that
the<00:04:32.050> steelseries<00:04:32.530> 6gv2<00:04:33.210> spend<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.389> bit<00:04:34.660> more

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.839 
the steelseries 6gv2 spend a bit more
money<00:04:35.139> but<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.740> get<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.099> better<00:04:36.280> quality
