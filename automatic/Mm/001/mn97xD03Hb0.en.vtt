environmental<00:00:27.890> above<00:00:28.890> my<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.429> has<00:00:29.609> like

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
environmental above my think it has like

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.700 
environmental above my think it has like
a<00:00:29.789> bloom<00:00:30.210> effect<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.720> mean<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> game<00:00:31.230> looks

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
a bloom effect I mean the game looks

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.340 
a bloom effect I mean the game looks
excellent<00:00:32.309> especially<00:00:33.149> since<00:00:33.630> I'm<00:00:33.870> comparing

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
excellent especially since I'm comparing

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.630 
excellent especially since I'm comparing
everything<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> middle<00:00:35.070> care<00:00:35.219> summit<00:00:35.430> for

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
everything the middle care summit for

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.060 
everything the middle care summit for
these<00:00:35.880> days<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.329> mean<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:37.140> not<00:00:37.410> quite<00:00:37.770> there

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
these days I mean it's not quite there

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.790 
these days I mean it's not quite there
but<00:00:38.100> still<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.000> has<00:00:39.360> those<00:00:40.110> graphics<00:00:40.649> you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
but still it has those graphics you

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.350 
but still it has those graphics you
won't<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.040> any<00:00:41.129> quality<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.670> now<00:00:41.969> we

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
won't have any quality of that now we

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.400 
won't have any quality of that now we
come<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> environment<00:00:43.050> now<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
come to the environment now the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.319 
come to the environment now the
environment<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.100> pretty<00:00:44.640> fast<00:00:44.910> i<00:00:45.090> would<00:00:45.239> have

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
environment is pretty fast i would have

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.850 
environment is pretty fast i would have
to<00:00:45.360> say<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.960> starts<00:00:46.260> into<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> snow

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
to say because it starts into a snow

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.400 
to say because it starts into a snow
area<00:00:47.250> then<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.670> leads<00:00:47.910> into<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.600> jungle<00:00:49.079> type

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
area then it leads into a jungle type

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.139 
area then it leads into a jungle type
area<00:00:49.649> then<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.100> leads<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> main<00:00:50.670> castle

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
area then it leads to the main castle

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.100 
area then it leads to the main castle
where<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.300> will<00:00:51.449> spend<00:00:51.539> most<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> time

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
where you will spend most of the time

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.260 
where you will spend most of the time
the<00:00:52.500> game<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.980> then<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> lead<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.850> back<00:00:54.030> into

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the game and then the lead you back into

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.090 
the game and then the lead you back into
like<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> battlefield<00:00:54.840> type<00:00:55.320> area<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.920> as

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
pretty much good for amounts places

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.959 
pretty much good for amounts places
where<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.100> can<00:00:59.250> keep<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.640> keep

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
controls the controls are pretty easy to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.039 
controls the controls are pretty easy to
learn<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.960> mean<00:01:07.260> they<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.590> their<00:01:08.750> role<00:01:09.750> they

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
learn I mean they have their role they

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.929 
learn I mean they have their role they
have<00:01:10.200> their<00:01:10.439> behavior<00:01:11.340> tags<00:01:12.049> heavy<00:01:13.049> attacks

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
have their behavior tags heavy attacks

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.340

spinning attacks for your light ones and
yeah<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.830> pretty<00:01:20.009> much<00:01:20.130> switches<00:01:21.060> between<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
yeah it pretty much switches between the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.600 
yeah it pretty much switches between the
different<00:01:22.080> forms<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> heavenly<00:01:23.250> swords

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
you have like the dual blaze and left

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.270 
you have like the dual blaze and left
like<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> giant<00:01:25.590> wanted<00:01:25.890> anything<00:01:26.100> like

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
like the giant wanted anything like

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.830 
like the giant wanted anything like
splitting<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.030> change<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.600> flipping

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
splitting and if I change like flipping

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.380 
splitting and if I change like flipping
around<00:01:27.960> kind<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.470> Kratos<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.100> yeah<00:01:30.000> it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
around kind of like Kratos and yeah it

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.920 
around kind of like Kratos and yeah it
does<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.780> game

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
does this game
