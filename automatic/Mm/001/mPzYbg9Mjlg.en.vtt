although<00:03:00.880> I<00:03:00.910> drained<00:03:01.420> fast<00:03:01.780> when<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.200> was<00:03:02.320> in

although I drained fast when I was in

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.170

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
real issues getting through even a long

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.070 
real issues getting through even a long
day<00:03:06.190> with<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.430> first<00:03:06.640> there's<00:03:07.480> no<00:03:07.630> removable

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
day with the first there's no removable

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.750 
day with the first there's no removable
battery<00:03:08.410> so<00:03:08.740> you<00:03:08.770> might<00:03:09.040> run<00:03:09.190> into<00:03:09.250> trouble

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
battery so you might run into trouble

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.430 
battery so you might run into trouble
but<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.060> benefit<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.450> having<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.870> relatively

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
but the benefit of having a relatively

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.530 
but the benefit of having a relatively
pokey<00:03:11.710> processor<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.520> a<00:03:12.640> smaller<00:03:12.910> screen<00:03:13.330> is

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
pokey processor and a smaller screen is

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.450 
pokey processor and a smaller screen is
that<00:03:13.660> both<00:03:13.840> draw<00:03:14.080> less<00:03:14.350> power<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.860> so<00:03:15.310> your

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
that both draw less power and so your

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.310 
that both draw less power and so your
phone<00:03:15.610> simply<00:03:15.850> lasts<00:03:16.180> longer<00:03:16.600> as<00:03:16.750> for<00:03:17.260> the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
phone simply lasts longer as for the

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.690 
phone simply lasts longer as for the
software<00:03:17.710> there<00:03:18.010> are<00:03:18.070> a<00:03:18.130> few<00:03:18.220> things<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.580> know

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
software there are a few things to know

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.580 
software there are a few things to know
obviously<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.690> first<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.080> most<00:03:20.140> important

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
obviously the first and most important

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.810 
obviously the first and most important
thing<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:20.739> that<00:03:20.860> it's<00:03:21.070> running<00:03:21.220> Facebook<00:03:21.459> home

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
if I'll be switching to the first but I

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:12.879 
if I'll be switching to the first but I
do<00:05:11.689> hope<00:05:11.990> that<00:05:12.050> it<00:05:12.199> does<00:05:12.349> well<00:05:12.529> enough<00:05:12.650> to

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
do hope that it does well enough to

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.279 
do hope that it does well enough to
prove<00:05:13.099> to<00:05:13.250> HTC<00:05:13.789> Samsung<00:05:14.210> and<00:05:14.719> everybody<00:05:15.080> else

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
prove to HTC Samsung and everybody else

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.659 
prove to HTC Samsung and everybody else
that<00:05:15.500> there's<00:05:15.650> a<00:05:15.710> real<00:05:15.919> market<00:05:16.159> for<00:05:16.370> phones

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
that there's a real market for phones

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.279 
that there's a real market for phones
that<00:05:16.819> aren't<00:05:17.060> designed<00:05:17.360> for<00:05:17.509> giants<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.110> with

that aren't designed for giants and with
stock<00:05:18.500> Android<00:05:18.919> the<00:05:19.580> first<00:05:19.819> is<00:05:19.969> great<00:05:20.240> but

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
stock Android the first is great but

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.029 
stock Android the first is great but
hopefully<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.139> second<00:05:21.529> will<00:05:21.650> do<00:05:21.830> away<00:05:22.009> with

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
hopefully the second will do away with

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.920 
hopefully the second will do away with
compromises<00:05:22.819> everybody<00:05:23.210> seems<00:05:23.479> to<00:05:23.569> make<00:05:23.779> on
