00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
think I think everybody should do I

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.720 
think I think everybody should do I
think<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.660> should<00:04:07.780> be<00:04:07.810> part<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.230> a<00:04:08.730> learning

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
think it should be part of a learning

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.670 
think it should be part of a learning
experience<00:04:10.270> I<00:04:10.750> think<00:04:10.780> everybody<00:04:11.290> should<00:04:11.350> take

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
experience I think everybody should take

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.530 
experience I think everybody should take
out<00:04:11.920> two<00:04:12.550> months<00:04:12.730> even<00:04:12.940> more<00:04:13.210> than<00:04:13.360> three

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
out two months even more than three

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.760 
out two months even more than three
months<00:04:13.660> so<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:13.960> don't<00:04:14.140> think<00:04:14.320> three<00:04:14.440> months<00:04:14.680> is

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
months so I don't think three months is

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.040 
months so I don't think three months is
long<00:04:14.920> enough<00:04:14.980> but<00:04:15.400> yeah<00:04:16.210> you<00:04:16.270> learn<00:04:16.690> so<00:04:16.900> much
