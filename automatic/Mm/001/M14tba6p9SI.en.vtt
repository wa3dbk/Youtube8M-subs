00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.190 

GM<00:01:03.490> cars

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:20.359 

like<00:01:09.740> our<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.100> ball<00:01:10.250> fairly<00:01:10.610> easy

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:32.100 

Hannibal<00:01:20.759> side-by-side

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.380 

so<00:01:32.620> there's<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.040> difference<00:01:33.490> that's<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.910> old

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
so there's a difference that's the old

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.510 
so there's a difference that's the old
stock<00:01:34.810> bulb<00:01:35.140> over<00:01:35.320> here<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:37.420> new<00:01:37.630> crystal

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
stock bulb over here and the new crystal

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.550 
stock bulb over here and the new crystal
clean<00:01:39.520> one<00:01:39.790> so<00:01:40.690> I'll<00:01:40.750> do<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.020> other<00:01:41.140> side<00:01:41.320> real

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
clean one so I'll do the other side real

00:01:41.560 --> 00:02:11.710 
clean one so I'll do the other side real
quick

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.840 

all<00:02:12.200> right<00:02:12.320> better<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.070> in<00:02:13.190> there<00:02:13.400> installed

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
all right better it in there installed

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.450 
all right better it in there installed
so<00:02:14.540> that's<00:02:14.720> an<00:02:14.930> HID<00:02:15.350> which<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.040> have<00:02:16.220> on<00:02:16.340> my

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
so that's an HID which I have on my

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.059 
so that's an HID which I have on my
headlight<00:02:16.880> 6000

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.209 

and<00:02:22.340> now<00:02:22.549> my<00:02:22.760> high<00:02:22.969> beams<00:02:23.799> those<00:02:24.799> are<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.099> new

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
and now my high beams those are the new

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.009 
and now my high beams those are the new
crystalline<00:02:25.819> just<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.299> give<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.569> an<00:02:26.689> idea<00:02:26.750> of

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
crystalline just to give you an idea of

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.459 
crystalline just to give you an idea of
a<00:02:27.079> difference<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:28.689> know<00:02:29.689> a<00:02:29.930> little<00:02:30.379> bit

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:30.469 
a difference you know a little bit

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.630 
a difference you know a little bit
bright<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> little<00:02:30.950> bit<00:02:31.040> better<00:02:31.159> there's<00:02:31.459> still

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
bright a little bit better there's still

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.509 
bright a little bit better there's still
a<00:02:31.670> halogen<00:02:32.150> base<00:02:32.480> vault<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.079> they<00:02:33.200> aren't<00:02:33.519> like

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
a halogen base vault so they aren't like

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:46.300 
a halogen base vault so they aren't like
the<00:02:34.640> HIDs<00:02:35.150> I'll<00:02:35.480> flash<00:02:35.780> for<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:35.989> couple<00:02:36.260> time

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.260 

like<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:46.970> said<00:02:47.319> that's<00:02:48.319> a<00:02:48.440> 6k<00:02:49.010> hid<00:02:49.610> right<00:02:49.970> there

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
like I said that's a 6k hid right there

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.530 
like I said that's a 6k hid right there
and<00:02:51.819> then<00:02:52.819> I'll<00:02:53.060> show<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.300> that<00:02:53.480> in

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
and then I'll show you that in

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.230 
and then I'll show you that in
crystalline

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.510 

so<00:03:01.810> there<00:03:02.320> you<00:03:02.350> go<00:03:02.530> those<00:03:02.890> are<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.130> crystal

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
so there you go those are the crystal

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.330 
so there you go those are the crystal
visions<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:04.720> know<00:03:04.840> they<00:03:04.990> are<00:03:05.440> not<00:03:05.470> HIDs<00:03:06.130> but

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
visions you know they are not HIDs but

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.620 
visions you know they are not HIDs but
they<00:03:06.430> are<00:03:06.550> wider<00:03:06.820> they<00:03:07.150> are<00:03:07.300> a<00:03:07.330> little<00:03:07.540> bit

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
they are wider they are a little bit

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.970 
they are wider they are a little bit
brighter<00:03:07.780> than<00:03:08.050> a<00:03:08.170> stock<00:03:08.410> bulb

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
brighter than a stock bulb

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.660 
brighter than a stock bulb
they<00:03:09.550> say<00:03:09.820> they<00:03:10.030> give<00:03:10.270> you<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:11.130> xenon<00:03:12.130> powered

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
they say they give you a xenon powered

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.570 
they say they give you a xenon powered
halogens<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.630> still<00:03:14.230> like<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.530> hid<00:03:14.860> better<00:03:15.190> but

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
halogens I still like the hid better but

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.820 
halogens I still like the hid better but
at<00:03:15.820> least<00:03:16.030> these<00:03:16.180> will<00:03:16.330> do<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.540> job<00:03:16.680> have<00:03:17.680> any

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
at least these will do the job have any

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.320 
at least these will do the job have any
