00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.310
 With 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.010
 it is the diameter par excellence for direct discharge from glass 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.849
 or on CCC bottles 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.000
 In recent years they have become more popular lighter than glass 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.880
 yes it needs now their share is 60 percent 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.050
 Researchers at the University of Frankfurt are now following his 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.499
 different packaging under closer scrutiny 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.889
 and found out something that makes one sit up in different 

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:35.199
 they found better hormonal substances 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.069
 in plastic bottles, the concentration was much higher than in glass bottles 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.039
 The virus found differently 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.559
 For many of these men, that was going to get you deeper into the grid again 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.019
 any umberto months would find out on warmth belly 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.440
 Mineral water from plastic bottles so sketched twice as high from Norway 

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:58.930
 to actively participate in the mineral resources glass bottles 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.370
 Harmonia which resembles the female sex hormone estrogen have researchers 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.210
 found 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.220
 in individual water 75 nanograms per liter that is more than for example in the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.930
 Wastewater that has long been regarded as contaminated by birth control pills 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.580
 This hormone cocktail has an impact on humans 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.940
 become 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.870
 Her mineral water drinking water is generally very sensitive food 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.350
 and 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.009
 when they are obviously substances again and from our normal 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.030
 Feelings do not even belong in this respect, there are already Wulkow 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.510
 is it water or is it the packaging of this question are the 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.240
 Researchers followed up with animal helpers 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.760
 New Zealand dwarf lid slugs 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.570
 For 8 weeks, the animals lived in different waters in the same water 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.770
 packaging forms 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.920
 and again, the result was clearly the snails go plastic bottles 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.480
 lived twice as many Ambri without Nvidia in Class bottles 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.060
 for consumer protection institutions 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.320
 if the team starts dating and you certainly have more to do 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.910
 Science and research in this field is about to make these environmental hormones 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.130
 find out world with which Schmidt income at all in contrast and 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.469
 is based on the real risk 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.310
 Interest groups deny this risk 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.650
 they refer to the legal limits and that the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.540
 Frankfurter results clearly lower than I can understand that 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.780
 Consumers have let them unsettle you 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.380
 but there is no reason to worry as I said 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.750
 Proven peaks are around one million Mead Rieger as the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.130
 legal limit if it is good for your health as well 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.439
 excluded 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.689
 Limit values ​​are valid so far only for individual squadron the Frankfurt 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.049
 Researchers, however, against a different path 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.870
 they examined the interaction of these constituents in the end 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.870
 Maybe the mix could be dangerous for people 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.759
 Again and again new substances occur as a possible problem in the tendency 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:56.660
 with the head 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.560
 our approach now is that we are not the individual substances but the 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.430
 Capture the effects of similar substances and that is 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.110
 much more effective and easier to monitor by the authorities 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.580
 Incidentally, the researchers were also funded with funds from the Federal Environmental Agency 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.930
 you do not want to comment on the result of the study there 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.020
 refers to the Federal Office for Risk Assessment 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.780
 However, this will first wait for further investigations
