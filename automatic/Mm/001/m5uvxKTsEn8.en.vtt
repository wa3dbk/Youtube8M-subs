domination win that is right now a lot
of<00:00:21.560> people<00:00:21.770> thought<00:00:21.980> that<00:00:22.040> this<00:00:22.220> was<00:00:22.460> not

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
of people thought that this was not

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.429 
of people thought that this was not
possible<00:00:22.939> personally<00:00:23.779> I<00:00:23.810> didn't<00:00:24.230> think<00:00:24.320> it

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
possible personally I didn't think it

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.720 
possible personally I didn't think it
was<00:00:24.529> possible<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:25.070> lot<00:00:25.160> of<00:00:25.279> other<00:00:25.460> guys<00:00:25.580> in

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
was possible a lot of other guys in

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.769 
was possible a lot of other guys in
carnage<00:00:26.000> thought<00:00:26.180> we<00:00:26.270> would<00:00:26.390> never<00:00:26.509> be<00:00:26.630> able

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
carnage thought we would never be able

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.300 
carnage thought we would never be able
to<00:00:26.869> get<00:00:27.020> this<00:00:27.140> because<00:00:27.380> it's<00:00:27.619> really<00:00:27.650> no<00:00:28.009> map

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
to get this because it's really no map

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.159 
to get this because it's really no map
that<00:00:28.550> works<00:00:28.880> to<00:00:29.239> get<00:00:29.390> that<00:00:29.509> you<00:00:29.599> know<00:00:29.869> like

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
that works to get that you know like

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.290 
that works to get that you know like
other<00:00:30.410> games<00:00:30.680> in<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.040> past<00:00:31.279> have<00:00:31.640> and<00:00:31.970> that

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
other games in the past have and that

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
other games in the past have and that
was<00:00:32.419> kind<00:00:32.540> of<00:00:32.570> unfortunate<00:00:32.750> because<00:00:33.079> this<00:00:33.230> is

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
was kind of unfortunate because this is

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.569 
was kind of unfortunate because this is
something<00:00:33.560> like<00:00:33.590> a<00:00:33.829> team<00:00:34.100> challenge<00:00:34.310> it's

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
something like a team challenge it's

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.120 
something like a team challenge it's
really<00:00:34.880> fun<00:00:35.149> to<00:00:35.180> go<00:00:35.329> for<00:00:35.750> but<00:00:36.200> luckily<00:00:36.710> enough

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
really fun to go for but luckily enough

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.100 
really fun to go for but luckily enough
we<00:00:37.370> found<00:00:37.579> that<00:00:37.820> instinct<00:00:38.390> was<00:00:38.630> the<00:00:38.870> only

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
we found that instinct was the only

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.430 
we found that instinct was the only
possible<00:00:39.710> map<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.579> do<00:00:40.790> this<00:00:40.970> on<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:41.450> even<00:00:42.260> with

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
possible map to do this on and even with

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.139 
possible map to do this on and even with
this<00:00:42.590> that<00:00:42.890> being<00:00:43.100> said<00:00:43.250> even<00:00:43.520> with<00:00:43.610> instinct

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
this that being said even with instinct

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.580 
this that being said even with instinct
you<00:00:44.210> know<00:00:44.329> being<00:00:44.539> possible<00:00:45.050> it<00:00:45.230> was<00:00:45.320> still

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
you know being possible it was still

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.160 
you know being possible it was still
very<00:00:45.920> very<00:00:46.070> challenging<00:00:46.489> because<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.809> flag

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
very very challenging because the a flag

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.529 
very very challenging because the a flag
is<00:00:48.410> closer<00:00:48.859> to<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.370> enemy's<00:00:49.820> team<00:00:50.300> that

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
is closer to the enemy's team that

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.139 
is closer to the enemy's team that
doesn't<00:00:50.809> get<00:00:50.929> the<00:00:51.370> response<00:00:52.370> or<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.760> doesn't

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
doesn't get the response or the doesn't

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.180 
doesn't get the response or the doesn't
get<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.300> house<00:00:53.449> spawns<00:00:53.839> so<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.649> host<00:00:54.859> gets

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
get the house spawns so the host gets

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.470 
get the house spawns so the host gets
the<00:00:55.399> spawn<00:00:55.640> down<00:00:55.820> at<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.000> bottom<00:00:56.239> of<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.390> hill

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
the spawn down at the bottom of the hill

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.090 
the spawn down at the bottom of the hill
and<00:00:56.719> we're<00:00:56.929> a<00:00:56.960> lot<00:00:57.199> further<00:00:57.410> than<00:00:57.769> they<00:00:58.070> are

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
and we're a lot further than they are

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.130 
and we're a lot further than they are
than<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:58.730> we<00:00:59.149> have<00:00:59.179> to<00:00:59.449> kind<00:00:59.539> of<00:00:59.629> get<00:00:59.780> lucky

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
than a so we have to kind of get lucky

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.840 
than a so we have to kind of get lucky
in<00:01:00.260> there<00:01:00.440> we<00:01:00.679> have<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.890> get<00:01:01.039> there<00:01:01.190> as<00:01:01.399> fast<00:01:01.429> as

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
in there we have to get there as fast as

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.610 
in there we have to get there as fast as
possible<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:02.570> we<00:01:02.660> have<00:01:02.780> like<00:01:02.899> over<00:01:03.079> clock<00:01:03.440> on

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
possible so we have like over clock on

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.259 
possible so we have like over clock on
and<00:01:03.800> stuff<00:01:03.949> like<00:01:04.070> that<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.460> we<00:01:04.670> get<00:01:04.820> there<00:01:05.059> and

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
and stuff like that and we get there and

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.460 
and stuff like that and we get there and
hopefully<00:01:05.449> there's<00:01:05.840> only<00:01:05.930> one<00:01:06.140> guy<00:01:06.290> in<00:01:06.320> the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
hopefully there's only one guy in the

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.960 
hopefully there's only one guy in the
flag<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:06.920> doesn't<00:01:07.130> cap<00:01:07.280> it<00:01:07.430> very<00:01:07.550> fast<00:01:07.790> we

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
flag so it doesn't cap it very fast we

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.010 
flag so it doesn't cap it very fast we
can<00:01:08.090> have<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:08.270> we<00:01:08.480> have<00:01:08.510> to<00:01:08.600> kill<00:01:08.810> them<00:01:08.930> off

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
can have to we have to kill them off

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.600 
can have to we have to kill them off
very<00:01:09.050> fast<00:01:09.260> that's<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.770> only<00:01:10.159> way<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.370> do<00:01:10.580> it

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
very fast that's the only way to do it

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.520 
very fast that's the only way to do it
in<00:01:10.820> this<00:01:10.909> game<00:01:11.120> now<00:01:11.480> real<00:01:11.659> quick<00:01:11.870> I<00:01:11.990> have<00:01:12.260> seen

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
in this game now real quick I have seen

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.649 
in this game now real quick I have seen
one<00:01:12.890> done<00:01:13.130> on<00:01:13.400> ascend<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.090> I<00:01:14.270> don't<00:01:14.330> know<00:01:14.510> it's

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
one done on ascend and I don't know it's

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.060 
one done on ascend and I don't know it's
kind<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:14.840> weird<00:01:15.080> how<00:01:15.260> they<00:01:15.409> got<00:01:15.530> it<00:01:15.680> on<00:01:15.740> ascend

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
kind of weird how they got it on ascend

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.010 
kind of weird how they got it on ascend
because<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:16.640> literally<00:01:16.939> spot<00:01:17.420> on<00:01:17.630> both<00:01:17.780> sides

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
because you literally spot on both sides

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.020 
because you literally spot on both sides
you<00:01:18.170> literally<00:01:18.500> spawn<00:01:18.920> on<00:01:19.189> top<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.759> flag

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
you literally spawn on top of the flag

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.480 
you literally spawn on top of the flag
and<00:01:20.329> I<00:01:20.840> don't<00:01:21.049> know<00:01:21.170> how<00:01:21.470> six<00:01:22.009> guys<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.220> the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
and I don't know how six guys and the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.219 
and I don't know how six guys and the
other<00:01:22.610> team<00:01:22.909> none<00:01:23.299> of<00:01:23.329> them<00:01:23.509> decided<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:24.049> cap

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
other team none of them decided to cap

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.719 
other team none of them decided to cap
the<00:01:24.439> flag<00:01:24.829> that<00:01:24.860> they<00:01:25.100> spawned<00:01:25.399> right<00:01:25.460> in

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
the flag that they spawned right in

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.520 
the flag that they spawned right in
front<00:01:25.909> of<00:01:26.000> I<00:01:26.180> don't<00:01:26.360> know<00:01:26.420> about<00:01:26.540> that<00:01:26.899> so<00:01:27.229> in

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
front of I don't know about that so in

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.830 
front of I don't know about that so in
reality<00:01:28.130> all<00:01:28.369> of<00:01:28.640> all<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.240> other<00:01:29.360> maps<00:01:29.600> are

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
reality all of all the other maps are

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.780 
reality all of all the other maps are
completely<00:01:30.290> impossible<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:31.159> do<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:31.729> will

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
completely impossible to do and it will

these<00:02:48.939> flags<00:02:49.180> held<00:02:49.510> but<00:02:50.019> nobody<00:02:50.319> would<00:02:50.409> join

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
these flags held but nobody would join

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.379 
these flags held but nobody would join
and<00:02:50.980> he<00:02:51.099> ended<00:02:51.310> up<00:02:51.400> getting<00:02:51.579> he<00:02:52.209> ended

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
and he ended up getting he ended

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.000 
and he ended up getting he ended
pressing<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.780> join<00:02:53.049> game<00:02:53.379> of<00:02:53.590> someone<00:02:53.889> else

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
pressing the join game of someone else

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.619 
pressing the join game of someone else
instead<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.340> inviting<00:02:54.609> so<00:02:54.969> he<00:02:55.120> got<00:02:55.269> kicked<00:02:55.510> out

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
instead of inviting so he got kicked out

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.179 
instead of inviting so he got kicked out
of<00:02:55.659> the<00:02:55.780> game<00:02:55.930> or<00:02:55.959> left<00:02:56.409> the<00:02:56.500> game<00:02:56.709> we<00:02:57.010> tried

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
of the game or left the game we tried

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.710 
of the game or left the game we tried
inviting<00:02:57.549> him<00:02:57.639> back<00:02:57.909> I<00:02:58.090> tried<00:02:58.269> inviting<00:02:58.599> him

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
inviting him back I tried inviting him

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.089 
inviting him back I tried inviting him
back<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.109> he<00:02:59.170> was<00:02:59.290> put<00:02:59.409> onto<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.709> other<00:02:59.859> team

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
back and he was put onto the other team

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.440 
back and he was put onto the other team
obviously<00:03:00.250> since<00:03:00.760> there's<00:03:00.909> less<00:03:00.970> people<00:03:01.269> on

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
obviously since there's less people on

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.449 
obviously since there's less people on
the<00:03:01.540> other<00:03:01.659> team<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.139> so<00:03:02.799> when<00:03:02.919> we<00:03:03.159> ended<00:03:03.370> up

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
the other team and so when we ended up

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.069 
the other team and so when we ended up
only<00:03:03.639> doing<00:03:03.939> this<00:03:04.030> again<00:03:04.269> five<00:03:04.540> other<00:03:04.780> people

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
only doing this again five other people

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.869 
only doing this again five other people
so<00:03:05.349> we<00:03:05.739> only<00:03:05.859> had<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.040> five-man<00:03:06.459> team<00:03:06.549> in<00:03:06.790> this

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
so we only had a five-man team in this

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.210 
so we only had a five-man team in this
so<00:03:07.150> it's<00:03:07.269> kind<00:03:07.419> of<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:08.109> know<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.230> crazy<00:03:08.829> team

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
so it's kind of you know a crazy team

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.800 
so it's kind of you know a crazy team
challenge<00:03:09.639> it<00:03:09.790> didn't<00:03:10.000> go<00:03:10.120> like<00:03:10.419> I<00:03:10.540> planned

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
challenge it didn't go like I planned

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.750 
challenge it didn't go like I planned
the<00:03:11.139> way<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.290> planned<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.769> to<00:03:11.919> be<00:03:11.950> was<00:03:12.250> this<00:03:12.370> epic

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
the way I planned it to be was this epic

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.759 
the way I planned it to be was this epic
battle<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:13.329> hold<00:03:13.540> all<00:03:13.810> three<00:03:14.139> flags<00:03:14.409> and

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
battle to hold all three flags and

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.110 
battle to hold all three flags and
obviously<00:03:15.099> that<00:03:15.220> didn't<00:03:15.489> turn<00:03:15.609> out<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:15.790> well

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
obviously that didn't turn out so well

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.879 
obviously that didn't turn out so well
but<00:03:16.450> if<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.599> think<00:03:16.720> about<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.049> most<00:03:17.319> enemies

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
but if you think about it most enemies

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.949 
but if you think about it most enemies
are<00:03:18.189> going<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.760> leave<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.269> game<00:03:19.450> if<00:03:19.659> we<00:03:19.810> have

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
are going to leave the game if we have

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.390 
are going to leave the game if we have
like<00:03:20.079> assault<00:03:20.439> streaks<00:03:20.650> up<00:03:20.799> in<00:03:20.889> the<00:03:20.980> air<00:03:21.159> and

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
like assault streaks up in the air and

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.800 
like assault streaks up in the air and
we're<00:03:21.549> holding<00:03:21.819> all<00:03:21.909> three<00:03:22.120> flags<00:03:22.359> that's

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
we're holding all three flags that's

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.089 
we're holding all three flags that's
exactly<00:03:23.200> what<00:03:23.290> happened<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:23.650> game<00:03:23.859> and

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
exactly what happened this game and

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.229

nobody<00:03:24.280> wanted<00:03:24.609> to<00:03:24.730> count<00:03:24.970> because<00:03:25.150> when

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
nobody wanted to count because when

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.759 
nobody wanted to count because when
people<00:03:25.329> did<00:03:25.629> join<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:26.169> were<00:03:26.260> beating<00:03:26.680> them
