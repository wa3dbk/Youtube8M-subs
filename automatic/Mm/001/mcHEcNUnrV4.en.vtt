00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.370
 Alexey Valerievich 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.420
 tell about problem areas and 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.530
 actual statistics for today 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.789
 day this year for three months was 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.269
 registered 173 report 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:24.109
 road traffic procession where died 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:26.109
 9 people and injured 205 speaking 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.589
 about what we lowered 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.890
 traffic accident 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.239
 still the number of people killed by them 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.760
 stayed high we don't 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.600
 has achieved a reduction in the names of the dead from 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.660
 nine dead 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.370
 6 dead and the day were pedestrians that is 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.370
 pedestrians those who do not follow the rules 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.230
 road crossing the carriageway 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.450
 part in unspecified places 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.580
 we expose our outfits road patrons 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.110
 service in places of concentration 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.570
 traffic accidents exactly 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.180
 composing administrative materials and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.680
 doing stress prevention at the very 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.480
 most pedestrian arrivals 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.050
 tied by the fault of the pedestrians themselves 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.780
 would be more 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.579
 degree or lazy to walk to 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.380
 crosswalk or just not 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.249
 attentive on the road static 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.640
 tells you that 

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:12.319
 really who is a pedestrian without crossing 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.780
 about this part did not think about anything 

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:17.149
 what day the vehicle is 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.100
 the source of increased danger is in the spring 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.289
 Cheboksary city roads more severely to 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.990
 motorists with a lot of me 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.329
 after melting snow on the roads as far as 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.060
 increased number of accidents associated with 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:32.209
 negative road conditions definitely 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.709
 this is a problem in the city there that is 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:36.560
 every motorist probably sees 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:37.249
 driving along the roads of the city 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.799
 how much do we have 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:42.039
 pits on the roadway as much 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.590
 vehicles directly 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.049
 stand on the sidelines put a spare tire 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.520
 let's say the drivers know the legal 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.679
 basis cause the traffic police officers 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.329
 who are coming to the place exactly 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.630
 a traffic accident then 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.719
 there is a rupture wheel make up act after 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.209
 what can the driver apply to 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.849
 civil procedure for reimbursement 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:09.530
 damage caused to the vehicle 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.150
 are there enough crews 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.140
 inspectors to fix 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.430
 all these cases are those crew directed 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.370
 possible traffic accidents 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.850
 imparted during 10 minutes 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.780
 after clearance to exactly transport 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.030
 reported to the duty officer about 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.800
 what is happening what are you doing for 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.630
 reduce such accidents in general that is 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.970
 have any prescriptions let's say 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.860
 the city administration after 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.730
 doron transport material 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.709
 if associated with hitting a selected one 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.120
 pit is made an act after which 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.970
 logged in the log book 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.550
 road network deficiencies 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.280
 day traffic officer 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.959
 write out all these flaws and prepare 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.820
 submissions after which submission 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.300
 not sent by administration 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.070
 cities 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.300
 to eliminate this disadvantage 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.870
 safety enhancement program 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.120
 the traffic of the Chuvash for 2013 2020 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.010
 of the year said raising culture 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.690
 road users how 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.130
 way in your opinion can be enhanced 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.180
 the culture of road users 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.720
 Cheboksary city culture can be raised 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.220
 only prevention probably most likely 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.890
 attitude of all road users 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.549
 go directly to each other 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.340
 raise their not and sense of justice to 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.350
 the road was all mutually polite when 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.780
 the occurrence of some kind of emergency 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.730
 situations helped each other not somehow 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.190
 way prevented the passage and the forest 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.390
 some problems created each other but 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.860
 I think that there still should be 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.630
 predictability directly 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.880
 road users are the same 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.420
 use turn signals when turning 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.100
 maneuver 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.660
 car because it often happens 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.150
 coming off so people 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.950
 spontaneously begin there was a mouth about it not 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.110
 notifying and colliding occurs 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.610
 as well as pedestrians again, too 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.110
 show to other participants 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.970
 pedestrian traffic in this 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.709
 case of motorists what are they planning 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.680
 cross the road they are so spontaneous 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.720
 breaking out so to speak in the sprint for another 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.430
 side of the road up is a big problem 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.100
 arises directly pedestrian 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.940
 transition when a pedestrian is sure of his 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.340
 action and quick step or almost 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.299
 run can run out or go out on 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.390
 crosswalk 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.209
 literally driver 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.609
 can not respond to this that is 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.140
 the consequence of what happens such assaults 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.520
 at pedestrian crossings 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.380
 so I would like to turn to 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.150
 pedestrians to be extremely attentive 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.060
 when crossing the road use 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.419
 crosswalk and take off the hood 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.919
 headphones remove the phone and these 30 seconds 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.510
 while you cross the road to be 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.010
 be as vigilant as possible and listen to us 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.680
 a large number of hits 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.350
 from motorists about bus 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.020
 who drive to rebuild from the band 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.060
 in lane a creates an emergency 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.010
 Of course, not all routes are concerned, but 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.840
 Nevertheless, most cases are 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.720
 it happens all the same they risk 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.340
 health and lives of their passengers and 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.860
 these are women and children 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.080
 so how can you influence 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.970
 their behavior on the road and is it possible 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.870
 tighten control of the machine 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.060
 work with shuttle buses with us 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.470
 units are on special account 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.030
 directly by staff 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.090
 traffic police daily 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.190
 up to 20 drivers are made but 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.020
 breaking the rules of the road 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.360
 work is also carried out and 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.300
 and in administration at meetings with 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.669
 owners of freight routes 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.190
 reached an agreement to have them in 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.830
 bus and it was pasted information about 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.330
 that the driver is forbidden when 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.640
 driving a vehicle 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.870
 talk on one hundred phones by 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:43.380
 walkie talkies both lie down and smoke smoking and downstairs 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.330
 this information is cellular information 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.669
 phone directly to the owner 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.190
 route and owner of this transport 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.229
 funds for which you can call and 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.740
 express their discontent regarding 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.080
 the driver 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.850
 Alexey Valerievich what are the work plans for 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.990
 2013 you have come spring season 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.600
 summer where directly already on 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.010
 drive through parts appear and children and 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.800
 children on bicycles scooters motorcycles 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:13.530
 a large quantity that already gives us 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.720
 some kind of focus on 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.370
 identifying on their part the rules of motion 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.530
 because track statistics 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.850
 last year such road traffic 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.130
 there were enough incidents 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.510
 Thank you for the interesting conversation 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.630
 good luck thank you sitting 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.630
 not at all
