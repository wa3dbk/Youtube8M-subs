and<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.450> definitely<00:02:22.720> noticed<00:02:23.260> how<00:02:23.590> small<00:02:24.160> the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
and I definitely noticed how small the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.780 
and I definitely noticed how small the
toe<00:02:25.150> box<00:02:25.360> like<00:02:25.810> how<00:02:26.050> narrow<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.040> compared

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
toe box like how narrow it is compared

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.940 
toe box like how narrow it is compared
to<00:02:27.910> my<00:02:28.060> other<00:02:28.090> ones<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.170> I've<00:02:29.260> gotten<00:02:29.590> before

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
to my other ones that I've gotten before

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.910 
to my other ones that I've gotten before
I'll<00:02:31.080> show<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.290> other<00:02:32.440> shoe<00:02:32.710> really

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
I'll show you the other shoe really

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.110 
I'll show you the other shoe really
quick<00:02:34.620> again<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.830> laces<00:02:36.220> don't<00:02:36.550> even<00:02:36.910> match

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
quick again the laces don't even match

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.800 
quick again the laces don't even match
the<00:02:37.150> shoe<00:02:40.080> more<00:02:41.080> really<00:02:41.800> bad<00:02:41.980> glue<00:02:42.310> stains

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:55.640 

that's<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:47.910> but<00:02:48.910> ah<00:02:53.580> just<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.760> sweet<00:02:55.060> like

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
that's it but ah just the sweet like

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.050 
that's it but ah just the sweet like
it's<00:02:56.650> just<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.070> sway<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.520> makes<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.880> so

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
it's just a sway that makes it so

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.420 
it's just a sway that makes it so
obviously<00:02:58.510> fake<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.230> glue<00:02:59.410> stains<00:02:59.710> but

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
obviously fake and the glue stains but

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.870 
obviously fake and the glue stains but
the<00:03:00.610> insoles<00:03:01.240> are<00:03:01.570> what<00:03:02.520> actually<00:03:03.520> came<00:03:03.700> in

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
the insoles are what actually came in

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.880 
the insoles are what actually came in
like<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.120> real<00:03:04.300> ones<00:03:04.570> like<00:03:04.870> there<00:03:05.200> they<00:03:05.770> have

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
like the real ones like there they have

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.920 
like the real ones like there they have
a<00:03:05.950> printed<00:03:06.310> design<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:07.000> which<00:03:07.600> is<00:03:07.720> pretty

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
a printed design in it which is pretty

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.520 
a printed design in it which is pretty
sweet

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
sweet

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.240 
sweet
but<00:03:09.370> overall<00:03:10.350> it's<00:03:11.350> definitely<00:03:11.800> a<00:03:11.830> bad<00:03:11.950> shoe

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
but overall it's definitely a bad shoe

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.730 
but overall it's definitely a bad shoe
maybe<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.910> could<00:03:13.090> fix<00:03:14.020> it<00:03:14.140> up<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.380> little<00:03:14.470> bit

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
maybe you could fix it up a little bit

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.950 
maybe you could fix it up a little bit
any<00:03:15.040> by<00:03:15.250> getting<00:03:15.610> new<00:03:15.730> laces<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.570> get<00:03:16.720> some<00:03:16.900> of

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
any by getting new laces and get some of

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.320 
any by getting new laces and get some of
the<00:03:17.020> glue<00:03:17.320> off<00:03:17.530> but<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.580> really<00:03:18.940> can't<00:03:19.180> do

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
the glue off but you really can't do

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.210 
the glue off but you really can't do
anything<00:03:19.360> about<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.140> swoosh<00:03:20.470> it's<00:03:20.709> supposed

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
anything about the swoosh it's supposed

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.699 
anything about the swoosh it's supposed
to<00:03:21.370> be<00:03:22.410> suede

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
to be suede

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.740 
to be suede
um<00:03:24.100> another<00:03:24.580> thing<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.120> I'm<00:03:25.209> not<00:03:25.330> too<00:03:25.540> sure

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
um another thing that I'm not too sure

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.870 
um another thing that I'm not too sure
about<00:03:25.930> is<00:03:26.170> if<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.620> purple<00:03:27.070> color<00:03:27.310> actually

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
about is if the purple color actually

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.360 
about is if the purple color actually
matches<00:03:28.360> I<00:03:28.650> heard<00:03:29.650> some<00:03:29.890> problems<00:03:30.220> about

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
matches I heard some problems about

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.000 
matches I heard some problems about
purple<00:03:30.940> before<00:03:31.060> because<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:32.110> like<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.800> Dino

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
purple before because of like the Dino

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.520 
purple before because of like the Dino
juniors<00:03:33.550> are<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.570> purples<00:03:34.959> don't<00:03:35.260> match<00:03:35.500> up

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
juniors are the purples don't match up

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.210 
juniors are the purples don't match up
um<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:37.060> didn't<00:03:37.510> have<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:38.080> pair<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:38.980> purple

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
um I didn't have a pair of purple

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.180 
um I didn't have a pair of purple
pigeons<00:03:39.760> or<00:03:39.880> anyone<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.660> know<00:03:41.260> doesn't<00:03:42.070> have<00:03:42.160> a

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
pigeons or anyone I know doesn't have a

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.250 
pigeons or anyone I know doesn't have a
pair<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.459> her<00:03:42.670> religion<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.840> couldn't

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
pair of her religion so I couldn't

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.020 
pair of her religion so I couldn't
really<00:03:44.410> do<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.790> comparison

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
really do a comparison

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.690 
really do a comparison
I'll<00:03:46.260> do<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.380> fact<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.890> laces<00:03:48.340> are<00:03:48.489> so

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
I'll do the fact that the laces are so

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.920 
I'll do the fact that the laces are so
off<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.470> looked<00:03:50.470> in<00:03:50.620> pictures<00:03:51.100> and<00:03:51.370> uh<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:52.630> kind

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
off I looked in pictures and uh it kind

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.050 
off I looked in pictures and uh it kind
of<00:03:52.989> looks<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.320> little<00:03:53.530> bit<00:03:53.830> off<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.550> I<00:03:54.760> would

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
of looks a little bit off so I would

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.479 
of looks a little bit off so I would
even<00:03:55.300> think<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.780> purple<00:03:56.620> colorway<00:03:57.070> is<00:03:57.430> a

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
even think the purple colorway is a

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.430 
even think the purple colorway is a
little<00:03:57.940> bit<00:03:58.060> off<00:03:58.209> but<00:03:59.430> um<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:02.110> could<00:04:02.230> probably

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
little bit off but um you could probably

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.530 
little bit off but um you could probably
just<00:04:02.620> past<00:04:02.830> as<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.130> rubber<00:04:03.550> egative<00:04:03.910> nike

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
just past as a rubber egative nike

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.710 
just past as a rubber egative nike
with<00:04:04.750> definitely<00:04:05.170> not<00:04:05.380> like<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.940> like<00:04:07.330> a<00:04:07.360> pert

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
with definitely not like it like a pert

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.900 
with definitely not like it like a pert
look<00:04:08.080> like<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.290> purple<00:04:08.709> pigeon<00:04:09.100> like<00:04:09.430> again

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
look like a purple pigeon like again

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.940 
look like a purple pigeon like again
they<00:04:10.420> made<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.630> bunch<00:04:10.840> of<00:04:11.080> like<00:04:11.560> different

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
they made a bunch of like different

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.390 
they made a bunch of like different
designs<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.670> like<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:12.970> Gucci<00:04:13.390> high<00:04:14.130> lady<00:04:15.130> came

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
designs of like the Gucci high lady came

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.849 
designs of like the Gucci high lady came
out<00:04:15.519> on<00:04:15.610> the<00:04:15.700> regular<00:04:16.030> dunk<00:04:16.690> line<00:04:16.959> came<00:04:17.739> out

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
out on the regular dunk line came out

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.610 
out on the regular dunk line came out
and<00:04:17.980> SB<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:19.150> was<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.359> sample<00:04:19.840> like<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.440> can

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
and SB it was a sample like you can

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.260 
and SB it was a sample like you can
probably<00:04:20.890> pass<00:04:21.250> his<00:04:21.489> regular<00:04:21.760> Nike<00:04:22.120> but

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
probably pass his regular Nike but

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.240 
probably pass his regular Nike but
definitely<00:04:22.720> not<00:04:23.440> an<00:04:23.680> SB<00:04:24.100> shoe<00:04:24.370> um<00:04:25.560> besides<00:04:26.560> 9.5

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
definitely not an SB shoe um besides 9.5

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.310 
definitely not an SB shoe um besides 9.5
