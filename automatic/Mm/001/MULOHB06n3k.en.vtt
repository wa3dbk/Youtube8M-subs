00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.160
 for us to discuss the changes man 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.040
 who have brought here to Peru the world in 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.300
 an attack world track giselle very good 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.690
 thank you very much for this opportunity 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.940
 and this interview is not changed badly 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.589
 good months ago we were in brazil 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.750
 good they presented the full range of 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.920
 the products there and the expectation that 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.899
 had in Peru what are the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.399
 characteristics of their trucks and what 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.440
 use that have not been accompanied in the 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.930
 Brazil because in Brazil it was the first 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.600
 country in Latin America that was launched not 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.430
 the man truck line and it was also the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.149
 first truck man produced outside 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.899
 germany was a man truck made 100% 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.670
 in Brazil today in Peru we are the first 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.649
 country after brazil where we are 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.110
 making the launch of our 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.970
 products in Latin America our 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.729
 main objective is that with the 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.229
 Man products, let's go to complement the 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.110
 products that we already import 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.960
 for 19 years with brands form 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.210
 in trucks and buses is to say that with 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.820
 shape of trucks and buses we arrived 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.280
 motorization up to 320 horses and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.130
 coman we will complement the line form in 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.939
 with 360 horsepower engines up 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.159
 reaching the most powerful 480 engine 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.320
 horses said for example here they had 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.350
 15 change them sold before they arrive 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.030
 Peru if in fact I think they are a 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.590
 little more but we have wanted 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.869
 keep this in reserve because we wanted to 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.060
 really that this release was e 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.130
 we have not even demanded the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.989
 trucks that spend time here already 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.580
 starting tomorrow we will go from some 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.810
 way revealing part these secrets and 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.030
 sincerely that augured many successes 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.819
 for the brand many customers already from 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.950
 many years ago they even waited with 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.549
 you crave the key of trucks man and here 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.200
 we are already present this forever and 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.180
 all the years that come by 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.380
 go ahead as you know but it's a 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.349
 mining country and mining activity and 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.549
 construction both have been the most 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.910
 growth have shown the last 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.350
 years on the other hand Peru is a country that 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.770
 difference from other countries of 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.610
 Latin America 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.350
 despite the European crisis our 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.700
 economy our gross domestic product 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.740
 keeps growing we had the news 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.500
 today that we are growing in 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.170
 more than 6% and well all this means 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.760
 a great opportunity for us the 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.320
 today launch our products man 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.110
 that are going to attend just these two 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.290
 mining and construction segments with 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.760
 extra heavy truck trucks 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.370
 Approved and optimized to work 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.430
 in very severe conditions in countries 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.310
 as peru with a rugged geography 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.110
 with little paved roads and 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.300
 we are talking countries as countries of 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.090
 Africa Middle East countries 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.410
 very extreme conditions that way and 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.000
 with the experience that man has for 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.130
 have their markets which we have 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.330
 configured this line of trucks that 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.930
 Soon we will be offering to the market 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.360
 Peruvian 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.920
 we have here for this 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.940
 conference that we have brought a 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.530
 truck tractor 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.020
 What is it 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.150
 a vehicle to transport cargo of 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.010
 long distance stockings as you will see 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.140
 you all the trucks have the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.300
 first two acronyms that represent the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.860
 vehicular gross vehicle weight and 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.020
 next is the approximate power of 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.010
 engine in this case that this is going to be 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.140
 our star truck the 40 480 is a 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.660
 dedicated rigid chassis truck for 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.790
 one application of the tipper 40 ton 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.459
 of gross vehicle weight with a power 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.250
 of 480 horsepower which is a power 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.840
 superior to what it brings in our 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.310
 brands and with which we will compete 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.530
 the brands with which we are going to 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.120
 compete in the market then then 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.700
 invite her through the world suit 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.190
 our carrier of the world perch for 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.950
 that go and see is also and buy it 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.930
 if we wait for you in our dealer here 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.270
 in Lima that is located in the district 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.500
 of santa anita almost the intersection of 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.090
 the road avoidance with the road 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.040
 central 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.410
 stÃ©dile is called euro trucks we have 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.440
 infrastructure of more than 7 thousand 500 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.240
 square meters where they can 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.800
 contemplate and see the range of models and 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.790
 The greatest technical specifications of 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.920
 logic 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.030
 We are with frame function and man 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.580
 Brazil 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.580
 first of all, welcome to Peru and now 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.140
 good the expectation that is not about 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.550
 the presentation of these roads image 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.440
 when we were not there in Brazil 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.990
 I mentioned the one on the avenue here 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.580
 but let's see if it 's when I saw if you from 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.680
 launch of the lines of ex in 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.050
 brazil euro5 you were with us 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.360
 it was a very big taste we were already 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.430
 foreseeing the entry into other countries of 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.430
 Latin America is not there but it was one of the 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.740
 main targets because Peru is today 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.020
 undoubtedly one of the most 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.940
 important of latin america just 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.340
 look at the growth of the Peruvian market 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.920
 so you have the answer of why 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.260
 We are also investing in Peru 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.060
 not this are specifically being soft 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.420
 in europe we are going to bring the euro line 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.550
 3 from Germany euro line 5 that is 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.350
