airtight and waterproof pressurization
is<00:00:59.420> an<00:00:59.630> issue<00:00:59.810> so<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.730> valves<00:01:01.730> are<00:01:01.880> built<00:01:02.210> into

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
is an issue so the valves are built into

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.970 
is an issue so the valves are built into
the<00:01:02.660> latches<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:03.290> if<00:01:03.410> I'm<00:01:03.620> changing

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
the latches so if I'm changing

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.880 
the latches so if I'm changing

temperatures or changing altitudes all I
have<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.189> do<00:01:07.310> is<00:01:07.430> open<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:07.909> valve<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.420> it

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
have to do is open the valve and it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.050 
have to do is open the valve and it
equalizes<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.290> pressure<00:01:09.640> allowing<00:01:10.640> an<00:01:10.759> easy

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
equalizes the pressure allowing an easy

that seal for the waterproof protection

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.980 
that seal for the waterproof protection
you<00:01:25.580> want<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:25.880> make<00:01:26.030> sure<00:01:26.299> that<00:01:26.510> as<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:26.780> use

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
you want to make sure that as you use

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.200 
you want to make sure that as you use
these<00:01:27.200> these<00:01:27.560> stay<00:01:27.890> free<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.340> debris<00:01:28.549> because

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
these these stay free of debris because

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.469 
these these stay free of debris because
again<00:01:29.540> they<00:01:29.720> create<00:01:30.080> that<00:01:30.260> waterproof<00:01:30.620> seal

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
again they create that waterproof seal

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.840 
again they create that waterproof seal
