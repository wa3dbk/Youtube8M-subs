00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
understand that that sexy thing was only

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.840 
understand that that sexy thing was only
created<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:36.030> allow<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.890> behavior<00:01:37.890> which<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
created to allow this behavior which I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.690 
created to allow this behavior which I
said<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:40.200> usually<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> digital<00:01:41.100> thing<00:01:41.400> which

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
said is it usually a digital thing which

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.850 
said is it usually a digital thing which
and<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.689> digital<00:01:43.079> because<00:01:43.259> that's<00:01:43.560> scalable

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and it's digital because that's scalable

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.080 
and it's digital because that's scalable
and<00:01:44.570> create<00:01:45.570> amazing<00:01:46.049> ROI<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and create amazing ROI and so the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.420 
and create amazing ROI and so the
linking<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.659> those<00:01:48.869> two<00:01:49.140> things<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.890> really

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
linking of those two things is really

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.010 
linking of those two things is really
manifold<00:01:51.090> strong<00:01:51.570> suit<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:54.509> way<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.899> we
