today we're going to talk about the new
balance<00:00:04.230> minimus<00:00:04.680> road<00:00:05.810> zeroes<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.040> we<00:00:08.040> have

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
balance minimus road zeroes and we have

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.940 
balance minimus road zeroes and we have
that<00:00:08.550> here<00:00:08.910> i<00:00:09.090> have<00:00:09.750> put<00:00:10.050> about<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.620> hundred

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
that here i have put about a hundred

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.870 
that here i have put about a hundred
miles<00:00:11.309> on<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:12.300> shoe<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.009> so<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.400> got<00:00:14.849> a

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
miles on the shoe and so that got a

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.390 
miles on the shoe and so that got a
chance<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.299> using<00:00:15.750> quite<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.960> bit<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
chance to using quite a bit in it's a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.220 
chance to using quite a bit in it's a
really<00:00:17.850> nice<00:00:18.090> shoe<00:00:18.330> it's<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.510> very<00:00:18.690> minimal

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
really nice shoe it's a very minimal

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.950 
really nice shoe it's a very minimal
shoe<00:00:19.439> again<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.850> kind<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> zero

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
shoe again with the kind of the zero

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.920 
shoe again with the kind of the zero
drop<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.500> very<00:00:22.650> minimal<00:00:23.210> type<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.390> shoes<00:00:24.810> that

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
drop and very minimal type of shoes that

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.509 
drop and very minimal type of shoes that
that<00:00:25.410> new<00:00:25.590> balance<00:00:25.890> has<00:00:25.980> been<00:00:26.010> really

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
that new balance has been really

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.849 
that new balance has been really
focusing<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.359> doing<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.960> lot<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
focusing on in doing a lot of in the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.429 
focusing on in doing a lot of in the
last<00:00:29.010> couple<00:00:29.250> years<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.140> zero

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
last couple years it is a it is a zero

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.709 
last couple years it is a it is a zero
drop<00:00:31.740> there's<00:00:32.009> about<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.219> 12<00:00:32.550> millimeter<00:00:32.759> drop

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
drop there's about a 12 millimeter drop

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.370 
drop there's about a 12 millimeter drop
on<00:00:33.989> both<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.739> heel<00:00:35.100> as<00:00:35.520> well<00:00:35.730> as<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.050> 444<00:00:37.050> foot

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
on both the heel as well as the 444 foot

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.709 
on both the heel as well as the 444 foot
so<00:00:37.770> there<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> zero<00:00:38.670> drop<00:00:38.969> as<00:00:39.180> far<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.510> that

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so there is a zero drop as far as that

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.819 
so there is a zero drop as far as that
goes<00:00:39.950> it<00:00:40.950> does<00:00:41.129> use<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:42.230> vibram<00:00:43.230> spotted

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
goes it does use the vibram spotted

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.650 
goes it does use the vibram spotted
outsole<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.899> see<00:00:46.110> here

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
outsole so you can kind of see here

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.729 
outsole so you can kind of see here
there's<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> whole<00:00:49.079> lot<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.350> traction

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
there's not a whole lot of traction

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.729 
there's not a whole lot of traction
underneath<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.530> shoe

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
underneath it and but it is it is a shoe

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.520 
underneath it and but it is it is a shoe
that's<00:00:52.920> meant<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.660> used<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> road<00:00:55.140> so

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that's meant to be used on the road so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.139 
that's meant to be used on the road so
it's<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.129> something<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.760> want<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.030> really

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
it's not something you want to really

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.150 
it's not something you want to really
take<00:00:57.360> off<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.690> trails<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.649> take<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
take off the trails to take on the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.430 
take off the trails to take on the
trails<00:00:59.430> or<00:00:59.670> take<00:01:00.539> off<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> pavement<00:01:00.989> too<00:01:01.260> much

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
trails or take off the pavement too much

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.420 
trails or take off the pavement too much
it<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> very<00:01:02.629> minimal<00:01:03.629> shoe<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.619> about

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it is a very minimal shoe it is about

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.109 
it is a very minimal shoe it is about
6.1<00:01:06.360> else's<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.290> very<00:01:08.010> lightweight<00:01:08.280> shoe<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
6.1 else's so very lightweight shoe and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.300 
6.1 else's so very lightweight shoe and
as<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.420> see<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.720> very<00:01:09.990> flexible<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.710> can

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
as you see it's very flexible I can

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.270 
as you see it's very flexible I can
really<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:12.750> know<00:01:12.869> bend<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.500> number<00:01:14.159> of

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
really you know bend it a number of

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.520 
really you know bend it a number of
different<00:01:14.340> ways<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.299> know<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.600> far<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
different ways you know as far as the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.179 
different ways you know as far as the
flexibility<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.210> actually<00:01:18.689> do<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> lot<00:01:19.920> as

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
flexibility you can actually do a lot as

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.429 
flexibility you can actually do a lot as
far<00:01:20.250> as<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> flexibility<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> shoe

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
far as just the flexibility of the shoe

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.149 
far as just the flexibility of the shoe
so<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> very<00:01:24.110> minimal<00:01:25.110> shoe<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.799> be<00:01:25.950> sure

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
so it is a very minimal shoe to be sure

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.060 
so it is a very minimal shoe to be sure
so<00:01:26.520> for<00:01:27.150> me<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:28.049> other<00:01:28.200> runners<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.950> are

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
so for me and for other runners that are

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.830 
so for me and for other runners that are
just<00:01:29.280> getting<00:01:29.460> into<00:01:29.729> using<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> minimal<00:01:30.360> shoe<00:01:30.600> I

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
just getting into using a minimal shoe I

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.399 
just getting into using a minimal shoe I
would<00:01:31.350> work<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.430> very<00:01:32.610> slowly<00:01:32.790> kind<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.409> get

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
would work it in very slowly kind of get

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.380 
would work it in very slowly kind of get
your<00:01:34.590> feet<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.130> your<00:01:35.700> legs<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.270> everything

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
your feet and your legs and everything

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.469 
your feet and your legs and everything
used<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.930> wearing<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.890> very<00:01:38.430> minimal<00:01:38.970> shoe<00:01:39.210> I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
used to wearing a very minimal shoe I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.679 
used to wearing a very minimal shoe I
would<00:01:40.049> probably<00:01:40.470> compare<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.820> wearing

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
would probably compare it to wearing

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.359 
would probably compare it to wearing
actually<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.079> vibrams<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:43.710> or<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> very

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
actually the vibrams or or a very

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.399 
actually the vibrams or or a very
minimal<00:01:44.939> minimal<00:01:45.090> shoe<00:01:45.479> there<00:01:45.960> really<00:01:46.200> isn't

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
minimal minimal shoe there really isn't

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.230 
minimal minimal shoe there really isn't
much<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.430> really<00:01:47.610> feel<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> lot<00:01:48.210> of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
much and you can really feel a lot of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.990 
much and you can really feel a lot of
the<00:01:48.420> road<00:01:48.600> anything<00:01:49.439> underneath<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.790> this

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the road anything underneath you in this

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.260 
the road anything underneath you in this
shoe<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.610> would<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.149> know<00:01:54.180> I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
shoe and so I I would you know I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.810 
shoe and so I I would you know I
recommend<00:01:54.840> working<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.829> slowly<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.640> you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
recommend working it in slowly if you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.969 
recommend working it in slowly if you
haven't<00:01:57.119> had<00:01:57.540> or<00:01:57.930> used<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.530> type<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.770> shoe

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
haven't had or used this type of shoe

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.240 
haven't had or used this type of shoe
before<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.549> would<00:02:00.000> definitely<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.009> work

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
before I would definitely you know work

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.719 
before I would definitely you know work
it<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.689> some<00:02:03.689> your<00:02:03.810> speed<00:02:04.049> workouts<00:02:04.439> or<00:02:04.740> some

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
it in some your speed workouts or some

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.429 
it in some your speed workouts or some
your<00:02:05.880> track<00:02:06.090> workouts<00:02:06.509> first<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.140> get<00:02:07.290> used

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
your track workouts first and get used

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.930 
your track workouts first and get used
to<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.740> before<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.069> taking<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.520> too<00:02:08.789> many

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
to it before you taking on too many

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.460 
to it before you taking on too many
longer<00:02:09.869> runs<00:02:10.250> they<00:02:11.250> fit<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.209> feel<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.629> is

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
longer runs they fit and feel of it is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.440 
longer runs they fit and feel of it is
really<00:02:13.950> nice<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.310> really<00:02:14.520> do<00:02:14.940> like<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.240> feel<00:02:15.420> of

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
really nice I really do like the feel of

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.450 
really nice I really do like the feel of
it<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:16.110> can<00:02:16.170> kind<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.470> see<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.130> little

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
it you can kind of see it is a little

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.750 
it you can kind of see it is a little
wider<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.990> toe<00:02:19.140> box<00:02:19.350> here<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:20.040> for<00:02:20.610> me<00:02:20.730> I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
wider in the toe box here so for me I

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.840 
wider in the toe box here so for me I
have<00:02:20.970> slightly<00:02:21.300> wider<00:02:21.630> feet<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.100> nice

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
have slightly wider feet so it is a nice

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.500 
have slightly wider feet so it is a nice
fit<00:02:24.180> as<00:02:24.330> far<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.780> goes<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:26.190> wraps<00:02:26.970> really

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
fit as far as that goes it wraps really

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.290 
fit as far as that goes it wraps really
well<00:02:27.720> again<00:02:27.980> with<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.160> laces<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.760> on<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
well again with the laces and on the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.720 
well again with the laces and on the
forefront<00:02:30.630> there's<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.170> nice<00:02:31.380> snug<00:02:31.710> feeling<00:02:32.160> to

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
forefront there's a nice snug feeling to

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.060 
forefront there's a nice snug feeling to
the<00:02:32.880> shoe<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:34.440> whole<00:02:35.430> upper<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.090> the

the shoe and the whole upper and the
wrap<00:02:38.070> on<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.550> really<00:02:39.030> nice<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.540> breeze

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
wrap on it is really nice it's breeze

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.800 
wrap on it is really nice it's breeze
really<00:02:40.140> well<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:41.150> just<00:02:42.150> hence<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.450> has<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.600> nice

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810

really well and just hence it has a nice
feel<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.320> but<00:02:43.860> again<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> very<00:02:45.110> there

feel to it but again it is a very there

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.830 
feel to it but again it is a very there
there's<00:02:46.350> not<00:02:46.560> much<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.760> shoe<00:02:47.970> from<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
there's not much to the shoe from the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.140 
there's not much to the shoe from the
top<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.320> bottom<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:49.890> as<00:02:50.280> far<00:02:50.580> as<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:51.090> know

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
top and the bottom so as far as you know

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.270 
top and the bottom so as far as you know
having<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.480> make<00:02:51.600> any<00:02:51.780> turns<00:02:52.050> or<00:02:52.470> or<00:02:52.860> doing

having to make any turns or or doing

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.490 
having to make any turns or or doing
anything<00:02:53.520> too<00:02:54.090> aggressive<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.260> shoe

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
anything too aggressive in the shoe

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.850 
anything too aggressive in the shoe
you're<00:02:56.160> going<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.370> have<00:02:57.350> not<00:02:58.350> much<00:02:58.590> there<00:02:58.800> to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
you're going to have not much there to

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.140 
you're going to have not much there to
really<00:02:59.270> wrap<00:03:00.270> or<00:03:00.600> provide<00:03:01.230> any<00:03:01.470> support<00:03:02.150> for

really wrap or provide any support for

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.660 
really wrap or provide any support for
fro<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.480> shoes<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.110> again<00:03:04.709> very<00:03:04.740> minimal<00:03:05.459> shoe

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
fro the shoes so again very minimal shoe

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.690 
fro the shoes so again very minimal shoe
one<00:03:06.450> slightly<00:03:07.290> unique<00:03:07.680> feature<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.459> it

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
one slightly unique feature is that it

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.970 
one slightly unique feature is that it
has<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.570> doesn't<00:03:09.840> have<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:09.990> removable<00:03:10.320> insole

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
has a it doesn't have a removable insole

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.030 
has a it doesn't have a removable insole
so<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.970> can't<00:03:12.180> really<00:03:12.240> see<00:03:12.420> inside<00:03:12.900> but<00:03:13.140> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
so you can't really see inside but the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.360 
so you can't really see inside but the
insole<00:03:14.459> here<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.750> can't<00:03:15.990> take<00:03:16.230> out<00:03:16.410> so<00:03:16.709> for

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
insole here is you can't take out so for

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.870 
insole here is you can't take out so for
people<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.880> might<00:03:18.590> replace<00:03:19.590> or<00:03:19.950> have<00:03:20.580> some

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
people that might replace or have some

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.300 
people that might replace or have some
additional<00:03:21.450> support<00:03:21.959> they<00:03:22.140> put<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.860> the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
additional support they put in the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.670 
additional support they put in the
actual<00:03:23.880> insole<00:03:24.239> of<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.420> shoe<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:25.410> can't

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
actual insole of the shoe you can't

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.040 
actual insole of the shoe you can't
really<00:03:25.830> do<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.190> can't<00:03:27.030> really<00:03:27.120> take<00:03:27.330> out<00:03:27.480> the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
really do this can't really take out the

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.940 
really do this can't really take out the
insole<00:03:28.440> for<00:03:29.040> their<00:03:29.280> shoe<00:03:29.550> but<00:03:30.380> overall<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.739> very

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
insole for their shoe but overall a very

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.940 
insole for their shoe but overall a very
good<00:03:32.850> shoe<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.330> guess<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.320> pros<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.620> it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
good shoe I guess the the pros of it

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.470 
good shoe I guess the the pros of it
would<00:03:35.160> be<00:03:35.310> really<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:36.860> basic<00:03:37.860> shoe<00:03:38.700> for<00:03:39.060> someone

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
would be really a basic shoe for someone

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.729 
would be really a basic shoe for someone
that's<00:03:39.630> really<00:03:39.840> we're<00:03:40.019> looking<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.440> have<00:03:40.560> that

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
that's really we're looking to have that

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.410 
that's really we're looking to have that
very<00:03:40.860> minimalist<00:03:41.459> shoe<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.880> think<00:03:42.299> it'd<00:03:42.390> be

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
very minimalist shoe I think it'd be

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.960 
very minimalist shoe I think it'd be
great<00:03:42.780> for<00:03:42.810> speed<00:03:43.350> workouts<00:03:43.769> getting<00:03:44.760> on<00:03:44.850> the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
great for speed workouts getting on the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.270 
great for speed workouts getting on the
track<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.720> type<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:45.959> type<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:47.040> training

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
track and that type of type of training

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.539 
track and that type of type of training
I<00:03:48.060> guess<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.410> depends<00:03:49.739> on<00:03:49.830> how<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:49.980> want<00:03:50.459> to

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
I guess it depends on how you want to

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.690 
I guess it depends on how you want to
use<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.790> for<00:03:51.920> racing<00:03:52.920> flag<00:03:53.220> it's<00:03:53.519> definitely

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
use it for racing flag it's definitely

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.820 
use it for racing flag it's definitely
light<00:03:54.060> enough<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.570> be<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.019> racing<00:03:55.380> flat<00:03:55.590> but

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
light enough to be a racing flat but

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.370 
light enough to be a racing flat but
again<00:03:56.370> it's<00:03:56.519> very<00:03:56.820> very<00:03:57.090> minimal<00:03:57.269> so<00:03:57.780> if<00:03:58.200> you'd

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
again it's very very minimal so if you'd

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.020 
again it's very very minimal so if you'd
like<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.590> have<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.830> little<00:03:59.070> bit<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.370> support<00:03:59.580> or

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
like to have a little bit of support or

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.660 
like to have a little bit of support or
cushioning<00:04:00.660> when<00:04:00.930> you're<00:04:01.049> racing<00:04:01.489> you<00:04:02.489> might

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
cushioning when you're racing you might

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.740 
cushioning when you're racing you might
want<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.910> go<00:04:02.940> with<00:04:03.030> more<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.570> traditional

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
want to go with more of a traditional

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.259 
want to go with more of a traditional
flat<00:04:04.320> but<00:04:04.709> this<00:04:05.220> is<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.430> great<00:04:05.700> shoe<00:04:05.850> overall

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
flat but this is a great shoe overall

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.050 
flat but this is a great shoe overall
the<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.350> drop<00:04:07.560> accent<00:04:07.950> or<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.280> cons<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:08.880> guess

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
the the drop accent or the cons I guess

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.620 
the the drop accent or the cons I guess
for<00:04:09.239> this<00:04:09.390> shoe<00:04:09.630> would<00:04:10.080> be<00:04:10.400> just<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.549> it<00:04:12.450> does

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
for this shoe would be just that it does

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.699 
for this shoe would be just that it does
take<00:04:12.810> some<00:04:12.930> while<00:04:13.110> to<00:04:13.230> get<00:04:13.320> used<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.680> it

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
take some while to get used to it

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.350 
take some while to get used to it
because<00:04:14.190> there's<00:04:14.489> really<00:04:14.700> not<00:04:14.880> much<00:04:15.090> there

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
because there's really not much there

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.199 
because there's really not much there
it's<00:04:15.690> kind<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.560> very<00:04:16.620> very<00:04:17.130> minimal<00:04:17.700> in<00:04:18.030> all

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
it's kind of very very minimal in all

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.030 
it's kind of very very minimal in all
aspects<00:04:18.750> not<00:04:18.840> just<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.320> cushioning<00:04:19.950> and

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
aspects not just the cushioning and

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.360 
aspects not just the cushioning and
support<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.760> getting<00:04:21.419> used<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:22.130> took<00:04:23.130> is

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
support so getting used to it took is

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.510 
support so getting used to it took is
still<00:04:23.820> taking<00:04:24.120> me<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.240> while<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:24.780> so<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:25.770> it's

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
still taking me a while and so you it's

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.410 
still taking me a while and so you it's
not<00:04:26.729> something<00:04:27.030> that

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
not something that

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.300 
not something that
every<00:04:27.630> runner<00:04:27.810> can<00:04:28.020> just<00:04:28.170> jump<00:04:28.350> jump<00:04:28.890> into<00:04:29.040> and

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
every runner can just jump jump into and

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.030 
every runner can just jump jump into and
start<00:04:29.460> using<00:04:29.610> right<00:04:29.730> away<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.590> overall<00:04:31.590> very

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
start using right away so overall very

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.460 
start using right away so overall very
good<00:04:32.160> shoe<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.820> think<00:04:33.150> it<00:04:33.360> really<00:04:33.600> has<00:04:34.260> its

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
good shoe I think it really has its

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.370 
good shoe I think it really has its
place<00:04:34.650> as<00:04:34.860> far<00:04:35.070> as<00:04:35.220> what<00:04:36.210> type<00:04:36.420> of<00:04:36.450> runner<00:04:37.110> or

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
place as far as what type of runner or

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.870 
place as far as what type of runner or
what<00:04:37.710> type<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.860> workout<00:04:38.190> you're<00:04:38.340> using<00:04:38.520> it<00:04:38.760> in

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
what type of workout you're using it in

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.110 
what type of workout you're using it in
but<00:04:39.450> i<00:04:39.930> do<00:04:40.380> feel<00:04:40.860> it's<00:04:41.010> going<00:04:41.190> to<00:04:41.250> be<00:04:41.400> a<00:04:41.430> really

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
but i do feel it's going to be a really

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.400 
but i do feel it's going to be a really
good<00:04:42.240> shoe<00:04:42.420> for<00:04:42.630> me<00:04:42.720> hopefully<00:04:42.930> i<00:04:43.050> can<00:04:43.080> use<00:04:43.290> it

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
good shoe for me hopefully i can use it

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.620 
good shoe for me hopefully i can use it
for<00:04:43.590> quite<00:04:44.490> a<00:04:44.550> bit<00:04:44.820> just<00:04:45.030> because<00:04:45.120> there's<00:04:45.510> not

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
for quite a bit just because there's not

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.840 
for quite a bit just because there's not
much<00:04:45.840> there<00:04:46.050> in<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.890> in<00:04:47.130> the<00:04:47.190> cushioning

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
much there in the in the cushioning

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.170 
much there in the in the cushioning
support<00:04:48.330> or<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:48.840> shoe<00:04:49.050> in<00:04:49.170> general<00:04:49.590> so<00:04:49.940> as<00:04:50.940> far

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
support or the shoe in general so as far

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.700 
support or the shoe in general so as far
as<00:04:51.330> longevity<00:04:51.630> i'm<00:04:52.110> hoping<00:04:52.350> to<00:04:52.380> get<00:04:52.500> quite<00:04:52.680> a

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
as longevity i'm hoping to get quite a

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.980 
as longevity i'm hoping to get quite a
few<00:04:52.770> miles<00:04:53.070> out<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.370> bitches<00:04:53.760> because<00:04:53.990> there's

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
few miles out of bitches because there's

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.440 
few miles out of bitches because there's
not<00:04:55.170> a<00:04:55.200> whole<00:04:55.350> lot<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.650> really<00:04:55.980> go<00:04:56.130> bad<00:04:56.340> on<00:04:56.640> the

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
not a whole lot to really go bad on the

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.970 
not a whole lot to really go bad on the
shoe<00:04:57.630> unless<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:58.020> start<00:04:58.320> wearing<00:04:58.590> a<00:04:58.680> hole<00:04:58.860> in

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
shoe unless I start wearing a hole in

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.710 
shoe unless I start wearing a hole in
them<00:04:59.130> so<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.670> think<00:05:00.030> it's<00:05:00.210> going<00:05:00.330> to<00:05:00.420> be<00:05:00.510> a<00:05:00.540> good

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
them so I think it's going to be a good

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.580 
them so I think it's going to be a good
shoe<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:02.390> overall<00:05:03.390> I<00:05:03.420> think<00:05:03.690> it's<00:05:03.960> definitely

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
shoe and overall I think it's definitely

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.680 
shoe and overall I think it's definitely
recommended<00:05:05.250> for<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.730> runner<00:05:06.180> that's<00:05:06.420> looking

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
recommended for a runner that's looking

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.290 
recommended for a runner that's looking
to<00:05:06.840> get<00:05:07.050> into<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.950> very<00:05:08.520> minimal<00:05:08.970> shoe<00:05:09.180> without

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
to get into a very minimal shoe without

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.810 
to get into a very minimal shoe without
going<00:05:09.690> to<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.710> extremes<00:05:11.280> of<00:05:11.460> you<00:05:11.730> know

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
going to the extremes of you know

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.660 
going to the extremes of you know
barefoot<00:05:12.360> or<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.500> vibram<00:05:13.950> five<00:05:14.370> bigger

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
barefoot or to the vibram five bigger

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.880 
barefoot or to the vibram five bigger
type<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.150> shoe<00:05:15.270> like<00:05:15.480> that<00:05:15.690> so<00:05:15.960> overall<00:05:16.620> very

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
type of shoe like that so overall very

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.340 
type of shoe like that so overall very
good<00:05:16.980> shoot
