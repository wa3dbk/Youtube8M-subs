00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.480
 I like it at the kickoff that I really like what I am there 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.440
 I can also say that I am not going to try 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.980
 but that is not a goal 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.560
 the school more or the council states that things are going well in the netherlands it is now 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.290
 not much water is very well known for the sport so I think that's what I think 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.750
 I'm glad I got through despite that it's not a good cause but then you get it 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.860
