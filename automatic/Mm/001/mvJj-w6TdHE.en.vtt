00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi friends i hope you go 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.450
 well so sixth day on the limits 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.529
 so how to transform its limits 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.450
 in strength 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.780
 so yesterday we saw how to put 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.150
 concrete actions to put in place in 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.990
 the material in the outside is 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.609
 really very important 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.109
 I hope you did it or that I 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.310
 shows you started doing it if 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.050
 you have not done it I invite you to the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.670
 redo to watch the videos if you 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.449
 did not do it frankly 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.150
 Its very important 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.619
 unless you want to do a little 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.810
 like everyone else ie stay 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.730
 within its limits repeat a hundred times a hundred 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.309
 times a thousand times ten thousand times the same 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.809
 thing and then happened at the end of his life 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.790
 with regrets but I do not think so 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.200
 if you are here it is that I do not think 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.520
 is that somewhere you want 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.780
 so put it into action as soon as 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.850
 now i will be honest with 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.079
 you it's not easy from the beginning but 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.160
 after a time when you did 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.700
 we will say that it will be difficult to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.039
 to go a week 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.969
 go big max two weeks but at 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.219
 after a while you will see 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.030
 go dependent you will love to pass 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.770
 at the action you loved it widening your 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.989
 possibilities give you a choice 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.080
 exceptional allow you to move 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.210
 the boundaries that you have where you go 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.100
 addicted to turning all of your 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.180
 limits in force so take action 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.729
 friends if you have not done 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.540
 today we are not going to find 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.950
 concrete actions 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.360
 except that we are not going to pick them up 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.520
 in the outside we will not put in 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.590
 place actions in the outside so 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.460
 what should I do what is 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.430
 what am I doing what I have the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.930
 opportunity to do for the valley 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.270
 search inside and actually 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.960
 honestly this is the most important 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.369
 it is to reprogram his interior on 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.549
 can we see that with the results we 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.939
 maybe it's an impact on us but we have 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.710
 a better 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.880
 we have a better impact on us if we 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.450
 ourselves our program we 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.280
 internally 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.619
 so how does this program internally 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.060
 how to have the inner program that 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.920
 allows us to actually move our 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.030
 limits just then 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.590
 I have a question it's a question 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.009
 that you have to ask I'll go 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.220
 to ask it is how you will be so 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.290
 you had no limits 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.740
 how will you act when you act 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.170
 if you have no limits 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.149
 how will you talk to people how 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.830
 you'll see things imagine you 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.319
 have full confidence in you 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.569
 what would you do how you 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.489
 dye you will hold like that no I 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.200
 do not think how do you dye yourself 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.000
 would hold if you had if you had a 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.530
 hyper confidence in you what is that 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.800
 you would do if you had serious of 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.530
 the money how will you talk to you 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.959
 how will you speak to yourself in 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.299
 noted all that or if you do not want 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.690
 note it but recorded plan you 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.670
 in a moment where or in the future or 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.600
 in the imagination of the fact that you 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.060
 have no limits 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.440
 in fact it's very important to actually do that 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.390
 it's an exercise to do almost all 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.340
 the days to do it every day 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.660
 as if you have no limit you 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.450
 look how you would act how 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.190
 is actually you reprogrammed yourself further 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.870
 doing it really so a 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.120
 once you've done that it's by 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.709
 example if I trust myself if 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.079
 I really had confidence in myself 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.570
 will hold like that will keep me right 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.140
 I'll have a piercing look I'll have the 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.810
 head held high 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.600
 smile I will have a smile and I 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.420
 will talk to people with confidence and 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.190
 I would dare to approach them besides 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.290
 do it 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.209
 by force that you will think it by force 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.190
 that you are going to imagine having 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.709
 confidence in you the camera flew 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.959
 real french boss 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.060
 you're going to actually reprogrammed 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.709
 internally and ultimately 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.530
 the more you'll imagine right by 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.830
 example more you're going to be if you 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.930
 if you do not think it will come to you 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.660
 think about it and think about it 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.950
 so you're like that you're going 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.819
 think bitterness and holds right to 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.530
 premiums is a right that at the end of a 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.810
 moment you will stand right 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.980
 instantly 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.630
 I have to tackle the hood that I 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.250
 say hello I have to ask 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.720
 questions cauxoise a whole lot of stuff 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.090
 crazy i call clients etc 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.620
 by dint of thinking about it you're going to do it 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.390
 you will do it consciously at 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.040
 start but after you're going to be told to 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.480
 to say that you will not be able to 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.959
 do if you are like that 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.970
 usually 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.540
 by dint of staying upright you're going 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.500
 stay upright but after a while if 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.000
 you end up like that you 're going 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.860
 so addict to staying straight 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.030
 that you have not be able to stay like 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.760
 that you will hand you say right 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.110
 so imagine you really if you 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.300
 had no wet in fact is a trick 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.010
 that I would like to tell you is that if 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.680
 some people gets there 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.950
 you can get there in fact there is 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.930
 nothing that has nothing that is how 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.820
 to say who is blocked kefi g8 can there 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.830
 to get to him he can not get there 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.090
 shy then he and he's confident no 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.310
 it does not happen like that everything happens 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.289
 in there friends so re program 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.820
 your in there your brain other 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.250
 inner programs your subconscious 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.720
 you call it what you want and you 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.690
 see that it's really very 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.340
 very very very very very very very powerful 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.110
 so we'll meet again tomorrow for the 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.940
 last day on the limits and 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.810
 take action friends frankly 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.410
 it is for you that I do it here I am 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.720
 have nothing to do 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.979
 you just have to take action you 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.510
 want to succeed you do not want to succeed 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.039
 I sometimes have the impression that 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.070
 plays a momentum they want not managed a 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:15.760
 look yeah that's fine would have omitted the 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.900
 reason it's cool what he says 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.770
 then close the video he goes on to another 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.060
 thing no friends on 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.889
 wants to make a success of his life we ​​take action 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.419
 or not we go to action 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.639
 so I'm counting on you to move on to 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.660
 the action I do big kisses months on 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.770
 will meet again tomorrow for the last 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.009
 video about the limits 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.009
 ciao
