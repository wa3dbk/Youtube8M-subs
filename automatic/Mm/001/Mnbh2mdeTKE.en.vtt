00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750
 I think the first thing to do 

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:05.750
 first of all, network also girls boys 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:15.000
 they understood this thing 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:18.180
 this does not like to be a victim of us 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.640
 same this victimization these me not 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.109
 I really don't like it 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.730
 tomorrow we have the first game of 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.449
 champions the important game 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.279
 we will have to try to win the kala 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.880
 end what counts then the result 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.280
 because then later if you make a goal more 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.250
 of the opponent manages to win well the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.960
 things all in a certain way if instead 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.219
 fails to make 16 when done 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.160
 in the two home games you see things 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.930
 in another way and therefore also in 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.309
 this period surely where we have 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.510
 nor is there the league in the best of 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.750
 ways but often that we have a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.829
 plus point is the only positive note 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.149
 compared to last year and must 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.799
 think of the part tomorrow seeing the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.799
 things in a positive way because the team 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.780
 maybe in the difficulties of the game 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.080
 has not made any matches 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.520
 spectacular though both with the sampdoria 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.340
 that with the atantanta we have created 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:26.450
 different favorable situations and we have 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.869
 immediately two goals compared to the occasions 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.750
 granted 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.329
 I believe that the average realization of the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.369
 the opposing team has been very high 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.840
 and the evil went that what they are 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.640
 doing the guys on the pitch maybe in 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.180
 this moment is not enough to get to 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.210
 result and you have to do something 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.040
 in addition and to do so you have to do it from 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.290
 tomorrow night at the anderlecht you need 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.729
 surely above all champions are 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.570
 Much more difficult matches are there 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.110
 teams that start off on paper 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.790
 speaking to a story also in champions 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.439
 has often participated in the matches of the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.819
 champions so you have to play a part 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.500
 very careful secular balance there 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.060
 you need a little patience you don't have to 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.650
 think that the game lasts five 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.780
 minutes 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.090
 but the part does not last 95 minutes 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.700
 give the hurry to unlock it right away 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.140
 want to play with a lot of balance 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.209
 knowing they can during a game of 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.209
 occasions we create them
