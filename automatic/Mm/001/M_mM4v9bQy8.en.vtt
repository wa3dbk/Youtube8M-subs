00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
i think it was or 16 there was multiple

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.249 
i think it was or 16 there was multiple
skin<00:02:09.179> packs<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.599> kept<00:02:09.750> getting<00:02:09.989> released

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
before the actual title if they got

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.790 
before the actual title if they got
released<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.500> kind<00:02:13.680> of

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
released so it kind of

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.530 
released so it kind of
shows<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.550> mean<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.150> doesn't<00:02:15.420> really

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
shows that I mean it doesn't really

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.480 
shows that I mean it doesn't really
affect<00:02:15.660> anything<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.680> has<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.830> do<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.370> the
