00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.540
 all original greeting is 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.280
 optimister and on this channel again 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.620
 talk about what is absolutely not 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.960
 understand and so shaman king cartoon series 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.330
 released in 2001 and lasted only 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.010
 one year but even in that time he managed 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.110
 will appeal to all viewers 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.790
 well, that is, most viewers 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.640
 told this series no matter how 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.589
 strange about the shamans which every 500 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.690
 years must take part in the tournament 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.430
 this tournament is determined by the shaman 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.829
 worthy of seeing the king of sounds 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.870
 the king of spirits is the spirit of all things he 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.829
 can both save the world so destroy it 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.510
 at will 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.729
 the protagonist of this cartoon series is the name 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.039
 which sounds like a name from you to names 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.840
 it shows a very lazy fellow 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.380
 who dreams nothing all his life 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.360
 do 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.530
 and he and my friend March with him and 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.509
 the whole story began 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.280
 all ober and spirits and as a result of the campaign 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.229
 in the graveyard this guy is short 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.509
 shows itself as a true friend and 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.460
 without even having the ability of shamans he is without 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.619
 hesitation ready to stand up for their 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.330
 loyal companions cartoon shaman 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.009
 king very often touches the world 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.110
 nature is not only affected here 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.700
 environmental problems so trite 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.020
 argues a meaner good 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.790
 I'm not a big fan of Japanese 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.310
 animation however my knowledge is not enough 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.200
 to judge characters and rarely in this 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.360
 genre i met monochromatic heroes in 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.490
 each character was both black and white 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.140
 even in the most evil heroes were sparks 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.150
 good and in shaman king 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.170
 for example how this antihero I would not 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.210
 called universal evil 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.430
 maybe even the opposite, he tried to protect 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.380
 nature from death wanted to save what 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.549
 yet what is left on our planet and 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.530
 watching this anime 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.210
 each of us must think and maybe 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.220
 and really we should stop 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.720
 it is worth stopping to destroy and destroy 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.939
 that's the only way we are 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.409
 we exist oh well enough morality 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.269
 what else can you say about the shaman 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.890
 There are a lot of fun in this anime 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.150
 unobtrusive moments funny 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.220
 cute characters 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.440
 great soundtrack and not exactly good 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.090
 but I watch the animation well and how 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.890
 not to mention that there are two versions 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.989
 shaman king anime japanese and 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.970
 american in american version almost 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.049
 all characters have their last name omitted 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.610
 censorship considerations 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.980
 changed some design elements 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.079
 characters in general, such a short one 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.000
 review about anime shaman king watch it 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.100
 or not to think yourself 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.810
