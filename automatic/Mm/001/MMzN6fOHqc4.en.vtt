right<00:01:12.840> here<00:01:12.869> far<00:01:13.530> far<00:01:13.799> away<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:15.180> he

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
right here far far away it's because he

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
right here far far away it's because he
didn't<00:01:15.630> stand<00:01:15.810> well<00:01:16.110> he<00:01:16.439> kept<00:01:16.650> falling<00:01:16.830> down

didn't stand well he kept falling down

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.310 
didn't stand well he kept falling down
