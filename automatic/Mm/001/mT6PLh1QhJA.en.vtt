00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
but that's not right typically with a

but that's not right typically with a
bulb<00:01:47.640> flower<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.180> not<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.509> if

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
bulb flower you would not do that if

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.789 
bulb flower you would not do that if
you're<00:01:48.840> gonna<00:01:48.930> use<00:01:49.110> something<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.560> hard

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
you're gonna use something like a hard

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.289 
you're gonna use something like a hard
woody<00:01:50.009> stem<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.490> rose<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.700> would<00:01:51.149> help

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
woody stem like a rose that would help

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.060
