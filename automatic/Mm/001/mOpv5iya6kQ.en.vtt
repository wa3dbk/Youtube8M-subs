00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
it kind of drip dry so that you don't

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.679 
it kind of drip dry so that you don't
run<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> risk<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.320> oops<00:01:44.270> run<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> risk<00:01:45.540> of

it tipping over onto the counter and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.280 
it tipping over onto the counter and
falling<00:01:48.840> possibly<00:01:49.409> breaking<00:01:50.899> so<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.049> makes

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
falling possibly breaking so that makes

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.260 
falling possibly breaking so that makes
it<00:01:52.380> nice<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.799> hold<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.369> bottle<00:01:53.880> upside<00:01:53.970> down

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
it nice to hold the bottle upside down

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.690 
it nice to hold the bottle upside down
to<00:01:54.420> dry<00:01:54.770> next<00:01:55.770> you're<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.070> need<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> three

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
to dry next you're going to need a three

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.539 
to dry next you're going to need a three
piece<00:01:57.060> air<00:01:57.420> lock<00:01:57.920> system<00:01:58.920> or<00:01:59.130> they<00:01:59.399> have

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
piece air lock system or they have

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.039 
piece air lock system or they have
different<00:01:59.790> airlock<00:02:00.240> systems<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.899> aren't

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
different airlock systems that aren't

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.230 
different airlock systems that aren't
three-piece<00:02:01.469> there's<00:02:01.770> ones<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.369> are<00:02:02.490> kind

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
three-piece there's ones that are kind

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.289 
three-piece there's ones that are kind
of<00:02:03.329> built<00:02:03.600> mold<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.259> all<00:02:04.350> together<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:05.240> tend<00:02:06.240> to

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
of built mold it all together I tend to

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.819 
of built mold it all together I tend to
like<00:02:06.360> these<00:02:06.570> three<00:02:06.899> piece<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.680> take

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
like these three piece that you can take

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.040 
like these three piece that you can take
them<00:02:07.920> apart<00:02:08.039> cleaner

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
them apart cleaner

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.370 
them apart cleaner
so<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> first<00:02:10.410> piece<00:02:10.619> here<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.130> where<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
so the first piece here is where the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.630 
so the first piece here is where the
solution<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.470> put<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.950> keep<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.250> air<00:02:14.430> out

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
solution you put in to keep the air out

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.870 
solution you put in to keep the air out
you<00:02:15.420> fill<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:15.660> up<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:15.990> line<00:02:16.230> right<00:02:16.440> here

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
you fill it up to this line right here

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.630 
you fill it up to this line right here
might<00:02:17.880> tend<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.210> use<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.720> stars'<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:20.460> fill

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
might tend to use the stars' and to fill

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.910 
might tend to use the stars' and to fill
up<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.150> point<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:22.320> help<00:02:22.470> keep<00:02:22.680> any

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
up to that point to help keep any

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.730 
up to that point to help keep any
contaminants<00:02:23.490> out<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.440> juice<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.650> I'm

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
contaminants out of the juice that I'm

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.830 
contaminants out of the juice that I'm
making<00:02:26.070> are<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.310> wine<00:02:26.520> whatever<00:02:27.030> may<00:02:27.360> be<00:02:27.420> the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
making are the wine whatever may be the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.700 
making are the wine whatever may be the
other<00:02:28.620> piece<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:29.250> here<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:31.410> set<00:02:31.590> this

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
other piece is this here you set this

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.960 
other piece is this here you set this
down<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.100> might<00:02:32.280> be<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> little<00:02:32.520> bit<00:02:32.670> easier

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
down this might be a little bit easier

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.830 
down this might be a little bit easier
if<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.120> do<00:02:33.270> this<00:02:33.980> love<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.100> me<00:02:35.220> use<00:02:35.400> my<00:02:35.610> tripod

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.960 

there<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.860> first<00:02:41.100> piece<00:02:41.370> here<00:02:41.700> is

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
there so this first piece here is

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.090 
there so this first piece here is
actually<00:02:42.330> what<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:43.080> put<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.380> solution<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:43.950> up

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
actually what you put the solution in up

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.620 
actually what you put the solution in up
to<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.340> line<00:02:44.580> as<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.880> probably<00:02:45.120> can't<00:02:45.540> see

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
to this line as you probably can't see

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.620 
to this line as you probably can't see
on<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.020> video<00:02:46.250> then<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.370> put<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.700> piece

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
on the video then you put this piece

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.310 
on the video then you put this piece
here<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.980> traps<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.490> hair<00:02:51.110> inside<00:02:52.110> this

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
here and it traps the hair inside this

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
here and it traps the hair inside this
tube<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.880> doesn't<00:02:54.090> get<00:02:54.390> into<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
tube so that it doesn't get into the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.520 
tube so that it doesn't get into the
solution<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.180> then<00:02:57.330> into<00:02:57.900> the<00:03:00.290> solution<00:03:01.290> that

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
solution and then into the solution that

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.170 
solution and then into the solution that
you're<00:03:01.680> fermenting<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.340> juice<00:03:02.580> or<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.910> wine

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
you're fermenting the juice or the wine

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.630 
you're fermenting the juice or the wine
or<00:03:03.450> whatever<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.870> may<00:03:03.990> be<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:05.130> third<00:03:05.340> piece<00:03:05.610> is

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
or whatever it may be the third piece is

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.230 
or whatever it may be the third piece is
this<00:03:06.000> top<00:03:06.270> that<00:03:06.540> goes<00:03:06.570> on<00:03:06.810> here<00:03:08.060> keeps<00:03:09.060> all

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
this top that goes on here keeps all

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.810 
this top that goes on here keeps all
contaminants<00:03:10.020> out<00:03:10.310> once<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.430> starts<00:03:11.640> for

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
contaminants out once it starts for

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.540 
contaminants out once it starts for

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
into here I've heard this called many

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
kinds of funny names I just tend to call

kinds of funny names I just tend to call
it<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.700> plug<00:03:30.860> that<00:03:31.860> goes<00:03:32.070> in<00:03:32.280> there<00:03:32.489> which<00:03:33.270> then

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.730 

once<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.320> have<00:03:37.530> your<00:03:37.680> jug<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:40.320> can<00:03:40.470> put<00:03:40.650> it

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
once you have your jug you can put it

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.790 
once you have your jug you can put it
here<00:03:40.920> on<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.100> top<00:03:41.960> seal<00:03:42.960> it<00:03:43.080> up<00:03:43.140> nice<00:03:43.380> good<00:03:43.650> and

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
here on the top seal it up nice good and

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.850 
here on the top seal it up nice good and
tight<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:45.230> then<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.350> can<00:03:46.500> start<00:03:46.710> your

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
fermentation we'll get to that in a

00:03:49.500 --> 00:04:00.320 
fermentation we'll get to that in a
