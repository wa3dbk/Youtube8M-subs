talking<00:00:11.370> about<00:00:11.580> pizza<00:00:11.820> toppings<00:00:12.420> which<00:00:12.660> i

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
talking about pizza toppings which i

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.710 
talking about pizza toppings which i
think<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> better<00:00:13.860> topic<00:00:14.190> right<00:00:14.730> definitely

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.050 

so<00:00:18.720> first<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.289> all<00:00:19.410> what<00:00:20.070> makes<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.699> really

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
so first of all what makes a really

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.460 
so first of all what makes a really
great<00:00:21.300> pizza<00:00:21.570> topping<00:00:22.020> like<00:00:22.140> where<00:00:22.320> do<00:00:22.439> you

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
great pizza topping like where do you

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.990 
great pizza topping like where do you
even<00:00:22.590> begin<00:00:22.859> when<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.490> have<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.880> okay

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
even begin when you have like okay

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
even begin when you have like okay
you've<00:00:24.269> got<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> dough<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.529> can<00:00:25.680> go

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
you've got the dough and you can go

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.380 
you've got the dough and you can go
anywhere<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.490> how<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.760> even<00:00:26.880> know<00:00:27.240> how

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
anywhere like how do you even know how

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.019 
anywhere like how do you even know how
to<00:00:27.420> filter<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.500> think<00:00:29.130> honestly<00:00:29.580> it

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
to filter it out I think honestly it

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.759 
to filter it out I think honestly it
starts<00:00:30.689> before<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.109> even<00:00:31.260> get<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.619> dough

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
starts before you even get to the dough

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.200 
starts before you even get to the dough
it's<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.130> kind<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:32.759> would<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
it's just kind of like what would be a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.670 
it's just kind of like what would be a
fun<00:00:33.450> thing<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.690> put<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:33.840> top<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.230> pizza<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
fun thing to put on top of a pizza and

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.760 
fun thing to put on top of a pizza and
then<00:00:34.829> what<00:00:34.980> about<00:00:35.070> sauce<00:00:35.640> versus<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:37.469> sauce

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
then what about sauce versus not sauce

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.080 
then what about sauce versus not sauce
but<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.160> think<00:00:38.399> that's<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.790> know<00:00:38.850> people

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
but I think that's you know people

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.000 
but I think that's you know people
traditionally<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> red<00:00:40.140> sauce<00:00:40.350> but<00:00:40.829> how

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
traditionally have a red sauce but how

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.010 
traditionally have a red sauce but how
do<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.160> sort<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.520> make<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.879> balance<00:00:42.120> well

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
do you sort of make that balance well

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.450 
do you sort of make that balance well
first<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.440> foremost<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> think<00:00:44.100> simpler

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
first and foremost that I think simpler

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.160 
first and foremost that I think simpler
the<00:00:44.610> better<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.149> when<00:00:45.539> working<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.960> tomato

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the better so when working with tomato

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.240 
the better so when working with tomato
sauce<00:00:46.410> we're<00:00:46.590> working<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> best

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
sauce we're working with the best

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.130 
sauce we're working with the best
possible<00:00:47.399> Tomatoes<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.180> find<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:48.840> do

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
possible Tomatoes we can find and we do

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.869 
possible Tomatoes we can find and we do
nothing<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.590> them<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.340> terms<00:00:50.579> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
nothing to them and then in terms of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.490 
nothing to them and then in terms of
topping<00:00:51.449> something<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.899> paste<00:00:52.079> over<00:00:52.230> tomato

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
topping something to paste over tomato

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.840 
topping something to paste over tomato
sauce<00:00:52.680> some<00:00:52.860> things<00:00:53.039> taste<00:00:53.430> better<00:00:53.520> without

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
sauce some things taste better without

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.819 
sauce some things taste better without
so<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.809> know<00:00:54.930> sometimes<00:00:55.289> we'll<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.770> use

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so you know sometimes we'll have to use

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.639 
so you know sometimes we'll have to use
bechamel<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.570> plain<00:00:57.809> cheese<00:00:58.170> baked<00:00:58.500> on

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
bechamel or just plain cheese baked on

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.500 
bechamel or just plain cheese baked on
top<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.920> dough<00:00:59.100> instead<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.879> using<00:01:00.180> any<00:01:00.300> red

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
top of dough instead of using any red

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.810 
top of dough instead of using any red
sauce<00:01:00.690> at<00:01:00.870> all<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.559> really<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.039> whatever

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
sauce at all so it really is whatever

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.340 
sauce at all so it really is whatever
your<00:01:03.000> heart<00:01:03.149> desires<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.780> then<00:01:03.930> let's<00:01:04.170> talk

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
your heart desires and then let's talk

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.350 
your heart desires and then let's talk
about<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.799> amount<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.400> topping<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.060> how<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
about the amount of topping and how you

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.300 
about the amount of topping and how you
balance<00:01:06.720> because<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.770> me<00:01:07.950> Ike<00:01:08.130> I'm

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
balance because I think for me Ike I'm

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.770 
balance because I think for me Ike I'm
someone<00:01:08.610> who's<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.850> oh<00:01:08.970> I'm<00:01:09.360> gonna<00:01:09.479> throw<00:01:09.540> on

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
artichokes I don't know throw every

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.520 
artichokes I don't know throw every
below<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.390> you're<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.600> oh<00:01:12.720> no<00:01:12.900> my<00:01:12.930> face<00:01:13.229> is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
below and you're like oh no my face is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.320 
below and you're like oh no my face is
falling<00:01:13.799> apart<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.369> how<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.939> decide

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
falling apart like how do you decide

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.600 
falling apart like how do you decide
that<00:01:15.390> ratio<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.650> enough<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.070> enough

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that ratio of like what enough is enough

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
that ratio of like what enough is enough
that<00:01:17.820> same<00:01:18.030> idea<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.659> when<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.930> go<00:01:19.140> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that same idea is like when you go to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.929 
that same idea is like when you go to
the<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.770> know<00:01:19.860> build<00:01:20.130> your<00:01:20.310> own<00:01:20.369> burrito<00:01:20.759> at

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the you know build your own burrito at

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.730 
the you know build your own burrito at
home<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.479> always<00:01:21.960> over<00:01:22.200> stuff<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.560> just

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
home and you always over stuff and just

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.170 
home and you always over stuff and just
packing<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.310> full<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.490> flavor<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.880> think<00:01:24.090> we

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
packing it full of flavor I think we

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.490 
packing it full of flavor I think we
look<00:01:24.299> for<00:01:24.509> aggressive<00:01:24.869> ingredients<00:01:25.290> Epona

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
look for aggressive ingredients Epona

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.080 
look for aggressive ingredients Epona
since<00:01:25.770> we're<00:01:25.860> putting<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.189> much<00:01:26.310> fewer

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
since we're putting so much fewer

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.210 
since we're putting so much fewer
ingredients<00:01:27.330> they<00:01:28.140> need<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.350> pack<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> punch

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
ingredients they need to pack a punch

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.010 
ingredients they need to pack a punch
yeah<00:01:29.400> we're<00:01:29.579> obsessed<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:30.119> Rome<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.600> Roman

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
yeah we're obsessed with Rome and Roman

add a whole lot of weight to the dough I

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.889 
add a whole lot of weight to the dough I
think<00:01:44.280> our<00:01:44.430> probably<00:01:44.970> our<00:01:45.090> most<00:01:45.210> popular<00:01:45.360> pie

think<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.520> pizzas<00:02:08.879> almost<00:02:09.179> as<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.450> canvas

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
think of pizzas almost as like a canvas

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.029 
think of pizzas almost as like a canvas
for<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> salad<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.709> build

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
for a salad like you can build

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.220 
for a salad like you can build
salad<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.430> top<00:02:11.579> of<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.790> pizza<00:02:11.969> so<00:02:12.269> when<00:02:12.450> tomato

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
salad on top of the pizza so when tomato

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.720 
salad on top of the pizza so when tomato
seasons<00:02:13.620> around<00:02:13.769> we<00:02:13.980> do<00:02:14.099> heirloom<00:02:14.400> tomatoes

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
seasons around we do heirloom tomatoes

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.459 
seasons around we do heirloom tomatoes
and<00:02:14.760> buffalo<00:02:15.030> mozzarella<00:02:15.150> some<00:02:15.870> cheeses<00:02:16.319> are

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
and buffalo mozzarella some cheeses are

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.050 
and buffalo mozzarella some cheeses are
stronger<00:02:16.890> than<00:02:17.040> others<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.609> how<00:02:17.790> do<00:02:17.849> you

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
stronger than others so how do you

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.520 
stronger than others so how do you
figure<00:02:18.359> out<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.659> right<00:02:18.750> amount<00:02:19.079> and<00:02:19.319> how<00:02:19.469> do

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
figure out the right amount and how do

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.349 
figure out the right amount and how do
you<00:02:19.590> figure<00:02:19.799> out<00:02:19.950> when<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.549> put<00:02:20.969> the<00:02:21.060> cheese<00:02:21.329> on

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
you figure out when to put the cheese on

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.339 
you figure out when to put the cheese on
well<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.319> think<00:02:22.439> that<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:23.730> know<00:02:23.849> you<00:02:23.909> really

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
well I think that you know you really

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.020 
well I think that you know you really
have<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.469> think<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:25.799> does<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.040> pie<00:02:26.219> want<00:02:26.489> you

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
have to think what does the pie want you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.059 
have to think what does the pie want you
know<00:02:27.209> like<00:02:27.239> like<00:02:28.140> when<00:02:28.290> we<00:02:28.409> like<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:28.709> make<00:02:28.920> that

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
know like like when we like we make that

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.729 
know like like when we like we make that
happen<00:02:29.599> you<00:02:30.599> have<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.930> ask<00:02:31.079> the<00:02:31.230> pie<00:02:31.379> but<00:02:31.560> I

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
happen you have to ask the pie but I

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.979 
happen you have to ask the pie but I
will<00:02:31.920> tell<00:02:32.099> you<00:02:32.250> sometimes<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.269> streaks

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
will tell you sometimes it just streaks

something a little bit neutral like them

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.209 
something a little bit neutral like them
looks<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.810> little<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.439> know<00:02:40.769> you're<00:02:40.980> really

highlighted<00:02:42.480> ingredient<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.079> and<00:02:43.349> then<00:02:43.530> play

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
highlighted ingredient is and then play

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.099 
highlighted ingredient is and then play
to<00:02:44.069> that<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.730> when<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.150> think<00:02:45.389> about<00:02:45.420> topping

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
cheese but some of the ingredients you

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.770 
cheese but some of the ingredients you
mentioned<00:02:50.189> some<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.489> vegetables<00:02:50.720> how<00:02:51.720> do

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
mentioned some of the vegetables how do

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.960 
mentioned some of the vegetables how do
you<00:02:52.019> balance<00:02:52.769> that<00:02:53.040> or<00:02:53.310> sort<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:53.519> having<00:02:53.819> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970

freshness of maybe a tomato on top

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.069 
freshness of maybe a tomato on top
