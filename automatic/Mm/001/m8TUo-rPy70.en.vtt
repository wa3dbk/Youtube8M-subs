00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 Hey, everyone, I'm pretty 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.080
 I'm here for a video and special 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.349
 personal gp bike 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.109
 I already talked about the moto g with the 31 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.529
 moto g with moto x but I'm doing 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.960
 this video only of the bike g1 o they a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.240
 phone that caught my attention 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.099
 understood even had talked to a 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.240
 person who has one of three 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.579
 she also found the sensational the bike g1 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.090
 that I told him what it looks like 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.719
 they took the d3 right and gave a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.750
 This improved and improved 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.390
 arrived if the bike g santana makes a 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.910
 comment similar to when making a 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.039
 comparative with my 3 and seal the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.489
 Motorola is to be congratulated 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.239
 innovated again in the part of 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.870
 phone putting features very cool 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.979
 get out on the cell phone at a very very price 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.900
 low 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.220
 A cell phone today decides to be in the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.369
 range from 600 to 700 reais this engine g 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.409
 almost the same price as the 3's is 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.799
 As if the motorola you wanted 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.229
 kill him 3 and just let the bike g 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.729
 okay so let some things I 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.549
 draws attention for example 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.869
 the screen is 4.5 inches is a screen 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.689
 great 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.549
 326 dots per inch is a density 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:38.189
 very cool at 720p resolution of the 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.869
 and as soon as it was announced it was 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.350
 released this is very cool it comes with 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.079
 gorilla glass third generation that is 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.600
 very cool and these last generations of 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.950
 Greek mockery are tougher leaves 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.380
 the thinnest appliance even though it does not 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.399
 getting thinner should be because of 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.500
 of the battery but the last one coming out 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.170
 with gorilla glass from the latest gadgets 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.960
 they're fine, my gosh, why? 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.329
 the gorilla strike he can 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.009
 it seems that in the third generation he 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.009
 was able to reduce a layer still 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.890
 but maintaining the same quality and with 20 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.130
 and 30% more resistant yet personal is 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.560
 bug 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.900
 that's why everyone when they talk gorilla 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.270
 glass of the world like 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.670
 a very negative point 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.330
 I think it necessary there is not to have the fable 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.950
 have a memory card and because of the 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.840
 for example you buy eight gigs 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.910
 you barely have room to store your 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.300
 things inside you will want to save 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.400
 photo video mp3 these things you play and 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.920
 all a memory card and does not come with 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.540
 Personal memory card slot so the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.620
 Memory card're 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.170
 This is very very bad, ok let's go 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:58.510
 it comes with gps and gprs edge which is the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.890
 default 3g and download speed 21 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.770
 megas but he does not talk upload is 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.260
 basic staff basic bgn network with 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:14.350
 wifi hotspot is also basic 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:18.880
 bluetooth 4.0 is the market usb 2.0 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:22.360
 he does not say anything about nfc he does not 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.390
 nfc comes with much less has tv 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.060
 5 megapixel camera to motorola could 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.460
 improve this camera a bit more 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.850
 Sunday 8 megapixels but it's okay 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.100
 size up for this device is ok 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.980
 but because yes to 5 for me the standard 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.970
 staff 3 is already a reasonable camera 50 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.090
 started to get good even 8 is very 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.220
 good and above it has excellent with 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.190
 autofocus and flash to be very cool 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.600
 autofocus is personal you have some 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.850
 devices is that you do not have you 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.020
 approaches he does not focus and everything comes out 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.530
 says focused 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.260
 it's very cool it comes with a hotel 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.050
 focuses on you and plays on it 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.460
 focuses on that region and makes the 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.520
 focus is 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.360
 comes with a face- to-face detection hdr is 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:17.620
 very nice and the panoramic photo shoots the 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.830
 30fps to 720p and a secondary camera or 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.430
 be the front camera of 1.3 megapixels 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.500
 it already comes with an android 4.3 that is 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.580
 very important and should already be 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.220
 available as well as the kit kat 4.4 tá 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.990
 inside it comes the snapdragon 400 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.650
 There were people who asked me a lot. 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.340
 difference between 600 and 800 dragons 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.560
 400 exists also has a lot of difference 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.449
 it has a quad core inside it of 1.2 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:52.240
 ghz model to this process and if this 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.610
 corttex to 7 it is very good staff 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.289
 it is compared to the cortex a15 that I 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.650
 I already talked about a video talking about it. 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.419
 codex nomenclatures. 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.099
 it comes with adriano 300 this is a 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.240
 graphics processor market standard 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.699
 which is very good 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.330
 the accelerometer proximity and compass 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:14.650
 sms html it comes with radio i think a lot 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:17.020
 cool radio despite the s 4 and iphone by 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.300
 example I did not see with radio and if it comes with 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.720
 radio and I think it's really cool in 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:26.970
 pocket point positive but I think it's cool 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:31.389
 the gps gonesse java simulator in colors is 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:33.880
 black and seven color option né 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.580
 that's right even seven color option comes with 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.400
 a lot of stuff shipped and battery pack 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:44.139
 2070 milliamperes I expect the battery 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:48.220
 It lasts quite a long time, because my cell phone 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:50.380
 Ball show okay if you ask me with the 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:56.199

00:05:50.380 --> 00:06:00.520
 s 12 or 7 5 6 2 7 5 921 62 or 31 motorcycle 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:02.800
 g 8 g sure that if she is very 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.289
 good people, this is my opinion
