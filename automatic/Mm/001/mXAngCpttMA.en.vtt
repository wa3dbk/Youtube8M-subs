00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.280 

I'm<00:01:19.480> not<00:01:19.690> quite<00:01:19.900> sure<00:01:19.960> it<00:01:20.350> beats<00:01:20.620> us<00:01:20.860> Sebenza

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.310 
I'm not quite sure it beats us Sebenza
but<00:01:23.290> it's<00:01:23.470> a<00:01:23.590> very<00:01:24.070> unique<00:01:24.460> piece<00:01:25.320> very

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
but it's a very unique piece very

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.250 
but it's a very unique piece very
functional<00:01:26.950> as<00:01:27.220> well<00:01:27.570> one<00:01:28.570> thing<00:01:28.750> I<00:01:28.900> really

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
functional as well one thing I really

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.920 
functional as well one thing I really
don't<00:01:29.290> care<00:01:29.770> for<00:01:30.010> is<00:01:30.370> the<00:01:30.670> jimping<00:01:31.240> upfront

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
don't care for is the jimping upfront

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.290 
don't care for is the jimping upfront
kind<00:01:32.470> of<00:01:32.590> like<00:01:32.770> fades<00:01:33.160> down<00:01:33.430> into<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:33.940> handle

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
kind of like fades down into the handle

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.320 
kind of like fades down into the handle
so<00:01:34.540> it's<00:01:34.720> really<00:01:35.020> for<00:01:35.380> looks<00:01:35.590> only<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:37.150> you<00:01:37.240> can

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
so it's really for looks only so you can

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.360 
so it's really for looks only so you can
see<00:01:37.480> the<00:01:37.600> raised<00:01:37.840> portion<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:38.470> only<00:01:38.590> from<00:01:38.980> here

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
see the raised portion is only from here

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.580 
see the raised portion is only from here
to<00:01:39.670> here<00:01:42.630> what<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:43.750> know<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:43.990> fine<00:01:44.230> but<00:01:44.500> it

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
to here what you know is fine but it

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.050 
to here what you know is fine but it
just<00:01:44.710> kind<00:01:45.010> of<00:01:45.160> seems<00:01:45.400> like<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.610> design

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
just kind of seems like a design

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.910 
just kind of seems like a design
oversight<00:01:48.120> and<00:01:49.120> then<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.780> long<00:01:50.110> pocket<00:01:50.710> clip

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
oversight and then the long pocket clip

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.850 
oversight and then the long pocket clip
I<00:01:51.190> did<00:01:51.430> not<00:01:51.580> carry<00:01:51.880> this<00:01:52.090> knife<00:01:52.300> but<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
I did not carry this knife but the

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.290 
I did not carry this knife but the
pocket<00:01:54.250> clip<00:01:54.370> seems<00:01:54.790> overly<00:01:55.270> long<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:01.180> what

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
pocket clip seems overly long but what

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.090 
pocket clip seems overly long but what
do<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.450> know<00:02:01.510> I<00:02:01.690> haven't<00:02:01.990> carried<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.500> just<00:02:02.980> by
