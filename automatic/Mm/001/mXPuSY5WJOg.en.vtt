 aquarium had laid out a little world 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.289
 underwater with stones roots 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.469
 well cleaned by providing hiding places 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.000
 for fish

 heavy metals dissolved in water 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.540
 the scale on the top 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.540
 facilitates the dosage 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.760
 before introducing them to release 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.560
 plants of the wool that surrounds them then 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.750
 shorten and the roots of about 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.010
 3 centimeters practiced now

 introduced the plants 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.510
 once all the plants are introduced 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.510
 completely fill the aquarium with water 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.370
 for the siporex filtration media

 can start immediately 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.250
 biological decomposition of substances 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.070
 harmful 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.910
 sprinkle serra filter bio start on the 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.910
 filtration media 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.360
 all that remains is to put the 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.360
 technical elements and to connect them 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.730
 filtration starts immediately and 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.870
 then begins the biological filtration 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.760
 harmful substances in the filter 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.440
 start the biological decomposition of

 harmful substances in the aquarium 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.549
 with these unit discounts remake the

 cleaning bacteria and rock 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.989
 volcanic acid transforms ammonium and 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.569
 nitrites turbidity are related and 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.610
 minerals are released into the water with 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.370
 adding these nutri radios with 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.709
 the water this trouble slightly after four 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.510
 at 24 hours the aquarium becomes crystal clear 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.730
 and fish can be introduced 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.799
 before and for security 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.200
 check the main parameters of 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.200
 the water with the seven serves to akwa test 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.540
 this is very easy and very simple to 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.299
 understand 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.549
 even for novices just 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.709
 compare the color of the measurement with 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.209
 scale and raise the value 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.639
 the description of the tests contains a 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.930
 explanation you can now 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.930
 introduce the fish 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.490
 start by opening the sachet and 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.220
 filled them with portions of 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.290
 aquarium water after 20 to 30 minutes 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.240
 carefully introduce the fish 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.400
 in the aquarium using the dip net 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.400
 serves to discard the transport water 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.930
 then add a dose of greenhouse to akwa 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.150
 time when the fish will have 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.290
 acclimated they will be fed with the 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.290
 food served pan 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.520
 serra flore plus facilitates their roots 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.860
 mans plants pressed the pellet 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.240
 with macros essential element in 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.759
 the land at the roots 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.160
 helping you to clip plants 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.020
 serra flowers tools series 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.940
 nutrients will be found 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.240
 so exactly where they are 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.240
 consumed 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.280
 biotope aquarium set for a world

 natural aquatic 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.190
