00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
applicator i kind of like this more than

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.030 
applicator i kind of like this more than
the<00:02:38.540> gold<00:02:38.750> colored<00:02:39.200> just<00:02:39.560> because<00:02:39.799> i<00:02:39.890> don't

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
the gold colored just because i don't

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.100 
the gold colored just because i don't
really<00:02:40.069> put<00:02:40.370> on<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.519> lot<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.849> gold<00:02:41.150> color<00:02:41.810> makeup

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
really put on a lot of gold color makeup

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.360 
really put on a lot of gold color makeup
so<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:42.920> haven't<00:02:43.579> really<00:02:44.140> really<00:02:45.250> excited<00:02:46.250> it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
so I haven't really really excited it

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.949 
so I haven't really really excited it
too<00:02:46.579> much<00:02:46.760> but<00:02:47.060> maybe<00:02:47.269> I<00:02:47.390> could<00:02:47.540> incorporate

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
too much but maybe I could incorporate

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.039 
too much but maybe I could incorporate
it<00:02:48.349> into<00:02:48.530> my<00:02:48.980> makeup<00:02:49.549> 14-years<00:02:50.450> like<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.930> if

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
it into my makeup 14-years like that if

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.330 
it into my makeup 14-years like that if
I<00:02:51.139> were<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.319> put<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> little<00:02:51.889> bit<00:02:52.100> of<00:02:52.160> eyeshadow

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
I were to put a little bit of eyeshadow

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.970 
I were to put a little bit of eyeshadow
I<00:02:52.910> would<00:02:53.090> definitely<00:02:53.600> put<00:02:53.780> this<00:02:53.900> on<00:02:54.109> as<00:02:54.410> in<00:02:54.859> the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
I would definitely put this on as in the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.949 
I would definitely put this on as in the
gold<00:02:55.220> I'm<00:02:55.609> not<00:02:55.910> really<00:02:56.030> sure<00:02:56.389> I'm<00:02:56.690> kind<00:02:56.930> of

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
gold I'm not really sure I'm kind of

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.720 
gold I'm not really sure I'm kind of
iffy<00:02:57.109> about<00:02:57.319> it<00:02:57.799> but<00:02:58.040> if<00:02:58.160> you're<00:02:58.310> into<00:02:58.519> gold

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
iffy about it but if you're into gold

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.250 
iffy about it but if you're into gold
colors<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.329> think<00:02:59.690> this<00:02:59.840> is<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.959> really

which<00:03:30.739> I<00:03:31.220> was<00:03:31.970> at<00:03:32.180> first<00:03:32.510> not<00:03:33.079> too<00:03:33.650> into<00:03:34.099> it<00:03:34.599> but

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
which I was at first not too into it but

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.620

it's a reddish brown color I didn't like

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.900 
it's a reddish brown color I didn't like
it<00:03:38.780> at<00:03:38.930> first<00:03:38.959> just<00:03:39.620> because<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:40.340> looked<00:03:40.609> weird

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
it at first just because it looked weird

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.809 
it at first just because it looked weird
and<00:03:41.419> I<00:03:42.019> didn't<00:03:42.290> like<00:03:42.470> how<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.709> looked<00:03:42.859> on<00:03:43.400> my

and I didn't like how it looked on my
skin<00:03:44.780> tone<00:03:44.989> and<00:03:45.260> I<00:03:45.349> thought<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.769> would<00:03:45.950> make<00:03:45.980> me

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
skin tone and I thought it would make me

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.569 
skin tone and I thought it would make me
look<00:03:46.489> really<00:03:47.000> yellowy<00:03:47.569> orange<00:03:48.160> but<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.190> ended

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
look really yellowy orange but I ended

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:50.890 
look really yellowy orange but I ended

nicely if you do the inner corners of
real<00:04:41.720> it's<00:04:41.900> just<00:04:41.960> because<00:04:42.440> it's<00:04:42.650> not<00:04:43.130> really

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
real it's just because it's not really

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.670 
real it's just because it's not really
like<00:04:43.580> BAM<00:04:43.880> pink<00:04:44.420> it's<00:04:44.960> more<00:04:45.200> of<00:04:45.290> a<00:04:45.410> really

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
like BAM pink it's more of a really

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.500 
like BAM pink it's more of a really
subtle<00:04:46.010> pink<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:46.700> it<00:04:46.790> gives<00:04:47.000> that<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.180> really

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
subtle pink so it gives that a really

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.170 
subtle pink so it gives that a really
nice<00:04:47.720> innocent<00:04:48.170> glow<00:04:48.590> so<00:04:49.040> wrong<00:04:49.370> these<00:04:49.910> were

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
nice innocent glow so wrong these were

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.680 
nice innocent glow so wrong these were
my<00:04:50.390> best<00:04:50.780> buys<00:04:51.230> in<00:04:51.680> this<00:04:51.860> entire<00:04:52.220> summer<00:04:52.690> it's

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
my best buys in this entire summer it's

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.680 
my best buys in this entire summer it's
quite<00:04:54.020> long<00:04:54.230> lasting<00:04:54.830> but<00:04:55.760> of<00:04:55.910> course<00:04:56.300> I<00:04:56.570> would

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
quite long lasting but of course I would

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.720 
quite long lasting but of course I would
recommend<00:04:57.260> applying<00:04:57.440> a<00:04:57.710> base<00:04:57.920> on<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.370> because

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
recommend applying a base on it because

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.270 
recommend applying a base on it because
there's<00:04:59.720> some<00:04:59.870> glitter<00:05:00.200> to<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.560> for<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.040> price

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
there's some glitter to it for the price

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.790 
there's some glitter to it for the price
the<00:05:01.850> color<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:02.570> how<00:05:03.020> long<00:05:03.230> it<00:05:03.440> lasts

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
the color and how long it lasts

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.560 
the color and how long it lasts
I<00:05:03.830> definitely<00:05:04.130> recommend<00:05:04.760> this<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.240> everybody
