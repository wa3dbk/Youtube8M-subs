00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
stopped as well that was around the same

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.109 
stopped as well that was around the same
time<00:01:46.649> where<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> stopped<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.549> dropped<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
time where I stopped and dropped the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.850 
time where I stopped and dropped the
anime<00:01:48.420> series<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.079> that's<00:01:49.229> pretty<00:01:49.500> much<00:01:49.680> my

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
anime series so that's pretty much my

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.859 
anime series so that's pretty much my
story<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.640> fell<00:01:50.880> out<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.420> stopped

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
story I just fell out of it I stopped

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.020

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.149 
enjoying it I just couldn't take it
because<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.509> was<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.960> cliche<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.799> was<00:01:55.979> pretty

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
because it was so cliche it was pretty

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.459 
because it was so cliche it was pretty
much<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.520> definition<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.840> shounen<00:01:58.170> anime

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
