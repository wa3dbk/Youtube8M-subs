00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.120
 hi everyone what stage these lists 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.160
 so comes little video today so 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.570
 my second to show you the test of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.480
 my knife when fault that I have since 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.920
 ten years so the cabaret 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.970
 usmc surely olive well according to he has 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.410
 served so that's so it's a knife 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.149
 me who has never failed me 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.380
 for now I've put the face 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.440
 still he still works very 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.930
 well I have no problem with it 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.719
 is not suitable for Toulon I think the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.860
 sleeve is pretty big so I already have 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.579
 big hands so it 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.289
 he is a little heavy he weighs 2,311 g but 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.390
 roughly I believe he measures 18 18 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.840
 So here centimeters away far 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.110
 18 cm with the handle made about 30 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.600
 cm when you loose t it comes with 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.810
 a beautiful leather case 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.760
 so then the ena who worries not even 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.439
 I like it that I find it crazy 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.570
 it's a pure 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.310
 there is a hole to pass a lace for 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.500
 tie it around the tree not that 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.010
 it gets trimballe just that 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.450
 the system of 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:29.130
 system buttons buttons 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.150
 the pressure is not great as it 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.780
 after I did not too much floor the 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.780
 above I agree I do not care what 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.320
 yeah so 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.850
 so here is so after the little 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.880
 story so it's a knife that has been 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.910
 created bass for US soldiers 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.940
 of the cia usmc so it's for the 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.440
 marine I think it must be dated 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.770
 second world war or whatever 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.240
 something like that and so we can see a 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.260
 little his ancestor at the blade 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.600
 it's still like a kind of boiko knife 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.190
 so here we go we'll go 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.830
 test young and sticks I'm going 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.350
 go and hit pieces of wood etc for 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.170
 to show you a little that works 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.970
 here at lattes at the time here is a little the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.610
 all the gear is put in place and even 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:29.350
 the dog a case where so I put the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:34.989
 great story of for gemalto I have not 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:37.320
 the time to hurt myself wearing all 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.320
 classical 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.270
 without forcing 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.950
 know when not a lot of time we 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.549
 do you like me it's hardwood 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.549
 it's cypress 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.510
 it may not be but it's done 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.620
 limit of balls or a hatchet for 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.690
 sticking it works well too 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.690
 the gema a small budget 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.470
 so much effort 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.470
 without forcing 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.720
 you and me 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.300
 here 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.300
 all who work well 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.160
 the carpet 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.160
 given drogba if you want 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.740
 here 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.360
 and to be well aware 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.020
 of size either in video it's not 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.020
 obviously obvious 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.510
 one classic opinel echoed the 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.510
 press that it gives 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.180
 here to finish at the march all Arab 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.559
 with a good knife I did not show no 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.249
 plus anything that can do you after 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:06.870
 there is that down after we do not know he can 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.539
 do a lot of things so we can not 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.849
 Finally, it is according to the request 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.849
 so I hurry up because there is match 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:20.400
 so suddenly it's good so it's 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:21.870
 for the blow is not necessarily in 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.210
 our usual home politics 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.189
 to say you are more about the 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.050
 cheap equipment but hey we feel 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:29.729
 that a knife can be allowed when 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.589
 even to put a little bit of time aside 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.479
 in time and be able to have fun 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:35.819
 also because that's it too I believe 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.749
 it is to have fun ideas with 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:40.379
 sometimes good tools 

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:42.710
 that's going to cost in the 75 70 euros 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:45.770
 I think but I tell you this is done 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.449
 maybe a little more than ten years ago I 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.479
 I drooled and lease is still 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:52.649
 there what maintenance is simple just a 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.210
 little look from time to time 

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:58.949
 because the LaCie tends to 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.969
 sting cdu carbon steel why 1092 or 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:02.339
 in any case something like that I 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:04.680
 did not notice for once and 

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:06.539
 the talk bah yeah that's him and the 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.860
 feet six stones nor the 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:11.819
 sharp finally I mean it's not 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.349
 it's pretty simple cd cd objects that 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:15.360
 are who are hardy 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.379
 this is really five months I 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.419
 had taken it at the time since I am 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:19.529

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:20.849
 American they had used during 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:22.169
