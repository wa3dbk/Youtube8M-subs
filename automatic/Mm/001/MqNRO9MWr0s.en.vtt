00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.210
 well that is delineated what I do 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.430
 always commonly with migraine pain 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.620
 the real 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:17.460
 but those who follow my blog will have 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.160
 realized that I have recommended this 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.349
 another eyeliner that I found a lot much 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.200
 cheaper for a third of what I 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.210
 costs the other 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.740
 and I'm very happy with him, well, I'm going to 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.450
 teach them I will apply it with a 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.450
 angular brush I'll grab 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.690
 you barely have to touch it 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.300
 you do not have to apply much more what I 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.860
 it's not like I have to be all 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.570
 webs to both eyes this time for 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.430
 that they see the different techniques that 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.920
 I use to apply this line door in 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.870
 this eye I do not know why do not ask me 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.980
 but I always start here in the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.980
 external corner 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.159
 I do as a line 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.640
 what is going to come being the 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.640
 tail 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.700
 as well as diagonally as connecting the 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.700
 end of the eyebrow at the end of my eye 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.270
 it will be a diagonal like that and after this 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.050
 point of this point I'm going to drag it and 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.660
 match what you can not see 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.190
 no angle here that you see has 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.190
 rounded not in peak 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.570
 and that he lacked a little 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.909
 plus the product 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.140
 and since I did that then I'm going to 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:47.470
 start doing it like that 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.470
 and bring it to the inner part 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.270
 what would he do 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.550
 that would be more or less like that 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.090
 what 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.579
 easy truth though it was my other eye 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.440
 I start it upside down that I start it 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.680
 inside out 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.290
 and start I can look here I have a 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.820
 hand mirror and I put it down then 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.690
 wrapped and down to the mirror and 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.690
 I start to apply it 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.870
 here because there are no tabs that 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.390
 interfere with the delineated but already 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.730
 here where there are eyelashes I close my eye 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.329
 and I try to stretch the eyelid as much 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.329
 possible 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.220
 and I'm applying it 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.420
 as doing as a line but in 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.420
 taps like many small lines 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.110
 and then putting together 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.110
 when you reach the corner 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.740
 I will have to compare with the 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.150
 height of the peak that I put in the other eye 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.420
 so 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.780
 I will compare and I will flip my brush 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.860
 with the shape of the angle and peak the part 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.989
 bigger out and I'll compare 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.989
 which more or less it is at this point 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.170
 and I'm going to make a line like diagonal 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.170
 like a little bit 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.670
 we peeked in there and now I'm going to do what 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.280
 same can join this peak with this 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.090
 line here 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.989
 and try to make it round this part 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.989
 that does not look 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.050
 [Music] 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.030
 very like corner but rather like 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.500
 faded this line here to what I 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.980
 I mean something I referred llosa that I do not know 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:02.550
 sees a line so and so to not 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.550
 see this angle ok but more rounded 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.270
 is the phone 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.790
 I did not do anything afterwards but this is the 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.760
 way in which you applied the eyeliner in 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.549
 Now let's place on the brush if 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.650
 you want you can apply like this between 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.640
 lashes with taps so you do not 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.640
 It looks very loaded 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.450
 and I did not remove color from the shadow that 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.450
 apply here 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.570
 all this only in between the 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.570
 tabs 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.150
 and we do the same thing on the other side 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.759
 then what you read 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.310
 I tried to show with this is not the weird thing 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:01.389
 what am i and what gene did the 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.280
 different eyeliner but it does not matter 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.139
 the method that you use does not 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.729
 matter how it suits them better as 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.729
 I had done it before 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.050
 the fact is that they can exist 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.289
 different ways of doing it always and 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.809
 when the result is 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.270
 the one that you want for you 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:24.710
 see that there is no right way or 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.389
 wrong to do what you 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.770
 can do it as best suits them 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.119
 as they see fit as they are 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.039
 make it easier the important thing is 

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:38.599
 result that you want with so many 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:40.409
 with which is approximated in the form 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:44.219
 of 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:48.139
 of the eyeliner one eye that on the other and 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:48.139
 that's how it looks and then in mascara 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.800
 it is a very simple delineation very easy 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.100
 to do it and that's the one he used 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.170
 practically every day good 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.710
 I hope you liked this tip 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.980
 this tutorial and see you in the next 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.980
 bye
