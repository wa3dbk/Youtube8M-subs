it's<00:01:18.810> only<00:01:18.960> about<00:01:19.110> well<00:01:20.070> I'll<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> check

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the specs of it I think it's only about

the specs of it I think it's only about
40<00:01:22.200> pounds

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
40 pounds

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.260 
40 pounds
that's<00:01:23.220> good<00:01:23.460> less<00:01:23.640> than<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.909> because<00:01:24.119> it's

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that's good less than that because it's

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.270 
that's good less than that because it's
very<00:01:24.450> easy<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.810> lift<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.229> hand<00:01:25.530> the

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.540 
and you've got a dedicated monitor out
here<00:04:31.910> so<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.240> can<00:04:32.450> send<00:04:32.690> this<00:04:32.780> out<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:33.070> one<00:04:34.070> to
