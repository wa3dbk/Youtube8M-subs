00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.740
 hear as we are in summer 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.380
 offers the cool truth the outside is 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.849
 here the coffee then decorate 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.980
 our garden our terrace what 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.540
 have to put a little plant for 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.190
 that this one 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.130
 not only in the garden are you 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.440
 you can use in the kitchen what can you 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.940
 apply in a room or on your balcony you cited 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.760
 to your department the home the concept 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.190
 from the department that has a lot much 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.270
 use so what are we going to need what 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.860
 First of all, what are we going 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.970
 request is a meter everyone what 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.880
 have at home 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.880
 rope and scissors 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:54.300
 to hang it good I just taught 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.270
 a well patrise and wrong way to measure a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.220
 metro I did not know what they think is worth 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.570
 what I think I did not know I hope that 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.829
 many of you are in the same 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.700
 me and tell them 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:10.189
 and grab the tip of whatever they're going to 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.670
 measure and up to your shoulder that is a meter 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:18.170
 ok two meters now we have one 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.810
 we need another we cut it 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.810
 and we do it again 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.430
 so four times do we have then 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.549
 our 4 mec before 2 meters each 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.890
 we're going to stretch a measure for them 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.500
 this car face show jumping and what 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.100
 what we are going to do is measure ourselves in the middle 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.439
 and then let's make a knot 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.770
 around here more or less a normalito knot 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.690
 there it is 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.420
 next step we have an assistant 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.010
 that I can hold the knot as if 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.140
 we were going to separate the hair for a 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:59.900
 braid we're basically going to separate the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.990
 mecates other two mecates other two and 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.060
 two others so you have four very left 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.680
 fine and then we will win our 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.080
 our meter our rule what 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.480
 we have and we will measure 30 centimeters 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.959
 in each mega teach in each part let's say 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.510
 here we are 30 centimeters and in the 30 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.280
 centimeters let's make an equal knot 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.100
 that the one above also now with 2 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.970
 mecates ok 2 let's do it with the 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.580
 third and the fourth and fourth before 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.209
 squeeze what they look at to stop 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.860
 the correct height that is actor this 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.860
 sweat is done four times 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.270
 there comes more complicated thing 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.610
 we grabbed two of those that we have we are going to 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.160
 do again the 30 centimeters and 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.990
 let's do the knot there between two 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.990
 knots ok knots 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.970
 so we grabbed this one that was 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.170
 second with the third and we tie these 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.939
 two we make another logical your third nudite 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:18.780
 and finally that this with this with 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:21.140
 the last one sees how everything is a matter of 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.240
 life perspective 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.240
 they were all entangled with each other 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.379
 finish the final knot which is where it goes to 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.959
 hold the pot you can do as 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.790
 that of about 5 or 10 centimeters and depends 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.739
 also the size of your pot how 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.180
 you want the distance from your knots is 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.709
 say if it's a smaller flowerpot by 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.900
 example here how can you see the 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.819
 distance is 10 centimeters if it is more 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.250
 long since we did 30 there 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.530
 we are now open that and let everything be 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.290
 centered so that the pot has a 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.299
 base see nothing but beauty subscribe
