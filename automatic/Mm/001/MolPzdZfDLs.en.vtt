and<00:00:17.750> they<00:00:18.750> executed<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.380> two-minute

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
and they executed that two-minute

Tosh needed they definitely provided a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.630 
Tosh needed they definitely provided a
spark<00:00:29.070> he<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.760> groove<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.359> his<00:00:30.510> own

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
spark he was in a groove and in his own

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.280 
spark he was in a groove and in his own
what<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> great<00:00:32.940> when<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.690> reacting<00:00:34.170> and

what a great when I just reacting and

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.709 
what a great when I just reacting and
playing<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.239> you<00:00:36.239> kind<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> look<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> little

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
playing and you kind of look a little

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.840 
playing and you kind of look a little
bit<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:36.989> LSU<00:00:37.320> last<00:00:38.040> year<00:00:38.309> as<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.550> took<00:00:38.700> it

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
bit like LSU last year as we took it

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.450 
bit like LSU last year as we took it
down<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.090> field<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:41.160> know<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.340> was

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
down the field and and you know it was

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.340 
down the field and and you know it was
kind<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.670> our<00:00:41.820> mindset<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.570> had<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.989> had<00:00:43.020> three

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
kind of our mindset we had we had three

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.930 
kind of our mindset we had we had three
timeouts<00:00:43.590> left<00:00:43.920> had<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> minute<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> clock

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
timeouts left had a minute on the clock

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.110 
timeouts left had a minute on the clock
and<00:00:45.300> had<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.110> go<00:00:46.230> 70<00:00:46.649> yards<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.700> did<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
and had to go 70 yards and we did it and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.790 
and had to go 70 yards and we did it and
be<00:00:48.570> able<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> see<00:00:48.870> taja<00:00:49.110> execute<00:00:49.620> at<00:00:49.680> that

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
be able to see taja execute at that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.160 
be able to see taja execute at that
level<00:00:49.980> was<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:50.550> all<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.000> them<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.989> make

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
level was really all of them and make

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.350 
level was really all of them and make
plays<00:00:52.410> get<00:00:52.829> out<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.039> bounds<00:00:53.399> xq<00:00:53.879> two<00:00:54.030> different

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
plays get out of bounds xq two different

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.959 
plays get out of bounds xq two different
receivers<00:00:54.750> yeah<00:00:55.230> yeah<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> thought<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.850> was

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
receivers yeah yeah I thought that was

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.160 
receivers yeah yeah I thought that was
very<00:00:57.059> impressive<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.960> thought<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
very impressive and I thought I

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.049 
very impressive and I thought I
definitely<00:00:58.980> thought<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.250> was<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.550> huge

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
definitely thought it was a huge

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.880 
definitely thought it was a huge
momentum<00:01:00.449> swing<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:00.989> us<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.320> into<00:01:01.440> going

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
momentum swing for us going into going

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.329 
momentum swing for us going into going

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
it and and then we were able to come

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
it and and then we were able to come
back<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> third<00:01:25.890> down<00:01:26.220> calling<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
back in on on the third down calling and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.999 
back in on on the third down calling and
that's<00:01:27.299> what<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.540> called<00:01:27.780> him<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.829> yet

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that's what we called him and it yet

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
that's what we called him and it yet
that's<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.759> were<00:01:29.850> after<00:01:30.619> playing<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that's what we were after playing the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.890 
that's what we were after playing the
best<00:01:31.950> he's<00:01:32.520> ever<00:01:32.549> played<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:33.329> now<00:01:33.509> he's<00:01:33.750> no

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
best he's ever played right now he's no

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.590 
best he's ever played right now he's no
I<00:01:33.960> think<00:01:34.140> he's<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.619> electric<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.600> explosive

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
I think he's is electric and explosive

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.149 
I think he's is electric and explosive
as<00:01:36.750> he's<00:01:36.990> ever<00:01:37.079> been<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.829> we've<00:01:37.979> kind<00:01:38.009> of

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
as he's ever been you know we've kind of

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.399 
as he's ever been you know we've kind of
said<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.400> all<00:01:38.670> year<00:01:38.850> long<00:01:39.030> he's<00:01:39.720> consistent

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
said that all year long he's consistent

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.100 
said that all year long he's consistent

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
now starting to develop that chemistry

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.960 
now starting to develop that chemistry
that<00:02:24.640> Taj<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:24.910> new<00:02:25.270> cat<00:02:25.630> last<00:02:26.500> season<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.250> would

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
that Taj a new cat last season I would

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.680 
that Taj a new cat last season I would
say<00:02:28.120> without<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.420> doubt<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:29.050> would<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.910> think<00:02:31.570> they

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
say without a doubt I would I think they

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.260 
say without a doubt I would I think they
got<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.870> good<00:02:32.080> feel<00:02:32.320> for<00:02:32.500> each<00:02:32.590> other<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.370> I

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.580 
got a good feel for each other and I
think<00:02:34.300> that's<00:02:34.780> kind<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.260> what<00:02:35.440> you're

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
think that's kind of what you're

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.350 
think that's kind of what you're
starting<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:36.010> see<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.400> know<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.940> difference
