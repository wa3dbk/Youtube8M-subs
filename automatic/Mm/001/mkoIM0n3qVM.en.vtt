00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
a rogue app taking up resources and you

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.080 
a rogue app taking up resources and you
don't<00:00:20.189> know<00:00:20.310> which<00:00:20.460> one<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.000> it's

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
don't know which one it is and it's

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.179 
don't know which one it is and it's
slowing<00:00:21.330> your<00:00:21.570> whole<00:00:21.720> tablet<00:00:22.199> down<00:00:22.350> basically

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
you can reboot into safe mode and all

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.300 
you can reboot into safe mode and all
the<00:00:25.170> apps<00:00:25.320> will<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.590> gone<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.949> then<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.160> have

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
the apps will be gone and then you have

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.060 
the apps will be gone and then you have
to<00:00:26.460> kind<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.880> slowly<00:00:27.840> figure<00:00:28.260> out<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.890> it's

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
to kind of slowly figure out that it's

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.650 
to kind of slowly figure out that it's
definitely<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.519> third-party<00:00:30.060> app<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
definitely a third-party app and you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.910 
definitely a third-party app and you
have<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.869> go<00:00:30.990> through<00:00:31.230> your<00:00:31.380> third-party<00:00:31.560> apps

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
have to go through your third-party apps

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.590 
have to go through your third-party apps
and<00:00:32.070> I'll<00:00:32.130> install<00:00:32.309> them<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.480> is
