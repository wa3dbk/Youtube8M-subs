because<00:00:33.320> I'm<00:00:33.530> recording<00:00:33.920> I<00:00:34.309> can't<00:00:34.670> seem<00:00:34.850> to

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
because I'm recording I can't seem to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.250

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
get it to stop doing so it's kind of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.600 
get it to stop doing so it's kind of
dumb<00:00:36.500> looking<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:36.890> me<00:00:37.010> now<00:00:37.130> but<00:00:37.309> if<00:00:37.400> I'm<00:00:37.489> not

does the pre OVR suit there are ways of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.110 
does the pre OVR suit there are ways of
detecting<00:01:16.010> motion<00:01:16.370> that<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:16.760> can<00:01:16.909> put<00:01:17.060> your

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
detecting motion that you can put your

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.700 
detecting motion that you can put your
hand<00:01:17.330> in<00:01:17.510> certain<00:01:17.810> games<00:01:17.840> if<00:01:18.229> they<00:01:18.320> support<00:01:18.470> it

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
things are popping up all the time to

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.160 
things are popping up all the time to
improve<00:01:20.600> VR<00:01:21.140> but<00:01:22.299> the<00:01:23.299> looking<00:01:23.689> around<00:01:23.869> is

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
improve VR but the looking around is

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.830 
improve VR but the looking around is
absolutely<00:01:24.920> amazing<00:01:25.520> in<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.880> motion<00:01:26.329> the

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
absolutely amazing in the motion the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.700 
absolutely amazing in the motion the
position<00:01:27.290> sensing<00:01:27.770> with<00:01:27.890> yet

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
position sensing with yet

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.030 
position sensing with yet
with<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.280> with<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.430> dk2<00:01:31.360> rift<00:01:31.900> here<00:01:32.229> you<00:01:32.860> can

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
with it with the dk2 rift here you can

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.969 
with it with the dk2 rift here you can
kind<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.280> look<00:01:33.490> down<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:34.780> at<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:34.990> table<00:01:35.380> is

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
kind of look down right at the table is

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.770 
kind of look down right at the table is
the<00:01:36.220> camera<00:01:36.640> out<00:01:36.729> of<00:01:36.760> range<00:01:37.090> of<00:01:37.210> my<00:01:37.390> camera's<00:01:37.750> a

the camera out of range of my camera's a

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.090 
the camera out of range of my camera's a
bit<00:01:37.990> high<00:01:38.140> but<00:01:40.020> yeah<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.080> look<00:01:41.440> anywhere<00:01:41.920> you

just go in and out you movie go up and
down<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:45.040> side<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.400> side<00:01:45.580> I<00:01:45.759> look<00:01:46.090> like<00:01:46.300> an

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
down and side to side I look like an

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.359 
down and side to side I look like an
idiot<00:01:46.570> all<00:01:46.960> pretty<00:01:47.320> hard<00:01:47.640> anyways<00:01:49.770> yeah<00:01:50.770> but

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
there are some downsides of course this

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.730 
there are some downsides of course this

tech is far from perfect you can kind of
see<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:57.130> pixels<00:01:57.580> is<00:01:57.850> 1080p<00:01:58.750> screens<00:01:59.380> but

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
see the pixels is 1080p screens but

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.830 
see the pixels is 1080p screens but
they're<00:02:00.190> right<00:02:00.340> up<00:02:00.460> against<00:02:00.790> your<00:02:00.850> face<00:02:01.210> so

like<00:02:50.049> a<00:02:50.290> minute<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.370> had<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.850> take<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.209> thing

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
like a minute I had to take this thing

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.080 
like a minute I had to take this thing
off<00:02:52.799> but<00:02:53.799> I've<00:02:53.980> been<00:02:54.100> gradually<00:02:54.640> getting<00:02:54.820> used

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
off but I've been gradually getting used

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.660 
off but I've been gradually getting used
to<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.720> worst<00:02:55.930> problem<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.590> movement<00:02:57.220> like

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
to it the worst problem is movement like

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.670 
to it the worst problem is movement like
looking<00:02:58.030> around<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.420> fine<00:02:58.690> but<00:02:59.440> if<00:02:59.560> you're

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
looking around is fine but if you're

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.020 
looking around is fine but if you're
moving<00:02:59.980> like<00:03:00.010> if<00:03:00.250> you're<00:03:00.400> turning<00:03:00.790> with<00:03:00.910> the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
moving like if you're turning with the

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
it and so at the top it ends up feeling

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.560 
it and so at the top it ends up feeling
like<00:04:02.610> you're<00:04:02.880> going<00:04:03.350> like<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:05.360> every<00:04:06.360> time<00:04:06.390> i

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
like you're going like that every time i

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.420 
like you're going like that every time i
tried<00:04:06.959> is<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.260> gets<00:04:07.440> slightly<00:04:07.709> better<00:04:08.130> though

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
tried is it gets slightly better though

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.850 
tried is it gets slightly better though
so<00:04:08.790> just<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.750> matter<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.050> getting<00:04:10.170> used<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.740> it<00:04:10.800> i

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
so just a matter of getting used to it i

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.620 
so just a matter of getting used to it i
suppose<00:04:10.920> but<00:04:11.400> let<00:04:12.090> me<00:04:12.120> see<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.390> like<00:04:12.510> in

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
suppose but let me see you like in

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.170 
suppose but let me see you like in
rimini<00:04:12.930> down<00:04:13.610> okay<00:04:14.610> that<00:04:14.790> has<00:04:14.910> motion

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
rimini down okay that has motion

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.270 
rimini down okay that has motion
tracking<00:04:15.600> again<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:16.230> can<00:04:16.410> so<00:04:16.799> yeah<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.070> guess

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280
