the city at every pack I got on the bike

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.480 
the city at every pack I got on the bike
and<00:00:08.690> 12.2<00:00:09.690> miles<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.110> get<00:00:10.200> here<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:11.250> need<00:00:11.400> to

back<00:00:13.290> home<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.940> packs<00:00:15.179> were<00:00:15.450> at<00:00:15.630> sixty<00:00:16.020> two

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170

back home the packs were at sixty two
and<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.320> half<00:00:16.440> volts<00:00:16.619> when<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.949> plugged<00:00:17.220> them<00:00:17.310> in

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
and a half volts when I plugged them in

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.550 
and a half volts when I plugged them in
and<00:00:17.699> they're<00:00:17.850> still<00:00:18.119> at<00:00:18.630> sixty<00:00:19.080> point<00:00:19.350> eight

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
and they're still at sixty point eight

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.150 
and they're still at sixty point eight
right<00:00:19.800> now

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
right now

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.880 
right now
I<00:00:20.449> was<00:00:21.449> very<00:00:21.689> easy<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> throttle<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
I was very easy on the throttle on the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.689 
I was very easy on the throttle on the
whole<00:00:23.010> way<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:25.949> hopefully<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.340> make<00:00:26.580> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
whole way out so hopefully I can make it

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.870 
whole way out so hopefully I can make it
back<00:00:26.789> home<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.269> are<00:00:28.189> twenty<00:00:29.189> two<00:00:29.369> point<00:00:29.640> six

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
back home we are twenty two point six

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.840 
back home we are twenty two point six
miles<00:00:30.210> into<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.689> ride<00:00:31.369> I've<00:00:32.369> been<00:00:32.520> taking<00:00:32.790> it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
miles into the ride I've been taking it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.209 
miles into the ride I've been taking it
very<00:00:32.910> easy<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.600> throttle<00:00:33.809> as<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:34.440> kill

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
very easy on the throttle as to not kill

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.650 
very easy on the throttle as to not kill
these<00:00:35.370> batteries<00:00:35.850> because<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.180> didn't<00:00:36.540> know

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
these batteries because I didn't know

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.150 
these batteries because I didn't know
how<00:00:36.840> they<00:00:37.230> were<00:00:37.320> going<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> last<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:38.040> this

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
how they were going to last on this

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.299 
how they were going to last on this
really<00:00:38.460> long<00:00:38.610> trip<00:00:39.770> all<00:00:40.770> right<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.100> finally

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
really long trip all right we finally

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.139 
really long trip all right we finally
get<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> end<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> ride<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.899> let's<00:00:43.710> see

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
get to the end of the ride and let's see

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.170 
get to the end of the ride and let's see
25<00:00:45.149> point<00:00:45.629> 14<00:00:46.050> miles

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
25 point 14 miles

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.080 
25 point 14 miles
check<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> packs<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.629> 59<00:00:51.989> point<00:00:52.260> 12<00:00:52.469> volts

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
check so the packs at 59 point 12 volts

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.740 
check so the packs at 59 point 12 volts
max<00:00:54.090> draws<00:00:54.390> almost<00:00:54.690> 1,700<00:00:55.680> watts<00:00:56.570> 5.3<00:00:57.570> amp

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
max draws almost 1,700 watts 5.3 amp

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.360 
max draws almost 1,700 watts 5.3 amp
hours<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> way<00:00:58.710> back<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.399> that's<00:01:00.120> 13<00:01:00.930> miles

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
hours on the way back so that's 13 miles

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.399 
hours on the way back so that's 13 miles
5<00:01:02.370> point<00:01:02.760> something<00:01:03.059> amps<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:04.530> bad<00:01:06.409> 5.3

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
5 point something amps it's not bad 5.3

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.890 
5 point something amps it's not bad 5.3
for<00:01:08.540> 312<00:01:09.540> watt<00:01:09.810> hours<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> if<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.270> estimate<00:01:12.750> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
for 312 watt hours so if I estimate it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.510 
for 312 watt hours so if I estimate it
probably<00:01:13.200> took<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.439> little<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.799> less<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.369> get

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
probably took a little bit less to get

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.940 
probably took a little bit less to get
there<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.720> more<00:01:16.290> downhill<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
there because it's more downhill on the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.700 
there because it's more downhill on the
way<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.240> I'd<00:01:18.420> say<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:18.780> 4<00:01:19.140> amp<00:01:19.320> hours

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
way there so I'd say about 4 amp hours

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.429 
way there so I'd say about 4 amp hours
so<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.280> draw<00:01:20.580> almost<00:01:21.570> 10<00:01:21.810> F<00:01:21.960> hours<00:01:22.259> out<00:01:22.409> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
so we draw almost 10 F hours out of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.340 
so we draw almost 10 F hours out of
these<00:01:22.619> packs<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.000> back<00:01:24.180> from<00:01:24.390> my<00:01:24.930> longest

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
these packs and get back from my longest

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.539 
these packs and get back from my longest
ebike<00:01:25.680> ride<00:01:25.979> yet<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.790> 25<00:01:27.330> miles<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.340> my

and<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.550> got<00:02:11.730> bent<00:02:12.030> spokes<00:02:12.540> which<00:02:13.379> he<00:02:14.220> didn't

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
and it's got bent spokes which he didn't

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.250 
and it's got bent spokes which he didn't
tell<00:02:14.670> me<00:02:14.700> about<00:02:14.819> they're<00:02:15.330> all<00:02:15.360> loose<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.989> bent

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
tell me about they're all loose and bent

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.780 
tell me about they're all loose and bent
probably<00:02:17.250> going<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.610> get<00:02:17.700> it

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
probably going to have to get it

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.839 
probably going to have to get it
realized<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:19.680> only<00:02:19.769> thing<00:02:19.890> he<00:02:20.190> said<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.670> had<00:02:20.819> a

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
realized the only thing he said it had a

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.580 
realized the only thing he said it had a
couple<00:02:21.209> Nick's<00:02:21.569> in<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.870> Hall<00:02:22.019> sensors

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
couple Nick's in the Hall sensors

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.670 
couple Nick's in the Hall sensors
probably<00:02:23.010> need<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.250> fix<00:02:23.459> them<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:25.200> this

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
probably need to fix them but this

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.770 
probably need to fix them but this
wiring<00:02:25.920> cluster<00:02:26.550> looks<00:02:26.760> pretty<00:02:27.030> messy<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:27.690> I'm

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
wiring cluster looks pretty messy so I'm

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.949 
wiring cluster looks pretty messy so I'm
probably<00:02:27.959> going<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.349> end<00:02:28.380> up<00:02:28.530> redoing<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.959> the

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
probably going to end up redoing it the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.229 
probably going to end up redoing it the
next<00:02:31.170> thing<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.440> did<00:02:31.500> was<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.880> took<00:02:32.880> up<00:02:32.970> all<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
next thing I did was a took up all the

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.509 
next thing I did was a took up all the
old<00:02:33.360> heat<00:02:33.930> shrink<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.530> electrical<00:02:34.950> tape<00:02:35.160> and

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
old heat shrink and electrical tape and

old heat shrink and electrical tape and
zip<00:02:35.819> ties<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.470> nut<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.709> bolt<00:02:37.769> obviously

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
zip ties and the nut and bolt obviously

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.390 
zip ties and the nut and bolt obviously
and<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:39.540> have<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.049> repair<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.440> wiring<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.099> bought

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
and I have to repair the wiring I bought

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.009 
and I have to repair the wiring I bought
this<00:02:41.580> motor<00:02:41.970> used<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:44.720> as<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.870> can<00:02:45.959> see

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
this motor used and as you can see

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.490 
this motor used and as you can see
there's<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.380> nick<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.769> green<00:02:47.040> phase<00:02:47.370> and

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
there's a nick in the green phase and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.440 
there's a nick in the green phase and
one<00:02:49.500> broken<00:02:49.769> Hall<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.640> couple<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> junk

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
one broken Hall and a couple of the junk

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.880 
one broken Hall and a couple of the junk
hauls<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.110> I'm<00:02:52.230> going<00:02:52.349> to<00:02:52.380> take<00:02:52.530> care<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.769> this

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
hauls so I'm going to take care of this

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.330 
hauls so I'm going to take care of this
wiring<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.549> also<00:02:54.709> I'm<00:02:55.709> going<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.920> change<00:02:56.190> out

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
wiring I also I'm going to change out

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.130 
wiring I also I'm going to change out
the<00:02:56.459> connectors<00:02:56.940> because<00:02:57.690> they're

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
the connectors because they're

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.470 
the connectors because they're
anderson's<00:02:58.650> but<00:02:59.250> they're<00:02:59.430> kind<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.700> broken<00:03:00.299> so

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
anderson's but they're kind of broken so

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.539 
anderson's but they're kind of broken so
when<00:03:00.569> you<00:03:00.690> plug<00:03:00.900> them<00:03:01.049> together<00:03:01.230> they<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
when you plug them together they the

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.720 
when you plug them together they the
pins<00:03:03.140> fall<00:03:04.140> out<00:03:04.380> like<00:03:04.739> as<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.370> see<00:03:05.549> that

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
pins fall out like as you can see that

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.140 
pins fall out like as you can see that
one<00:03:05.849> right<00:03:05.970> there<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.299> not<00:03:06.510> locked<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:08.150> alright

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
one right there is not locked in alright

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.699 
one right there is not locked in alright
they<00:03:09.329> have<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.480> little<00:03:09.690> piece<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.170> red<00:03:10.560> and

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
they have a little piece of red and

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.800 
they have a little piece of red and
black<00:03:10.860> wire<00:03:11.190> very<00:03:11.549> very<00:03:11.849> small<00:03:12.120> gauge<00:03:12.389> I<00:03:12.630> don't

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
black wire very very small gauge I don't

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.379 
black wire very very small gauge I don't
even<00:03:12.870> know<00:03:13.049> what<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.350> but<00:03:13.560> it's<00:03:13.850> almost<00:03:14.850> the

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
even know what it is but it's almost the

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.270 
even know what it is but it's almost the
same<00:03:15.690> size<00:03:15.959> as<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.410> stuff<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.069> we<00:03:17.160> have

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
same size as this stuff that we have

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.370 
same size as this stuff that we have
here<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:18.420> next<00:03:18.750> thing<00:03:18.870> I'm<00:03:18.989> going<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.139> do<00:03:19.260> is

connections made and then I'll be able
to<00:03:24.690> put<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:24.989> piece<00:03:25.139> of<00:03:25.290> heat<00:03:25.380> shrink<00:03:25.440> over<00:03:25.859> there

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
to put a piece of heat shrink over there

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.629 
to put a piece of heat shrink over there
cover<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.120> up

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
alright success put a little bit of

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.039 
alright success put a little bit of
solder<00:03:31.590> there<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:33.060> extended<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.600> red<00:03:33.900> and

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
solder there and I extended the red and

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.680 
solder there and I extended the red and
black<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.730> rest<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:36.030> them<00:03:36.150> are<00:03:36.269> fine

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690

black and the rest of them are fine
I<00:03:36.720> had<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.319> take<00:03:37.500> off<00:03:37.650> all<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:38.160> previous<00:03:38.700> heat

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
I had to take off all the previous heat

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.879 
I had to take off all the previous heat
shrink<00:03:39.299> all<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.810> way<00:03:39.930> down<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.410> where<00:03:40.709> it's

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
shrink all the way down to where it's

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.160 
shrink all the way down to where it's
already<00:03:41.250> changed<00:03:41.910> over<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.269> Anderson

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
already changed over to the Anderson

already changed over to the Anderson
connecting<00:03:43.739> leads<00:03:44.150> so<00:03:45.150> I'm<00:03:45.750> going<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:45.989> see<00:03:46.109> if

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
connecting leads so I'm going to see if

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.449 
connecting leads so I'm going to see if
I<00:03:46.290> can<00:03:46.440> slide<00:03:46.650> some<00:03:46.829> heat<00:03:46.950> shrink<00:03:47.160> over<00:03:47.250> this

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
I can slide some heat shrink over this

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.110 
I can slide some heat shrink over this
stuff<00:03:47.639> and<00:03:47.819> take<00:03:47.970> care<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:49.849> alright<00:03:50.849> there

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
stuff and take care of it alright there

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.830 
stuff and take care of it alright there

the<00:03:52.290> smallest<00:03:52.590> heat<00:03:52.799> shrink<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.130> have<00:03:53.310> was

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
the smallest heat shrink I have was

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.910 
the smallest heat shrink I have was
actually<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:53.940> teeny<00:03:54.239> bit<00:03:54.480> too<00:03:54.660> big<00:03:54.870> but<00:03:55.200> they're

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
actually a teeny bit too big but they're

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.650 
actually a teeny bit too big but they're
in<00:03:56.010> place<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.459> they'll<00:03:56.579> be<00:03:56.670> fine<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:57.389> may

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
in place and they'll be fine that may

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.390 
in place and they'll be fine that may
not<00:03:57.780> look<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.049> best<00:03:58.349> but<00:03:58.530> it's<00:03:59.069> definitely

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
not look the best but it's definitely

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.569 
not look the best but it's definitely
safe<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:01.440> I'm<00:04:01.709> probably<00:04:01.920> going<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.190> try<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.400> put

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
safe so I'm probably going to try to put

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.400 
safe so I'm probably going to try to put
some<00:04:02.609> other<00:04:03.180> type<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.630> protection<00:04:04.109> over<00:04:04.169> these

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
some other type of protection over these

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.839 
some other type of protection over these
wires<00:04:04.650> since<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.069> really<00:04:05.280> don't<00:04:05.430> have<00:04:05.489> long

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
wires since I really don't have long

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.370 
wires since I really don't have long
heat<00:04:06.090> shrink<00:04:06.389> to<00:04:06.480> get<00:04:06.599> all<00:04:06.690> this<00:04:06.840> taken<00:04:07.169> care

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
heat shrink to get all this taken care

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.800 
heat shrink to get all this taken care
of<00:04:07.410> so<00:04:08.400> I'll<00:04:08.700> try<00:04:08.849> to<00:04:08.910> find<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.209> solution<00:04:09.359> and

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
of so I'll try to find a solution and

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.979 
of so I'll try to find a solution and
get<00:04:10.650> this<00:04:10.829> thing<00:04:10.980> bolted<00:04:11.160> on<00:04:11.750> all<00:04:12.750> right<00:04:12.959> I

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
get this thing bolted on all right I

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.140 
get this thing bolted on all right I
pulled<00:04:13.290> my<00:04:13.440> old<00:04:13.620> hub<00:04:13.919> motor<00:04:14.099> off<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.730> GM

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
pulled my old hub motor off the GM

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.409 
pulled my old hub motor off the GM
thousand<00:04:15.690> watt<00:04:15.840> 48<00:04:16.349> volt<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:17.000> I<00:04:18.000> also<00:04:18.150> took

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
thousand watt 48 volt and I also took

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.970 
thousand watt 48 volt and I also took
off<00:04:18.810> my<00:04:18.989> disk<00:04:19.229> caliper<00:04:19.440> just<00:04:20.159> to<00:04:20.640> make

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
off my disk caliper just to make

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.920 
off my disk caliper just to make
with<00:04:21.490> the<00:04:21.610> new<00:04:21.760> motor<00:04:21.970> lines<00:04:22.300> up<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:22.720> I<00:04:22.780> don't

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
with the new motor lines up and I don't

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.770 
with the new motor lines up and I don't
have<00:04:23.020> any<00:04:23.140> problems<00:04:24.390> I'm<00:04:25.390> probably<00:04:25.540> going<00:04:25.720> to

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
have any problems I'm probably going to

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.900 
have any problems I'm probably going to
swap<00:04:26.020> over<00:04:26.170> this<00:04:26.410> rotor<00:04:26.680> even<00:04:27.430> though<00:04:27.580> I'm<00:04:27.760> not

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
swap over this rotor even though I'm not

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.170 
swap over this rotor even though I'm not
sure<00:04:27.970> how<00:04:28.420> it's<00:04:28.570> going<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.780> line<00:04:28.990> up<00:04:29.020> yet<00:04:29.410> I

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
sure how it's going to line up yet I

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.280 
sure how it's going to line up yet I
found<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.210> nice<00:04:31.330> piece<00:04:31.510> of<00:04:31.660> insulation<00:04:31.870> right

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
found a nice piece of insulation right

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.200 
found a nice piece of insulation right
here<00:04:32.530> so<00:04:32.740> I'll<00:04:33.100> be<00:04:33.130> able<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.490> sleeve<00:04:33.790> this<00:04:33.910> over

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
here so I'll be able to sleeve this over

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.090 
here so I'll be able to sleeve this over
all<00:04:34.330> my<00:04:34.510> Hall<00:04:34.720> sensors<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:35.470> that<00:04:35.560> just<00:04:35.890> zip

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
all my Hall sensors and that just zip

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.310 
all my Hall sensors and that just zip
tie<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.310> in<00:04:36.460> place<00:04:36.670> I'm<00:04:37.600> going<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:37.840> tie<00:04:38.110> on<00:04:38.260> a

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
tie it in place I'm going to tie on a

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.140 
tie it in place I'm going to tie on a
single<00:04:38.680> conductor<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.280> my<00:04:39.400> five<00:04:39.640> Hall<00:04:39.910> wires

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
single conductor to my five Hall wires

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.850 
single conductor to my five Hall wires
and<00:04:40.540> snake<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:41.020> through<00:04:41.050> here<00:04:41.440> to<00:04:41.560> make<00:04:41.710> it<00:04:41.800> a

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
and snake it through here to make it a

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.250 
and snake it through here to make it a
little<00:04:42.040> easier<00:04:42.340> on<00:04:42.460> myself<00:04:42.640> so<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.720> sleep<00:04:44.140> the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
little easier on myself so I sleep the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.350 
little easier on myself so I sleep the
whole<00:04:44.410> piece<00:04:45.310> of<00:04:45.430> insulation<00:04:45.820> over<00:04:46.030> all<00:04:46.240> my

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
whole piece of insulation over all my

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.890 
whole piece of insulation over all my
Hall<00:04:46.540> sensors<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.700> think<00:04:48.880> that'll<00:04:49.210> help<00:04:49.720> it

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
Hall sensors and I think that'll help it

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.110 
Hall sensors and I think that'll help it
out<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:50.020> lot<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:50.410> add<00:04:50.650> some<00:04:50.860> protection<00:04:51.310> it's

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
out a lot and add some protection it's

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.830 
out a lot and add some protection it's
kind<00:04:52.330> of<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.450> pain<00:04:52.630> but<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.890> went<00:04:54.040> on<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.840> I'm

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
kind of a pain but it went on and I'm

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.879 
kind of a pain but it went on and I'm
satisfied

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.999 

all<00:05:03.889> right<00:05:04.069> I<00:05:04.099> have<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.460> 54<00:05:05.389> o4<00:05:05.919> mounted<00:05:06.919> on

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
all right I have the 54 o4 mounted on

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.370 
all right I have the 54 o4 mounted on
the<00:05:07.099> bike<00:05:07.310> with<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:08.270> specialized<00:05:08.810> front<00:05:09.259> and

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
the bike with the specialized front and

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.900 
the bike with the specialized front and
back<00:05:09.500> tires<00:05:09.830> I<00:05:10.069> swapped<00:05:10.400> those<00:05:10.610> out<00:05:10.880> I<00:05:11.289> got<00:05:12.289> my

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
back tires I swapped those out I got my

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.540 
back tires I swapped those out I got my
brake<00:05:13.910> rotor<00:05:14.210> on<00:05:14.740> all<00:05:15.740> right<00:05:15.889> nice<00:05:16.130> I<00:05:16.340> got<00:05:16.430> my

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
brake rotor on all right nice I got my

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.510 
brake rotor on all right nice I got my
15<00:05:16.849> cell<00:05:17.090> lipo<00:05:17.270> pack<00:05:17.720> hooked<00:05:18.020> up<00:05:18.199> to<00:05:18.380> it<00:05:18.530> and<00:05:18.740> I

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
15 cell lipo pack hooked up to it and I

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.129 
15 cell lipo pack hooked up to it and I
was<00:05:20.210> just<00:05:20.330> trying<00:05:20.449> to<00:05:20.630> figure<00:05:20.750> out<00:05:20.930> all<00:05:21.020> the

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
was just trying to figure out all the

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.170 
was just trying to figure out all the
phase<00:05:21.319> and<00:05:21.530> Hall<00:05:21.680> combinations<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.639> I

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
phase and Hall combinations and I

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.879 
phase and Hall combinations and I
finally<00:05:23.389> got<00:05:23.630> it<00:05:23.780> it<00:05:24.050> only<00:05:24.169> took<00:05:24.410> like<00:05:24.470> three

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
finally got it it only took like three

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.950 
finally got it it only took like three
tries<00:05:25.130> this<00:05:25.400> time<00:05:25.669> and<00:05:25.970> it's<00:05:26.660> spinning

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
tries this time and it's spinning

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.870 
tries this time and it's spinning
forward<00:05:27.440> so<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.889> controller's<00:05:28.370> still<00:05:28.550> set<00:05:28.789> in

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
forward so the controller's still set in

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.559 
forward so the controller's still set in
that<00:05:29.000> mode<00:05:30.669> all<00:05:31.669> right<00:05:31.970> I<00:05:32.120> got<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.419> motor

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:32.569 
that mode all right I got the motor

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.379 
that mode all right I got the motor
mounted<00:05:32.960> on<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.110> bike<00:05:33.289> I<00:05:34.060> changed<00:05:35.060> out<00:05:35.180> both

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
mounted on the bike I changed out both

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.580 
mounted on the bike I changed out both
front<00:05:35.720> and<00:05:35.780> rear<00:05:35.870> tires<00:05:36.259> with<00:05:36.560> the

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
front and rear tires with the

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.070 
front and rear tires with the
specialized<00:05:37.340> crossroads<00:05:38.030> these<00:05:38.750> things<00:05:38.960> are

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
specialized crossroads these things are

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.899 
specialized crossroads these things are
good<00:05:39.199> for<00:05:39.319> up<00:05:39.380> to<00:05:39.470> 80<00:05:39.650> psi<00:05:40.220> I<00:05:40.250> didn't<00:05:40.639> know<00:05:40.759> that

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 
good for up to 80 psi I didn't know that

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.140 
good for up to 80 psi I didn't know that
till<00:05:41.150> now<00:05:41.210> but<00:05:41.690> it's<00:05:41.870> pretty<00:05:42.020> cool<00:05:43.030> get<00:05:44.030> the

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
till now but it's pretty cool get the

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.050 
till now but it's pretty cool get the
disc<00:05:44.330> brake<00:05:44.479> all<00:05:44.810> set<00:05:45.470> up<00:05:45.590> I<00:05:45.830> got<00:05:46.610> the<00:05:46.729> caliper

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
disc brake all set up I got the caliper

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.879 
disc brake all set up I got the caliper
I<00:05:47.389> lined<00:05:47.599> up<00:05:47.720> properly<00:05:47.960> and<00:05:48.259> working<00:05:48.710> I

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
I lined up properly and working I

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.100 
I lined up properly and working I
actually<00:05:49.789> could<00:05:50.120> use<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.389> same<00:05:50.569> adapter<00:05:51.080> I

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
actually could use the same adapter I

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.110 
actually could use the same adapter I
made<00:05:51.380> for<00:05:51.620> my<00:05:51.680> others<00:05:51.949> I<00:05:52.310> just<00:05:52.729> had<00:05:52.849> to<00:05:52.940> bring

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
made for my others I just had to bring

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.460 
made for my others I just had to bring
it<00:05:53.240> to<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.389> outside<00:05:53.419> of<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.930> frame<00:05:54.139> instead

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
it to the outside of the frame instead

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.719 
it to the outside of the frame instead
of<00:05:54.560> the<00:05:54.620> inside<00:05:54.949> of<00:05:55.039> the<00:05:55.099> frame<00:05:55.310> and

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
of the inside of the frame and

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.689 
of the inside of the frame and
everything's<00:05:56.240> lining<00:05:56.449> up<00:05:56.690> I<00:05:57.430> got<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:58.520> phase

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
everything's lining up I got the phase

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.600 
everything's lining up I got the phase
wires<00:05:58.940> taped<00:05:59.270> up<00:05:59.479> and<00:05:59.889> the<00:06:00.889> combinations<00:06:01.460> are

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
wires taped up and the combinations are

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.040 
wires taped up and the combinations are
correct<00:06:02.030> and<00:06:02.300> the<00:06:02.419> motor<00:06:02.599> is<00:06:02.690> spinning

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
correct and the motor is spinning

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.879 
correct and the motor is spinning
properly<00:06:04.870> so<00:06:05.870> everything's<00:06:06.500> good

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
properly so everything's good

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.629 
properly so everything's good
I<00:06:07.509> took<00:06:08.509> it<00:06:08.750> for<00:06:08.810> a<00:06:08.900> test<00:06:09.110> drive<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:10.340> spokes

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
I took it for a test drive the spokes

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.399 
I took it for a test drive the spokes
are<00:06:10.820> really<00:06:11.180> loose<00:06:11.389> I<00:06:11.630> got<00:06:11.750> to<00:06:11.840> deal<00:06:11.990> with<00:06:12.169> that

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
are really loose I got to deal with that

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:15.999 
are really loose I got to deal with that
I<00:06:13.719> hope<00:06:14.719> I<00:06:14.840> can<00:06:15.020> fix<00:06:15.229> it<00:06:15.409> I<00:06:15.530> don't<00:06:15.710> have<00:06:15.800> to<00:06:15.889> get

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:16.009 
I hope I can fix it I don't have to get

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:17.260 
I hope I can fix it I don't have to get
it<00:06:16.099> real<00:06:16.219> aced<00:06:16.430> because<00:06:16.729> I<00:06:16.789> don't<00:06:16.940> really<00:06:17.120> want

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
it real aced because I don't really want

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.610 
it real aced because I don't really want
to<00:06:17.300> spend<00:06:17.479> any<00:06:17.719> more<00:06:17.810> money<00:06:17.870> after<00:06:18.380> spending

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
to spend any more money after spending

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.180 
to spend any more money after spending
so<00:06:19.400> much<00:06:19.610> on<00:06:19.789> this<00:06:19.880> motor<00:06:20.590> but<00:06:21.590> just<00:06:21.949> look<00:06:22.099> at

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
so much on this motor but just look at

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
so much on this motor but just look at
out<00:06:22.280> why<00:06:22.430> this<00:06:22.490> thing<00:06:22.729> is

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.910 

it's<00:06:29.210> almost<00:06:29.330> twice<00:06:29.720> as<00:06:29.930> heavy<00:06:30.110> as<00:06:30.350> my<00:06:30.500> golden

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
it's almost twice as heavy as my golden

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.590 
it's almost twice as heavy as my golden
motor<00:06:31.070> thousand<00:06:31.610> watt<00:06:31.790> which<00:06:32.030> I<00:06:32.150> thought<00:06:32.390> was

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
motor thousand watt which I thought was

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.370 
motor thousand watt which I thought was
a<00:06:32.660> heavy<00:06:32.930> motor<00:06:33.230> before<00:06:33.520> this<00:06:34.520> thing<00:06:34.850> is<00:06:35.120> heavy

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.870 

it<00:06:39.380> actually<00:06:39.710> almost<00:06:39.860> seems<00:06:40.190> a<00:06:40.310> little<00:06:40.520> slower

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
it actually almost seems a little slower

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.990 
it actually almost seems a little slower
than<00:06:41.120> my<00:06:41.300> my<00:06:41.810> golden<00:06:42.710> motor<00:06:42.860> as<00:06:43.010> well<00:06:43.040> I<00:06:43.490> think

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
than my my golden motor as well I think

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.470 
than my my golden motor as well I think
I<00:06:44.240> was<00:06:44.330> getting<00:06:45.010> under<00:06:46.010> 30<00:06:46.310> on<00:06:46.520> it<00:06:46.700> when<00:06:46.880> I<00:06:47.180> was

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
I was getting under 30 on it when I was

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.390 
I was getting under 30 on it when I was
using<00:06:47.720> 15<00:06:48.170> cell<00:06:48.470> which<00:06:48.680> is<00:06:48.710> weird<00:06:49.040> I'm<00:06:49.250> gonna

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
using 15 cell which is weird I'm gonna

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.540 
using 15 cell which is weird I'm gonna
have<00:06:49.520> to<00:06:49.610> find<00:06:49.760> out<00:06:49.970> again<00:06:50.210> though<00:06:51.130> but<00:06:52.130> once<00:06:52.430> I

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
have to find out again though but once I

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.000 
have to find out again though but once I
up<00:06:52.730> the<00:06:52.880> voltage<00:06:53.210> to<00:06:53.390> 20<00:06:53.810> or<00:06:53.900> 24<00:06:54.320> cell<00:06:54.650> I'm<00:06:54.860> sure

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.010 
up the voltage to 20 or 24 cell I'm sure

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.320 
up the voltage to 20 or 24 cell I'm sure
this<00:06:55.160> thing<00:06:55.310> is<00:06:55.400> going<00:06:55.520> to<00:06:55.580> come<00:06:55.700> alive<00:06:55.970> and<00:06:56.270> be

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
this thing is going to come alive and be

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:26.159 
this thing is going to come alive and be
pretty<00:06:56.840> pretty<00:06:57.170> fun

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:26.169 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:28.209 

before<00:07:27.169> it<00:07:27.229> gets<00:07:27.289> dark<00:07:27.529> out<00:07:27.709> if<00:07:27.830> figure<00:07:27.979> I<00:07:28.009> get

00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:28.219 
before it gets dark out if figure I get

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:29.859 
before it gets dark out if figure I get
one<00:07:28.339> more<00:07:28.459> shot<00:07:28.699> of<00:07:28.819> the<00:07:28.879> bike<00:07:29.059> outside

00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:29.869 
one more shot of the bike outside

00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:33.969 
one more shot of the bike outside
I'll<00:07:30.739> tempt<00:07:31.339> out<00:07:31.489> motor<00:07:32.389> working<00:07:32.899> it<00:07:33.529> out<00:07:33.800> big

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:33.979 
I'll tempt out motor working it out big

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:36.550 
I'll tempt out motor working it out big
that<00:07:34.159> motor<00:07:34.339> is
