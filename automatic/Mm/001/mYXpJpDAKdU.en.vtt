glitch i'm going to show you guys how to
ensure<00:00:07.560> any<00:00:08.189> supercar<00:00:08.849> any<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:10.290> know

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
ensure any supercar any you know

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.110 
ensure any supercar any you know
supercar<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.309> can't<00:00:11.580> store<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.030> your

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.700 
supercar that you can't store in your
garage<00:00:12.240> normally<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.620> was

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
garage normally and this and it was

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.079 
garage normally and this and it was
significant<00:00:14.250> about<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.519> glitch<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.910> it

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
significant about this glitch is it

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.029 
significant about this glitch is it
actually<00:00:15.480> allows<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.960> do<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.170> by<00:00:16.379> yourself

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
actually allows you to do it by yourself

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.090 
actually allows you to do it by yourself
so<00:00:18.029> as<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.480> see<00:00:18.660> here<00:00:19.020> i<00:00:19.199> try<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.800> put<00:00:20.070> it

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
so as you can see here i try to put it

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.560 
so as you can see here i try to put it
in<00:00:20.189> my<00:00:20.310> garage<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.180> doesn't<00:00:21.300> really<00:00:21.449> work

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
in my garage but it doesn't really work

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.179 
in my garage but it doesn't really work
obviously<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.769> still<00:00:22.920> out<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.130> be

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
obviously because it's still out to be

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.640 
obviously because it's still out to be
modified<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.090> supercar<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:25.410> already

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
modified and it's a supercar it already

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.630 
modified and it's a supercar it already
had<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> tracker<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.519> what

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
glitch will not in fact work so once you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.220 
glitch will not in fact work so once you
park<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.180> there<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.510> run<00:00:45.780> inside<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.140> your
