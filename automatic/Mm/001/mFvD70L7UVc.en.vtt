whenever you know how the spawn delay

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.310 
whenever you know how the spawn delay
was<00:03:10.070> like<00:03:10.250> 10<00:03:10.549> seconds<00:03:11.030> or<00:03:11.180> longer<00:03:11.360> now<00:03:12.109> it's

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
was like 10 seconds or longer now it's

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.590 
was like 10 seconds or longer now it's
almost<00:03:12.859> instant<00:03:13.609> it<00:03:13.820> only<00:03:13.970> takes<00:03:14.239> like<00:03:14.329> three

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
almost instant it only takes like three

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
almost instant it only takes like three
seconds<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:16.010> respond<00:03:16.630> it's<00:03:17.630> pretty<00:03:17.930> cool<00:03:18.230> and

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
seconds to respond it's pretty cool and

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.349 
seconds to respond it's pretty cool and
then<00:03:18.829> whenever<00:03:19.070> you're<00:03:19.430> Lake<00:03:19.609> of<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.820> enemy

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
then whenever you're Lake of the enemy

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.030 
then whenever you're Lake of the enemy
team<00:03:20.570> they<00:03:21.440> won't<00:03:21.650> spawn<00:03:21.920> on<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:24.040> because

it's like a negative influence so they

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.069

much time to explain

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.270 
much time to explain
and<00:05:13.900> then<00:05:14.050> in<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.380> middle<00:05:14.680> of<00:05:14.710> Eagle<00:05:14.980> and

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
and then in the middle of Eagle and

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.650 
and then in the middle of Eagle and
Berlin<00:05:15.640> wall<00:05:15.880> in<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.120> middle<00:05:16.330> there's<00:05:16.540> gonna

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
Berlin wall in the middle there's gonna

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.990 
Berlin wall in the middle there's gonna
be<00:05:16.870> automated<00:05:17.230> turrets<00:05:17.590> which<00:05:18.430> they<00:05:18.640> can<00:05:18.820> kill

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
be automated turrets which they can kill

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.860 
be automated turrets which they can kill
you<00:05:20.100> but<00:05:21.100> you<00:05:21.220> get<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.730> objective<00:05:22.000> way

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
you but you get to the objective way

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.280 
you but you get to the objective way
faster<00:05:23.380> then<00:05:23.620> going<00:05:24.220> around<00:05:24.340> the<00:05:24.610> map<00:05:24.790> and

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
faster then going around the map and

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.780 
faster then going around the map and
then<00:05:26.550> second<00:05:27.550> map<00:05:27.760> or<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.150> third<00:05:28.450> map<00:05:28.660> is<00:05:29.790> the

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
then second map or the third map is the

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.900 
then second map or the third map is the
bridge<00:05:31.920> something<00:05:32.920> like<00:05:33.040> that<00:05:33.280> discover<00:05:33.820> oh

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
bridge something like that discover oh

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.850 
bridge something like that discover oh
yeah<00:05:34.120> discover<00:05:34.510> there's<00:05:35.230> gonna<00:05:35.380> be<00:05:35.560> like<00:05:35.710> this

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
yeah discover there's gonna be like this

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.080 
yeah discover there's gonna be like this
huge<00:05:36.100> bridge<00:05:36.400> channel<00:05:36.760> you<00:05:36.850> throw<00:05:37.060> like

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
huge bridge channel you throw like

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.830 
huge bridge channel you throw like
semtex<00:05:37.540> the<00:05:38.530> like<00:05:38.920> it<00:05:39.460> collapses<00:05:40.180> so<00:05:40.390> then

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
semtex the like it collapses so then

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.470 
semtex the like it collapses so then
like<00:05:41.020> you<00:05:41.170> kill<00:05:41.410> the<00:05:41.590> teammates<00:05:42.180> it's<00:05:43.180> pretty
