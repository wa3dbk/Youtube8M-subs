00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
some high-value tech in this base but we

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.880 
some high-value tech in this base but we
can't<00:03:30.090> get<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:31.019> armory<00:03:31.319> is<00:03:31.410> sealed<00:03:31.739> by

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
can't get to it the armory is sealed by

can't get to it the armory is sealed by
a<00:03:31.920> blast<00:03:32.250> door<00:03:32.489> we<00:03:32.730> can't<00:03:32.940> get<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.209> open

a blast door we can't get it open
we're<00:03:34.230> pretty<00:03:34.440> sure<00:03:34.560> anyone<00:03:35.099> who<00:03:35.129> completes

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
we're pretty sure anyone who completes

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.729 
we're pretty sure anyone who completes
the<00:03:35.760> facilities<00:03:36.299> VR<00:03:36.629> simulation<00:03:37.319> program

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
the facilities VR simulation program

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.890 
the facilities VR simulation program
will<00:03:37.890> gain<00:03:38.069> access<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:39.269> it<00:03:39.390> requires<00:03:39.750> a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
will gain access but it requires a

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.949 
will gain access but it requires a
certain<00:03:40.440> interface<00:03:41.599> unfortunately<00:03:42.599> we<00:03:42.810> don't

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
certain interface unfortunately we don't

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.259 
certain interface unfortunately we don't
have<00:03:43.079> one<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:44.129> do<00:03:44.370> right<00:03:44.910> there<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.239> your

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.890 
simulator and complete that program
which<00:03:50.010> will<00:03:50.220> unlock<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.670> armory<00:03:51.000> you'll<00:03:51.750> get

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
which will unlock the armory you'll get
