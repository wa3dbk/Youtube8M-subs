00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.540 

you

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.160 

the<00:00:24.550> next<00:00:24.820> three<00:00:25.000> chords<00:00:25.029> are<00:00:25.570> also<00:00:25.720> going<00:00:26.080> to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
the next three chords are also going to

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.679 
the next three chords are also going to
be<00:00:26.380> very<00:00:26.710> easy<00:00:26.980> to<00:00:27.220> learn<00:00:27.480> we're<00:00:28.480> going<00:00:28.599> to

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
be very easy to learn we're going to

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.650 
be very easy to learn we're going to
learn<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:29.470> chords<00:00:29.920> and<00:00:30.160> three<00:00:30.400> keys<00:00:30.669> we're

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
learn the chords and three keys we're

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.090 
learn the chords and three keys we're
going<00:00:31.750> to<00:00:31.840> learn<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.320> chords<00:00:32.619> in<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:32.830> key<00:00:32.920> of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
going to learn the chords in the key of

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.650 
going to learn the chords in the key of
D<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.809> key<00:00:35.050> of<00:00:35.260> E<00:00:35.500> and<00:00:36.430> the<00:00:37.150> key<00:00:37.330> of<00:00:37.449> a<00:00:37.690> sol<00:00:38.470> de<00:00:38.830> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
D the key of E and the key of a sol de a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.390 
D the key of E and the key of a sol de a
so<00:00:40.660> the<00:00:40.900> D<00:00:41.050> chord<00:00:41.320> is<00:00:41.620> simple<00:00:42.750> start<00:00:43.750> on<00:00:43.900> D<00:00:44.400> we

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
so the D chord is simple start on D we

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.979 
so the D chord is simple start on D we
skip<00:00:45.699> a<00:00:45.820> key<00:00:46.030> but<00:00:46.210> this<00:00:46.390> time<00:00:46.600> we're<00:00:46.840> going<00:00:46.930> to

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
skip a key but this time we're going to

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.560 
skip a key but this time we're going to
actually<00:00:47.170> play<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.890> black<00:00:48.670> key<00:00:49.030> which<00:00:49.540> is

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
actually play the black key which is

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.380 
actually play the black key which is
called<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.110> have<00:00:50.230> sharp<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:52.090> then<00:00:52.270> we're

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
called to have sharp and then we're

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.110 
called to have sharp and then we're
going<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.570> have<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.920> note<00:00:54.219> on<00:00:54.460> top<00:00:54.760> which<00:00:55.000> is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
going to have this note on top which is

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.430 
going to have this note on top which is
a<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.500> we<00:00:56.620> have<00:00:56.739> all<00:00:56.860> three<00:00:57.039> of<00:00:57.129> those

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.229 

now<00:01:00.010> one<00:01:00.190> of<00:01:00.219> the<00:01:00.370> things<00:01:00.430> like<00:01:00.820> I<00:01:00.850> said<00:01:01.090> that

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
now one of the things like I said that

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.360 
now one of the things like I said that
makes<00:01:01.449> this<00:01:01.719> court<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.590> little<00:01:02.800> different<00:01:03.250> is

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
makes this court a little different is

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.189 
makes this court a little different is
that<00:01:03.430> it<00:01:03.730> has<00:01:03.879> this<00:01:04.089> black<00:01:04.390> key<00:01:04.690> in<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.930> middle

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
that it has this black key in the middle

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.600 
that it has this black key in the middle
but<00:01:05.350> that<00:01:05.470> also<00:01:05.650> makes<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:06.040> little<00:01:06.220> bit<00:01:06.310> easier

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
but that also makes a little bit easier

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.749 
but that also makes a little bit easier
to<00:01:06.790> remember<00:01:07.060> too<00:01:07.390> so<00:01:07.930> is<00:01:08.049> this<00:01:08.170> key<00:01:08.710> here<00:01:09.009> this

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
to remember too so is this key here this

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.300 
to remember too so is this key here this
one

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.730 

the<00:01:13.820> next<00:01:14.149> chord<00:01:14.390> looks<00:01:14.750> like<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.170> décor<00:01:15.560> but

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
the next chord looks like the décor but

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.060 
the next chord looks like the décor but
it<00:01:15.890> starts<00:01:16.189> on<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.340> note<00:01:16.549> e<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.210> we<00:01:17.329> have<00:01:17.450> e

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
it starts on the note e so we have e

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.230 
it starts on the note e so we have e
you're<00:01:19.070> going<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.340> skip<00:01:19.549> a<00:01:19.579> key<00:01:19.880> but<00:01:20.119> then

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
you're going to skip a key but then

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.639 
you're going to skip a key but then
we're<00:01:20.329> going<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:20.479> go<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:20.810> black<00:01:20.990> key<00:01:21.350> so

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
we're going to go to the black key so

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.800 
we're going to go to the black key so
this<00:01:21.829> one<00:01:21.979> here<00:01:22.390> you're<00:01:23.390> going<00:01:23.539> to<00:01:23.600> skip

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
this one here you're going to skip

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.510 
this one here you're going to skip
another<00:01:23.930> key<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.530> go<00:01:24.649> to<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:24.860> right<00:01:25.280> key

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
another key and go to this right key

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.490 
another key and go to this right key
right<00:01:25.729> here<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.990> we<00:01:27.110> have<00:01:27.229> these<00:01:27.380> three<00:01:27.680> keys

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
right here so we have these three keys

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.279 
right here so we have these three keys
that's<00:01:30.500> our<00:01:30.770> E<00:01:30.920> major<00:01:30.950> chord<00:01:31.340> in<00:01:32.110> our<00:01:33.110> last

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
that's our E major chord in our last

on the note a so if we go to the note

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.850 
on the note a so if we go to the note

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
about why we have a black key in the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.440 
about why we have a black key in the
middle<00:01:51.259> because<00:01:51.409> in<00:01:52.009> a<00:01:52.130> future<00:01:52.459> lesson<00:01:52.670> I'll

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
middle because in a future lesson I'll

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.389 
middle because in a future lesson I'll
actually<00:01:53.840> discuss<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.530> major<00:01:54.740> scales<00:01:55.100> and

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
actually discuss the major scales and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.059 
actually discuss the major scales and
how<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:55.549> form<00:01:56.000> these<00:01:56.179> chords<00:01:56.659> so<00:01:57.619> anyway<00:01:57.920> the

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
how you form these chords so anyway the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:59.649 
how you form these chords so anyway the
three<00:01:58.189> chords<00:01:58.640> once<00:01:58.849> again<00:01:59.090> on<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.330> D<00:01:59.450> major

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
three chords once again on the D major

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.039 
three chords once again on the D major
chord<00:02:01.119> email<00:02:02.119> court<00:02:02.569> an<00:02:03.289> a<00:02:04.069> major<00:02:04.280> chord<00:02:05.049> and

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
chord email court an a major chord and

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.749 
chord email court an a major chord and
again<00:02:06.649> these<00:02:06.770> are<00:02:06.860> easy<00:02:07.099> to<00:02:07.340> remember<00:02:07.580> because

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
again these are easy to remember because

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.999 
again these are easy to remember because
they<00:02:08.269> all<00:02:08.420> have<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.720> black<00:02:09.049> key<00:02:09.319> in<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.679> middle

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
they all have a black key in the middle

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.740 
they all have a black key in the middle
so<00:02:10.700> now<00:02:10.789> let's<00:02:10.970> go<00:02:11.060> back<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.420> D<00:02:11.540> major

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
so now let's go back to the D major

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.470 
so now let's go back to the D major
chord<00:02:12.459> second<00:02:13.459> quart<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:13.640> want<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:13.910> learn<00:02:14.060> is

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
chord second quart we want to learn is

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.140 
chord second quart we want to learn is

a half step to that one there that's our

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.930 
a half step to that one there that's our
d<00:02:25.940> minor<00:02:26.450> chord<00:02:28.030> D<00:02:29.030> major<00:02:29.500> D<00:02:30.500> minor

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
QV we have our E major chord which is

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.040 
QV we have our E major chord which is
this<00:02:36.550> one<00:02:36.730> here<00:02:37.000> again<00:02:37.420> what<00:02:37.569> we<00:02:37.660> do<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:37.900> we

this one here again what we do is we

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.729 
this one here again what we do is we
lower<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.470> middle<00:02:38.739> note<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:39.330> half<00:02:40.330> step<00:02:40.739> it

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
lower the middle note a half step it

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.260 
lower the middle note a half step it
gives<00:02:41.920> us<00:02:42.040> our<00:02:42.160> e-minor<00:02:42.580> chord<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:44.020> e<00:02:44.050> major

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
gives us our e-minor chord so e major

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.490 
gives us our e-minor chord so e major
e-minor<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:49.300> our<00:02:49.420> last<00:02:49.600> chord<00:02:50.020> in<00:02:50.140> this<00:02:50.290> series

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
e-minor in our last chord in this series

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.850 
e-minor in our last chord in this series
is<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.040> chord<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:52.209> we<00:02:52.360> have<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.810> major<00:02:53.500> chord

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
sometimes you just called an a chord now

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.900 
sometimes you just called an a chord now
we<00:02:56.020> make<00:02:56.290> an<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.620> minor<00:02:56.980> chord<00:02:57.100> so<00:02:57.580> we<00:02:57.700> lower

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
we make an a minor chord so we lower

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.490 
we make an a minor chord so we lower
that<00:02:58.120> middle<00:02:58.420> note<00:02:58.569> this<00:02:58.690> one<00:02:58.870> here<00:02:59.140> comes

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
that middle note this one here comes

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.580 
that middle note this one here comes
down<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.910> gives<00:03:01.120> us<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.480> minor<00:03:01.750> chord<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:02.380> again

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
down it gives us a minor chord so again

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:12.840 
down it gives us a minor chord so again
a<00:03:02.739> major<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.420> minor<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:11.350> now<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.620> next<00:03:11.890> set<00:03:12.819> of

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
based off an E major chord this one here

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.700 
based off an E major chord this one here
where<00:03:45.300> we<00:03:45.390> take<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> top<00:03:45.840> note<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.350> we<00:03:46.470> raise

where we take the top note and we raise

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.290 
where we take the top note and we raise
it<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.950> half<00:03:47.130> step<00:03:49.010> this<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.160> e<00:03:50.400> augmented<00:03:51.030> chord

it a half step this is e augmented chord

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.199 
it a half step this is e augmented chord
so<00:03:51.720> e<00:03:51.750> major<00:03:52.140> chord<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:53.730> augment<00:03:54.180> it

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.880 

same<00:03:58.209> thing<00:03:58.450> for<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.629> key<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:59.080> this<00:03:59.590> is<00:03:59.830> a

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
same thing for the key of a this is a

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.089 
same thing for the key of a this is a
record<00:04:00.400> here<00:04:00.790> we<00:04:01.450> raised<00:04:01.689> a<00:04:01.720> top<00:04:02.079> note<00:04:02.349> up<00:04:02.620> one

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
record here we raised a top note up one

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.179 
record here we raised a top note up one
half<00:04:03.340> step<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:05.019> we<00:04:05.140> go<00:04:05.290> from<00:04:05.500> this<00:04:05.709> one<00:04:05.920> here<00:04:06.069> to

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
half step so we go from this one here to

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.690 
half step so we go from this one here to
that<00:04:06.599> it<00:04:07.599> gives<00:04:07.810> us<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:08.140> augmented<00:04:08.709> chord<00:04:08.980> say

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
that it gives us a augmented chord say

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:19.140 
that it gives us a augmented chord say
major<00:04:10.560> hey<00:04:11.560> augmented<00:04:15.209> in<00:04:16.680> them<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:18.669> final

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
major hey augmented in them the final

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.729 
major hey augmented in them the final
set<00:04:19.539> of<00:04:19.570> course<00:04:19.870> that<00:04:20.109> will<00:04:20.199> learn<00:04:20.440> in<00:04:20.470> these

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
set of course that will learn in these

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.250 
set of course that will learn in these
three<00:04:20.949> keys<00:04:21.250> is<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.789> diminished<00:04:22.300> chord<00:04:22.720> so

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
three keys is the diminished chord so

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.020 
three keys is the diminished chord so
our<00:04:23.410> formula<00:04:23.590> for<00:04:23.979> the<00:04:24.010> diminished<00:04:24.460> chord<00:04:24.760> is

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
our formula for the diminished chord is

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.719 
our formula for the diminished chord is
we<00:04:25.630> take<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.870> major<00:04:26.440> court<00:04:26.979> or<00:04:27.250> wheat

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
we take the major court or wheat

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.159 
we take the major court or wheat
actually<00:04:28.090> we<00:04:28.150> could<00:04:28.210> take<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:28.539> minor<00:04:28.870> chord

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
actually we could take the minor chord

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.779 
actually we could take the minor chord
to<00:04:29.260> make<00:04:29.410> a<00:04:29.440> little<00:04:29.710> bit<00:04:29.800> simpler<00:04:30.100> we<00:04:30.550> take<00:04:30.760> the

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
to make a little bit simpler we take the

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.600 
to make a little bit simpler we take the
minor<00:04:31.150> chord<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:31.870> then<00:04:32.110> we<00:04:32.289> lower<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:33.340> top

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
minor chord and then we lower the top

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.390 
minor chord and then we lower the top
note<00:04:33.940> one<00:04:34.330> half<00:04:34.600> step<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:35.260> in<00:04:36.010> other<00:04:36.100> words<00:04:36.310> if

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
note one half step so in other words if
