jewelry<00:00:44.850> shop<00:00:44.970> models<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.540> here<00:00:45.810> is<00:00:45.960> compared

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
jewelry shop models so here is compared

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.430 
jewelry shop models so here is compared
directly<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> PlayStation<00:00:47.880> 3<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
directly to the PlayStation 3 so the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.500 
directly to the PlayStation 3 so the
drill<00:00:49.560> shop<00:00:49.740> for<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.400> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.730> probably<00:00:51.390> tell

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
drill shop for as you can probably tell

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.850 
drill shop for as you can probably tell
it's<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> little<00:00:52.020> bit<00:00:52.110> more<00:00:52.200> rounded<00:00:52.680> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
it's a little bit more rounded and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.950 
it's a little bit more rounded and
result<00:00:53.220> easier<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.730> more<00:00:54.360> comfortable<00:00:54.540> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
result easier to more comfortable to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.930 
result easier to more comfortable to
hold<00:00:55.400> elsewhere<00:00:56.400> it's<00:00:56.489> got<00:00:56.579> obviously<00:00:56.700> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
hold elsewhere it's got obviously a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.729 
hold elsewhere it's got obviously a
number<00:00:57.450> of<00:00:57.540> significant<00:00:58.200> other<00:00:58.320> differences

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
number of significant other differences

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.250 
number of significant other differences
so<00:00:58.950> here<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.310> a<00:00:59.340> touchpad<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.810> doesn't<00:01:00.989> play

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
so here is a touchpad this doesn't play

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.510 
so here is a touchpad this doesn't play
any<00:01:01.440> data<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.860> not<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.160> touchscreen

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
any data it's not like a touchscreen

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.880 
any data it's not like a touchscreen
also<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.360> it<00:01:03.450> like<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.630> laptops<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
also think of it like a laptops and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.560 
also think of it like a laptops and
touchpad<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.060> sort<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.300> thought<00:01:06.390> use

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
touchpad so you can sort of thought use

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.120 
touchpad so you can sort of thought use
it<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.750> navigate<00:01:07.080> menus<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.620> also<00:01:07.710> clicks

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
it to navigate menus and it also clicks

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.370 
it to navigate menus and it also clicks
in<00:01:08.540> elsewhere<00:01:09.540> there's<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> speaker<00:01:10.080> here<00:01:10.229> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
in elsewhere there's a speaker here that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.860 
in elsewhere there's a speaker here that
sort<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.590> emits<00:01:10.890> sound<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:12.240> analog<00:01:12.630> sticks

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
sort of emits sound the analog sticks

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.570 
sort of emits sound the analog sticks
and<00:01:13.020> I'll<00:01:13.110> concave<00:01:13.620> so<00:01:13.890> they<00:01:14.010> fit<00:01:14.190> easier<00:01:14.490> on

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and I'll concave so they fit easier on

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.649 
and I'll concave so they fit easier on
the<00:01:14.670> firm's<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.120> also<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.360> little<00:01:15.570> bit

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the firm's that are also a little bit

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.030 
the firm's that are also a little bit
more<00:01:15.780> tighter<00:01:16.050> so<00:01:16.409> they<00:01:16.530> feel<00:01:16.680> better<00:01:16.920> when

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
more tighter so they feel better when

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
more tighter so they feel better when
playing<00:01:17.220> games<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.299> start<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.600> select

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
sort of curb up the ps3 triggers were

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.420 
sort of curb up the ps3 triggers were
controversial<00:01:30.740> as<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.799> result<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.220> of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
controversial as a result of that of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.940 
controversial as a result of that of
them<00:01:32.610> curving<00:01:32.970> down<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:33.780> now<00:01:34.049> handle

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
them curving down so they now handle

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.230 
them curving down so they now handle
much<00:01:35.070> better<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.490> elsewhere<00:01:35.850> there<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
much better and elsewhere there is a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240 
much better and elsewhere there is a
light<00:01:36.900> sensor<00:01:37.170> bar<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.619> that's<00:01:37.890> what<00:01:37.979> change

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
light sensor bar here that's what change

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.469 
light sensor bar here that's what change
different<00:01:38.460> colours<00:01:38.790> think<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
different colours think of it like the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.030 
different colours think of it like the
PlayStation<00:01:39.930> Move<00:01:39.990> controller<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.890> will

PlayStation Move controller it will

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.530 
PlayStation Move controller it will
change<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.549> blue<00:01:41.760> and<00:01:42.030> red<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.210> green

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
change to like blue and red and green

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.899 
change to like blue and red and green
and<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.900> picked<00:01:43.080> up<00:01:43.290> by<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.860> body<00:01:44.430> PS

compared<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> launch<00:01:47.310> ps3<00:01:48.650> there<00:01:49.650> you<00:01:49.770> go

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
compared to the launch ps3 there you go

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.179 
compared to the launch ps3 there you go
as<00:01:50.580> you<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.820> see<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:52.140> launch<00:01:52.409> ps3<00:01:52.890> was<00:01:53.010> a<00:01:53.040> bit

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
as you can see the launch ps3 was a bit

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.149 
as you can see the launch ps3 was a bit
of<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> behemoth<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:55.080> you<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.860> see<00:01:56.010> how<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
of a behemoth and it you can see how the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.679 
of a behemoth and it you can see how the
ps4<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.760> sits<00:01:56.939> very<00:01:57.090> close<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.479> surface

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
ps4 just sits very close to the surface

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.289 
ps4 just sits very close to the surface
there<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.320> how<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.130> partly<00:01:59.790> almost<00:02:00.150> like

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
there and how it's partly almost like

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.480 
there and how it's partly almost like
half<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.840> height<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.650> ps3<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
half the height of the ps3 and if you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.999 
half the height of the ps3 and if you
put<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:03.330> top<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.630> each<00:02:03.659> other<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.650> actually<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
put on top of each other it's actually a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.550 
put on top of each other it's actually a
lot<00:02:05.310> wider<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:05.850> well<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.110> regard<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
lot wider as well so in that regard the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.309 
lot wider as well so in that regard the
ps4<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.129> quite<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> quite<00:02:09.420> remarkable<00:02:09.479> thing<00:02:10.109> as
