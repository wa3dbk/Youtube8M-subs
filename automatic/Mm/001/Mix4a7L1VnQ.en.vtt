know what project natal is let me tell
you<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> little<00:00:10.410> bit<00:00:10.530> how<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.099> works

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
you a little bit how it works

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.490 
you a little bit how it works
essentially<00:00:12.030> it's<00:00:12.120> an<00:00:12.210> add-on<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:12.719> xbox<00:00:13.019> 360

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
essentially it's an add-on for xbox 360

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.799 
essentially it's an add-on for xbox 360
that<00:00:13.679> uses<00:00:14.040> two<00:00:14.340> cameras<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.269> understand<00:00:15.690> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
that uses two cameras to understand the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.599 
that uses two cameras to understand the
information<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.500> front<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.859> basically<00:00:17.490> it

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
information in front of it basically it

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.220 
information in front of it basically it
takes<00:00:17.760> camera<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.359> camera<00:00:18.539> B<00:00:18.750> looks<00:00:19.050> at<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
takes camera and camera B looks at the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.019 
takes camera and camera B looks at the
same<00:00:19.439> points<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.920> part<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.460> using

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
same points in part of it and using

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.060 
same points in part of it and using
geometric<00:00:21.330> reading<00:00:22.109> figures<00:00:22.380> out<00:00:22.529> how<00:00:22.740> far

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
geometric reading figures out how far

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.099 
geometric reading figures out how far
away<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.730> point<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.240> now<00:00:24.570> using<00:00:24.779> def

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
away that point is now using def

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.050 
away that point is now using def
capabilities<00:00:25.800> they<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.099> basically<00:00:26.279> map<00:00:26.789> out

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
capabilities they can basically map out

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.120

the<00:00:27.300> entire<00:00:27.750> scene<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.500> front<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.920> for

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the entire scene in front of it for

the entire scene in front of it for
example<00:00:29.699> if<00:00:29.760> project<00:00:30.090> natal<00:00:30.359> was<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.660> front<00:00:30.869> of

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
example if project natal was in front of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.200 
example if project natal was in front of
me<00:00:31.019> right<00:00:31.050> now<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.590> would<00:00:31.740> see<00:00:32.070> me<00:00:32.399> being<00:00:32.910> about

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
me right now it would see me being about

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.000 
me right now it would see me being about
a<00:00:33.239> foot<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.780> front<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.230> wall<00:00:34.500> back<00:00:34.530> here
