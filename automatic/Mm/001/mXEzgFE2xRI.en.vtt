00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
you notice that the strings are pointing

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.010

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.250 
facilitate the slice step out step in in
slice<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:23.940> notice<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.420> try<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.780> stop<00:04:25.140> my

so<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.580> freeze<00:04:29.940> step<00:04:30.540> out<00:04:30.890> step<00:04:31.890> in<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:33.060> you<00:04:33.270> can

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
so I freeze step out step in and you can

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.200 
so I freeze step out step in and you can
even<00:04:33.570> go<00:04:33.780> for<00:04:34.080> placement<00:04:34.940> try<00:04:35.940> one

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
even go for placement try one

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.870 
even go for placement try one
cross-court<00:04:36.810> one<00:04:37.050> down<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.410> line<00:04:37.560> okay<00:04:38.370> so
