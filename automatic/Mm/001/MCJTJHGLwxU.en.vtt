00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.880
 hello everyone we rest so for a 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.560
 new video as I had said on the 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.939
 facebook page I will do a video on 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.710
 my mother brought me level 55 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.939
 even if beautiful what app has already done I 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.950
 think it's quite interesting to 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.000
 do two different ways 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.620
 I think it can help you finish 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.199
 also your level 55 eyelashes 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.269
 so here I am decided to do it I you 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.739
 invite to join the facebook page I 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.430
 will put the link in the description of 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.379
 the video and this video I invite you to 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.610
 join her because I see there I 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.650
 tell you in advance when I withdraw 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.330
 videos i can give you tips 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.129
 and advice and I respond to 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.350
 private messages if you ever have good 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.089
 a little advice neither head I 'll be there 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.460
 to help you for a roll in 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.799
 basic analyzes finally the name of your 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.659
 task force is your base in a 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.420
 private message and by the words of task 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.520
 force after the ad in the next 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.560
 basic analysis of ascq force ads 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.869
 here I am answering most of 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.150
 nose messages but a lot and I 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.939
 answer as soon as possible is promised 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.939
 so at 25.25 I showed you 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.500
 so that's the difficulty of those 7.2 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.130
 this map we'll say it's this mortar 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.980
 who is here if the dog with a cushioning 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.810
 level 1 10 thousand life of 150 damage 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.490
 per second 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.010
 so basically the oukases are affected 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.320
 press who are maybe one shot in one 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.520
 what's the matter, but I know that 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.030
 it's going a lot a lot did them well 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.070
 we have seven rows of two super 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.150
 mines and a half it's going to be very very 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.680
 dangerous that's why I used 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.720
 shootings like I do you 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.550
 showed just now we also have this 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.810
 mlg 9000 12000 health points these four 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.160
 rockets lances years left and I 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.780
 think I'm going to state the cellars not 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.479
 too much we'll see on the cost of 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.479
 the action on fire of the action during one 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.679
 has two rounds of snipers on the right 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.730
 I improvised a bit I'll tell you 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.060
 show the level of my troops and 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.020
 my syria art for you have all the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.530
 information whose big arm level 18 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.530
 zucca level 17 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.560
 I can also show you a clear rocket 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.340
 hold on May 6 of ikivo 17 electro good 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.340
 level 5 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.379
 smoke level 3 dam level 14 and 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.150
 level 19 shells 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.730
 so here I have this level 16 barge 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.189
 that's it and a barge level 10.6 to 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.719
 so here I am going to attack in brazÃ¹k at 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.720
 four barges of big arms four barges 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.980
 in any case and it's gone then I do not 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.269
 you do not hide that I have booster 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.220
 some troops it was for the 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.989
 doctor terror behind march 25 minutes 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.799
 so I have energy there as elsewhere more 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.549
 60 g health 3.44 and I have some guys 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.389
 troops 50 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.459
 so some to tell me that finally 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.079
 it's not it's not good advice if you 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.510
 move his troops and that I speak I 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.680
 could not do it 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.450
 in fact it's just I show you the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.829
 method I know that even without the damage 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.569
 troops I can arrive it's not a 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.129
 problem but in fact it's to be 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.629
 sure to lose the least troops 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.829
 possible because after this video 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.840
 does continue to attack I still 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.069
 need for maximum of my troops without 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.250
 end I will try in the lose the 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.079
 less possible that's it so it's 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.200
 left I look quickly makes the scope of 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.919
 mega mortar ok so what am I going 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:45.169
 to do is shootout in Angola 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:45.169
 and another in water and a lower 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.500
 I will lower the sound a little bit 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:04:01.220
 that's ok so I'm going to run all my 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:04.160
 troops and I'm not going and here we see that 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:14.060
 the mortar had as carried away 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:17.180
 this is the case the head I have a lot of 2 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.079
 or case he also helped me that I'm going 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.079
 to do is I'm going 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.540
 I 'm focused on it , it's okay 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.660
 to be complicated I lost a lot of 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.660
 holes 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:44.939
 if I arrived there was almost 

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:44.939
 troops certainly it's a miracle 

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:48.689
 I focus 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.550
 I like to focus my eyes I produced 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.550
 elsewhere well past 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.260
 there I will focus qg it's a little 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.260
 in fast mode 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.729
 I think I'll get there it's 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.190
 really really in pain and 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.650
 to say that the statuses are boosted 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.020
 so it's to tell you down that 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.820
 I should not have done it 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.919
 forced it into a passage and you 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.199
 can review the video I forced the 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.080
 zouk crossing ensures mines is 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.090
 also the mortar my beauty was at her 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.620
 scope so the case or less affected that 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.550
 made me feel bad 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:39.910
 I do not know how the hole I lost 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:43.360
 28 or 4 lost 18 big arm of lost he 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:50.290
 I do not have much left the 4 5 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:53.320
 6 7 8 9 zucca and big arms or there so much 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.210
 better anyway if I have ended up in 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.300
 the principle that's what I can you 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.370
 advise to do what I did 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.070
 not done so at first it was going well 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.310
 but rather after the two shots of 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.530
 dam use a shell on the mines 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.639
 on which or if I went 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.460
 do not know if you will understand but 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:15.010
 in fact it is to enlarge the breach in 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.580
 somehow since that's what got me 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.750
 endangered in some way the by 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.060
 against what I advise you to do 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.000
 what i did is taz the mortar 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.220
 and focus directly to go 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.370
 directly on the mortar before he 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.840
 no longer under the effect of taz lo 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.949
 so after I have you have spears 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.410
 rockets that's normal I have states too 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:41.320
 the same annoyance 9000 when I would not have 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.550
 due since they were still not 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.740
 bring me neither the guns that were 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.450
 around elsewhere so it's a little bit in 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.669
 the rush fortunately I 'm there 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:52.780
 arrived as you could see five 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:54.520
 gained victory points and a lot of 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:58.120
 I could do a lot of status thanks 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.770
 at his manna level 55 years ago is leaving 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.430

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.260

 Hi everybody
