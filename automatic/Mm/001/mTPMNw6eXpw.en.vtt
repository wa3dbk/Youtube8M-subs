00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:09.580 
today I'm gonna share a super esoteric
idea<00:00:06.950> with<00:00:07.220> you<00:00:07.459> and<00:00:07.730> I<00:00:08.600> was<00:00:09.080> talking<00:00:09.350> to<00:00:09.410> Kevin

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
idea with you and I was talking to Kevin

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.280 
idea with you and I was talking to Kevin
about<00:00:09.890> this<00:00:10.100> last<00:00:10.310> week<00:00:10.640> and<00:00:10.940> this<00:00:11.870> is<00:00:12.080> all

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
about this last week and this is all

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.710 
about this last week and this is all
about<00:00:13.720> vibrato<00:00:14.720> and<00:00:15.669> the<00:00:16.720> conventional

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
about vibrato and the conventional

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.560 
about vibrato and the conventional
vibrato<00:00:18.500> would<00:00:19.339> normally<00:00:19.759> be<00:00:20.449> you'd<00:00:21.410> be<00:00:22.570> using

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
vibrato would normally be you'd be using

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.970 
vibrato would normally be you'd be using
your<00:00:23.900> embouchure<00:00:24.550> to<00:00:25.550> to<00:00:26.539> create<00:00:26.990> that<00:00:27.409> effect

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
your embouchure to to create that effect

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.120 
your embouchure to to create that effect
but<00:00:28.730> today<00:00:29.119> I<00:00:29.150> have<00:00:29.539> this<00:00:29.839> interesting<00:00:30.739> idea

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
but today I have this interesting idea

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.190 
but today I have this interesting idea
and<00:00:31.220> what<00:00:31.519> we're<00:00:31.609> gonna<00:00:31.669> do<00:00:31.999> is<00:00:32.270> we're<00:00:33.140> gonna

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.550 
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:34.040> vibrato<00:00:34.490> by<00:00:35.450> actually<00:00:36.230> moving

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
create the vibrato by actually moving

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.980 
create the vibrato by actually moving
the<00:00:37.600> keys<00:00:38.600> down<00:00:39.730> just<00:00:40.730> slightly<00:00:41.120> but<00:00:41.780> not

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:41.990 
the keys down just slightly but not

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.260 
the keys down just slightly but not
closing<00:00:42.500> them<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.100> creating<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.790> vibrato

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
closing them and creating the vibrato

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.350 
closing them and creating the vibrato
like<00:00:44.750> that<00:00:45.140> if<00:00:45.980> you<00:00:46.250> can<00:00:46.430> see<00:00:46.670> that<00:00:46.910> in<00:00:47.120> the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
like that if you can see that in the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.960 
like that if you can see that in the
camera<00:00:48.130> so<00:00:49.130> I'll<00:00:49.220> go<00:00:49.430> ahead<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:49.760> demonstrate

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
camera so I'll go ahead and demonstrate

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.530 
camera so I'll go ahead and demonstrate
it<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:50.570> see<00:00:50.720> if<00:00:50.840> I<00:00:50.960> can<00:00:51.940> see<00:00:52.940> if<00:00:53.030> I<00:00:53.090> can<00:00:53.270> show

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
it and see if I can see if I can show

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.990 
it and see if I can see if I can show
you<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:54.170> it<00:00:54.350> creates<00:00:54.770> a<00:00:54.920> different<00:00:55.520> kind<00:00:55.790> of

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
you and it creates a different kind of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.250 
you and it creates a different kind of
tonal<00:00:56.720> quality<00:00:57.520> than<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.670> normal<00:00:59.000> vibrato<00:00:59.420> so

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
tonal quality than the normal vibrato so

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:13.540 
tonal quality than the normal vibrato so
we'll<00:01:00.350> just<00:01:00.500> try<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:00.770> here

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:24.230 

as<00:01:14.420> opposed<00:01:14.900> to

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
you'll have to forgive me I'm played in

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.539 
you'll have to forgive me I'm played in
a<00:01:26.920> few<00:01:27.159> days<00:01:27.399> I<00:01:27.429> had<00:01:27.939> oral<00:01:28.270> surgery<00:01:29.399> it's<00:01:30.399> the

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
a few days I had oral surgery it's the

a few days I had oral surgery it's the
first<00:01:30.759> time<00:01:30.909> I<00:01:30.969> played<00:01:31.270> saxophone<00:01:31.659> in<00:01:32.020> about

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
first time I played saxophone in about

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.279 
first time I played saxophone in about
five<00:01:33.039> days<00:01:33.310> anyway<00:01:34.179> that's<00:01:34.450> kind<00:01:34.539> of<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.869> idea

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
five days anyway that's kind of the idea

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.440 
five days anyway that's kind of the idea
and<00:01:35.500> see<00:01:35.740> if<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.920> can<00:01:36.130> see<00:01:36.819> if<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:36.969> can<00:01:37.149> try<00:01:37.390> it

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
and see if you can see if you can try it

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.440 
and see if you can see if you can try it
and<00:01:37.719> get<00:01:38.049> like<00:01:39.030> try<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.060> get<00:01:40.329> an<00:01:40.509> even<00:01:41.159> tone<00:01:42.450> by

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
and get like try to get an even tone by

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.699 
and get like try to get an even tone by
just<00:01:44.259> pushing<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.920> keys<00:01:45.189> down<00:01:45.899> halfway<00:01:46.899> and

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
just pushing the keys down halfway and

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.550 
just pushing the keys down halfway and
have<00:01:48.670> some<00:01:48.880> fun<00:01:49.030> with<00:01:49.209> it<00:01:49.350> there's<00:01:50.350> always

have some fun with it there's always
something<00:01:51.459> new<00:01:51.819> to<00:01:52.479> try<00:01:52.929> and<00:01:54.719> you<00:01:55.719> know<00:01:55.780> for

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
something new to try and you know for

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.139 
something new to try and you know for
different<00:01:56.530> tonal<00:01:56.920> qualities<00:01:57.520> on<00:01:57.700> saxophone

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
different tonal qualities on saxophone

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.330 
different tonal qualities on saxophone
thanks<00:01:58.630> so<00:01:58.780> much<00:01:58.840> for<00:01:59.079> watching<00:01:59.200> folks<00:01:59.619> next
