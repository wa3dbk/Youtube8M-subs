00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
that popped into my mind so I'm sure you

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.130 
that popped into my mind so I'm sure you
guys<00:00:48.500> have<00:00:48.559> seen<00:00:48.890> this<00:00:49.070> if<00:00:49.699> not<00:00:50.089> let's<00:00:50.839> just

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
guys have seen this if not let's just

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.299 
guys have seen this if not let's just
dive<00:00:51.620> in<00:00:51.890> have<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.749> deeper<00:00:53.749> discussion<00:00:54.309> about

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
dive in have a deeper discussion about

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.259 
dive in have a deeper discussion about
stem<00:00:55.879> bionics<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.109> what<00:00:58.039> the<00:00:58.249> hell<00:00:58.550> they<00:00:59.239> are

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
stem bionics and what the hell they are

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.509 
stem bionics and what the hell they are
doing<00:00:59.629> with<00:01:00.140> these<00:01:00.679> they're<00:01:01.159> their

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
doing with these they're their

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:02.979 
doing with these they're their
experiments<00:01:02.120> let's<00:01:02.359> just<00:01:02.539> put<00:01:02.719> it<00:01:02.749> like<00:01:02.960> that

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
experiments let's just put it like that

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.860 
experiments let's just put it like that
so<00:01:03.890> basically<00:01:04.190> stem<00:01:05.000> bionics<00:01:05.449> they're<00:01:05.659> the

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
so basically stem bionics they're the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.530 
so basically stem bionics they're the
company<00:01:06.470> you<00:01:06.650> can<00:01:06.860> see<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.280> logo<00:01:07.550> throughout

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
company you can see the logo throughout

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.120 
company you can see the logo throughout
the<00:01:08.780> map<00:01:08.960> on<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.290> different<00:01:09.650> walls<00:01:09.860> and

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
the map on the different walls and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.580 
the map on the different walls and
whatnot<00:01:10.520> you<00:01:10.760> can<00:01:10.909> see<00:01:11.150> their<00:01:11.300> name<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.840> so

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
whatnot you can see their name and so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.469 
whatnot you can see their name and so
clearly<00:01:12.890> this<00:01:13.100> is<00:01:13.280> our<00:01:13.460> facility<00:01:14.090> we<00:01:14.329> don't

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
clearly this is our facility we don't

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.630 
clearly this is our facility we don't
know<00:01:14.689> what<00:01:15.320> significance<00:01:15.590> they<00:01:16.100> have<00:01:16.280> yet

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
know what significance they have yet

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.370 
know what significance they have yet
whether<00:01:16.939> they're<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.570> campaign<00:01:17.990> or<00:01:18.200> not

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
whether they're in the campaign or not

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.920 
whether they're in the campaign or not
could<00:01:19.100> be<00:01:19.310> could<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:19.909> just<00:01:20.119> be<00:01:20.570> for<00:01:20.840> the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
could be could it just be for the

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.560 
could be could it just be for the
multiplayer<00:01:21.649> map<00:01:21.920> but<00:01:22.130> I<00:01:22.189> think<00:01:22.430> not<00:01:22.790> now

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
multiplayer map but I think not now

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.050 
multiplayer map but I think not now
what's<00:01:24.170> interesting<00:01:24.320> about<00:01:24.920> stem<00:01:25.369> bionics

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
what's interesting about stem bionics

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.490 
what's interesting about stem bionics
there's<00:01:26.329> two<00:01:26.540> different<00:01:26.750> words<00:01:27.079> in<00:01:27.320> their

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
there's two different words in their

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.249 
there's two different words in their
first<00:01:27.829> stem<00:01:28.490> first<00:01:29.180> thing<00:01:29.390> about<00:01:29.479> stems<00:01:29.990> are

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
first stem first thing about stems are

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.830 
first stem first thing about stems are
stem<00:01:30.590> cells<00:01:31.040> stem<00:01:31.969> cells<00:01:32.270> I'm<00:01:32.390> sure<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.750> guys

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
stem cells stem cells I'm sure you guys

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.749 
stem cells stem cells I'm sure you guys
have<00:01:32.899> heard<00:01:33.079> of<00:01:33.229> them<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.649> have<00:01:33.770> not<00:01:33.920> suggest

more details my further you got more
details<00:01:38.810> about<00:01:38.899> stem<00:01:39.320> cells<00:01:39.530> but<00:01:39.649> basically

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
details about stem cells but basically

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.190 
details about stem cells but basically
what<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.610> there's<00:01:41.149> multiple<00:01:41.450> types<00:01:41.899> of<00:01:42.049> stem

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
what that there's multiple types of stem

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.170 
what that there's multiple types of stem
cells<00:01:42.530> how<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:42.920> can<00:01:43.159> create<00:01:43.310> them<00:01:43.670> but

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
cells how you can create them but

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.580 
cells how you can create them but
basically<00:01:44.420> they're<00:01:44.810> used<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.079> repairing

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
basically they're used to repairing

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.010 
basically they're used to repairing
tissue<00:01:45.920> heart<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.700> they're<00:01:47.210> used<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.630> like<00:01:47.810> I

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
tissue heart and they're used to like I

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.660 
tissue heart and they're used to like I
think<00:01:48.649> they're<00:01:48.770> trying<00:01:48.979> to<00:01:49.130> cure<00:01:49.399> diabetes

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
think they're trying to cure diabetes

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.599 
think they're trying to cure diabetes
and<00:01:50.539> heart<00:01:50.840> disease<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.560> its<00:01:52.280> really

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
and heart disease and its really

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
could be used to feel something or maybe

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.230 
could be used to feel something or maybe
create<00:02:04.189> something<00:02:04.520> new

just<00:02:06.240> keep<00:02:06.420> those<00:02:06.600> two<00:02:06.840> thoughts<00:02:07.080> in<00:02:07.320> mind

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760

they're<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.860> robots<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.150> exoskeleton

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
they're like robots that the exoskeleton

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
bionics combine them together and you

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.600 
bionics combine them together and you

that last picture in this picture you
see<00:02:26.280> human<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.600> guess<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.290> call<00:02:28.410> him

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680

kind<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.090> creepy<00:02:42.270> that's<00:02:42.570> kind<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:42.960> weird<00:02:43.320> and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
kind of creepy that's kind of weird and

kind of creepy that's kind of weird and
being<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.090> stem<00:02:45.450> biotics<00:02:45.930> thing<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.290> think<00:02:46.500> that

being in stem biotics thing I think that

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.320 
being in stem biotics thing I think that
has<00:02:46.830> maybe<00:02:47.220> something<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.820> do<00:02:47.940> with<00:02:48.090> stem

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
has maybe something to do with stem

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.120 
has maybe something to do with stem

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
cells may be there they're either a

trying to heal the trying to heal these
humans<00:02:53.820> from<00:02:53.940> something<00:02:54.450> or<00:02:54.630> trying<00:02:55.260> to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
humans from something or trying to

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
create humans into something else that

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.440 
create humans into something else that
is<00:02:58.440> where<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.710> think<00:02:58.920> we<00:02:59.190> get<00:02:59.460> our<00:02:59.670> first<00:02:59.700> little

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
is where I think we get our first little

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.450 
is where I think we get our first little
glimpse<00:03:00.960> we<00:03:01.170> don't<00:03:01.350> know<00:03:01.500> what<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.740> is<00:03:01.770> we

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
glimpse we don't know what it is we

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.650 
glimpse we don't know what it is we
don't<00:03:02.580> know<00:03:02.670> what<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.880> glimpses<00:03:03.210> it's<00:03:03.420> just

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
don't know what the glimpses it's just

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.960 
don't know what the glimpses it's just
there<00:03:04.080> because<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:04.860> we<00:03:05.220> don't<00:03:05.340> have<00:03:05.520> other

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
there because we we don't have other

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.180 
there because we we don't have other
information<00:03:06.300> that<00:03:06.720> would<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.560> know<00:03:07.710> sort<00:03:08.040> of

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
information that would you know sort of

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.490 
information that would you know sort of
emphasize<00:03:08.490> what<00:03:09.450> we<00:03:09.600> should<00:03:09.780> be<00:03:09.900> looking<00:03:09.930> for

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
emphasize what we should be looking for

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.710 
emphasize what we should be looking for
but<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.430> think<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:11.910> our<00:03:12.090> first<00:03:12.360> sort<00:03:12.630> of

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
but I think this is our first sort of

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.460 
but I think this is our first sort of
glimpse<00:03:13.110> at<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> night<00:03:13.470> co-op<00:03:14.420> mode<00:03:15.420> idea<00:03:16.140> of

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
glimpse at a night co-op mode idea of

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.050 
glimpse at a night co-op mode idea of
what<00:03:16.739> they're<00:03:16.860> doing<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.730> know<00:03:17.850> it's

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
what they're doing you know it's

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.390 
what they're doing you know it's
probably<00:03:18.390> i'm<00:03:18.930> either<00:03:19.320> i'm<00:03:19.620> hyped<00:03:19.950> about<00:03:20.130> this

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
probably i'm either i'm hyped about this

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.060 
probably i'm either i'm hyped about this
call<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.760> think<00:03:21.180> it's<00:03:21.330> gonna<00:03:21.510> be<00:03:21.690> epic<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.500> think

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
call I think it's gonna be epic I think

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.380 
call I think it's gonna be epic I think
this<00:03:23.220> could<00:03:23.400> be<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.610> know<00:03:23.700> something<00:03:24.150> like<00:03:24.300> I

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
this could be you know something like I

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.000 
this could be you know something like I
talked<00:03:24.630> about<00:03:24.840> earlier<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.620> didn't<00:03:25.950> say

talked about earlier you didn't say

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.310

something<00:03:26.940> along<00:03:27.090> those<00:03:27.510> lines<00:03:27.750> either

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
something along those lines either

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.900 
something along those lines either
they're<00:03:28.650> trying<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.130> heal<00:03:29.370> them<00:03:29.580> here<00:03:29.880> or

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
there creating them here in stem bionics

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.460 
there creating them here in stem bionics
something<00:03:33.480> like<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.900> because<00:03:34.019> clearly

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
something like that because clearly

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.610 
something like that because clearly
something<00:03:35.070> is<00:03:35.190> going<00:03:35.459> down<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:36.239> stem<00:03:36.600> bionics

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
something is going down in stem bionics

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.070 
something is going down in stem bionics
that<00:03:37.920> maybe<00:03:38.730> they<00:03:39.000> don't<00:03:39.150> want<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.599> be<00:03:39.720> public

that maybe they don't want to be public
I<00:03:40.290> don't<00:03:40.860> know<00:03:41.099> but<00:03:41.519> clearly<00:03:41.819> something's

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
I don't know but clearly something's

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.089 
I don't know but clearly something's
going<00:03:42.659> on<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.260> not<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.560> first<00:03:43.590> time

not<00:03:47.099> saying<00:03:47.489> they're<00:03:47.640> zombies<00:03:47.849> in<00:03:48.239> here<00:03:48.390> I'm

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
not saying they're zombies in here I'm

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.199 
not saying they're zombies in here I'm
saying<00:03:48.720> zombies<00:03:49.170> as<00:03:49.319> a<00:03:49.349> co-op<00:03:49.830> mode<00:03:50.129> so<00:03:50.940> this

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
saying zombies as a co-op mode so this

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.970 
saying zombies as a co-op mode so this
is<00:03:51.239> not<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.599> first<00:03:51.629> time<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.110> multiplayer

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
is not the first time that multiplayer

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.229 
is not the first time that multiplayer
maps<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.459> campaign<00:03:53.970> maps<00:03:54.239> have<00:03:54.720> held<00:03:55.200> secrets

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
maps and campaign maps have held secrets

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.720 
maps and campaign maps have held secrets
and<00:03:57.239> you<00:03:57.360> look<00:03:57.540> back<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.260> black<00:03:58.500> ops<00:03:58.769> 1<00:03:58.890> got

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
and you look back the black ops 1 got

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.869 
and you look back the black ops 1 got
the<00:03:59.909> whole<00:04:00.120> Nova<00:04:00.629> 6<00:04:00.989> gas<00:04:01.349> that<00:04:02.190> whole<00:04:02.519> thing

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
the whole Nova 6 gas that whole thing

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.509 
the whole Nova 6 gas that whole thing
Nova<00:04:03.810> 6<00:04:04.049> crawlers<00:04:04.560> Nova<00:04:04.860> six<00:04:05.069> gas<00:04:05.280> in<00:04:05.430> the

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
Nova 6 crawlers Nova six gas in the

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.670 
Nova 6 crawlers Nova six gas in the
campaign<00:04:05.849> a<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.540> then<00:04:07.110> there's<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.349> bunch<00:04:07.590> of

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
campaign a and then there's a bunch of

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.559 
campaign a and then there's a bunch of
black<00:04:07.890> ops<00:04:08.129> 2<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.310> think<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:09.120> only<00:04:09.239> one<00:04:09.420> that

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
black ops 2 I think the only one that

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.000 
black ops 2 I think the only one that
comes<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.900> my<00:04:09.989> head<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.200> now<00:04:10.440> is<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:10.920> you

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
comes to my head and now is that you

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.890 
comes to my head and now is that you
know<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.280> whole<00:04:11.430> thrusted<00:04:12.000> I'm<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.269> transit

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
know the whole thrusted I'm the transit

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.380 
know the whole thrusted I'm the transit
Wonder<00:04:13.590> weapon<00:04:13.739> buildable<00:04:14.400> thing<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:15.209> could

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
Wonder weapon buildable thing you could

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.830 
Wonder weapon buildable thing you could
find<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.889> somewhere<00:04:16.889> i<00:04:16.949> think<00:04:17.400> i<00:04:17.780> think<00:04:18.780> it

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
find that somewhere i think i think it

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.420 
find that somewhere i think i think it
was<00:04:18.930> on<00:04:19.079> like<00:04:19.289> a<00:04:19.320> pedestal<00:04:19.709> somewhere<00:04:20.190> I<00:04:20.220> don't

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
was on like a pedestal somewhere I don't

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.650 
was on like a pedestal somewhere I don't
know<00:04:20.609> but<00:04:21.120> like<00:04:21.389> there<00:04:21.900> are<00:04:22.079> these<00:04:22.260> secrets<00:04:22.770> in

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
know but like there are these secrets in

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.060 
know but like there are these secrets in
campaign<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:24.900> in<00:04:24.990> other<00:04:25.169> multiplayer<00:04:25.650> maps

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
campaign and in other multiplayer maps

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.350 
campaign and in other multiplayer maps
in<00:04:26.220> previous<00:04:26.550> Call<00:04:26.699> of<00:04:26.729> Duty's<00:04:26.970> that<00:04:27.120> relate

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
in previous Call of Duty's that relate

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.540 
in previous Call of Duty's that relate
to<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:27.570> co-op<00:04:27.750> mode<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.289> think<00:04:29.039> this<00:04:29.190> could<00:04:29.430> be

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
to the co-op mode I think this could be

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.600 
to the co-op mode I think this could be
our<00:04:29.580> first<00:04:29.940> glimpse<00:04:30.240> sort<00:04:30.930> of<00:04:31.110> sort<00:04:31.320> of<00:04:31.410> sort

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
our first glimpse sort of sort of sort

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.890 
our first glimpse sort of sort of sort
of<00:04:32.610> something<00:04:32.880> just<00:04:32.910> interesting<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.870> think

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
of something just interesting to think

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.439 
of something just interesting to think
about<00:04:34.169> you<00:04:34.650> know<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.850> I<00:04:35.970> just<00:04:36.120> want<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.360> know
