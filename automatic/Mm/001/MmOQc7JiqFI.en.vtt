for the layup I thought it was a dunk I

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.440 
for the layup I thought it was a dunk I
thought<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.159> might<00:01:14.280> dunk<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.299> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
thought I might dunk there but it was a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.300 
thought I might dunk there but it was a
layup<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.350> been<00:01:16.470> increasing<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:17.009> lot<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.220> my

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
layup I have been increasing a lot of my

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
layup I have been increasing a lot of my
attributes<00:01:17.460> specifically<00:01:18.330> my<00:01:18.509> three-point

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
attributes specifically my three-point

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.270 
attributes specifically my three-point
shooting<00:01:19.439> my<00:01:20.070> mid-range<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:21.500> also<00:01:22.500> my<00:01:22.890> speed

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
shooting my mid-range and also my speed

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.520 
shooting my mid-range and also my speed
I<00:01:23.610> think<00:01:24.600> those<00:01:24.750> are<00:01:24.780> most<00:01:25.049> important<00:01:25.500> for

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.440 
I think those are most important for
someone<00:01:25.890> who's<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> score<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:27.330> know

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and have an offensive game so I might

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.370 
and have an offensive game so I might
shoot<00:01:29.159> fade<00:01:29.460> away<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:29.939> oh<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.750> drop<00:01:31.170> step

eventually<00:02:50.459> when<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.260> improve<00:02:52.260> my<00:02:52.290> player<00:02:52.620> a

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
eventually when I improve my player a

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.290 
eventually when I improve my player a
little<00:02:52.920> more<00:02:53.040> that's<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.370> good<00:02:53.550> backdoor<00:02:54.030> cut

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
little more that's a good backdoor cut

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.420 
little more that's a good backdoor cut
that's<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.690> good<00:02:54.930> pass<00:02:55.590> by<00:02:55.620> DeMarcus<00:02:56.340> Cousins

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
that's a good pass by DeMarcus Cousins

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.390 
that's a good pass by DeMarcus Cousins
and<00:02:57.000> that's<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.450> great<00:02:57.780> finish<00:02:58.440> since<00:02:59.220> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
and that's a great finish since the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.090 
and that's a great finish since the
start<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.850> second<00:03:00.540> half<00:03:00.569> here<00:03:00.959> we<00:03:01.680> have

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
start of the second half here we have

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.160 
start of the second half here we have
actually<00:03:02.489> been<00:03:02.580> dominating<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.510> weed<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:03.989> far

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
actually been dominating the weed so far

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.949 
actually been dominating the weed so far
I<00:03:04.200> think<00:03:04.650> at<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.950> current<00:03:05.250> point<00:03:05.519> uh<00:03:05.930> well<00:03:06.930> I

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
I think at the current point uh well I

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.870 
I think at the current point uh well I
forgot<00:03:07.260> what<00:03:07.560> our<00:03:07.650> record<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.069> but<00:03:08.340> we<00:03:08.519> don't

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
forgot what our record is but we don't

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.520 
forgot what our record is but we don't
have<00:03:08.970> many<00:03:09.330> losses<00:03:09.569> and<00:03:09.870> we<00:03:10.019> have<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.140> lot<00:03:10.500> of

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
have many losses and we have a lot of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.640 
have many losses and we have a lot of
wins<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:12.000> 61<00:03:12.360> 78<00:03:12.900> I'm<00:03:13.110> still<00:03:13.380> looking<00:03:13.590> to

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
wins so it's 61 78 I'm still looking to

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.289
