 Seeing the world again and why 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.800
 I would wish that the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.090
 Tasmanian tiger is revived 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.189
 maybe she will even succeed 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.289
 that through some kind of counter project 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.210
 or what the alternative quite like to see 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.000

 I want to grab the terex and get up 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.350

 I will be really boxer with her ex 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.370
 judge across the country or strip 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.090
 pikachu two next question from my life 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.640
 ley lee 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.190
 she always asks me how interested 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.820
 Actually feels like so many 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.780
 people always be addressed 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.460
 but I just got a lot more 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.119
 how interested is it to an event? 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.470
 being one of the main characters you 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.330
 may answer 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.400
 ok so at the beginning as one you 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.830
 first people had have raised the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.240
 still pretty unfamiliar though 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.770
 meanwhile as well should not 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.619
 imaginary or something like that sounds 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.640
 I get used to it slowly 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.020
 am always writes you already 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.250
 a video made even though I did 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.479
 I did not feel like it 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.100
 and if you have the video 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.500
 note that only pretended 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.930
 Nothing 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.189
 good question because I believe many pose 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.840
 it also has the question if you as 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.420
 youtube really getting bock to as 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.250
 week after week to shoot videos and it 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.619
 is actually days on which you do not 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.990
 Bock has at least that's the case with everyone 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.310
 I think so but we do 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.990
 Just like that, we move it up 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.520
 the next day and hope that you then 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.460
 again have the word question 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.770
 comes from builds ran and she asks what 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.790
 Inspire youtube for youtube 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.200
 the next went out 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.120
 youtube is just for me 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.790
 possibility of living out and creative 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.500
 to be as I would like and 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.660
 i can help my helper a bit 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.070
 give in to syndrome and maybe with the 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.270
 one or the other video people like that 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.180
 help a little bit 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.530
 The cross is a suitcase sign asking 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.360
 when I first myself if I am 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.190
 too thick or I disappear 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.770
 complete question mark 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.400
 the answer is clear it does not come out 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.970
 times of the father's logic you have one 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.940
 piece of cake 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.680
 you have to cut it in half, even if you 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.150
 Now a piece of which is a half 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.580
 piece of it is you can double me 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.560
 eat as much as half or is 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.060
 In the end it can eat more for the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.830
 half in the end but for more 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.770
 and that's exactly how it is with the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.200
 to eat oneself when I understood 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.040
 was not countered 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.870
 otherwise, comes appreciates the fact 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.060
 which part you start with 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.790
 you probably will not be much lower 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.310
 much thicker because half disappears 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.590
 yes, and then in your stomach and then 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.209
 will you stay my god then stay 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.950
 easy for always there is that the 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.630
 is the medium to become immortal 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.890
 simple sam asks the accepted 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.690
 science would have one today 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.000
 Possibility found with the help of one 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.769
 Time machine either forward or 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.420
 to travel backwards through time 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.700
 you would get the offer one 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.739
 to make a pure time travel 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.360
 would you accept the offer or 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.400
 would you reject and prefer in the 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.560
 stay there so I would 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.209
 Of course in any case immediately 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.890
 accept offer that would be easy times 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.370
 the hottest ever in time too 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.870
 to travel 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.549
 I think I will be in the future 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.650
 traveling because I'm interested in that 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.470
 just full how everything develops 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.269
 I think 100 years ago there were 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.730
 not even watching TV and now 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.130
 There is internet and everything is possible 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.230
 the madness and yes I am on everyone 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.239
 curious how the progress is like that 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.850
 in 1000 years the most back to the 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.410
 world looks like a total of what 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.250
 Are you looking forward to seeing her this summer ? 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.959
 most 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.050
 Eat on ice I love as me 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.959
 love tennis and i prefer to watch 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.849
 eat on my vacation travel equal 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.840
 namely to Crete and I am glad 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.819
 that's enough 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.720
 would have wanted to do for quite a long time 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:14.400
 Vanilla with a slightly too soon departure 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.950
 and funny note exactly the trend 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.690
 But perhaps sounds good will 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.880
 me as a human or something in my life 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.090
 next life 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.680
 janina latin has asked you one 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.110
 if you have a role model you have a role model 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.380
 which is my role model so me 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.180
 I think I have a lot of role models 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.070
 i must say i admire very steve 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.040
 jobs because he has a life attitude 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.290
 as I have the day and use 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.320
 makes every day and think every day 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.970
 of death and I do that and that is 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.470
 my very good adviser of the dead me 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.320
 which is very positive, he advises 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.590
 just always to do what you do 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.910
 have fun you have what is productive 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.389
 with which you may also enter the world 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.889
 can change a little and he says 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.930
 you that you do it as well as possible 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.100
 shall the death be so 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.479
 actually the positive is ours 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.070
 always remembered how short life is 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.820
 is and should use the knowledge and 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.970
 that's why steve jobs asked my hey 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.440
 what's up is what a cup looks like 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.419
 from the inside out christ- how does that look 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.010
 humpback whale from the notes so I have 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.990
 always presented that so really 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.160
 in that metal I really am and that 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.570
 pokÃ©mon then he shrinks in there 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.729
 practically that just like that but metal 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.620
 world just has round and then hopes 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:32.220
 even minimal in there so no big ones 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:35.099
 thing now said why men than 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.210
 the first case which is hardly possibility 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.729
 yes, I do not think so 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.229
 traveling as well as you or more 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.090
 really metal and that's it 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.200
