 which experts advise to treat

 Particularly serious glued timber or devoid 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.930
 all although classes that have 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.750
 standard wooden house 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.270
 we get a wooden house ta ta ta 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.620
 same to logic but we get 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.720
 very fast construction time in 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.580
 principle under construction can be 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.470
 there two or three months came to connect 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.110
 walls in the house of glued timber has 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.060
 perfectly flat and smooth surface 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.790
 they do not warp over time 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.340
 crack and do not lose the attractive 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.370
 Appearance flame resistant glued 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.130
 timber is 45 times higher compared to 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.110
 steel structures also walls from 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.110
 such timber provide high 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.940
 insulation means that the cost of 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.640
 home heating will be significantly less 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.830
 and this is only part of the benefits because 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.770
 building material in the company bring 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.220
 to perfection we get roundwood 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.650
 ruble with 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.840
 sawn into lumber and he was losing 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.070
 crawled into the drying chamber where for 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.150
 there 10 and 12 days is brought to 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.850
 switching humidity ie 80 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.740
 percent in this in this case we 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.800
 removed from the wood in iyske all the moisture and 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.429
 Remove any resin that who wants 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.220
 through the ends 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.260
 next board long board arrives 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.410
 optimization where defects are removed from it 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.940
 this dead bitches are removed from it 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.050
 accused of removing wormholes from it 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.850
 and 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.130
 and thus reverse converts 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.460
 back to the board and then glue 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.490
 back to another home advantage of 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.700
 glued timber construction period to 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.450
 example 120 150 square meters of residential 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.040
 the premises are being built in just three months

 construction can be carried out at any time 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.110
 of the year 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.510
 even in winter the most advantages are that cant 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.950
 dry it is stable accordingly it is already 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.260
