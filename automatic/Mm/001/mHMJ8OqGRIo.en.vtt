00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.710 
also have smooth titles on this and i
recommend<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.619> v-cube<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.550> they<00:02:09.179> are<00:02:09.330> more

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
recommend a v-cube but they are more

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.660 
recommend a v-cube but they are more
expensive<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.739> if<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.129> don't<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.430> as<00:02:11.520> much

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
expensive so if you don't have as much

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.010 
expensive so if you don't have as much
more

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
more

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.470 
more
getting<00:02:12.470> each<00:02:12.680> do<00:02:13.490> not<00:02:13.670> get<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> Rubik's

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
getting each do not get a Rubik's

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.810 
getting each do not get a Rubik's
because<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.900> have<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.170> mix<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.710> it<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.070> slow<00:02:16.580> and

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
because I have a mix and it is slow and

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.850 
because I have a mix and it is slow and
it<00:02:17.000> pops<00:02:17.210> all<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.990> time<00:02:18.200> maybe<00:02:18.530> it's<00:02:18.770> just

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
it pops all the time maybe it's just

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:28.750 
it pops all the time maybe it's just
