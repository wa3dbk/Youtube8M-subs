if I can go out and show the kind of

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.240 
if I can go out and show the kind of
trees<00:00:54.379> that<00:00:54.410> those<00:00:54.800> grow<00:00:55.130> on<00:00:55.340> in<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.820> places

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
trees that those grow on in the places

to<00:00:58.250> find<00:00:58.490> those<00:00:58.760> trees<00:00:59.120> I<00:00:59.360> guess<00:00:59.600> what<00:01:00.050> he

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
to find those trees I guess what he

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.140 
to find those trees I guess what he
wanted<00:01:00.560> so<00:01:01.310> that's<00:01:01.550> what<00:01:01.700> I'm<00:01:01.790> going<00:01:01.880> to<00:01:01.970> do

I'm<00:01:02.329> going<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.540> head<00:01:02.660> out<00:01:02.690> in<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.020> woods<00:01:03.230> today

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
I'm going to head out in the woods today

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
I'm going to head out in the woods today
I'm<00:01:04.400> going<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.790> try<00:01:05.239> to<00:01:05.300> identify<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:06.050> trees

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
I'm going to try to identify the trees

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.920 
I'm going to try to identify the trees
that<00:01:07.550> grow<00:01:07.820> those<00:01:08.090> different<00:01:08.540> types<00:01:08.750> of

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
that grow those different types of

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.190 
that grow those different types of
fungus<00:01:09.440> that<00:01:09.619> can<00:01:09.770> be<00:01:09.920> used<00:01:10.100> as<00:01:10.280> tendered<00:01:10.759> and

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
fungus that can be used as tendered and

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.960 
fungus that can be used as tendered and
also<00:01:12.200> i'll<00:01:12.530> try<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:13.250> give<00:01:13.369> you<00:01:13.399> a<00:01:13.490> brief<00:01:13.790> idea

also i'll try and give you a brief idea

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.620 
also i'll try and give you a brief idea
of<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:15.020> overall<00:01:15.979> habitat<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:17.240> overall

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
of the overall habitat the overall

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.540 
of the overall habitat the overall
forest<00:01:18.110> type<00:01:18.410> that<00:01:18.680> these<00:01:18.920> different<00:01:19.340> trees

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
forest type that these different trees

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
forest type that these different trees
growing<00:01:21.430> just<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:22.550> you<00:01:22.610> know<00:01:22.850> this<00:01:23.180> video

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
growing just so you know this video

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.930 
growing just so you know this video
might<00:01:23.840> be<00:01:23.869> pieced<00:01:24.290> together<00:01:24.640> because<00:01:25.640> i<00:01:25.670> have

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
might be pieced together because i have

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.930 
might be pieced together because i have
some<00:01:26.180> other<00:01:26.360> videos<00:01:26.740> on<00:01:27.740> my<00:01:28.430> channel<00:01:28.460> already

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
some other videos on my channel already

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.930 
some other videos on my channel already
that<00:01:29.630> somewhat<00:01:30.080> explain<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.610> i<00:01:31.640> may<00:01:31.909> just

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
that somewhat explain that so i may just

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.240 
that somewhat explain that so i may just
take<00:01:32.390> pieces<00:01:32.780> out<00:01:33.110> of<00:01:33.170> those<00:01:33.409> to<00:01:33.799> fill<00:01:34.010> in<00:01:34.159> the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
take pieces out of those to fill in the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.250 
take pieces out of those to fill in the
blanks<00:01:34.729> but<00:01:35.479> we're<00:01:35.600> going<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.750> go<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.110> head

a<00:02:53.769> lot<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.040> dead<00:02:54.370> Elms<00:02:54.880> around<00:02:55.180> here<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:55.780> they

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
a lot of dead Elms around here and they

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.180 
a lot of dead Elms around here and they
cut<00:02:56.230> them<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:57.489> they<00:02:57.640> don't<00:02:57.760> fall<00:02:58.090> on<00:02:59.190> people's

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
cut them so they don't fall on people's

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.860 
cut them so they don't fall on people's

houses and such or in the road and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.310 
houses and such or in the road and
you'll<00:03:04.870> find<00:03:05.200> ganoderma<00:03:06.190> lucidum<00:03:07.200> growing<00:03:08.200> on

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
you'll find ganoderma lucidum growing on

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.180 
you'll find ganoderma lucidum growing on
the<00:03:08.470> dead<00:03:08.680> stumps<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.459> elm<00:03:11.190> another

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
the dead stumps of the elm another

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.360 
the dead stumps of the elm another
feature<00:03:12.459> which<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:14.590> can't<00:03:14.950> really<00:03:15.190> see

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
feature which you can't really see

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.400 
feature which you can't really see
because<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.480> snow<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.380> roots<00:03:17.620> tend<00:03:18.070> to

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
because of the snow is the roots tend to

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.009 
because of the snow is the roots tend to
spread<00:03:20.410> out<00:03:20.680> as<00:03:20.860> well<00:03:23.519> um<00:03:24.519> let<00:03:25.510> me<00:03:25.600> see<00:03:25.660> if<00:03:25.900> I

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
spread out as well um let me see if I

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.880 
spread out as well um let me see if I
can<00:03:26.200> spot<00:03:26.290> any<00:03:26.950> on<00:03:27.100> this

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:41.260 

yeah<00:03:30.890> just<00:03:31.370> this<00:03:31.610> camera<00:03:39.819> what<00:03:40.819> you'll<00:03:41.030> find

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
yeah just this camera what you'll find

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.190 
yeah just this camera what you'll find
once<00:03:42.020> you<00:03:42.140> get<00:03:42.290> up<00:03:42.410> close<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:43.040> tree

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.300 

hopefully<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.290> can<00:03:48.470> see<00:03:48.739> those<00:03:48.890> marks

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.660 

there<00:03:54.910> will<00:03:55.000> be<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.180> straight<00:03:55.660> line<00:03:56.670> that's

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
there will be a straight line that's

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.070 
there will be a straight line that's
vertical

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
vertical

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.140

you<00:04:00.650> know<00:04:00.770> vertical<00:04:01.580> not<00:04:02.300> horizontal

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.479 

and<00:04:05.269> coming<00:04:06.170> out<00:04:06.409> from<00:04:06.709> that<00:04:06.860> will<00:04:07.099> be<00:04:07.250> little

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
and coming out from that will be little

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.970 
and coming out from that will be little
other<00:04:08.090> little<00:04:08.599> lines<00:04:08.840> that's<00:04:09.650> where<00:04:09.890> the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
other little lines that's where the

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.949 
other little lines that's where the
beetle<00:04:10.340> gets<00:04:10.519> in<00:04:10.760> there<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.060> introduces<00:04:11.840> the

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
beetle gets in there and introduces the

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.400 
beetle gets in there and introduces the
fungus<00:04:12.409> which<00:04:12.590> destroys<00:04:13.129> the<00:04:13.370> street<00:04:17.410> that's

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
fungus which destroys the street that's

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.529 
fungus which destroys the street that's
a<00:04:18.709> easy<00:04:18.829> way<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.310> tell<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:19.759> closed<00:04:20.030> up<00:04:22.330> it<00:04:23.330> has

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
a easy way to tell it closed up it has

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.090 
a easy way to tell it closed up it has
alternate<00:04:24.139> leaves<00:04:24.759> that<00:04:25.759> are<00:04:25.820> tooth<00:04:26.210> and

somewhat lance-shaped but really the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.170 
somewhat lance-shaped but really the
best<00:04:33.259> way<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.530> distinguish<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.550> is<00:04:34.729> by<00:04:34.940> that

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
best way to distinguish it is by that

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.180 
best way to distinguish it is by that
vase<00:04:35.449> shape<00:04:35.810> from<00:04:36.410> a<00:04:36.500> distance<00:04:40.720> here's<00:04:41.720> an<00:04:41.900> old

it will persist for years the fungus I

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.390 
it will persist for years the fungus I
used<00:05:09.400> in<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:09.700> video<00:05:09.850> was<00:05:10.420> one<00:05:10.750> that<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:10.990> found

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
used in the video was one that I found

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.490 
used in the video was one that I found
growing<00:05:12.400> on<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.760> roadside<00:05:12.970> in<00:05:13.600> a<00:05:13.690> ditch<00:05:13.930> on<00:05:14.230> an

elm stump it looked like it was probably
a<00:05:18.580> year<00:05:18.910> old<00:05:19.090> I<00:05:19.450> brought<00:05:19.810> it<00:05:19.960> home<00:05:20.140> threw<00:05:20.530> it

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
a year old I brought it home threw it

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.980 
a year old I brought it home threw it
out<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:20.860> backyard<00:05:21.100> and<00:05:21.730> two<00:05:22.030> years<00:05:22.240> later<00:05:22.390> I

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
out the backyard and two years later I

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.140 
out the backyard and two years later I
went<00:05:23.590> back<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:23.860> recovered<00:05:24.580> it<00:05:24.670> from<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.970> back

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
went back and recovered it from the back

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.510 
went back and recovered it from the back
yard<00:05:25.480> and<00:05:25.720> it<00:05:25.840> was<00:05:25.990> still<00:05:26.290> intact<00:05:26.740> it<00:05:27.130> hadn't

rotted and just decided to try and use

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.510 
rotted and just decided to try and use
it<00:05:31.270> as<00:05:31.360> tender<00:05:32.670> so<00:05:33.670> that's<00:05:33.880> tree<00:05:34.240> number<00:05:34.660> one

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520
