00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.039 
and moving on with this rate i'm just
going<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.270> speed<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:50.479> up<00:01:50.600> for<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:50.810> cuz<00:01:50.930> it's

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
going to speed this up for you cuz it's

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:58.950 
going to speed this up for you cuz it's
really<00:01:51.259> boring

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.550 

you

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.100 

so<00:02:03.220> as<00:02:03.549> I<00:02:03.759> bring<00:02:04.000> in<00:02:04.119> my<00:02:04.240> second<00:02:04.659> rate<00:02:04.780> this<00:02:04.930> is

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
so as I bring in my second rate this is

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.810 
so as I bring in my second rate this is
the<00:02:05.229> most<00:02:05.380> clutch<00:02:05.680> right<00:02:05.860> I<00:02:05.920> have<00:02:06.189> ever<00:02:06.369> done<00:02:06.549> I

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
the most clutch right I have ever done I

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.910 
the most clutch right I have ever done I
brought<00:02:07.149> or<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.689> had<00:02:08.020> another<00:02:08.259> clutch<00:02:08.649> raid

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
brought or I had another clutch raid

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.949 
brought or I had another clutch raid
before<00:02:09.280> but<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:09.789> one<00:02:09.970> tops<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:10.330> off<00:02:10.450> so

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
before but this one tops it off so

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.120 
before but this one tops it off so
really<00:02:11.170> quickly<00:02:11.410> if<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.709> notice<00:02:11.950> in<00:02:12.040> the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
really quickly if you notice in the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.400 
really quickly if you notice in the
right<00:02:12.250> corner<00:02:12.520> all<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.390> my<00:02:13.569> balloons<00:02:13.930> go<00:02:14.200> down

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
right corner all of my balloons go down

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.920 
right corner all of my balloons go down
right<00:02:14.950> there<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.280> can<00:02:15.400> see<00:02:15.450> my<00:02:16.450> bloom<00:02:16.660> split

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
right there you can see my bloom split

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.100 
right there you can see my bloom split
up<00:02:17.050> into<00:02:17.260> three<00:02:17.430> sections<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.880> now<00:02:19.480> they're

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
up into three sections and now they're

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.199 
up into three sections and now they're
only<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.410> 22<00:02:20.709> so<00:02:21.160> right<00:02:21.310> now<00:02:21.340> I'm<00:02:21.730> panicking

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
only in 22 so right now I'm panicking

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.520 
only in 22 so right now I'm panicking
and<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.690> was<00:02:22.810> actually<00:02:22.930> thinking<00:02:23.080> if<00:02:23.440> i<00:02:23.500> should

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
and I was actually thinking if i should

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.089 
and I was actually thinking if i should
attack<00:02:23.920> this<00:02:24.069> base<00:02:24.250> or<00:02:24.459> not<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:26.010> what<00:02:27.010> do<00:02:27.069> you

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
attack this base or not the what do you

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.190 
attack this base or not the what do you
call<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.760> inferno<00:02:28.030> towers<00:02:28.209> were<00:02:28.510> both<00:02:28.989> set

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
call it the inferno towers were both set

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.350 
call it the inferno towers were both set
on<00:02:29.290> multi<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.860> all<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.489> Expos<00:02:30.880> were<00:02:31.090> set<00:02:31.330> on

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
on multi and all the Expos were set on

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.690 
on multi and all the Expos were set on
air<00:02:31.720> also<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.500> i<00:02:32.530> was<00:02:32.830> thinking<00:02:33.220> about<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.459> and
