we're looking at a few deciduous hardy
ferns<00:00:18.170> basically<00:00:19.170> deciduous<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:19.980> means

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
ferns basically deciduous just means

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
that these plants lose their foliage

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.320 
that these plants lose their foliage
during<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> late<00:00:23.130> fall<00:00:23.160> winter<00:00:23.820> months<00:00:24.180> and

we're<00:00:27.660> going<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> look<00:00:27.960> at<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> couple<00:00:28.410> of

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
we're going to look at a couple of

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.290 
we're going to look at a couple of
different<00:00:28.710> species<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.910> first<00:00:30.179> one

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
different species and the first one

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.519 
different species and the first one
we're<00:00:30.390> gonna<00:00:30.449> look<00:00:30.689> at<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.349> ones

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
we're gonna look at is one of the ones

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.959 
we're gonna look at is one of the ones
that<00:00:31.619> has<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.949> most<00:00:32.130> potential<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
that has the most potential to get the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.799 
that has the most potential to get the
tallest<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.770> royal<00:00:35.219> fern<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:35.940> Munda

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
tallest this is the royal fern as Munda

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.430 
tallest this is the royal fern as Munda
regalis<00:00:37.760> this<00:00:38.760> plant<00:00:39.059> isn't<00:00:39.239> native<00:00:39.570> fern<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
regalis this plant isn't native fern and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.200 
regalis this plant isn't native fern and
in<00:00:40.829> fact<00:00:41.070> at<00:00:41.280> first<00:00:41.309> glance<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.879> doesn't<00:00:42.030> even

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
in fact at first glance it doesn't even

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.850 
in fact at first glance it doesn't even
look<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.629> fern<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.290> actually<00:00:43.590> looks<00:00:43.800> like

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
look like a fern it actually looks like

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.560 
look like a fern it actually looks like
possibly<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.579> member<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> legume<00:00:45.360> family

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
possibly a member of the legume family

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.220 
possibly a member of the legume family
but<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.710> actually<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.340> fern<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.510> royal<00:00:48.930> fern

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
but it is actually a fern the royal fern

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.470 
but it is actually a fern the royal fern
is<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.800> nice<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.340> foundation<00:00:50.940> plantings

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
is really nice for foundation plantings

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.360 
is really nice for foundation plantings
or<00:00:51.750> background<00:00:52.260> plantings<00:00:52.710> because<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.219> its

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
or background plantings because of its

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
or background plantings because of its
nice<00:00:53.579> height<00:00:53.910> although<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.230> it

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
nice height although here you can see it

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.110 
nice height although here you can see it
is<00:00:55.469> much<00:00:55.620> shorter<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> be

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
is much shorter so it's going to be

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240 
is much shorter so it's going to be
really<00:00:57.719> nice<00:00:57.960> toward<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> border<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.949> your

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
really nice toward the border of your

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.760 
really nice toward the border of your
garden<00:00:59.820> one<00:01:00.570> thing<00:01:00.780> about<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> royal<00:01:01.379> part<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
garden one thing about the royal part is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.950 
garden one thing about the royal part is
is<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> clumping<00:01:02.699> root<00:01:02.969> system<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.809> has<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
is a clumping root system so it has a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.289 
is a clumping root system so it has a
massive<00:01:04.379> clumping<00:01:05.220> root<00:01:05.430> system<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.939> does<00:01:06.150> not

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
massive clumping root system it does not

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.640 
massive clumping root system it does not
spread<00:01:06.780> now<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.130> fern<00:01:08.430> has<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> nice<00:01:09.650> really

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
spread now this fern has a nice really

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.010 
spread now this fern has a nice really
show<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> fertile<00:01:11.460> frond<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> tips<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:12.630> the

River fern this is a really nice fern
that's<00:01:40.110> also<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.530> native<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.979> South<00:01:41.189> Carolina

that's also in native to South Carolina
it's<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> get<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:43.020> bit<00:01:43.140> taller

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
it's going to get a little bit taller

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.620 
it's going to get a little bit taller
than<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.399> royal<00:01:44.759> fern<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.270> tell<00:01:45.479> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
than the royal fern you can tell that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.270 
than the royal fern you can tell that
this<00:01:45.780> plant<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.229> actually<00:01:46.619> happier<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.159> this

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
this plant is actually happier in this

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.590 
this plant is actually happier in this
environment<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.119> much<00:01:48.299> taller

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
environment because it is much taller
