00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.109

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.950
 need 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.540
 say goodbye to Islam 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.170
 for example on the gas pedal 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.780
 Yanukovych

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.930

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
 what he takes see how guests 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.850
 have it yourself 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.159
 as known 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.459
 now moving in the most interesting 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.419
 phone which from film to film 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.799
 to shoot 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.539
 somehow 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.399
 as for the phone 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.399
 I arrived today 1 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.539
 asked stefan to read what i can 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.189
 sound the cracks of the months of the microscope 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.289
 a business 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.149
 what should the hunger strike 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:47.239
 But I went to make sure 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.270
 What nothing 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.459
 as they say 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.670
 altogether near surprise for 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.319
 phone this phone ran new 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.599
 another one for location 6 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.520
 country's population 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.029
 check order could not survive 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:01.699
 about give 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:03.069
 here 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.349
 and as for 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.719
 second phone that did not bring 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.969
 so I would compare the gap means 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.689
 everything is quiet 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.009
 what was seen 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.069
 We do not know whether to appoint 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.499
 here is this part 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:20.699
 on the second phone they didn't bring here 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.429
 no money 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:25.749
 crevices 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:28.199
 you donâ€™t have one 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.649
 availability 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.469
 there was in a cave just he has none 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.239
 whom 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.799
 we were very noticeable 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.209
 as for this and critical 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.049
 here we see 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.019
 only this is it 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.379
 seems to be r 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.109
 You can basically say that this is a gap 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.329
 but 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.819
 basically not visible 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.819
 I don't think it was driving a car 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.319
 I don't know 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.429
 for us 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.269
 which cameras 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.269
 and now such a plan but today 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:09.069
 as for the stub on the second copy 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.579
 phones and saw that the stub 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.269
 gutseriev 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.089
 and this side 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:17.799
 were and there are other people doing 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.799
 in general, my opinion is 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.779
 so every phone 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.210
 the deficit will be 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.860
 have some small children 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.699
 manicure 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.849
 that is why 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.580
 you can imagine winter tires 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.449
 phones for the first time 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:36.259
 first channel 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:37.250
 it will suit me 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.419
 introduction 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.199
 can be said referred to the fact that he 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.020
 111 8 years 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.020
 another year there is 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.749
 I'm not even so much 2 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.210
 so here it turns on 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.490
 often on the italian continent 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.490
 will not be now 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.680
 total for january
