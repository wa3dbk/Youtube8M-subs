00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.500 

all<00:02:12.010> right<00:02:12.250> next<00:02:12.849> thing<00:02:13.000> I'm<00:02:13.180> going<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.330> show

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
all right next thing I'm going to show

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.500 
all right next thing I'm going to show
you<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.080> double<00:02:14.349> stroke<00:02:14.560> roll<00:02:15.510> that

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
you is the double stroke roll that

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.260 
you is the double stroke roll that
consists<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.319> it's<00:02:18.280> good<00:02:18.520> for<00:02:18.730> when<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.090> want

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
consists of it's good for when you want

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.360 
consists of it's good for when you want
to<00:02:19.300> go<00:02:19.660> faster<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:21.340> just<00:02:21.670> do<00:02:22.450> two<00:02:22.750> hits<00:02:23.050> for

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
to go faster you just do two hits for

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.000 
to go faster you just do two hits for
each<00:02:24.370> stick<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.360> just<00:02:25.510> keep<00:02:25.660> alternating

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
each stick and you just keep alternating

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.190 
each stick and you just keep alternating
so<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.130> would<00:02:27.250> be<00:02:27.400> right<00:02:28.000> right<00:02:28.269> left<00:02:28.870> left

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
so it would be right right left left

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.180 
so it would be right right left left
right<00:02:29.590> right<00:02:30.130> left<00:02:30.550> left<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:32.530> just<00:02:32.769> you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
right right left left and you just you

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.729 
right right left left and you just you
definitely<00:02:33.580> need<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.790> relax<00:02:34.090> on<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:34.739> because

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
definitely need to relax on this because

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.199 
definitely need to relax on this because
if<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:35.920> don't<00:02:36.190> it's<00:02:36.519> going<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:36.970> be<00:02:37.060> really

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209
