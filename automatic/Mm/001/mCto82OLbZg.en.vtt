00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.100
 video 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.440
 today I will show you an application that 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.110
 it's something pretty spectacular 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.809
 will create us our 3d avatar there 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.190
 something as absurd as ever before 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.680
 begin I invite you to leave a beautiful one 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.420
 thumb up let's see if we reach 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.189
 the 8 thousand I like for the next one 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.090
 video and at this point I'd say 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.240
 start to see what comes out of it 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.670
 then 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.849
 the application is called ista 3d here we are 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.099
 here the place olive animated avatar 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.600
 perfect let's do this usual 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.329
 selphy and let's see what comes out of it 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.100
 out or what a beautiful chick we have 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.620
 more admitted here tell us how to do it 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.899
 self but we don't need it is certainly a guide 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.870
 so let's do this case yes but I'm in 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.170
 buchetto is my very small type 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.840
 face looks like it's inside a hole in the ass 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.370
 how nice it's good let's do this 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.879
 selphy that we are silent but it is a lot 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.309
 nice if when a selfish is in this 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.619
 so it only comes to you to say that ca o that 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.990
 after years I will have done 300,000 self and al 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.549
 end I got a good one then now 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.700
 we have to set male or 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.729
 female who asks difficult orazio 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.979
 internet not available well serves 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.900
 also internet 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.280
 heck ok after we activated it 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.780
 internet is a kind of 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.759
 elaboration yes here they are 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.090
 by scanning the face this will do that 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.950
 these guys put me in the documents 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.890
 of the fbi alas they start to blow 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.479
 it could be this really isn't 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.909
 an avatar creation application is 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.970
 an application created by the fbi for 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.619
 scan the faces and put them all 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.619
 in their databases 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.710
 or a simple application for 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.280
 make dick avatars how much there 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.170
 is putting hobo store are ten fucking 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.060
 of hours that here scans my face 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:04.310
 did or my god then first thing 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.830
 what is this horrible hair 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.890
 second because you're dancing like that 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.230
 boy but what are you doing 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.020
 ok now what the fuck is dancing gang 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:20.180
 hardstyle ie no let's imagine a 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:29.390
 moment the scene with gangan style urban 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:33.110
 car nam is fine, I would say that it can be enough 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.410
 so at the stop and turn it 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.270
 of course there is a text in the giant and obvious 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.690
 however hungry impression because that 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.880
 face and my dick then there is the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.840
 complexion color well I would say that 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.090
 this is fine 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.769
 no this dark because I am 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.280
 enough white done is true that 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.980
 cookie always in the sun what a fuck if not 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.980
 I'm so white it's okay that I'm white 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.480
 but I'm not so white so I'd say of 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.620
 set another color even if it had 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.200
 posted black actually well does not work 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.800
 more than casabella now I keep this 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.140
 loved so ok since that evening avatar 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.360
 I don't know what the hell it was 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.350
 success has had to make me a self ii 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.200
 in conclusion 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.920
 here we are again a self worse than the other 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.890
 all right 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.650
 ok at this point i would say to do it 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.489
 look a little more like me we see that 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:33.330
 fuck it comes out if with a bandana 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:38.040
 goes meanwhile now looks justin bieber 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.319
 fuck no so they are too long oh my 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.380
 this is a hedgehog they are not gods 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.830
 a porcupine's fucking hair I don't 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.019
 I know which ones are worse among them but 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.269
 at some point I put on my hat and 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:57.720
 via i look like tony hawk the one on 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:04:00.180
 skateboard or holy christ 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.549
 we do a beautiful thing but we put the 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.580
 justin bieber hair and in fact no 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.780
 these are a little nicer leaving 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.330
 so we can also choose a 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.519
 complete yes it seems kind of a 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.650
 I don't know why he 's shirting me 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:20.340
 remembers a woodcutter 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:26.539
 if I have to comment on this what you want 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:31.169
 that even short pants well 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:34.530
 this is a little prettier oh my god 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.130
 maybe in 50 years I will be like this but for now 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.650
 I prefer myself with a sweater well to sto 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.490
 point you know that I do read this 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:49.200
 here that perhaps the most horrible thing that 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.450
 there is more horrible than there is a beauty 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.880
 what we leave the initial one because me 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.850
 he knows he is the most decent of these things 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.630
 obrobriosa then we can also choose 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.700
 face but what the hell is this 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.740
 stupid smile there is only the mouth 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:12.380
 retort or my god 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.380
 if so it seems a kind of weak 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.409
 you're crying boy 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.979
 moron's face it seems he has 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:25.590
 something invisible in my mouth now 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.919
 I don't want to think badly but let's go 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.560
 face that is better was not better 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.659
 face was better than before 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.360
 first then we can choose ok 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:39.779
 how to make this color gang dance 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.680
 amstein well i would say that it connects gam style 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:45.509
 everything is asked is what you come from 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.860
 neighborhoods that did not intervene at the entrance 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:52.439
 may have immediately suffered even less ok 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.569
 maybe I'm freaking out too much 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:56.610
 this bad then we leave is this 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.590
 that is unleashed by we can set 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:05.460
 even the glasses 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:08.370
 no for divine charity now it seems zed 89 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.159
 for God's sake I prefer not to know 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.159
 I know how to have scholarly glasses 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:16.139
 so it seems like a teacher of a 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.870
 problem because I set man 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.550
 when I created this avatar 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:26.370
 I have to worry about what I am 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:29.460
 really i ok guys good we have 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.289
 tested this beautiful application is 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.629
 this avatar is out 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:39.139
 I know I looked like the beauty though 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:39.139
 certain clothes 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.289
 forget it 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:45.659
 not to mention the final glasses 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:47.189
 oh well oh well we do n't think about it 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:49.050
