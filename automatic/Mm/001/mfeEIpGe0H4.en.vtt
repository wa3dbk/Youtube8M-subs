of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> box<00:00:44.750> yeah<00:00:45.750> go<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.129> here<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.910> 3gs

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
of the box yeah go so here it is 3gs

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.990 
of the box yeah go so here it is 3gs
same<00:00:49.649> thing<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.160> probably<00:00:50.879> no

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
same thing you know probably no

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.760 
same thing you know probably no
difference<00:00:51.420> or<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> 3g<00:00:52.020> there's<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.440> form

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
difference or the 3g there's a form

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.459 
difference or the 3g there's a form
factor<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> outside

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
factor it's what it's not the outside

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.160 
factor it's what it's not the outside
it's<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> inside<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.550> counts<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it's the inside that counts for this a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.220 
it's the inside that counts for this a
upgrade<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.910> course<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.359> course<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.690> camera

the first time you run you have to do a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.690 
the first time you run you have to do a
figure<00:02:54.090> eight<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.690> motion<00:02:55.080> like<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.470> or<00:02:56.370> make

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
figure eight to motion like this or make

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.670 
figure eight to motion like this or make
an<00:02:56.880> see<00:02:57.120> well<00:02:57.390> but<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:57.959> figure-eight<00:02:58.620> motion

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
an see well but that figure-eight motion

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.830 
an see well but that figure-eight motion
calibrates<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.670> sensor<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.420> right
