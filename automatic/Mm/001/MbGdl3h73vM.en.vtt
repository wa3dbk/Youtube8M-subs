00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.049 

so<00:00:12.300> here<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> question<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:13.160> what<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.730> best

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
so here the question is what is the best

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.279 
so here the question is what is the best
reparation<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:16.320> side<00:00:17.630> dance<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.900> question

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
reparation for side dance that question

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.260 
reparation for side dance that question
you<00:00:19.439> kind<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.650> got<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.890> know<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.789> difference

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
you kind of got to know the difference

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.400 
you kind of got to know the difference
between<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.800> two<00:00:23.070> types<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.609> muscle<00:00:23.910> fibers

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
between the two types of muscle fibers

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.120 
between the two types of muscle fibers
so<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.740> one<00:00:26.070> under<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> structure<00:00:26.960> there's

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
so on one under the structure there's

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.160 
so on one under the structure there's
circle<00:00:29.130> plasma<00:00:29.730> muscle<00:00:30.119> which<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.019> type

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
circle plasma muscle which is the type

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.650 
circle plasma muscle which is the type
of<00:00:31.199> muscle<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.619> body<00:00:31.830> butters<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.759> it's

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
of muscle of body butters have and it's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.620 
of muscle of body butters have and it's
generally<00:00:34.170> puffy<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.700> big<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.270> it

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
generally puffy and it's big and it

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.860 
generally puffy and it's big and it
makes<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.079> bigger<00:00:37.770> as<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.480> person<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.719> you're

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
makes you bigger as a person so you're

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.479 
makes you bigger as a person so you're
going<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.079> put<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.379> weight<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.309> going<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
going to put on weight but it's going to

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.540 
going to put on weight but it's going to
be<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> fluid-filled<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:43.070> it's<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.340> really

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
be a fluid-filled and it's not really

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.299 
be a fluid-filled and it's not really
gonna<00:00:44.690> correlate<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.719> actual<00:00:46.559> strength<00:00:46.980> gains

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
gonna correlate to actual strength gains

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.970 
gonna correlate to actual strength gains
in<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> gym<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.649> bigger

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
in the gym but it is going to be bigger

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.220 
in the gym but it is going to be bigger
than<00:00:50.449> they<00:00:51.449> are<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.809> other<00:00:51.930> side<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
than they are on the other side of the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.150 
than they are on the other side of the
structure<00:00:52.670> there's<00:00:54.110> myofibrillar<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.770> muscle

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
structure there's myofibrillar of muscle

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.330 
structure there's myofibrillar of muscle
and<00:00:56.719> that<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.899> when<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.170> muscle<00:00:58.590> fibers

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
and that is when your muscle fibers

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.360 
and that is when your muscle fibers
actually<00:00:59.879> rip<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.480> make<00:01:01.140> new<00:01:01.859> muscles<00:01:02.280> in

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
actually rip and make new muscles in

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.310 
actually rip and make new muscles in
their<00:01:02.460> place<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
their place so it's not really going to

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.280 
their place so it's not really going to
make<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.850> bigger<00:01:05.930> but<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> make

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
make you bigger but it's going to make

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.990 
make you bigger but it's going to make
you<00:01:07.439> done<00:01:07.710> sir<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> muscle<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.850> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
you done sir and the muscle of that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.670 
you done sir and the muscle of that
you're<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.479> making<00:01:10.409> me<00:01:10.830> stronger<00:01:11.510> so

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
you're going to be making me stronger so

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.980 
you're going to be making me stronger so
it's<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.950> question<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.790> whether<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.720> want<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it's the question of whether you want to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.700 
it's the question of whether you want to
get<00:01:16.140> bigger<00:01:16.380> or<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.369> want<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.700> done<00:01:17.909> sir

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
get bigger or you want to get done sir

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.580 
get bigger or you want to get done sir
personally<00:01:20.659> people<00:01:21.659> generally<00:01:22.020> shoot<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.560> be

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590

home dancers with clothes fit better and
that's<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.400> typical<00:01:26.820> Hollywood

might want to shoot for the I'm gonna
have<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> structure<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.150> try<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.750> get<00:01:40.470> more

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
have the structure and try and get more

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.929 
have the structure and try and get more
Sparkle<00:01:41.759> bus<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> get<00:01:42.810> more<00:01:43.460> size<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
Sparkle bus so to get more size and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.060 
Sparkle bus so to get more size and
supervised<00:01:45.329> Muslim<00:01:46.020> you're<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> want

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
supervised Muslim you're going to want

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.719 
supervised Muslim you're going to want
to<00:01:47.250> try<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.060> aim<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.619> higher<00:01:49.619> reps<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
to try and aim for higher reps not that

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.060 
to try and aim for higher reps not that
much<00:01:50.939> weight<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.689> i<00:01:52.020> would<00:01:52.470> say<00:01:52.740> probably

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
much weight so i would say probably

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.569 
much weight so i would say probably
around<00:01:53.850> 10<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.540> 15<00:01:54.899> reps<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:56.189> range<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.939> uh

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
around 10 to 15 reps that range and uh

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.920 
around 10 to 15 reps that range and uh
between<00:01:59.579> fifty<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.060> seventy<00:02:00.360> percent<00:02:00.689> of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
between fifty and seventy percent of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.219 
between fifty and seventy percent of
your<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.439> rep<00:02:01.590> max<00:02:02.509> but<00:02:03.509> if<00:02:03.689> you're<00:02:03.869> shooting

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
your one rep max but if you're shooting

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.399 
your one rep max but if you're shooting
for<00:02:04.610> leaner<00:02:05.610> denser<00:02:06.270> muscle<00:02:06.630> which<00:02:07.110> i

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
for leaner denser muscle which i

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.889 
for leaner denser muscle which i
personally<00:02:08.009> suggest<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.119> go<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.599> because

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
personally suggest you go for because

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.370 
personally suggest you go for because
that

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
that

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.700 
that
just<00:02:10.680> it's<00:02:11.460> more<00:02:11.580> functional<00:02:12.440> ages<00:02:13.440> who<00:02:13.530> looks

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
just it's more functional ages who looks

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.800 
just it's more functional ages who looks
better<00:02:13.800> on<00:02:14.010> those<00:02:14.220> people<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.760> would<00:02:15.660> suggest

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
better on those people I would suggest

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.640 
better on those people I would suggest
going<00:02:16.370> for<00:02:17.370> between<00:02:17.850> 70<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.930> hundred<00:02:19.200> year

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
going for between 70 and a hundred year

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.090 
going for between 70 and a hundred year
one<00:02:19.800> R<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.920> X<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.580> then<00:02:21.300> going<00:02:21.540> for<00:02:22.230> between

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
one R of X and then going for between
