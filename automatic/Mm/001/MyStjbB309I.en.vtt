00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
understand Anatomy is destiny for most

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.529 
understand Anatomy is destiny for most
of<00:00:47.890> us<00:00:47.980> they<00:00:48.430> don't<00:00:48.460> understand<00:00:48.910> that<00:00:48.969> sex

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
of us they don't understand that sex

wear<00:00:58.210> barrettes<00:00:58.390> that<00:00:58.780> makes<00:00:58.929> you<00:00:59.019> a<00:00:59.050> girl<00:00:59.320> if

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
wear barrettes that makes you a girl if

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.279 
wear barrettes that makes you a girl if
you<00:00:59.710> wear<00:01:00.510> overalls<00:01:01.510> that<00:01:01.719> makes<00:01:01.929> you<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.079> boy

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
you wear overalls that makes you a boy

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.530 
you wear overalls that makes you a boy
and<00:01:02.559> so<00:01:02.800> that's<00:01:03.309> called<00:01:03.460> gender<00:01:03.850> impermanence

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
and so that's called gender impermanence

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.100 
and so that's called gender impermanence
and<00:01:04.720> when<00:01:05.379> kids<00:01:05.770> are<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:07.330> that<00:01:07.540> phase<00:01:07.840> they

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
and when kids are in that phase they

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.510 
and when kids are in that phase they
tend<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.350> gravitate<00:01:08.619> toward<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.340> most

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
tend to gravitate toward the most

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.020 
tend to gravitate toward the most
extreme<00:01:10.030> representation<00:01:10.869> of<00:01:11.049> whatever<00:01:11.500> it<00:01:11.680> is

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
extreme representation of whatever it is

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.370 
extreme representation of whatever it is
for<00:01:13.030> their<00:01:13.210> sex<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.720> culture<00:01:14.020> offers

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380

says a toy for a girl and a toy for a
boy<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.300> was<00:03:50.390> supposed<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.870> be<00:03:51.110> a<00:03:51.320> toy<00:03:51.620> for

boy it was supposed to be a toy for
everybody<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.550> then<00:03:53.060> over<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.540> years<00:03:53.780> they

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
everybody and then over the years they

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.060 
everybody and then over the years they
realized<00:03:54.140> that<00:03:54.350> they<00:03:54.500> could<00:03:54.650> make<00:03:54.800> a<00:03:54.830> whole

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
realized that they could make a whole

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.350 
realized that they could make a whole
lot<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.400> money<00:03:55.520> by<00:03:55.760> making<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:56.150> hyper

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
lot of money by making it hyper

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.720 
lot of money by making it hyper
stereotyped<00:03:57.020> towards<00:03:57.320> boys<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:58.040> then<00:03:58.580> they

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
stereotyped towards boys and then they

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.860 
stereotyped towards boys and then they
realized<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.090> they'd<00:03:59.300> left<00:03:59.480> out<00:03:59.600> half<00:03:59.750> the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
realized that they'd left out half the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.780 
realized that they'd left out half the
population<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:00.920> rather<00:04:01.160> than<00:04:01.400> really<00:04:01.550> try<00:04:01.760> to

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
population so rather than really try to

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.310 
population so rather than really try to
figure<00:04:02.000> out<00:04:02.270> a<00:04:02.300> way<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.570> reach<00:04:02.780> girls<00:04:03.110> that

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
figure out a way to reach girls that

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.040 
figure out a way to reach girls that
would<00:04:03.580> broaden<00:04:04.580> ideas<00:04:05.240> make<00:04:05.570> it<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:05.930> know<00:04:06.020> a

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
would broaden ideas make it you know a

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.410 
would broaden ideas make it you know a
great<00:04:06.410> toy<00:04:06.740> they<00:04:07.310> just<00:04:07.520> went<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.030> easiest
