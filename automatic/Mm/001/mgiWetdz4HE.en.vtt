00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 welcome to another video friends today jay 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.400
 pokemon lice and good today 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.470
 I bring here to the channel what would be 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.750
 another informative video of pokemon ruby or 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.210
 mega and sapphire alpha or even also 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.710
 we could call it pokemon xc and now 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.839
 that a news story has just been revealed 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.760
 pretty amazing and I guess 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.590
 that absolutely everyone will know 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.490
 to the pokemon initials of second 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.529
 generation 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.960
 megan yunta and production and ferb a ligar 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.670
 of the alligator as he likes to call and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.920
 good thing is that today is just 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.439
 reveal something very incredible and that is that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.809
 we know exactly the date and the method 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.820
 to be able to get these pokemon with 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.149
 their respective hidden abilities the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.410
 which until now was impossible 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.090
 get them legally or that the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.340
 Pokemon was legal with the skills 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.829
 hidden but now we are going to be able to 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.719
 acquire and they will make these pokemon 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.149
 be more used and win 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.579
 a lot of potential friends before 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.770
 tell them the date and the methods 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.059
 I will comment a little above does 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.489
 every skill so they know 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.379
 exactly why is it that these ships 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.660
 now they will be so good with these 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.970
 skills first of all we start 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.830
 by megan and one that will win defense 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.780
 what it does is that it protects 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.670
 pokemon of any state change 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.220
 as long as the weather is sunny 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.380
 so if there is sunny weather we can 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.180
 intoxicate can not burn us 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.310
 can paralyze or anything like that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.650
 such pressure will acquire the skill 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.900
 absorbs fire that what it does is that 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.540
 apart from becoming immune to attacks 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.300
 of fire once the pokemon receives some 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.160
 fire type attack as I commented it is not going 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.490
 to receive any damage for any attack 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.530
 of fire will gain 50% power 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.630
 extra in any fire type attack 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.910
 which the pokemon wants to do which 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.070
 it's pretty good since the pokemon at 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.350
 have the same guy will win a double 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.270
 was now let's talk about the most 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.640
 I'm excited which is this to flirt 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.009
 or feral and geyter as he likes to say that 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.780
 will acquire brute force what does this 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.780
 movement improved this skill is that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.820
 30% boost all attacks that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.520
 have side effects, call 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.700
 waterfall call ice puyol or even 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.979
 shred making the cost of better 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.989
 stability is that it will no longer be 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.450
 never the side effect for example 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.730
 waterfall has a percentage to make 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.430
 was the rival is never going to push back 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.379
 to the rival but nevertheless it will have 30% 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.230
 of extra power which is pretty 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.510
 well doing that this pear and gate 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.280
 Now now earn a lot and it's going to be 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.280
 a much more competitive pokemon more 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.080
 used more offensive more incredible than the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.450
 truth of the three is the one that more illusion 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.069
 makes me able to use and really 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.050
 I hope this pokemon can 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.269
 get it with your hidden ability 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.799
 good to get these pokemon 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.950
 we will have to wait until what would be 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.890
 on February 27 so there is not much left 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.630
 maybe more than 20 days and 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.519
 to be able to get it simply 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.560
 we will have to enter what would be the 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.930
 pokemon bank with a subscription 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.049
 active so maybe this is a 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.849
 little nintendo trampita what do you want 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.349
 to make us buy the bank of 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.329
 pokemon to be able to get these 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.569
 pokemon but really do not see it so 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:10.049
 necessary I think we can 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.849
 get the pokemon and someone 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.980
 exchange because he already had the bank 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.379
 of pokemon and someone uploads it to the gts 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.060
 with hidden life I really do not think 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.769
 that it is so necessary to have to buy 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.719
 the pokemon bank but if you already have it 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.609
 bought everything will be as simple as 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.099
 re-enter the bank and save the 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.769
 pokemon bank and there you can get 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.590
 these three pokemon so in itself is 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.849
 pretty easy it 's pretty simple to 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.560
 unless they do not want to buy the 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.999
 because you will have to wait for a 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.919
 little bit more to have someone send them to you 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.840
 by the gts or someone to upload it by the 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.180
 gts or that some friend is 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.519
 exchange but also within 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.260
 absolutely nothing will we get this 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.060
 trio of pokemon initials with their 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.430
 respective hidden abilities with the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.719
 which will earn quite as well not 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.769
 forget to put me here in the 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.480
 comments 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.150
 which of the three makes them more illusion 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.129
 have me as I said fer alligator is 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.139
 my pokemon that more illusion makes me have 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.879
 likewise also we do not either 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.400
 destroy that button I like if it is 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.389
 who liked receiving this information 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.590

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.269
