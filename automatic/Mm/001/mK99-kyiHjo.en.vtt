00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.070
 set the ring 27 I think it was a 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.060
 thing that arose from the need for a 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.609
 cyclist city ​​topography distances 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.070
 heat temperature is meant that the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.240
 people think about this thing from 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.279
 shower in 5 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.199
 the bicycle parked safely 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.199
 something else that is missing a lot in the city 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.160
 seek integration not only between 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.780
 cyclists but among everyone in the community 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.770
 is one of Aquino's intrinsic goals 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.329
 27 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.579
 we have only in the expanded center of 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.930
 São Paulo City had in mind 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.739
 about 500 thousand bicycle trips is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.000
 is a large public audience brings their 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.500
 companions 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.930
 establishments that they like to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.489
 to attend then make these minimums 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.700
 put one to cycle in front of the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.200

 offers here also you can do 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.909
 lots of things, not to attract this 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.150
 public for your 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.150
 establishment 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.060
 the park show is is like the name itself 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.750
 says it's a parking area with the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.820
 showers 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.850
 So, you're going to take a shower. 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.310
 we offer this the cyclist as a 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.080
 ease him is one that is 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.000
 paid for this type of service 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.190
 it's like he's paying a parking lot 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.510
 By car the cyclist has the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:49.140
 People offer towel in the pits. 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.030
 individual and enclosed 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.710
 translucent despite being individuals 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.980
 are painted but it does not give a great 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.090
 privacy there is creamy soap for 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.650
 be used 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.290
 The water in the shower that is pressurized is 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.940
 is a water that was given by the research 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.360
 greener solar 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.150
 in addition the cyclist has cabinets 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.160
 a hairdryer is provided. 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.870
 an infra structure in changing rooms 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.790
 women's dressing room we went to a 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.900
 little or put up a flat iron to 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:26.430
 the most vain is not to use I think 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.430
 we had to have a unit each campuses 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.050
 are paulo of this scheme of having a place 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.430
 that you can see if I can talk 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.800
 Can I bring your bike that can 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.230
 you can take a bath that 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.220
 it is also a difference no 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.230
 place time 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.330
 there are places that you go for example I 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.160
 I'll put Paulista there's no way you do not 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.709
 to arrive in São Paulo, not from here 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.630
 because I have a server I wanted 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.540
 too much power to get there and spoken now I'm going 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.340
 take a shower or in the reader we do not 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.680
 would need bike lanes if people 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.260
 to live with all the means of 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.840
 not only to the car with a 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.730
 bike on a motorcycle with the bus as 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.090
 the truck everyone knew to have respect 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.830
 by the next is the least you can do 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.860
 a super athlete 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.400
 the bicycle people are ordinary people 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.110
 so people can not get 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.940
 means of transport which is not 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.630
 only technology to be able to use our 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.630
 brasília
