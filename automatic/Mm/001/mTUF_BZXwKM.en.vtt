00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
there's a little V point here which you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
there's a little V point here which you
match<00:01:35.159> up<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.670> V<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.329> there<00:01:38.270> throw<00:01:39.270> it

up<00:01:41.509> or<00:01:42.509> check<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.820> there<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.360> be

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
up or check that there is going to be

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.819 
up or check that there is going to be
enough<00:01:46.250> down<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:48.290> showing<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.530> I'll<00:01:49.680> be

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
enough down here showing that I'll be

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
easily

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.360 
easily
so<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.360> all<00:03:23.600> think<00:03:23.630> safety<00:03:24.200> free<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:25.100> there's

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
so you all think safety free so there's

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.800 
so you all think safety free so there's
no<00:03:25.550> need<00:03:25.760> for<00:03:26.570> any<00:03:26.750> protection<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:27.770> thought

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:57.810 

now<00:03:33.400> throw<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.670> up<00:03:34.880> again<00:03:35.650> using<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.770> bait

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.750 

now<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.360> excess<00:03:59.930> led<00:04:00.290> on<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:01.160> top<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.610> on

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
now the the excess led on the top and on

00:04:01.760 --> 00:05:09.730 
now the the excess led on the top and on
the<00:04:01.790> bottom<00:04:01.940> here<00:04:02.420> are<00:04:02.900> just<00:04:05.050> cuts<00:04:06.050> around

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.870 

let's<00:05:10.370> remove<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:12.699> shoulder<00:05:13.699> of<00:05:13.850> the

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
let's remove the shoulder of the

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.230 
let's remove the shoulder of the
accessory<00:05:15.310> it's<00:05:16.310> actually<00:05:16.669> going<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:17.090> bit

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
accessory it's actually going a bit

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.379 
accessory it's actually going a bit
further<00:05:19.660> now<00:05:20.660> these<00:05:21.400> are<00:05:22.400> just<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.970> couple<00:05:23.000> of

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
further now these are just a couple of

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.820 
further now these are just a couple of
pieces<00:05:23.660> of<00:05:24.400> water<00:05:25.400> pipe<00:05:25.789> with<00:05:25.820> point<00:05:26.570> on<00:05:26.840> but

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
pieces of water pipe with point on but

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.090 
pieces of water pipe with point on but
there<00:05:28.070> are<00:05:28.160> longer<00:05:28.430> than<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:28.789> shaft<00:05:29.620> so<00:05:30.620> when

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
there are longer than the shaft so when

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.260 
there are longer than the shaft so when
I<00:05:32.350> freeze<00:05:33.350> them<00:05:33.530> all<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:33.979> end<00:05:34.160> I<00:05:34.520> can<00:05:35.090> now

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
I freeze them all the end I can now

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.590 
I freeze them all the end I can now
knock<00:05:35.750> up<00:05:35.930> that<00:05:36.169> leg<00:05:39.610> which<00:05:40.610> tightens<00:05:41.210> it<00:05:41.449> up

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
knock up that leg which tightens it up

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.430 
knock up that leg which tightens it up
around<00:05:42.560> the<00:05:42.979> shaft<00:05:43.910> and<00:05:44.300> so<00:05:44.630> if<00:05:44.810> there<00:05:45.020> is<00:05:45.229> any

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
around the shaft and so if there is any

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.169 
around the shaft and so if there is any
looseness<00:05:46.090> it<00:05:47.090> will<00:05:47.300> tighten<00:05:47.780> up<00:05:47.900> out
