00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.729
 a nice cover image so the start menu 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.950

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.830
 jump the text williams improvement 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.600

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.860
 Of course there will be quite a lot 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.290

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.510

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.920

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.560

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.890
