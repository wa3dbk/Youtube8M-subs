00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 TOGETHER AGAINST DOPING - 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.260
 The prevention program of NADA. 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.680
 These are Sandra and Johannes. 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.660
 Due to a positive doping incident 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.560
 in the news they are on the topic 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.700
 Doping in the sport became aware. 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.380
 But something like doping, says Johannes, 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.620
 starts already in our society. 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.099
 For example, to get better faster 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.779
 or to meet the pressure to perform in the job, 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.560
 The handle becomes a painkiller or even to others 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.619
 Medicines more and more natural. 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.619
 This creates for the individual 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.019
 often a wrong or deceptive picture, 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.100
 that trivializes the handling of medicines. 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.920
 But also the advertising 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.160
 contributes to a wrong handling here. 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.470
 In competitive sports, Sandra continues, 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.220
 the most common reasons are the high ones 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.800
 Expectations of success of media, spectators, 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.620
 Lenders and coaches. 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.380
 But also the political pressure 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.140
 or the commercial structures of professional sports. 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.800
 Sandra adds, 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.690
 that professional athlete in the past 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.790
 often everything on the one card 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.550
 Have set "competitive sports" 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.730
 and pursued no dual career. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.240
 Thus, doping is often due to the great pressure 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.920
 falsely seen as a last resort. 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.120
 John is astonished and wonders for the first time 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.720
 what doping is exactly. 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.700
 Doping, says Sandra, 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.940
 already begins with possession, trade or only 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.000
 the attempted use of a prohibited substance 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 or a forbidden method. 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.620
 Not to mention a positive drug test 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.020
 even a neglected applies 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.980
 or refused sampling 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.580
 already as a doping violation. 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.620
 Also the manipulation 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.400
 or attempted manipulation of doping control 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.520
 is also seen as doping, 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.540
 extends Sandra. 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.460
 Johannes is impressed 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.680
 and now understands the strict handling. 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.620
 Yes, replies Sandra 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.560
 because doping is fraud and harms the athlete 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.720
 as well as the entire sport. 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.260
 TOGETHER AGAINST DOPING - 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.320
 the prevention program of NADA.
