ducks and what this is going to do is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580 
ducks and what this is going to do is
it's<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.759> draw<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.810> air<00:01:25.320> from

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
it's going to draw the air from

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.929 
it's going to draw the air from
underneath<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.070> car<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.549> that's<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
underneath the car and that's a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.940 
underneath the car and that's a
high-velocity<00:01:27.330> low<00:01:27.840> pressure<00:01:28.170> air<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.680> it's

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
high-velocity low pressure air and it's

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.289 
high-velocity low pressure air and it's
going<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.189> direct<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.670> towards<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.000> brake

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
going to direct it towards the brake

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.289 
going to direct it towards the brake
rotors<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> calipers<00:01:31.979> themselves<00:01:32.490> and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
Japanese but they do include pictures

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.450 
Japanese but they do include pictures
and<00:02:22.020> installation<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.130> easy<00:02:23.340> that

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
and installation on this is so easy that

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.120 
and installation on this is so easy that
you<00:02:23.610> don't<00:02:23.910> really<00:02:24.300> need<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:25.620> details<00:02:26.010> of

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
you don't really need to details of

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.440 
you don't really need to details of
instructions<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.760> they<00:02:26.820> show<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.030> pictures

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
instructions and they show you pictures

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.790 
instructions and they show you pictures
as<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.690> where<00:02:27.840> they<00:02:27.960> attach<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.500> control

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
as to where they attach to the control

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.180 
as to where they attach to the control
arms<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:29.850> should<00:02:30.360> be<00:02:30.540> more<00:02:30.750> than<00:02:30.810> enough

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
arms so that should be more than enough

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.030 
arms so that should be more than enough
again<00:02:32.190> installation<00:02:32.820> fairly<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.890> then<00:02:35.010> I

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.550 
just wanted to show you the other duct
as<00:02:37.770> well<00:02:38.210> pretty<00:02:39.210> much<00:02:39.330> identical<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
as well pretty much identical to the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.340 
as well pretty much identical to the
other<00:02:40.680> one<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:40.920> far<00:02:41.070> as<00:02:41.190> construction<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.540> on

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
other one as far as construction and on

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.510 
other one as far as construction and on
this<00:02:43.560> another<00:02:43.860> thing<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.130> wanted<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.459> mention

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
this another thing I wanted to mention

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.860 
this another thing I wanted to mention
was<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.880> weight<00:02:45.180> when<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.480> pick<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.810> thing

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
was the weight when you pick this thing

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.690 
was the weight when you pick this thing
up<00:02:46.080> i<00:02:46.200> mean<00:02:46.350> almost<00:02:46.590> weighs<00:02:46.950> nothing<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.640> you

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
up i mean almost weighs nothing and you

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.130 
up i mean almost weighs nothing and you
can<00:02:47.880> tell<00:02:48.180> where<00:02:48.480> most<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.810> weight<00:02:48.990> is

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
can tell where most of the weight is

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.350 
can tell where most of the weight is
coming<00:02:49.410> from<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.830> this<00:02:50.580> big<00:02:50.790> washer<00:02:51.030> right

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
here you can see that going from the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.540 
here you can see that going from the
front<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.940> back<00:02:54.060> i'm<00:02:54.959> in<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.740> these
