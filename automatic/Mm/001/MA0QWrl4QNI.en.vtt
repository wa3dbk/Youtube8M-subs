00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.629
 hello friends is again your friend Juan caves and greetings to all 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.049
 adventurers in lima peru 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.189
 in this video I want to show you how to draw a propeller 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.879
 the expert who led from the work I had to do 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.289
 efe scientists min these areas are relatively easy 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.519
 if we have a plan a lover where they are not in the middle of the axes 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.860
 maiolino including the radios to make things easier 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.020
 p also edil wanted to accept the treatment of an elite I know many traces of 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.930
 agreement where the strings are explained with two points called little 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.890
 i with a pencil we embark making or tuning the strings results 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040
 relatively easy 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.090
 but it happens when we do not have any of these data and we only have 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.800
 the lies of the major and minor axes 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.190
 no country and that complicates the thing 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.760
 sometimes I have a client who has told him and without any plan or indirect 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.290
 and filming 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.850
 he told me that 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.280
 what 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.359
 if you want me to design you start tickets for example in 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.900
 determined if the traces 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.190
 I only fear the media of the club higher and lower as much more 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.290
 in the figure 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.290
 so here he explained how to do in these cases 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.670
 well first of all this is public in the middle of the sky hill after 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.810
 both axes 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.229
 I keep looking at the ground so they can raise their rails I would do it on 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.520
 the plan is focused on bolus that is easier 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.080
 quintana template 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.990
 then trace the raw zárate tracking that measures 0 points 80 to the meter or 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.200
 be 60 centimeters 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.950
 in the middle or doing interest center bonuses indicated a distance of 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.580
 two points 2 75 meters or two meters 27 centimeters 15 5 millimeters 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.829
 it is a small curve 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:26.019
 He also accepted by making us a pledge and with a distance of two points 3 58 or 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.159
 be two meters 25 centimeters 2008 millimeters 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.659
 trajan another small curve 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.659
 originating the point p 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.659
 Now it's the same 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.859
 the points ap p 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.089
 dyn as shown in the fly 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.799
 step followed 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.799
 we draw the percent cement 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:59.459
 and then doing it in front and with a distance of one meter 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.109
 we also draw a small curve 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.379
 also the same 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.269
 from the percent point 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.699
 another curve was finished at a distance of one meter 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:16.539
 As you can see, it originated with a new point called efe 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.539
 We could point d with seven 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:26.519
 and has originated another point called g now 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.800
 the team feels impotent g 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.719
 with our province 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:36.819
 i tried the ph cement that is going to be the same i left 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:39.639
 step followed 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.969
 figures are vintage cleaning that from g 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:49.389
 what will happen to faes and same to age fiscal at this point i 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.319
 as the picture shows 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.329
 by the way there is 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.109
 then doing educational center I love them a curve 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.109
 lightning is the cement says 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.249
 also as it is shown safe 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:07.769
 so 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.089
 also getting trained 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.369
 we trace after curve 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:15.739
 the ray is hg 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.579
 so far we have drawn in the middle of the elite 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.440
 now and even last steps that only 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:25.870
 with more intensity 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.889
 if we stop plotting to choose the same apoquindo and thus we face 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.289
 after paying penultimate curve 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.059
 I love them ok the directive act h 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:41.000
 and so in the centers 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.789
 the grandmothers was final four 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.240
 as my bolero lovers see 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.840
 a perfect ellipse has been created 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.770
 was with talks you get to perfect it even though I work for 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.770
 design he says he does not come out all the time 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.229
 to finish some recommendations 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.220
 the measure is that it was initially bone zero points 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.960
 genta 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.240
 2 points 2 75 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.529
 2 a continuous process 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:11.779
 may vary 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:16.789
 circumstances can put some points 24 points 55 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:20.339
 another point if there is 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:21.280
 eleven 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.550
 g shakira has multiplied by two to each 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.680
 Jorge Estevez to have criteria 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.120
 by juan riquelme discards for export if you like sport 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.659
 port 4 as a dessert 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.939
 messi who broke says in the text struck out four 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:43.369
 because sometimes they send us to make the disc is very big gálvez petersen 

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:44.830
 approach 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.650
 in terms of recommendations of what 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.259
 percent and so you use the average is one meter to do it transport c 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:06:01.459
 exists efe can also be of any measure for example 80 

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:04.659
 centimeters 3 as it convinces you 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:07.639
 not always the three equal 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.919
 good is that he finished 7 the actress advised to practice it 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.809
 if it is possible to adapt it is done before executing it in the work 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:17.809
 this to me I regret 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:19.129
 soon fritzl
