00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
notebook and taped them on and cut them

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.370 
notebook and taped them on and cut them
to<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> appropriate<00:02:06.180> length<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:07.170> just

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
to the appropriate length and I just

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.389

made<00:02:07.500> sure<00:02:07.530> they<00:02:07.770> shaped<00:02:08.009> around<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
made sure they shaped around the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.830 
made sure they shaped around the
