 ruth reuters basic will allow you to 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:08.050
 will allow you to check if your cell tissue 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:13.250
 is rooted or not blocked and 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.640
 supervisor that will allow you this 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.760
 will allow 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.250
 you will be allowed to open the applications 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.979
 who can not know how to open 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:30.280
 applications since they are surrounded ok me 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:34.950
 I will teach you first what you should 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.159
 do is the root drama there is in root form 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.450
 a button will appear an option that says 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.840
 boromir must give them there 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.340
 I already gave that to disappear to this 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:54.090
 text you should give in ok already 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.750
 once they have given him they go to the clock 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.750
 principal 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:06.820
 and with that give in the turn off button 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.340
 and should give him a restart in my case 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.920
 I can not because the truth is 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.620
 making the video recording the screen and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.500
 If you do not restart, the video will be canceled 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.750
 must give a restart they must wait for 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:28.120
 that turned off very well because it went out 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:33.160
 now you should see how later 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:37.450
 of that they must learn again the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.450
 alone the phone once once 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.540
 that is 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.709
 that you have already given to restart and you 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.709
 have your cell phone turned on 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.110
 this is going to give you an announcement that you 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.360
 they should give him in allowing he should not be 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.940
 of giving he should give us another option more 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.780
 that allow you have to click on 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.709
 allow once this will take some 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:10.299
 like two minutes and your phone is already 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:13.340

 applications that were that are surrounded 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:52.490

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:17.049

 to press the volume button below 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.020
 to lower the volume you have to apply 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:27.190
 this to him and they have to oppress the 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.889
 button to turn on or off and at the same 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.120
 time once they have done this already 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:37.080
