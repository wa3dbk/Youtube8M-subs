Yeller horn the Best Exotic in the game

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.580 
Yeller horn the Best Exotic in the game
I<00:03:06.280> think<00:03:06.969> it<00:03:07.090> gives<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.449> a<00:03:07.569> very<00:03:07.599> very<00:03:08.319> high

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
I think it gives it a very very high

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.289 
I think it gives it a very very high
chance<00:03:08.919> of<00:03:09.099> making<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.609> best<00:03:09.790> exotic<00:03:10.060> in

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
thoughts on the yellow horn being the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.439 
thoughts on the yellow horn being the
best<00:04:02.829> exotic<00:04:03.129> in<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.430> game<00:04:03.609> if<00:04:03.790> you<00:04:04.359> are

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
best exotic in the game if you are

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.259 
best exotic in the game if you are
comfortable<00:04:04.750> with<00:04:05.169> your<00:04:05.379> two<00:04:05.590> primaries<00:04:06.269> your

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
comfortable with your two primaries your

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.899 
comfortable with your two primaries your
primary<00:04:07.689> and<00:04:07.810> your<00:04:07.900> secondary<00:04:08.609> you're<00:04:09.609> really

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
primary and your secondary you're really

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.610 
primary and your secondary you're really
not<00:04:10.000> going<00:04:10.209> to<00:04:10.299> find<00:04:10.479> a<00:04:10.599> better<00:04:10.750> heavy<00:04:11.019> exotic

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
not going to find a better heavy exotic

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.330 
not going to find a better heavy exotic
now<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.459> changes<00:04:13.329> that<00:04:13.750> are<00:04:13.959> coming<00:04:14.079> up<00:04:14.560> may

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
now the changes that are coming up may

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.219 
now the changes that are coming up may
make<00:04:15.759> that<00:04:15.969> different<00:04:16.389> now<00:04:16.570> some<00:04:16.870> people<00:04:16.989> have

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
make that different now some people have

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.870 
make that different now some people have
contended<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:17.739> perhaps<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.250> Thunder<00:04:18.639> Lord

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
contended that perhaps the Thunder Lord

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.599 
contended that perhaps the Thunder Lord
is<00:04:19.090> better<00:04:19.539> than<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.870> Yeller<00:04:20.109> horn<00:04:20.609> because

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
is better than the Yeller horn because

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.790 
is better than the Yeller horn because
you<00:04:21.760> can<00:04:21.880> do<00:04:21.969> the<00:04:22.120> same<00:04:22.150> damage<00:04:22.690> per<00:04:23.199> clip<00:04:23.529> on<00:04:23.740> a

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
you can do the same damage per clip on a

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.430 
you can do the same damage per clip on a
Theon<00:04:24.279> so<00:04:24.940> what<00:04:25.180> that<00:04:25.210> really<00:04:25.570> boils<00:04:25.990> down<00:04:26.080> to

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
Theon so what that really boils down to

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.220 
Theon so what that really boils down to
at<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.770> end

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
at the end

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.040 
at the end
is<00:04:27.610> which<00:04:28.610> one<00:04:28.910> does<00:04:29.390> the<00:04:29.540> most<00:04:29.720> amount<00:04:29.930> of

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
is which one does the most amount of

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.320 
is which one does the most amount of
damage<00:04:30.440> at<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.890> higher<00:04:31.160> rate<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:31.880> that<00:04:32.240> is

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
damage at a higher rate and that is

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.240 
damage at a higher rate and that is
obviously<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.840> Yeller<00:04:33.110> horn<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.560> can't<00:04:33.800> PK

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
obviously the Yeller horn you can't PK

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.700 
obviously the Yeller horn you can't PK
Theon<00:04:34.580> for<00:04:34.850> that<00:04:35.000> long<00:04:35.230> without<00:04:36.230> getting<00:04:36.620> your

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
Theon for that long without getting your

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.550 
Theon for that long without getting your
face<00:04:36.980> blown<00:04:37.310> off<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:38.080> if<00:04:39.080> you're<00:04:39.230> trying<00:04:39.440> to

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
face blown off and if you're trying to

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.820 
face blown off and if you're trying to
take<00:04:39.740> them<00:04:39.920> out<00:04:40.070> as<00:04:40.250> fast<00:04:40.550> as<00:04:40.790> possible<00:04:41.830> well

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
take them out as fast as possible well

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.340 
take them out as fast as possible well
of<00:04:43.010> course<00:04:43.600> you're<00:04:44.600> going<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.810> have<00:04:44.960> yourself

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
of course you're going to have yourself

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.260 
of course you're going to have yourself
a<00:04:45.410> better<00:04:45.590> time<00:04:45.890> with<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.640> Yeller<00:04:46.880> horner

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
a better time with the Yeller horner

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.110 
a better time with the Yeller horner
these<00:04:47.690> are<00:04:47.870> just<00:04:48.080> my<00:04:48.200> thoughts<00:04:48.620> for<00:04:49.160> now<00:04:49.310> there

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
these are just my thoughts for now there

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.550 
these are just my thoughts for now there
are<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.300> few<00:04:50.480> other<00:04:50.690> exotics<00:04:51.260> that<00:04:51.410> make<00:04:51.530> a

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
are a few other exotics that make a

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.460 
are a few other exotics that make a
strong<00:04:52.040> contention<00:04:52.610> for<00:04:52.910> Best<00:04:53.720> Exotic<00:04:53.930> in<00:04:54.380> the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
strong contention for Best Exotic in the

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.200 
strong contention for Best Exotic in the
game<00:04:54.650> you<00:04:55.400> have<00:04:55.550> things<00:04:55.790> like<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.090> ice

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
game you have things like the ice

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.120 
game you have things like the ice
breaker<00:04:56.630> or<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.230> patients<00:04:57.650> in<00:04:57.710> time<00:04:57.950> we're

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
breaker or the patients in time we're

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.350 
breaker or the patients in time we're
the<00:04:58.220> Thunder<00:04:58.520> Lord<00:04:58.700> which<00:04:58.820> is<00:04:58.940> brought<00:04:59.090> up<00:04:59.270> or

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
the Thunder Lord which is brought up or

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.660 
the Thunder Lord which is brought up or
even<00:04:59.450> perhaps<00:05:00.260> after<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.860> balance<00:05:01.280> the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
even perhaps after the balance the

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.430 
even perhaps after the balance the
things<00:05:01.940> like<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.420> juju<00:05:02.810> might<00:05:03.050> turn<00:05:03.290> into

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
things like the juju might turn into

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.530 
things like the juju might turn into
some<00:05:03.830> sort<00:05:04.010> of<00:05:04.130> broken<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.850> death<00:05:05.060> piece<00:05:05.360> of
