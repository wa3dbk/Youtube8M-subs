00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.490
 alstom butte 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.609
 she considers that I passed 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.099
 I'm not giving you a scoop 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.939
 ok if you are looking at 1 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.079
 a basic tutorial advise you 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.079
 the excellent 974 network soccer channel 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.050
 and I'm going to 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.580
 presented by donation now 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.410
 the goals of our channel 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.879
 so what you need to know is that I want 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.570
 presents an adventure 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.030
 so these adventures of guernica 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.240
 so I landed in this world 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.130
 we do not really know how 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.130
 also a goal save two become kings of this world 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.540
 then we explain to you 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.070
 it's going to be a server I want to create 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.360
 but rather than create the world on my side and swing without age limit 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.539
 before michael little adventurers started from scratch for such a beautiful 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.630
 no rise saint denis 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.990
 no None 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.729
 that's what you need to know is that 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.700
 it does not have to be the one we can roll in class on this holiday 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.900
 enemy attacks 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.070
 having the king or by robin we must protect ourselves for tonight 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.280
 so that bassima more than I discover the backstage and the two engineers 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.750
 so we'll come back to the good old little ball 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.150
 ie this woman confesses for the night 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.220
 good the same if not school tutorials explain a little bit what I do 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.880
 bolt doing it 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.420
 mass percentage a little bit of weight for 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.420
 make the teams based at the workshop 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.250
 I used to always do better but a makeshift shelter 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.200
 in the stone 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.000
 anyway because these stressed cuban 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.830
 as of the firm 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.830
 on a little cloud it does not hurt 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.840
 then the picture 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.810
 it is to describe 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.980
 the Kurds who will allow us 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.980
 to do 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.249
 short for everyone but there we will settle 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.359
 so I have an idea about this channel watching the other channels and 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.989
 watson was critical how is written by the French community and I 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.589
 think that in one more adventure and can not hurt to put between 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.589
 opposite 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.679
 what am I going to do a name 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.909
 should I do a small workshop which classic 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.909
 planks 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.159
 3 well his business 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.109
 not very fan of tools 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.109
 wooden but good 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.769
 here is a nice little thing 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.769
 a portion of the circuit 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.889
 gourmandine euros 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.019
 so him from the first day this chamber hole 9 it takes above all that everything 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.599
 made for 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.599
 in doubt 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.070
 so took place 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.159
 having followed tutorials 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.129
 tazio elephants you may have noticed that he 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.119
 a lot of things that he was also at the beginning 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.119
 which proves once again that his mixed troupe 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.759
 a precious chambon shows much more than before 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.129
 much more 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.749
 so here's the ideal if the most the coal hole trust that torches and one 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:43.749
 is not in the dark 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.270
 so he does not play a little bit of the world that I want to create so amazed 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.270
 from this ascendant line 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.319
 despite himself to finish at the top of a world 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.629
 built under the sole more or less hot 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.080
 we will have a castle at work 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.889
 I also want to take something from me 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.249
 the hair the painting 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.249
 we do not have too much for me 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.990
 tube it will be built with you sustainable shape is possible underlined 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.900
 the agent all different types 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.879
 a little bit 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.969
 so there no worry all my love for us it's all good 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.719
 the glove space a montage 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:59.559
 is not it a shelter shyly 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.690
 my little bit of stone so the advantage in doing worse is that inevitably we 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:08.969
 recovers a few resources 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.840
 for those who will allow us any kind of chardy 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.259
 stone tools 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:15.979
 while stuffing himself this time in raw and for him so 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.979
 but also all levels 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.710
 people6 a few small 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.759
 yet this feeling 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.210
 security 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.210
 ammann 29 security 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.900
 so flying even small makeshift shelters it's not good 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.930
 but we will immediately shouted 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:54.770
 more than a continuous shop of the building 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.770
 in rousseau county 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:02.449
 someone cost us 

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:15.069
 when I also have the habit 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:18.759
 they will be able to enjoy 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:26.689
 for me the night begins to fall and I have little full time 

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:29.770
 came to present the outline of the year 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.770
 anyone involved to find in a future video 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.039
 But you must know that patrick courage more immediately 

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:44.039
 the sun begins to go down bad little bit so that the words of m 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.699
 courageous patrick 

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:51.830
 for my mother is taking place this video is all to their delight
