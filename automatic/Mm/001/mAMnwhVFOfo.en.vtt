frontcourt ball is deemed in the

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.759 
frontcourt ball is deemed in the
frontcourt<00:04:07.910> but<00:04:08.910> if<00:04:09.750> they<00:04:10.139> still<00:04:10.350> have<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:10.500> foot

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
frontcourt but if they still have a foot

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.620 
frontcourt but if they still have a foot
in<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:10.889> back<00:04:10.920> court<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.819> ball<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.060> not<00:04:12.389> deemed

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
in the back court the ball is not deemed

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.110 
in the back court the ball is not deemed
to<00:04:12.840> actually<00:04:13.260> go<00:04:13.380> on<00:04:13.470> into<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.799> front<00:04:13.980> court

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
to actually go on into the front court

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.240 
to actually go on into the front court
so<00:04:15.200> technically<00:04:16.200> it's<00:04:16.530> not<00:04:16.590> cross<00:04:16.919> court

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
so technically it's not cross court

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.190 
so technically it's not cross court
because<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:17.729> ball<00:04:17.910> can't<00:04:18.239> have<00:04:18.389> crossed<00:04:18.690> from

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
because the ball can't have crossed from

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.629 
because the ball can't have crossed from
the<00:04:19.350> back<00:04:19.500> court<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.039> front<00:04:20.250> court<00:04:20.459> and

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
the back court to the front court and

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:21.949 
the back court to the front court and
back<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.000> back<00:04:21.120> court<00:04:21.390> if<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.690> hasn't<00:04:21.930> even

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959

was<00:05:54.560> just<00:05:54.770> go<00:05:54.949> and<00:05:55.099> they're<00:05:55.219> like<00:05:55.340> oh<00:05:55.490> yeah

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
was just go and they're like oh yeah

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.249 
was just go and they're like oh yeah
that's<00:05:56.060> how<00:05:56.210> it<00:05:56.270> goes<00:05:56.479> actually<00:05:56.930> it's<00:05:57.080> like

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
that's how it goes actually it's like

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:59.560 
that's how it goes actually it's like
this<00:05:57.530> so<00:05:58.009> I<00:05:58.340> realized<00:05:58.880> then<00:05:59.120> because<00:05:59.449> they

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
this so I realized then because they

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.700 
this so I realized then because they
explained<00:05:59.960> oh<00:06:00.110> yeah<00:06:00.289> it's<00:06:00.440> in<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:00.530> eighth

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
explained oh yeah it's in the eighth

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.709 
explained oh yeah it's in the eighth
second<00:06:01.159> section<00:06:01.550> because<00:06:01.909> the<00:06:02.090> eight-second

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:02.719 
second section because the eight-second

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:04.450 
second section because the eight-second
violation<00:06:02.900> said<00:06:03.710> that<00:06:03.889> you<00:06:03.979> can<00:06:04.130> only<00:06:04.219> have

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
violation said that you can only have

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.920 
violation said that you can only have
the<00:06:04.639> ball<00:06:04.789> in<00:06:05.000> your<00:06:05.060> back<00:06:05.389> court<00:06:05.690> for<00:06:05.840> eight

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
the ball in your back court for eight

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.370 
the ball in your back court for eight
seconds<00:06:06.550> so<00:06:07.550> it<00:06:07.849> needed<00:06:08.330> to<00:06:08.479> determine<00:06:08.960> when

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
seconds so it needed to determine when

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.839 
seconds so it needed to determine when
you<00:06:09.530> get<00:06:09.710> in<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:09.889> front<00:06:10.070> court<00:06:10.340> that's<00:06:10.550> why<00:06:10.789> it

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
you get in the front court that's why it

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.110 
you get in the front court that's why it
said<00:06:11.620> you<00:06:12.620> know<00:06:12.770> three<00:06:13.759> points<00:06:14.030> of<00:06:14.060> contact

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120
