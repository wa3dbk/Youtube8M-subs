00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.520
 lunar center of being good is one of my 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.439
 favorite series of childhood 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:35.129

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.059
 much doing other types of designs the 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:42.629
 nervous reaction so please this 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.579
 do not do it in their homes is something that is 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.190
 something that they really believe that they have the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.590
 ability for your output well using 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.750
 the corresponding elements and everything from 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.809
 very professional way welcome to 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.880
 this video and let's move on to Carlos 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.580
 on 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.510
 it will be a dance to take courage so that 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.510
 do not hurt the tattoo 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.190
 grandma who does not hurt vicky 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.520
 I'm messing with not having a 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.240
 assistant at this time because if I 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.700
 I faint because I'm going to apply a 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.670
 product we are going to apply it can be in 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.110
 our hands or can be directly to 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.670
 skin like this is a very upset 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.590
 little one does not need just a little bit of 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.860
 this product then we're going to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.860
 apply in the sector where in theory 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.450
 would say 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.830
 this to work the life of the worker 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.050
 as the complicated part of treating the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.270
 sky of a tattoo car stinging alone 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.830
 but well let's do what we can and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.320
 let's put speed 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.400
 let's start by schedule what I 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.270
 it's more comfortable because this is 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.270
 totally disastrous 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.830
 the fire that was a little bit more to my 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.690
 clients when they tell me that it has not been 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:53.850
 loyal and I think it is not hurting me not 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:57.320
 is to say the thing but not in fact the 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.320
 posta decided well success 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.650
 It's good as it was a little 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.370
 irritated is my skin is half fag 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.370
 and the lines with a needle of 7 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.930
 then it 's a kind of power line what 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.240
 means to go through again 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.150
 side and thicken the 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.760
 and not only is it a little bit good to see if 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.480
 we can give 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.629
 power of moonlight that allows 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.629
 finish 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:32.330
 there are some magazines that sell with poster 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:35.300
 for the time 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.840
 the truth that if I was a victim of bowling 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:43.480
 Bowling was a victim when I went to 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.480
 school once and then 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:55.769
 really but 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.440
 I took it hooked to the cart of the 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.130
 backpack for god goodbye forever with 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.790
 reason that of the groom 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.790
 hundred thousand 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.140
 question 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.840
 is that good as a child with my cart 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.810
 always exploiting that he was going to be able 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.359
 be a kind of superhero 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.930
 Caesar has had because he finds out about 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.799
 zÃ¡rate 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.530
 still 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.240
 in Buenos Aires most of my 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.000
 life already studies that I consider myself a 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.030
 series 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.120
 because he came back from school one day 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.290
 sunny 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.910
 and there was not difficult the vote squirt 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.139
 that steals a lady that leads to 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.969
 will summon on the motorcycle 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.270
 and I said this is my time to act 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.310
 as lord slaves 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.580
 not the balls asia guy that give him the 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.580
 disk 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.660
 and I want like 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:00.710
 and we forget 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.710
 and our beloved in you fixate 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.700
 Well I could not save her, sir 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.490
 and motorcycles went with a stonemason 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.310
 the move 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.610
 well I wanted to comment on this 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.610
 to Rome 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.610
 This is a tattoo that I made when 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.220
 I finished the faculty of reaching my thesis 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.860
 and I really did not find the strength to 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.410
 making the base always proposed something 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.080
 happened and I said that we did not deserve a click 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.789
 and to hear the story of the luma that 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.080

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.020

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.860
 far what I heard what I 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:43.789
 I found out about it 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.669
 the monk is supposed to meditate 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:50.419
 a lot of time and from so much meditating he stayed 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:53.129
 no arms and no legs and that's why 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.729
 like an egg 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:59.939
 they are good aires 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:02.510

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:08.770
