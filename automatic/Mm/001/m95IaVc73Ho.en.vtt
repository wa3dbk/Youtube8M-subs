00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.650 
as well as the grips more the carbon
fiber<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.580> same<00:02:40.790> on<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.030> other<00:02:41.060> side<00:02:41.239> just

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
fiber the same on the other side just

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.860 
fiber the same on the other side just
want<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.930> show<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.350> you

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
want to show it to you

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.509 
want to show it to you
you<00:02:43.830> didn't<00:02:44.519> know<00:02:44.670> what<00:02:44.940> kind<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.299> bike<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:45.840> is

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
you didn't know what kind of bike it is

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.539 
you didn't know what kind of bike it is
1098<00:02:47.870> more<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.080> carbon<00:02:49.409> fiber<00:02:49.799> over<00:02:50.129> here

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
1098 more of that carbon fiber over here

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.160 
1098 more of that carbon fiber over here
as<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.209> see<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.599> other<00:02:51.720> side<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.049> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
as you can see the other side of the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.490 
as you can see the other side of the
seat<00:02:52.650> still<00:02:53.640> free<00:02:53.909> of<00:02:54.030> all<00:02:54.120> rips<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.540> tears

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.740 

cool<00:02:58.500> thing<00:02:58.680> about<00:02:58.799> this<00:02:59.099> there's<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.750> more

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
cool thing about this there's the more

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.170 
cool thing about this there's the more
carbon<00:03:01.170> fiber<00:03:01.379> here<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.040> then<00:03:02.220> here<00:03:02.489> very

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
carbon fiber here and then here very

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.030 
carbon fiber here and then here very
cool<00:03:03.569> it's<00:03:03.870> got<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.140> single-sided<00:03:04.590> swingarm

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
cool it's got the single-sided swingarm

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.460 
cool it's got the single-sided swingarm
which<00:03:05.280> comes<00:03:05.489> stock<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:05.940> those<00:03:06.230> get<00:03:07.230> another

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
which comes stock on those get another

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:17.070 
which comes stock on those get another
shot<00:03:07.799> of<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.010> exhaust<00:03:10.129> that<00:03:11.129> is<00:03:11.310> wrapped

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.380 

other<00:03:17.770> side<00:03:17.980> of<00:03:18.010> this<00:03:18.190> tank<00:03:18.490> still<00:03:18.970> free<00:03:19.270> of

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
other side of this tank still free of

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.540 
other side of this tank still free of
all<00:03:19.480> dings<00:03:19.840> dents<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.440> chips<00:03:20.680> let's<00:03:21.400> at<00:03:21.520> least

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
all dings dents and chips let's at least

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.090 
all dings dents and chips let's at least
turn<00:03:21.820> it<00:03:21.970> on<00:03:22.060> so<00:03:22.270> you<00:03:22.360> can<00:03:22.420> see<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:23.130> boom<00:03:24.870> 15,000

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
turn it on so you can see it boom 15,000

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:35.400 
turn it on so you can see it boom 15,000
37<00:03:27.100> miles<00:03:27.280> on<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.640> so<00:03:28.920> it's<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.980> 1098<00:03:31.200> racing<00:03:34.410> so

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
37 miles on it so it's a 1098 racing so

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
37 miles on it so it's a 1098 racing so
I'm<00:03:35.470> going<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.680> put<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:35.890> camera<00:03:36.190> down<00:03:36.220> and

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
I'm going to put the camera down and

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.250 
I'm going to put the camera down and
start<00:03:36.670> this<00:03:36.790> guy<00:03:36.970> up<00:03:37.150> she's<00:03:37.360> pretty<00:03:37.630> noisy<00:03:37.810> so

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
start this guy up she's pretty noisy so

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.350 
start this guy up she's pretty noisy so
I'll<00:03:38.380> walk<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.250> around<00:03:39.490> and<00:03:39.880> tell<00:03:40.240> you<00:03:40.330> a

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
I'll walk it around and tell you a

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.420 
I'll walk it around and tell you a
little<00:03:40.510> bit<00:03:40.600> about<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:40.930> there<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.650> also<00:03:42.010> some

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
little bit about it there is also some

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.630 
little bit about it there is also some
carbon<00:03:42.760> fiber<00:03:42.970> back<00:03:43.240> here<00:03:43.540> as<00:03:43.660> well<00:03:44.490> so<00:03:45.490> here

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
carbon fiber back here as well so here

00:03:45.640 --> 00:04:43.920 
carbon fiber back here as well so here
we<00:03:45.670> go

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.740 

as<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:44.530> can<00:04:44.680> hear<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:45.240> open<00:04:46.240> clutch<00:04:46.479> there

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
as you can hear that open clutch there

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.460 
as you can hear that open clutch there
is<00:04:47.139> very<00:04:47.530> noisy<00:04:48.600> gives<00:04:49.600> it<00:04:49.750> that<00:04:49.780> distinct

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
is very noisy gives it that distinct

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.710 
is very noisy gives it that distinct
sound<00:04:50.770> and<00:04:51.009> that<00:04:51.130> exhaust<00:04:51.729> is<00:04:52.000> very<00:04:52.240> loud<00:04:52.509> as

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
sound and that exhaust is very loud as

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.040 
sound and that exhaust is very loud as
well<00:04:52.960> this<00:04:53.710> bike<00:04:54.009> is<00:04:54.190> very<00:04:54.940> sharp<00:04:55.330> very<00:04:55.720> cool

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
well this bike is very sharp very cool

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.110 
well this bike is very sharp very cool
