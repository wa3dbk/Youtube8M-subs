many fixed-blade reviews but recently
I've<00:00:10.160> got<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> few<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.550> them<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.380> this<00:00:13.380> one

I've got a few of them in so this one

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.849 
I've got a few of them in so this one
here<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:15.139> cold<00:00:16.139> steel<00:00:16.470> condo<00:00:17.310> -<00:00:17.609> and

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
here and is a cold steel condo - and

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.130 
here and is a cold steel condo - and
this<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> sort<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.449> wasn't<00:00:21.750> was<00:00:21.960> like

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
this is a sort of a this wasn't was like

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.480 
this is a sort of a this wasn't was like
what<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.439> expected<00:00:22.740> when<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.070> saw<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.310> knife

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
what I expected when I saw this knife

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.560 
what I expected when I saw this knife
handles<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> lot<00:00:24.359> thinner<00:00:24.600> than<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.960> thought<00:00:25.550> and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
handles a lot thinner than I thought and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.019 
handles a lot thinner than I thought and
the<00:00:27.570> they<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.439> handle<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.519> or<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> knife

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the they have handle this or the knife

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.970 
the they have handle this or the knife
blade<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> lot<00:00:30.900> proportionally<00:00:31.619> larger

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
blade is a lot proportionally larger

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.680 
blade is a lot proportionally larger
than<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> handle<00:00:32.610> let<00:00:32.790> me<00:00:32.969> pull<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.450> here

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
than the handle let me pull it up here

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.530 
than the handle let me pull it up here
so<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.870> get<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> chance<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.420> it's<00:00:36.420> got

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
so I can get a chance to see it it's got

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.030 
so I can get a chance to see it it's got
a<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.750> nice<00:00:36.930> mirror<00:00:37.260> finish<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.860> but

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
a really nice mirror finish on it but

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.600 
a really nice mirror finish on it but
the<00:00:38.250> handle<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:39.170> extremely<00:00:40.170> thin<00:00:40.469> there's<00:00:41.340> no

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the handle is extremely thin there's no

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.260 
the handle is extremely thin there's no
guard

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
guard

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.900 
guard
so<00:00:42.660> using<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.590> knife<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.489> an<00:00:44.670> easy<00:00:44.789> thing

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so using this knife is not an easy thing

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.430 
so using this knife is not an easy thing
because<00:00:45.180> your<00:00:45.420> head<00:00:45.510> could<00:00:45.660> slide<00:00:46.020> up<00:00:46.200> if<00:00:46.320> you

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
because your head could slide up if you

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.860 
because your head could slide up if you
penetrated<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.879> head<00:00:48.000> could<00:00:48.180> slide<00:00:48.539> up<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
penetrated your head could slide up and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.240 
penetrated your head could slide up and
you<00:00:48.930> cut<00:00:49.170> yourself<00:00:49.289> quite<00:00:49.710> easily<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.160> this

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
you cut yourself quite easily with this

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.290 
you cut yourself quite easily with this
knife<00:00:51.829> look<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> brass<00:00:53.460> hibachi<00:00:53.910> here

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
knife look at the brass hibachi here

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.900 
knife look at the brass hibachi here

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
about it see it's

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.279 
about it see it's
each<00:01:28.999> tier<00:01:29.450> condo<00:01:30.079> two<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:31.100> get<00:01:31.280> two<00:01:32.289> condo

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289

two<00:01:33.530> semi<00:01:34.130> three<00:01:35.259> and<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:37.399> sake<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.710> satin

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.949 
two semi three and the sake is a satin
finish<00:01:40.369> while<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.179> rest<00:01:41.359> of<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.569> blade<00:01:41.750> is<00:01:41.929> a

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
finish while the rest of the blade is a

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.330 
finish while the rest of the blade is a
mirror<00:01:42.200> finish<00:01:42.289> which<00:01:42.590> is<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:42.920> thought<00:01:43.100> it's<00:01:43.280> a

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
mirror finish which is I thought it's a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.149 
mirror finish which is I thought it's a
really<00:01:43.549> nice<00:01:43.670> touch<00:01:43.909> actually<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:45.200> like<00:01:45.920> the

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
really nice touch actually I like the

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.219 
really nice touch actually I like the
Torx<00:01:46.819> screws<00:01:47.119> holding<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.569> handles<00:01:47.899> in<00:01:48.020> there

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
Torx screws holding the handles in there

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.199 
Torx screws holding the handles in there
I'm<00:01:48.500> not<00:01:48.709> sure<00:01:48.770> if<00:01:49.039> they'll<00:01:49.369> come<00:01:49.670> off<00:01:49.880> if<00:01:50.090> you

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.209 
I'm not sure if they'll come off if you

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:51.609 
I'm not sure if they'll come off if you
remove<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.630> Torx<00:01:50.840> screws<00:01:51.170> or<00:01:51.409> if<00:01:51.469> they're

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
remove the Torx screws or if they're

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:52.839 
remove the Torx screws or if they're
epoxy<00:01:52.099> din<00:01:52.250> as<00:01:52.399> well

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:52.849 
epoxy din as well

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:54.630 
epoxy din as well
I<00:01:52.880> thought<00:01:53.479> those<00:01:53.659> are<00:01:53.840> kind<00:01:54.049> of<00:01:54.109> cool<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.469> you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
I thought those are kind of cool to you

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.380 
I thought those are kind of cool to you
generally<00:01:55.640> speaking<00:01:55.939> I<00:01:56.030> think<00:01:56.060> this<00:01:56.270> is<00:01:56.359> a

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
generally speaking I think this is a

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.600 
generally speaking I think this is a
really<00:01:56.630> nice<00:01:56.810> looking<00:01:57.079> knife<00:01:57.319> um<00:01:58.009> a<00:01:59.890> very<00:02:00.890> cool

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.709 

she's<00:02:04.610> sort<00:02:04.789> of<00:02:04.849> a<00:02:04.939> really<00:02:05.239> cool<00:02:05.450> looking

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
she's sort of a really cool looking

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.959 
she's sort of a really cool looking
knife<00:02:05.959> nice<00:02:06.649> collector's<00:02:07.129> knife<00:02:07.310> it's<00:02:07.759> nice

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
knife nice collector's knife it's nice

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.110 
knife nice collector's knife it's nice
to<00:02:08.119> have<00:02:08.269> it<00:02:08.420> on<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:09.310> on<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.519> display<00:02:10.879> case

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
to have it on the on the display case

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.229 
to have it on the on the display case
but<00:02:11.480> it's<00:02:12.079> not<00:02:12.640> necessarily<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.819> most<00:02:13.940> useful

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
but it's not necessarily the most useful

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.650 
but it's not necessarily the most useful

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
horizontal draw a little bit more than a

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.629 
horizontal draw a little bit more than a
