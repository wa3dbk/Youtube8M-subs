season yet and to Brian it seems is a

didn't<00:01:04.559> quite<00:01:04.739> pull<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.040> off<00:01:05.129> at<00:01:05.250> Chelsea<00:01:05.610> when

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
didn't quite pull it off at Chelsea when

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.399 
didn't quite pull it off at Chelsea when
he<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:05.939> there<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.450> maybe<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.840> got<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.320> in

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
he was there so maybe we got there in

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.260 
he was there so maybe we got there in
the<00:01:07.470> prone<00:01:07.680> area<00:01:07.950> that's<00:01:08.520> faster<00:01:08.909> question<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the prone area that's faster question is

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.850 
the prone area that's faster question is
it<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.840> he<00:01:09.930> do<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.290> Premier<00:01:10.560> League<00:01:10.590> so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it can he do it in the Premier League so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.609 
it can he do it in the Premier League so
he's<00:01:10.979> probably<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.520> worth<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> money<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.840> all

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
he's probably is worth the money but all

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.780 
he's probably is worth the money but all
these<00:01:13.799> Chelsea<00:01:14.130> found<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> same<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.610> don't

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
these Chelsea found the same we don't

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.890 
these Chelsea found the same we don't
want<00:01:14.939> him<00:01:15.030> back<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.450> want<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> bring<00:01:15.810> her

want him back we don't want to bring her
back<00:01:16.049> if<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.740> missed<00:01:16.979> something<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.119> is

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
back if we missed something is it is

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.780 
back if we missed something is it is
that<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.630> his<00:01:18.869> attitude<00:01:18.990> maybe<00:01:19.680> or<00:01:20.130> maybe<00:01:20.580> it's

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
that is his attitude maybe or maybe it's

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.580 
that is his attitude maybe or maybe it's
just<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.270> was<00:01:21.390> too<00:01:21.659> soon<00:01:22.020> that's<00:01:22.380> what

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
just that it was too soon that's what

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.590 
just that it was too soon that's what
I'm<00:01:22.950> hoping<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.909> was<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.119> too<00:01:24.360> soon

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
I'm hoping that it was just too soon

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.719 
I'm hoping that it was just too soon
yeah<00:01:24.900> i<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.500> was<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:26.009> 19<00:01:26.549> when<00:01:26.580> he

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
yeah i think it was it was 19 when he

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.490 
yeah i think it was it was 19 when he
was<00:01:26.850> at<00:01:26.939> chelsea<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.570> has<00:01:27.689> time<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.229> away

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
was at chelsea it has time to go away

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.440 
was at chelsea it has time to go away
develop<00:01:29.100> grow<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.579> little<00:01:29.700> bit<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.180> he's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
develop grow up a little bit and he's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.149 
develop grow up a little bit and he's
led<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> line<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.229> Wolfsburg<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.799> season

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
led the line for Wolfsburg this season

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.620 
led the line for Wolfsburg this season
and<00:01:32.490> that's<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.060> lot<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.270> players<00:01:33.450> are

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and that's not a lot of players are

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.050 
and that's not a lot of players are
doing<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.930> 23<00:01:34.350> Fabregas<00:01:34.829> was<00:01:34.950> doing<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.280> 22

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
doing that 23 Fabregas was doing that 22

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.810 
doing that 23 Fabregas was doing that 22
arsenal<00:01:37.049> I'm<00:01:37.439> not<00:01:37.650> comparing<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.280> Fabregas<00:01:38.700> I

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
arsenal I'm not comparing to Fabregas I

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.789 
mean and adipic remote five gas but it's
all<00:01:41.369> right<00:01:41.520> though<00:01:42.079> it<00:01:43.079> seems<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.710> could

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
all right though it seems like you could

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.139 
all right though it seems like you could
community<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.610> hit<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> ground<00:01:44.970> running

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
community and hit the ground running

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.880 
community and hit the ground running
there<00:01:45.780> wouldn't<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.110> too<00:01:46.290> much<00:01:46.439> pressure<00:01:46.680> on

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
there wouldn't be too much pressure on

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.109 
there wouldn't be too much pressure on
him<00:01:47.040> because<00:01:47.159> he's<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> midfield<00:01:47.850> that's

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
him because he's in a midfield that's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.600 
him because he's in a midfield that's
got<00:01:48.360> silver<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:49.229> Zuri<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.100> maybe<00:01:50.430> even

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
got silver now Zuri and so on maybe even

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.270 
got silver now Zuri and so on maybe even
papa<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.659> seems<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.829> time<00:01:53.100> is

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
papa and it just seems that the time is

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.740 
papa and it just seems that the time is
right<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.820> kind<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.180> player<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.570> come

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
right for that kind of a player to come

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.420 
right for that kind of a player to come
in<00:01:54.869> yeah<00:01:55.290> i<00:01:55.500> agree<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.130> with

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
in yeah i agree with that and with

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.160 
in yeah i agree with that and with
Milner<00:01:56.880> leaving<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.479> maybe<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.840> couple<00:01:58.049> of

reminds me a little bit of a certain
James<00:02:18.790> Milner<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.269> he's<00:02:19.360> versatile<00:02:19.870> and

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
James Milner in that he's versatile and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.740 
James Milner in that he's versatile and
chains<00:02:20.860> Milner's<00:02:21.250> are<00:02:21.489> not<00:02:21.849> easy<00:02:22.329> to<00:02:22.569> find

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750

because<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.859> whole<00:02:44.950> Chelsea<00:02:45.459> thing<00:02:45.670> and

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
because of the whole Chelsea thing and

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.119 
because of the whole Chelsea thing and
what<00:02:46.450> went<00:02:46.780> on<00:02:46.959> there<00:02:46.989> will<00:02:47.319> still<00:02:47.530> have<00:02:47.950> no

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
what went on there will still have no

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.809 
what went on there will still have no
idea<00:02:48.159> i<00:02:48.819> think<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.629> time's<00:02:49.930> right<00:02:50.139> and<00:02:50.819> I

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
idea i think the time's right and I

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.640 
idea i think the time's right and I
think<00:02:52.060> 40<00:02:52.420> million<00:02:52.720> quid<00:02:52.959> is<00:02:53.170> it's<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.500> going

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
think 40 million quid is it's the going

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.559 
think 40 million quid is it's the going
rate<00:02:53.889> for<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:54.159> player<00:02:54.430> who's<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:55.150> was<00:02:55.269> not<00:02:55.420> your

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
rate for a player who's it was not your

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.839 
rate for a player who's it was not your
Gareth<00:02:55.989> Bale<00:02:56.230> but<00:02:56.769> he's<00:02:56.889> not<00:02:57.040> your<00:02:57.280> air<00:02:57.549> I

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
Gareth Bale but he's not your air I

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.520 
Gareth Bale but he's not your air I
don't<00:02:58.180> know<00:02:58.239> someone<00:02:58.659> at<00:02:58.750> 20<00:02:59.019> million<00:02:59.290> quid

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
don't know someone at 20 million quid

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.679 
don't know someone at 20 million quid
he's<00:02:59.980> probably<00:03:00.189> the<00:03:00.370> one<00:03:00.400> who<00:03:00.700> who's<00:03:01.359> got<00:03:01.599> the

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
he's probably the one who who's got the

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.420 
he's probably the one who who's got the
most<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:02.200> don't<00:03:02.620> know<00:03:02.709> it's<00:03:03.129> got<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.310> most

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
most I don't know it's got the most

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.039 
most I don't know it's got the most
about<00:03:03.730> him<00:03:03.879> in<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.060> minute<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.389> he's<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.870> one

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
about him in a minute and he's the one

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.710 
about him in a minute and he's the one
who's<00:03:05.319> who<00:03:05.980> could<00:03:06.220> come<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.879> I<00:03:07.329> think<00:03:07.599> he'd

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
who's who could come in and I think he'd

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.449 
who's who could come in and I think he'd
do<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:07.959> straight<00:03:08.230> away<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.680> don't<00:03:09.159> think<00:03:09.340> he'd

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
do it straight away I don't think he'd

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.309 
do it straight away I don't think he'd
take<00:03:09.670> any<00:03:09.939> time<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.269> bed<00:03:10.599> into<00:03:10.900> our<00:03:11.049> squad

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
take any time to bed into our squad

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.830 
take any time to bed into our squad
where<00:03:11.560> would<00:03:11.650> he<00:03:11.739> fit<00:03:11.889> in<00:03:12.040> though<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.599> mean<00:03:13.599> I

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
where would he fit in though I mean I

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.000 
where would he fit in though I mean I
guess<00:03:13.900> he's<00:03:14.260> just<00:03:14.290> going<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.560> rotate<00:03:14.709> him

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.369 
guess he's just going to rotate him

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
Briner in 40 million quid seems like a

Briner in 40 million quid seems like a
bit<00:03:54.099> of<00:03:54.129> a<00:03:54.190> bargain<00:03:54.400> sealed<00:03:54.940> record<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.389> think<00:03:55.629> I

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
bit of a bargain sealed record I think I

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.569 
bit of a bargain sealed record I think I
wouldn't<00:03:56.530> go<00:03:56.590> as<00:03:56.650> far<00:03:56.709> as<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:56.919> bargain<00:03:57.370> but<00:03:57.519> i

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
wouldn't go as far as a bargain but i

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.309 
wouldn't go as far as a bargain but i
think<00:03:57.729> it's<00:03:57.849> money<00:03:58.030> well<00:03:58.090> spent<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.569> we've

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
think it's money well spent and we've

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.050 
think it's money well spent and we've
not<00:03:59.470> said<00:03:59.620> anything<00:03:59.680> controversial<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.909> so

not said anything controversial and so

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.339 
not said anything controversial and so
