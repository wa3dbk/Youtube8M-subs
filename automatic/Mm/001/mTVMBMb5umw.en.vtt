actually a connection for the drive
motor<00:00:36.190> resolver<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:36.999> what<00:00:37.449> the<00:00:37.539> resolver

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
motor resolver and what the resolver

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.739 
motor resolver and what the resolver
does<00:00:38.199> is<00:00:38.530> it<00:00:39.129> provides<00:00:39.429> RPM<00:00:40.089> input<00:00:40.510> and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:40.749 
does is it provides RPM input and

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:44.160 
does is it provides RPM input and
