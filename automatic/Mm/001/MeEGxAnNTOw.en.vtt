00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.360 
same problem with that attitude i found
it<00:02:20.959> separating<00:02:21.959> on<00:02:22.140> my<00:02:22.320> lips<00:02:22.530> before<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.250> end

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
it separating on my lips before the end

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.710 
it separating on my lips before the end
of<00:02:23.430> where<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.300> little<00:02:24.480> bit<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.690> a

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
of where so this is a little bit of a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.290 
of where so this is a little bit of a
high<00:02:24.900> maintenance<00:02:25.380> on<00:02:25.650> lip<00:02:26.280> product<00:02:26.670> unless

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
high maintenance on lip product unless

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.699 
high maintenance on lip product unless
you're<00:02:27.510> wearing<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.870> primer<00:02:28.140> or<00:02:28.440> liner

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
you're wearing a primer or liner

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.500 
you're wearing a primer or liner
underneath<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.730> if<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.880> wear<00:02:30.000> by<00:02:30.150> your<00:02:30.300> sub

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
by itself on your lips you might have a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.520 
by itself on your lips you might have a
little<00:02:32.130> bit<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.340> mutation<00:02:33.150> separation<00:02:33.780> it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
little bit of mutation separation it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.680 
little bit of mutation separation it
doesn't<00:02:34.860> bleed<00:02:35.040> or<00:02:35.370> feather<00:02:35.700> into<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.480> lips
