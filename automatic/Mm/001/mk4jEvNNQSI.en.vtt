hello<00:00:03.959> in<00:00:03.990> this<00:00:04.380> video<00:00:04.560> we<00:00:04.859> can<00:00:05.009> be<00:00:05.069> looking<00:00:05.190> at

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
hello in this video we can be looking at

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.120 
hello in this video we can be looking at
the<00:00:05.580> hardware<00:00:06.000> size<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.930> sony<00:00:07.290> xperia<00:00:07.980> m

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
the hardware size of the sony xperia m

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.580 
the hardware size of the sony xperia m
against<00:00:08.760> some<00:00:08.970> other<00:00:09.059> smartphones<00:00:09.960> available

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
against some other smartphones available

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.709 
against some other smartphones available
on<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:11.190> market<00:00:11.250> today<00:00:11.670> or<00:00:11.969> ones<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.420> may<00:00:12.599> have

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
on the market today or ones you may have

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.330 
on the market today or ones you may have
used<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.230> past<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.650> give<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.920> an<00:00:14.009> idea<00:00:14.070> of

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
used in the past to give you an idea of

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.269 
used in the past to give you an idea of
how<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.610> size<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.240> weight<00:00:15.440> compares<00:00:16.440> so

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
how the size and weight compares so

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.679 
how the size and weight compares so
let's<00:00:18.270> start<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.990> HTC<00:00:19.680> 8x<00:00:20.609> so<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.480> can

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
let's start with the HTC 8x so you can

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.349 
let's start with the HTC 8x so you can
see<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.199> 8x<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.699> bigger<00:00:23.939> device

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
see that the 8x is the bigger device

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.290 
see that the 8x is the bigger device
shares<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> similar<00:00:25.710> sort<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.369> profiling<00:00:27.029> with

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
shares a similar sort of profiling with

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.589 
shares a similar sort of profiling with
the<00:00:27.420> corners<00:00:28.039> sort<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.099> sharper<00:00:29.609> feel<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.390> them

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the corners sort of sharper feel to them

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.490 
the corners sort of sharper feel to them
you<00:00:31.500> can<00:00:31.650> also<00:00:31.830> see<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.520> thickness<00:00:32.759> here<00:00:33.500> how

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
you can also see the thickness here how

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.729 
you can also see the thickness here how
the<00:00:34.700> 8x<00:00:35.700> appears<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.840> be<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.140> thinner<00:00:37.380> device

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the 8x appears to be the thinner device

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.350 
the 8x appears to be the thinner device
because<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.460> got<00:00:38.579> character<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> sides

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
because it's got character on the sides

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.459 
because it's got character on the sides
relatively<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.390> same<00:00:42.480> thickness<00:00:42.930> although

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
relatively the same thickness although

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.580 
relatively the same thickness although
the<00:00:43.620> xperia<00:00:44.070> m<00:00:44.690> doesn't<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> curvature

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the xperia m doesn't have the curvature

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.970 
the xperia m doesn't have the curvature
to<00:00:46.920> help<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.430> feel<00:00:47.780> smoother<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.559> terms<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
to help it feel smoother and in terms of

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.279 
to help it feel smoother and in terms of
weight<00:00:50.250> probably<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.539> ax<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.160> heavier

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
weight probably the ax is the heavier

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.930 
weight probably the ax is the heavier
we've<00:00:55.289> got<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.710> very<00:00:55.949> popular<00:00:56.250> samsung

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
we've got the very popular samsung

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.130 
we've got the very popular samsung
galaxy<00:00:57.390> s3<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.489> see<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
galaxy s3 so you can see here that the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.929 
galaxy s3 so you can see here that the
s3<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> bigger<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.760> two<00:01:02.910> devices<00:01:03.390> but

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
s3 is the bigger of the two devices but

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.850 
s3 is the bigger of the two devices but
you've<00:01:05.939> got<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.150> sharper<00:01:06.659> corners<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
you've got the sharper corners on the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.960 
you've got the sharper corners on the
Xperia<00:01:08.520> m2<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.630> s3<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.490> thickness<00:01:11.490> wise<00:01:11.729> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
Xperia m2 the s3 and thickness wise you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.060 
Xperia m2 the s3 and thickness wise you
can<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.330> how<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.659> M<00:01:12.930> appears<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.530> little<00:01:13.890> bit

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
can see how the M appears a little bit

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.920 
can see how the M appears a little bit
thicker<00:01:14.930> as<00:01:15.930> well<00:01:19.159> like<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.540> terms<00:01:21.750> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
thicker as well like so and in terms of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.010 
thicker as well like so and in terms of
weight<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.830> s3<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> heavier<00:01:24.020> most

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
weight the s3 is the heavier most

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.480 
weight the s3 is the heavier most
specifically<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> larger

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
specifically because of the larger

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.090 
specifically because of the larger
screen<00:01:27.409> slightly<00:01:28.409> older<00:01:28.650> device<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
screen slightly older device the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.609 
screen slightly older device the
blackberry<00:01:29.840> 9700<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.229> gives<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.530> an

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
blackberry 9700 here but it gives you an

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.920 
blackberry 9700 here but it gives you an
idea<00:01:31.710> many<00:01:32.460> people<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:33.030> seen<00:01:33.240> handled<00:01:33.810> one

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
idea many people have seen handled one

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.440 
idea many people have seen handled one
of<00:01:34.049> these<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> 9700<00:01:35.909> actually<00:01:36.240> has<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
of these so the 9700 actually has a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.929 
of these so the 9700 actually has a
similar<00:01:36.869> width<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> M<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.250> M<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.549> slightly

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
similar width to the M the M is slightly

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.170 
similar width to the M the M is slightly
wider<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.380> close<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:41.040> length<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:42.030> of

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
wider but it's close to it length is of

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.870 
wider but it's close to it length is of
course<00:01:42.390> longer<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.470> M<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.920> well<00:01:44.159> but

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
course longer on the M as well but

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.450 
course longer on the M as well but
sickness<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.540> no<00:01:45.689> comparison<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.740> M<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
sickness is no comparison the M is the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.910 
sickness is no comparison the M is the
thinner<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> two<00:01:48.420> devices<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.770> terms

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
thinner of the two devices and in terms

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.850 
thinner of the two devices and in terms
of<00:01:50.159> weight<00:01:50.430> pretty<00:01:51.420> equal<00:01:51.840> without<00:01:52.170> looking

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
of weight pretty equal without looking

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.789 
of weight pretty equal without looking
at<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> spec<00:01:53.280> sheet<00:01:53.310> there<00:01:54.320> got<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> galaxy

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
at the spec sheet there got the galaxy

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.889 
at the spec sheet there got the galaxy
s3<00:01:56.189> mini<00:01:56.219> which<00:01:56.579> could<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.420> device<00:01:57.869> that

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
s3 mini which could be a device that

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.649 
s3 mini which could be a device that
you're<00:01:58.229> upgrading<00:01:58.409> from<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.090> M<00:02:00.329> or

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
you're upgrading from to the M or

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.170 
you're upgrading from to the M or
looking<00:02:01.079> at<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.710> competitor<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.060> can

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
looking at it as competitor so you can

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.819 
looking at it as competitor so you can
see<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.840> actually<00:02:03.960> quite<00:02:04.380> similar

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
see that this is actually quite similar

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.700 
see that this is actually quite similar
in<00:02:05.189> terms<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.939> overall<00:02:05.990> sizing<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.469> width

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
in terms of the overall sizing the width

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.119 
in terms of the overall sizing the width
is<00:02:07.920> Nayan<00:02:08.160> identical<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.349> length<00:02:10.709> all

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
is Nayan identical as is the length all

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.460 
is Nayan identical as is the length all
be

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
be

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.790 
be
the<00:02:11.710> M<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.130> just<00:02:12.580> fractionally<00:02:13.270> longer<00:02:13.810> with

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
the M is just fractionally longer with

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.710 
the M is just fractionally longer with
wise<00:02:16.290> or<00:02:17.290> sickness<00:02:18.100> wise<00:02:18.280> not<00:02:19.240> an<00:02:19.330> awful<00:02:19.660> lot

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
wise or sickness wise not an awful lot

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.320 
wise or sickness wise not an awful lot
on<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:20.110> think<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.530> M<00:02:20.950> just<00:02:21.730> edges<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.210> in

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
on it I think the M just edges it in

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.060 
on it I think the M just edges it in
terms<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.780> actual<00:02:23.110> thickness<00:02:23.350> it's<00:02:23.740> a<00:02:23.860> little

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
terms of actual thickness it's a little

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.730 
terms of actual thickness it's a little
bit<00:02:24.250> thicker<00:02:24.910> it's<00:02:25.720> also<00:02:25.960> square<00:02:26.530> where

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
bit thicker it's also square where

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.860 
bit thicker it's also square where
you've<00:02:26.830> got<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.070> nice<00:02:27.220> curvature<00:02:27.580> on<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.690> s3

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
you've got the nice curvature on the s3

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.930 
you've got the nice curvature on the s3
mini<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:30.280> finally<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.120> iphone<00:02:31.540> 4<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.610> we<00:02:33.760> can

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
mini and finally the iphone 4 so we can

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.070 
mini and finally the iphone 4 so we can
see<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:35.020> is<00:02:35.200> again<00:02:35.500> quite<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.860> close<00:02:37.080> size

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
see this is again quite a close size

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.520 
see this is again quite a close size
comparison<00:02:38.940> with<00:02:39.940> there's<00:02:40.600> just<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.380> know<00:02:41.500> a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
comparison with there's just you know a

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.650 
comparison with there's just you know a
few<00:02:41.830> mil<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.730> on<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.030> M<00:02:43.150> it's<00:02:43.330> at<00:02:43.480> that

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
few mil in it on the M it's at that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.880 
few mil in it on the M it's at that
little<00:02:43.870> bit<00:02:44.110> thicker<00:02:44.640> height<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:46.709> little<00:02:47.709> bit

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
little bit thicker height a little bit

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.300 
little bit thicker height a little bit
taller<00:02:49.320> thickness<00:02:50.320> there<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.709> actually<00:02:51.100> quite

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
taller thickness there is actually quite

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.900 
taller thickness there is actually quite
comparable<00:02:52.050> not<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.080> lot<00:02:53.380> in<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.100> two<00:02:54.459> units

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
comparable not a lot in the two units

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.060 
comparable not a lot in the two units
and<00:02:55.450> white<00:02:55.750> probably<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> iphone<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:56.709> the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
and white probably the iphone is the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.130 
and white probably the iphone is the
heavier<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:58.000> that's<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.209> quick<00:02:58.360> hardware<00:02:58.900> size

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
heavier so that's a quick hardware size

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.390 
heavier so that's a quick hardware size
comparison<00:02:59.770> of<00:02:59.980> these<00:03:00.280> sony<00:03:00.580> xperia<00:03:01.150> m
