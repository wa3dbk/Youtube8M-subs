 the characters involved this track 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.910
 in reality they have no way of dialogue 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:17.580
 or confront each other but in this 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:19.949

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.920
 which I weigh less than 500 grams but 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.960

 right of life all written in pencil 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.899
 so I gave up after four months taken 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.329
 from the months in conceiving an offspring but 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.070
 abortion is not a solution to put the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.620
 feet on the scale was a horror 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.750

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.719
 Mom's heartbeat was the lullaby 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.719

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.080
 what do they have to say I know it's dramatic 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.509
 I explain the situation to stick to 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.520
 panic and depression I regret 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.430

 people in this country the drama is that 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.850
 we are young people without a home, but no 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.979
 without arriving later every month 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.649

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.800
 alongside a message you know what it is maybe 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.300
