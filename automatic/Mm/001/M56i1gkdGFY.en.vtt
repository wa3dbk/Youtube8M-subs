in<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> game<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.310> killed<00:02:05.520> him<00:02:05.580> up<00:02:05.759> but

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
in the game I just killed him up but

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.249 
in the game I just killed him up but

I am the exact same and that doesn't
necessarily<00:02:09.569> lead<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.669> duping<00:02:11.669> but<00:02:13.129> usually

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
necessarily lead to duping but usually

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.490 
necessarily lead to duping but usually
it<00:02:14.219> does<00:02:14.400> if<00:02:14.639> you<00:02:14.790> can

they're<00:02:23.270> gonna<00:02:23.420> do<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.050> they're<00:02:24.140> gonna

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260

it could have been done accidentally is
a<00:02:32.750> very<00:02:33.140> damning<00:02:34.070> part<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.460> game<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.910> as

a very damning part of the game and as

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
the accidental part of duping anyway so

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.620 
the accidental part of duping anyway so
it's<00:02:42.200> it's<00:02:42.560> very<00:02:42.650> very<00:02:43.450> convincing<00:02:44.450> that

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
it's it's very very convincing that

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.330 
it's it's very very convincing that
there<00:02:45.020> is<00:02:45.140> some<00:02:45.380> kind<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.620> people<00:02:45.830> going<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.160> I

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
there is some kind of people going on I

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.310 
there is some kind of people going on I
don't<00:02:46.400> know<00:02:46.610> exactly<00:02:46.730> how<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.750> happens<00:02:48.140> how<00:02:48.290> it

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
don't know exactly how it happens how it

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.530 
don't know exactly how it happens how it
occurs<00:02:49.030> but<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.810> do<00:02:51.170> believe<00:02:51.620> it's<00:02:52.360> some<00:02:53.360> sort

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
occurs but I do believe it's some sort

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.900 
occurs but I do believe it's some sort
of<00:02:53.630> exploit<00:02:54.140> or<00:02:54.290> hack<00:02:54.500> it's<00:02:54.860> not<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.580> know<00:02:55.670> the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
of exploit or hack it's not you know the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.540 
of exploit or hack it's not you know the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
kind of dupe that people think we're you

items<00:03:02.390> or<00:03:02.540> some<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.440> then<00:03:03.560> they<00:03:03.709> like<00:03:03.890> to

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040

their peers over the phone of the
blizzards<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:09.800> I'm<00:03:10.730> sure<00:03:11.000> people<00:03:11.420> have<00:03:11.690> got

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
blizzards so I'm sure people have got

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.500 
blizzards so I'm sure people have got
that<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.620> work<00:03:12.800> but<00:03:13.250> let's<00:03:13.459> be<00:03:13.640> realistic<00:03:14.150> okay

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
that to work but let's be realistic okay

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.620 
that to work but let's be realistic okay
this<00:03:15.410> is<00:03:15.650> this<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.220> some<00:03:16.490> real<00:03:16.820> economic<00:03:17.420> ship

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
this is this is some real economic ship

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.199 
this is this is some real economic ship

right here gem pricings why are gems

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.870 
right here gem pricings why are gems
targeted<00:03:20.660> people<00:03:20.959> are<00:03:21.080> saying<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:22.459> know<00:03:22.519> gems

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.810 
targeted people are saying you know gems
are<00:03:23.060> good<00:03:23.209> because<00:03:23.360> they<00:03:23.660> don't<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:23.840> an<00:03:24.380> ID

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
are good because they don't have an ID

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.610 
are good because they don't have an ID
for<00:03:25.820> each<00:03:26.000> item<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:26.989> there's<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.410> yeah

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
for each item and so there's like yeah

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.550 
for each item and so there's like yeah
they<00:03:27.830> do<00:03:27.890> have<00:03:28.190> an<00:03:28.340> ID<00:03:28.489> well<00:03:29.180> yeah<00:03:30.050> that

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
they do have an ID well yeah that

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.290 
they do have an ID well yeah that
doesn't<00:03:30.830> really<00:03:30.950> matter<00:03:31.250> at<00:03:31.459> all

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
doesn't really matter at all

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.229 
doesn't really matter at all
largely<00:03:32.959> because<00:03:33.410> of<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.560> fact<00:03:33.830> that<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:35.060> can

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
largely because of the fact that you can

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.240 
largely because of the fact that you can
just<00:03:35.390> dupe<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.840> gem<00:03:36.080> before<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.709> radiant<00:03:37.130> and

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
just dupe the gem before the radiant and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.770 
just dupe the gem before the radiant and
then<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.430> can<00:03:37.550> craft<00:03:37.850> up<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.269> radiant

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
then you can craft up to a radiant

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.930 
then you can craft up to a radiant
generating<00:03:39.320> a<00:03:39.410> new<00:03:39.440> idea<00:03:39.920> it's<00:03:40.370> exactly<00:03:40.790> how

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
generating a new idea it's exactly how

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.820 
generating a new idea it's exactly how
people<00:03:41.090> did<00:03:41.390> it<00:03:41.540> with<00:03:41.660> runes<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.170> Diablo<00:03:42.650> 2

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
people did it with runes and Diablo 2

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.740 
people did it with runes and Diablo 2
they<00:03:43.370> would<00:03:43.519> dupe<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.910> hell<00:03:44.120> out<00:03:44.330> of<00:03:44.360> like<00:03:44.720> lo

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
they would dupe the hell out of like lo

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.830 
they would dupe the hell out of like lo
lo<00:03:45.590> her<00:03:46.010> runes<00:03:46.400> not<00:03:46.940> loaded<00:03:47.390> but<00:03:47.630> lower

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.289 
lo her runes not loaded but lower
Hiram's<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:49.489> would<00:03:49.580> craft<00:03:49.850> them<00:03:50.060> up<00:03:50.180> to

of the issue and are investing in these
gems<00:04:49.440> I<00:04:49.740> think<00:04:50.490> more<00:04:50.730> people<00:04:50.760> are<00:04:51.030> just<00:04:51.270> buying

gems I think more people are just buying
them<00:04:51.870> that's<00:04:52.260> why<00:04:52.440> they're<00:04:52.620> going<00:04:52.800> up<00:04:53.070> in

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
them that's why they're going up in

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.270 
them that's why they're going up in
price<00:04:53.780> I<00:04:54.780> think<00:04:55.380> people<00:04:55.890> have<00:04:55.980> been<00:04:56.130> doing

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
price I think people have been doing

price I think people have been doing
this<00:04:56.520> forever<00:04:56.960> there's<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.140> notion<00:04:58.290> of

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
this forever there's the notion of

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.970 
this forever there's the notion of
awareness<00:04:59.790> as<00:05:00.090> well<00:05:00.260> you<00:05:01.260> know<00:05:01.380> if<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:01.680> go<00:05:01.830> on

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
awareness as well you know if you go on

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.710 
awareness as well you know if you go on
to<00:05:02.160> read<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:02.670> you<00:05:02.730> find<00:05:02.940> out<00:05:03.120> about<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.450> dupe

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
to read it and you find out about a dupe

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.440 
to read it and you find out about a dupe
you<00:05:04.590> know<00:05:04.710> that's<00:05:04.890> the<00:05:05.070> last<00:05:05.430> step<00:05:05.970> in<00:05:06.210> the

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
you know that's the last step in the

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.110 
you know that's the last step in the
process<00:05:06.660> you<00:05:07.650> know<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:08.040> goes<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.820> goes<00:05:09.000> from

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
process you know it goes it goes from

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.610 
process you know it goes it goes from
the<00:05:09.240> beginning<00:05:09.540> where<00:05:09.810> some<00:05:10.050> guy<00:05:10.170> figures<00:05:10.500> out

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
the beginning where some guy figures out

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.410 
the beginning where some guy figures out
how<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.770> do<00:05:11.010> it<00:05:11.160> then<00:05:11.520> they<00:05:11.670> methodically<00:05:12.240> do

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
how to do it then they methodically do

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.390 
how to do it then they methodically do
it<00:05:12.570> then<00:05:12.780> they<00:05:12.930> get<00:05:13.110> you<00:05:13.650> know<00:05:13.740> really<00:05:14.130> really

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
it then they get you know really really

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.760 
it then they get you know really really
really<00:05:14.670> wealthy<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.330> then<00:05:16.140> maybe<00:05:16.380> they<00:05:16.590> give

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
really wealthy and then maybe they give

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.990 
really wealthy and then maybe they give
it<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:16.890> their<00:05:17.040> friends<00:05:17.400> maybe<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.730> leaks

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
it to their friends maybe it leaks

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.510 
it to their friends maybe it leaks
sometime<00:05:18.630> later<00:05:18.900> some<00:05:19.230> weeks<00:05:19.470> later<00:05:19.800> and<00:05:20.400> then

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
sometime later some weeks later and then

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.370 
sometime later some weeks later and then
maybe<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:20.760> group<00:05:21.000> of<00:05:21.090> people<00:05:21.360> do<00:05:21.510> it<00:05:21.630> and<00:05:21.750> then

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
maybe a group of people do it and then

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.480 
maybe a group of people do it and then
it<00:05:22.500> goes<00:05:22.620> in<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.860> hands<00:05:23.130> of<00:05:23.220> people<00:05:23.310> that

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
it goes in the hands of people that

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.690 
it goes in the hands of people that
don't<00:05:23.760> really<00:05:23.940> know<00:05:24.150> what<00:05:24.300> they're<00:05:24.420> doing<00:05:24.750> so

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
don't really know what they're doing so

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.800 
don't really know what they're doing so
they're<00:05:26.700> creating<00:05:26.880> too<00:05:27.210> much<00:05:27.360> supplying

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
they're creating too much supplying

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.160 
they're creating too much supplying
they're<00:05:28.140> lowering<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.920> price<00:05:29.570> below<00:05:30.570> what

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
they're lowering the price below what

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.780 
they're lowering the price below what
it's<00:05:31.320> actually<00:05:31.770> supposed<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.220> be<00:05:32.310> valued<00:05:32.640> at

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
it's actually supposed to be valued at

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.520 
it's actually supposed to be valued at
and<00:05:33.000> you<00:05:33.630> know<00:05:33.750> that's<00:05:33.990> when<00:05:34.140> I<00:05:34.200> start<00:05:34.440> to

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
and you know that's when I start to

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.080 
and you know that's when I start to
raising<00:05:34.800> some<00:05:35.010> flags<00:05:35.280> then<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:35.640> goes<00:05:35.820> on<00:05:36.030> and

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
raising some flags then it goes on and

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.570 
raising some flags then it goes on and
on<00:05:36.360> and<00:05:36.480> on<00:05:36.690> until<00:05:36.960> it's<00:05:37.620> like<00:05:37.800> hit<00:05:38.010> the<00:05:38.190> floor

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
on and on until it's like hit the floor

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.150 
on and on until it's like hit the floor
and<00:05:38.910> then<00:05:39.450> people<00:05:39.660> realize<00:05:40.170> it<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:40.620> then

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
and then people realize it and then

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.250 
and then people realize it and then
someone<00:05:41.640> you<00:05:41.820> know<00:05:42.000> well-known<00:05:42.750> enough<00:05:42.990> like

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
someone you know well-known enough like

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.990 
someone you know well-known enough like
Mulder<00:05:43.620> makes<00:05:43.830> a<00:05:43.950> video<00:05:44.220> about<00:05:44.430> it<00:05:44.580> then<00:05:44.970> that

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
Mulder makes a video about it then that

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.910 
Mulder makes a video about it then that
gets<00:05:45.330> enough<00:05:45.540> attention<00:05:45.570> then<00:05:46.470> it<00:05:46.590> goes<00:05:46.740> on

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
gets enough attention then it goes on

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.040 
gets enough attention then it goes on
Reddit<00:05:47.310> and<00:05:47.400> then<00:05:47.880> people<00:05:48.120> figure<00:05:48.510> it<00:05:48.600> out<00:05:48.720> you

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
Reddit and then people figure it out you

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.230 
Reddit and then people figure it out you
know<00:05:49.170> that's<00:05:49.400> that's<00:05:50.400> been<00:05:50.700> like<00:05:50.910> you<00:05:51.210> know

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
know that's that's been like you know

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.210 
know that's that's been like you know
many<00:05:51.570> months<00:05:51.960> since<00:05:52.140> the<00:05:52.320> first<00:05:52.590> guys<00:05:52.860> been

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
many months since the first guys been

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.040 
many months since the first guys been
starting<00:05:53.520> doing<00:05:53.790> this<00:05:53.910> so<00:05:54.180> there's<00:05:54.390> no<00:05:54.600> reason

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
starting doing this so there's no reason

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.710 
starting doing this so there's no reason
to<00:05:55.160> believe<00:05:56.160> that<00:05:56.520> this<00:05:56.670> is<00:05:56.850> a<00:05:56.880> new<00:05:57.270> kind<00:05:57.540> of

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
to believe that this is a new kind of

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.320 
to believe that this is a new kind of
method<00:05:58.110> it's<00:05:58.500> just<00:05:58.800> newly<00:05:59.520> discovered<00:05:59.970> by<00:06:00.270> the

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
method it's just newly discovered by the

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.570 
method it's just newly discovered by the
public<00:06:00.750> and<00:06:00.960> this<00:06:01.950> is<00:06:02.070> probably<00:06:02.430> been<00:06:02.550> going

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
public and this is probably been going

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.240 
public and this is probably been going
on<00:06:02.940> close<00:06:03.840> to<00:06:04.080> the<00:06:04.170> beginning<00:06:04.560> of<00:06:04.650> the<00:06:04.740> game<00:06:04.920> I

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
on close to the beginning of the game I

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.730 
on close to the beginning of the game I
think<00:06:05.750> because<00:06:06.750> I<00:06:06.780> have<00:06:07.140> seen<00:06:07.320> some<00:06:07.350> fishy

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
think because I have seen some fishy

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.950 
think because I have seen some fishy
things<00:06:08.070> as<00:06:08.280> well<00:06:08.490> over<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:09.450> course<00:06:09.720> of<00:06:09.900> the

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
things as well over the course of the

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.690 
things as well over the course of the
game<00:06:10.140> right<00:06:11.100> from<00:06:11.280> the<00:06:11.400> start<00:06:11.610> and<00:06:13.400> there's<00:06:14.400> um

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
game right from the start and there's um

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.260 
game right from the start and there's um
there's<00:06:15.090> a<00:06:15.840> few<00:06:16.080> other<00:06:16.200> things<00:06:16.500> where<00:06:17.270> you

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
there's a few other things where you

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.110 
there's a few other things where you
know<00:06:18.360> not<00:06:19.260> so<00:06:19.500> much<00:06:19.650> now<00:06:19.860> that<00:06:20.070> because<00:06:20.460> Diablo

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
know not so much now that because Diablo

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.420 
know not so much now that because Diablo
3<00:06:21.360> I<00:06:21.390> think<00:06:21.630> is<00:06:21.780> read<00:06:22.050> you<00:06:22.740> reach<00:06:22.950> some<00:06:23.160> kind<00:06:23.310> of

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
3 I think is read you reach some kind of

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.430 
3 I think is read you reach some kind of
stability<00:06:23.670> point<00:06:24.180> where<00:06:24.870> it<00:06:24.990> hasn't<00:06:25.170> really

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
stability point where it hasn't really

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.390 
stability point where it hasn't really
lost<00:06:25.980> too<00:06:26.250> many<00:06:26.370> people<00:06:26.490> lately<00:06:26.970> but<00:06:27.810> um<00:06:27.960> I

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
lost too many people lately but um I

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.920 
lost too many people lately but um I
have<00:06:29.400> seen<00:06:29.610> some<00:06:29.790> other<00:06:29.910> prominent<00:06:30.330> youtubers

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
have seen some other prominent youtubers

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.300 
have seen some other prominent youtubers
some<00:06:31.530> of<00:06:31.620> the<00:06:31.680> people<00:06:31.860> saying<00:06:32.070> that<00:06:32.220> they're

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
some of the people saying that they're

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.140 
some of the people saying that they're
gonna<00:06:32.430> quit

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
gonna quit

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.860 
gonna quit
if<00:06:33.270> Blizzard<00:06:34.200> doesn't<00:06:34.530> take

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
if Blizzard doesn't take

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.370 
if Blizzard doesn't take
action<00:06:35.230> I<00:06:35.730> think<00:06:36.730> that's<00:06:36.940> a<00:06:37.120> that's<00:06:37.330> a<00:06:37.780> joke<00:06:38.140> I

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
action I think that's a that's a joke I

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.220 
action I think that's a that's a joke I
mean<00:06:38.770> if<00:06:39.100> if<00:06:39.370> if<00:06:40.150> you<00:06:40.300> think<00:06:40.570> this<00:06:40.720> breaks<00:06:41.050> the

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
mean if if if you think this breaks the

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.490 
mean if if if you think this breaks the
game<00:06:41.410> it<00:06:41.680> kind<00:06:42.190> of<00:06:42.280> does<00:06:42.490> but<00:06:42.880> I<00:06:42.910> mean<00:06:43.290> for<00:06:44.290> one

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
game it kind of does but I mean for one

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.060 
game it kind of does but I mean for one
it's<00:06:44.830> just<00:06:45.160> a<00:06:45.250> game<00:06:45.490> -<00:06:46.390> it's<00:06:47.290> probably<00:06:47.620> going

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
it's just a game - it's probably going

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.900 
it's just a game - it's probably going
on<00:06:48.190> forever<00:06:48.640> and<00:06:49.420> I<00:06:50.070> mean<00:06:51.070> what<00:06:51.700> can<00:06:51.790> you

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910 
on forever and I mean what can you

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.400 
on forever and I mean what can you
really<00:06:52.060> expect<00:06:52.510> loser<00:06:52.690> to<00:06:52.930> do<00:06:53.020> at<00:06:53.140> this<00:06:53.290> point

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.410 
really expect loser to do at this point

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.860 
really expect loser to do at this point
you<00:06:53.800> know<00:06:54.640> they<00:06:54.790> took<00:06:54.970> some<00:06:55.240> measures<00:06:55.570> in

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
you know they took some measures in

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.590 
you know they took some measures in
Diablo<00:06:56.800> 2<00:06:57.040> but<00:06:57.640> they<00:06:57.760> couldn't<00:06:58.060> really<00:06:58.240> solve

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
Diablo 2 but they couldn't really solve

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.960 
Diablo 2 but they couldn't really solve
the<00:06:58.810> room<00:06:59.050> problem<00:06:59.560> and<00:06:59.770> I<00:07:00.400> don't<00:07:00.790> think

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
the room problem and I don't think

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.460 
the room problem and I don't think
they're<00:07:01.090> ever<00:07:01.120> going<00:07:01.540> to<00:07:01.660> solve<00:07:01.930> the<00:07:02.230> gem

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
they're ever going to solve the gem

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.620 
they're ever going to solve the gem
problem<00:07:02.890> they<00:07:03.370> can<00:07:03.580> go<00:07:03.730> to<00:07:03.760> the<00:07:03.970> core<00:07:04.270> of<00:07:04.300> the

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
problem they can go to the core of the

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.760 
problem they can go to the core of the
Duke<00:07:04.840> but<00:07:05.230> usually<00:07:07.050> that's<00:07:08.050> not<00:07:08.320> really<00:07:08.620> the

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
Duke but usually that's not really the

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.120 
Duke but usually that's not really the
case<00:07:08.950> when<00:07:09.910> it<00:07:10.000> came<00:07:10.150> to<00:07:10.450> like<00:07:11.080> duping<00:07:11.590> hacking

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.130 
case when it came to like duping hacking

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.000 
case when it came to like duping hacking
and<00:07:12.250> other<00:07:12.340> games<00:07:12.930> direct<00:07:13.930> fixes<00:07:14.350> were<00:07:14.530> not<00:07:14.770> so

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.010 
and other games direct fixes were not so

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.050 
and other games direct fixes were not so
easy<00:07:15.250> and<00:07:16.200> honestly<00:07:17.200> I<00:07:17.410> do<00:07:18.130> not<00:07:18.550> expect<00:07:18.880> this

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
easy and honestly I do not expect this

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.570 
easy and honestly I do not expect this
to<00:07:19.120> be<00:07:19.300> a<00:07:19.450> fixed<00:07:20.140> anytime<00:07:20.560> soon<00:07:20.860> I<00:07:21.100> actually

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 
to be a fixed anytime soon I actually

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.690 
to be a fixed anytime soon I actually
expect<00:07:22.120> the<00:07:22.390> gem<00:07:22.960> prices<00:07:23.410> to<00:07:23.710> go<00:07:23.890> down<00:07:24.100> even

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:24.700 
expect the gem prices to go down even

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.840 
expect the gem prices to go down even
further<00:07:25.290> once<00:07:26.290> people<00:07:26.590> kind<00:07:27.040> of<00:07:27.160> accept<00:07:27.700> the

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:27.850 
further once people kind of accept the

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.550 
further once people kind of accept the
fact<00:07:28.120> that<00:07:28.360> this<00:07:28.600> is<00:07:28.780> going<00:07:28.960> to<00:07:29.140> be<00:07:29.260> an<00:07:29.350> ongoing

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 
fact that this is going to be an ongoing

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.800 
fact that this is going to be an ongoing
thing<00:07:30.150> so<00:07:31.150> you<00:07:31.240> can<00:07:31.330> take<00:07:31.540> that<00:07:31.660> information

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
thing so you can take that information

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:37.140 
thing so you can take that information
however<00:07:32.650> you<00:07:32.830> want<00:07:33.870> and<00:07:35.670> I'm<00:07:36.670> curious<00:07:36.970> to<00:07:37.120> see
