00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.690
 Welcome to the opening of a 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.580
 order of special edition and I have to 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.070
 say I was very surprised when I was 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.360
 lately the playlist my mondays 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.950
 gone through openings and I saw 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.020
 I have never had an oscar 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.840
 special edition made easy on 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.930
 because my theme moved to the open 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.250
 left is always like often just one 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.660
 single special edition so i 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.939
 maybe someday in the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.490
 playlist so easy all special 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.710
 editions this even sometime soon with 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.420
 otherwise have made a car on 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.380
 The opportunity is being given up 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.950
 that I'll stop the whole thing 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.379
 display or regular display 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.239
 or display and I was very surprised 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.690
 On kings never single made often 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.739
 only he had something in front of something before about two 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.230
 years I have new special 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.899
 editions opened and then I have 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.180
 this is the special edition, so to speak 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:03.329
 display and 1 1 too little and then did 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.010
 I'll show you how to do those things 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.960
 can chat the old special editions 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.250
 because it's all very up here 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.619
 is flexible and you are so theoretical 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.330
 could already sneak in before buying 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.799
 which pro you get but often was first 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.150
 that was a very good thing because it existed 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.299
 Stop auctioning a very, very good one 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.080
 Promo was and the feelings of the rallye 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.250
 just not that good promo was 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.850
 and then i thought customers here then 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.850
 we do the thing it out on a 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.560
 nice add by now are not there 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.360
 more so many good cards in there the good ones 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.100
 text to keep it but support 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.790
 have gotten like wild ups and in 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.790
 sectors 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.860

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.290
 been started and are no longer so 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.079
 strong since then it does not work anymore 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.829
 but have been withdrawn anyway 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.259
 feature of joe cole asset and so on 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.090
 we almost complete our display 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.619
 from then world with this special 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.090
 edition we have ten and so on 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.979
 have a whole special edition display 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.689
 and since we already have those anyway 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.780
 videos are the links you have 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.820

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.310
 that did not manage to see which 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.570
 That's it 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.100
 it is definitely an effect 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.070
 veiling I do not know 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.000
 could 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.650
 but I can see from here that 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.640
 an effect will be auctioning and if 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.870
 I would have taken now 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.250

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.910
 hump 2012 I think I would have the ffo 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.710
 as an outfit its public around it 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.160

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.320
 a very very nice promo very good and 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.730
 Let's see what we got out of our six 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.200
 get a hollow enough for me that it 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.180
 standard for a special edition 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.580
 but do not get it 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.160
 because that's pretty shitty and where are those 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.420

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.890

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:27.120
 during the day time so I put the back where 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.670
 So it's soup sweet ice galaxy wave 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.120

 The knives may be the rallies of the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.130
 an addiction that becomes specific to others 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.130

 it is not so good and 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.430
 Therefore , the card is not so 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:16.260
