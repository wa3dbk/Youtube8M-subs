00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.340
 the troublemaker in defense he has nothing to 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.840
 envy to who knows to put a pressure of 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.840
 crazy about the wearer is who this guy 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.130
 camille you come from too much the ball goes 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.300
 and he 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.039
 But I thought I was out all 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.079
 is what comes out 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.909
 coal 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.079
 you are very naive it's not with this 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:39.409
 kind of attack that you will be able to 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.600
 pierce our defense are rolling 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.399
 solid under their impressive basket 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.879
 it's the best defense of any 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.559
 the region 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.379
 it would go he did not register the 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.250
 least basket cdj 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.159
 but what are they in the process of 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.329
 do yeah when we played against them 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.890
 I noticed they were slow to 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.949
 start but it's still great 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.359
 ominous usually it's camille who 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.469
 launches the machine but as it is 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.939
 still not back in the game 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.509
 others are not 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:04.509
 obviously 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.880
 this ogawa raises a little the foot where you go 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.650
 finish 1 is in the third quarter time 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.880
 it's going to be okay 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.370
 I realize that they are still 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.270
 less than was thought repeating for 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:25.020
 you fuck the charges for lack of 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.700
 number 10 of his life he is completely 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.710
 crazy the meaning of the word too quickly to the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.170
 head, we'll fall back tian kagami 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.310
 fault of chalmÃ© it is the second fault 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.229
 that you do camille you have to 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.410
 pay attention to the 5th refereed 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.690
 will expel thank you I know the rules 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.200
 their movement they are really hard at 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.200
 to anticipate 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.130
 I do not believe it I thought that only the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.860
 members of the miracle generation could 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.960
 to stop cac gains he does not even prevent you 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.400
 to make the simplest passes on 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.119
 can not rely on combinations 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.119
 was short in 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.320
 you 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.910
 and here again there is not the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.910
 lesser solution passes
