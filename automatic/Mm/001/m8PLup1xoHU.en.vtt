00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.269

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.059

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.910

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.020
 some of the few assets that the victims 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.510
 managed to save were stolen by 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.340
 firefighters who worked 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.379

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.300
