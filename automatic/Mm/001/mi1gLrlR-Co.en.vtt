when<00:00:00.930> boondocking<00:00:01.760> you<00:00:02.760> don't<00:00:03.030> want<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.270> be

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
when boondocking you don't want to be

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.999 
when boondocking you don't want to be
stuck<00:00:03.570> without<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.020> luxuries<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.470> home<00:00:04.770> and

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
stuck without the luxuries of home and

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.950 
stuck without the luxuries of home and
depending<00:00:05.850> on<00:00:05.970> how<00:00:06.150> many<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.420> those<00:00:06.480> luxuries

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
depending on how many of those luxuries

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.960 
depending on how many of those luxuries
you<00:00:06.990> can't<00:00:07.350> live<00:00:07.500> without<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:08.069> how<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.610> decide

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
you can't live without is how you decide

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.350 
you can't live without is how you decide
which<00:00:09.690> inverter<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.349> right<00:00:10.620> for<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:14.360> why

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
which inverter is right for you so why

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.060 
which inverter is right for you so why
do<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.570> need<00:00:15.660> an<00:00:15.900> inverter<00:00:16.260> if<00:00:16.740> all<00:00:16.920> our

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
do we need an inverter if all our

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.160 
do we need an inverter if all our
gadgets<00:00:17.460> ran<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.820> 12<00:00:18.119> volt<00:00:18.300> DC<00:00:18.390> power<00:00:18.690> like

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
gadgets ran on 12 volt DC power like

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.279 
gadgets ran on 12 volt DC power like
this<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:20.010> wouldn't<00:00:20.310> need<00:00:20.400> one<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:21.330> because<00:00:22.170> we

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
this we wouldn't need one but because we

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.130 
this we wouldn't need one but because we
want<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.529> run<00:00:22.710> 110<00:00:23.189> AC<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.150> an<00:00:24.420> inverter

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
want to run 110 AC like this an inverter

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.950 
want to run 110 AC like this an inverter
is<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.439> must<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.369> an<00:00:26.670> inverter<00:00:27.060> converts<00:00:27.330> DC

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
is a must so an inverter converts DC

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.740 
is a must so an inverter converts DC
power<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.859> AC<00:00:29.070> power<00:00:29.580> yep<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:31.019> magic<00:00:32.750> or

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
power to AC power yep it's like magic or

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.100 
power to AC power yep it's like magic or
science<00:00:34.730> okay<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.059> there's<00:00:36.239> modified<00:00:36.780> sine

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
science okay so there's modified sine

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.530 
science okay so there's modified sine
and<00:00:37.410> pure<00:00:37.950> sine<00:00:38.190> inverters<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.390> big

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
and pure sine inverters so it's a big

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.600 
and pure sine inverters so it's a big
difference<00:00:39.860> without<00:00:40.860> putting<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.430> sleep

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
difference without putting you to sleep

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.040 
difference without putting you to sleep
with<00:00:41.760> some<00:00:41.969> super<00:00:42.300> technical<00:00:42.629> nerd<00:00:42.930> out

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
with some super technical nerd out

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.770 
with some super technical nerd out
session<00:00:43.500> here's<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.340> gist<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
session here's the gist of it this is a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.779 
session here's the gist of it this is a
pure<00:00:46.079> sine<00:00:46.320> wave<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:47.070> exactly<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
pure sine wave it's exactly like the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.389 
pure sine wave it's exactly like the
power<00:00:48.059> inside<00:00:48.390> your<00:00:48.600> home<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:50.219> all

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
power inside your home and it's what all

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.010 
power inside your home and it's what all
hundred<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.879> ten<00:00:51.000> volt<00:00:51.210> devices<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:51.780> made<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
hundred and ten volt devices are made to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.010 
hundred and ten volt devices are made to
run<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.059> modified<00:00:54.480> sine<00:00:54.780> wave

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
run on and this is a modified sine wave

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.049 
run on and this is a modified sine wave
notice<00:00:55.980> there's<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.190> huge<00:00:56.520> difference<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
notice there's a huge difference in the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.720 
notice there's a huge difference in the
way<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.300> looks<00:00:57.559> many<00:00:58.559> devices<00:00:58.859> can't<00:00:59.309> run<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
way it looks many devices can't run on a

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.910 
way it looks many devices can't run on a
modified<00:01:00.120> sine<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.530> damaged

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
modified sine or they can be damaged

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.369 
modified sine or they can be damaged
over<00:01:02.010> time<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.640> modified<00:01:03.600> sine<00:01:03.870> wave<00:01:04.080> inverter

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
over time a modified sine wave inverter

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.140 
over time a modified sine wave inverter
can<00:01:04.589> run<00:01:04.799> gadgets<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.400> griddle<00:01:05.790> an

pure sine inverter typically cost 50

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.560 
pure sine inverter typically cost 50
percent<00:01:38.460> more<00:01:38.670> than<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.970> modified<00:01:39.390> version

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
percent more than the modified version

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.020 
percent more than the modified version
but<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.500> damage<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.070> expensive<00:01:41.490> device<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
but you damage one expensive device and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.109 
but you damage one expensive device and
is<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.540> worth<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.960> uh<00:01:43.490> not<00:01:44.490> at<00:01:44.670> all

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
is it really worth it uh not at all

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.999 
is it really worth it uh not at all
another<00:01:45.840> benefit<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> pure<00:01:46.799> sine

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
another benefit to the pure sine

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.310 
another benefit to the pure sine
inverter<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:48.090> up<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.360> 50<00:01:48.689> percent<00:01:48.840> more

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
inverter is it's up to 50 percent more

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.590 
inverter is it's up to 50 percent more
efficient<00:01:49.829> than<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> modified<00:01:50.520> version<00:01:50.729> okay

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
efficient than the modified version okay

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.240 
efficient than the modified version okay
so<00:01:51.659> what<00:01:52.020> you're<00:01:52.110> telling<00:01:52.530> me<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.220> a
