I just knew we had to play defense we

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.339 
I just knew we had to play defense we
had<00:00:18.099> to<00:00:18.189> get<00:00:18.310> a<00:00:18.340> stop<00:00:18.640> we<00:00:19.570> have<00:00:19.779> like<00:00:20.020> one<00:00:20.320> of

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
had to get a stop we have like one of

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.319 
had to get a stop we have like one of
the<00:00:20.529> best<00:00:20.830> goal-line<00:00:21.130> defenses<00:00:21.789> you<00:00:21.880> ask<00:00:22.060> me

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
the best goal-line defenses you ask me

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.670 
the best goal-line defenses you ask me
in<00:00:22.599> the<00:00:22.750> country<00:00:23.079> so<00:00:23.110> i<00:00:23.619> think<00:00:24.310> that<00:00:25.380> 10<00:00:26.380> yards

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
in the country so i think that 10 yards

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.830 
in the country so i think that 10 yards
and<00:00:26.919> is<00:00:27.099> it<00:00:27.340> becomes<00:00:27.669> like<00:00:27.910> how<00:00:28.419> bad<00:00:28.630> do<00:00:28.809> you

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
and is it becomes like how bad do you

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.819 
and is it becomes like how bad do you
want<00:00:28.930> it<00:00:33.989> everybody<00:00:34.989> looks<00:00:35.200> at<00:00:35.290> Dustin<00:00:35.680> it's
