and<00:01:16.509> go<00:01:17.509> ahead<00:01:17.660> and<00:01:17.840> power<00:01:17.990> it<00:01:18.140> on<00:01:18.289> reason<00:01:18.979> why

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
and go ahead and power it on reason why

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.200 
and go ahead and power it on reason why
you<00:01:19.160> want<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.340> do<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:19.550> first<00:01:19.789> is<00:01:19.940> because<00:01:20.119> you

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
you want to do this first is because you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.550 
you want to do this first is because you
would<00:01:20.330> hate<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:20.630> set<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:20.930> all<00:01:21.020> up<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.320> realize

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
would hate to set it all up and realize

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.230 
would hate to set it all up and realize
that<00:01:21.590> doesn't<00:01:22.009> work<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:22.550> does<00:01:22.700> not<00:01:22.850> work<00:01:23.030> go

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
that doesn't work it does not work go

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.400 
that doesn't work it does not work go
ahead<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.509> take<00:01:23.660> it<00:01:23.780> back<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.080> store<00:01:24.259> and

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
ahead and take it back to the store and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.600 
ahead and take it back to the store and
get<00:01:24.500> another<00:01:24.530> one<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.039> make<00:01:25.310> sure<00:01:25.490> the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
get another one and make sure the

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.310 
get another one and make sure the
program<00:01:25.789> color<00:01:26.330> modes<00:01:26.570> work<00:01:26.810> also<00:01:27.170> while

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
program color modes work also while

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.940 
program color modes work also while
you're<00:01:27.470> at<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:28.070> stage<00:01:28.310> of<00:01:28.490> it

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
you're at the stage of it

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.130 
you're at the stage of it
now<00:01:30.909> there<00:01:31.150> are<00:01:31.240> two<00:01:31.360> ways<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.690> install<00:01:31.960> this

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
now there are two ways to install this

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.960 
now there are two ways to install this
the<00:01:32.290> first<00:01:32.500> way<00:01:32.650> is<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.770> use<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.040> slider<00:01:33.820> bar

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
the first way is to use the slider bar

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.370 
the first way is to use the slider bar
metal<00:01:34.540> piece<00:01:34.690> that's<00:01:34.900> what<00:01:34.990> I'm<00:01:35.050> gonna<00:01:35.200> call

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
metal piece that's what I'm gonna call

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.010 
metal piece that's what I'm gonna call
it<00:01:35.590> put<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.220> screw<00:01:36.460> in<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:36.909> screw<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:37.900> into

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
it put the screw in and screw it into

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.149 
it put the screw in and screw it into
the<00:01:38.080> back<00:01:38.260> of<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.409> TV<00:01:38.590> which<00:01:39.010> I<00:01:39.100> don't

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
the back of the TV which I don't

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.600 
the back of the TV which I don't
recommend<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.860> if<00:01:41.979> you<00:01:42.070> already<00:01:42.250> use<00:01:42.369> the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
recommend but if you already use the

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.490 
recommend but if you already use the
slider<00:01:42.850> piece<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.300> LED<00:01:43.600> strip<00:01:43.869> slides<00:01:44.229> in

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
slider piece the LED strip slides in

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.469 
slider piece the LED strip slides in
like<00:01:44.530> so<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.159> it's<00:01:45.670> only<00:01:45.850> be<00:01:46.000> used<00:01:46.180> for<00:01:46.270> like<00:01:46.450> a

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
like so and it's only be used for like a

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.840 
like so and it's only be used for like a
wood<00:01:46.780> drywall<00:01:47.140> type<00:01:47.619> surface<00:01:47.890> something<00:01:48.670> that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
wood drywall type surface something that

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.280 
wood drywall type surface something that
can<00:01:48.940> actually<00:01:49.060> take<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.420> screw<00:01:49.780> without<00:01:49.960> being

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
can actually take a screw without being

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.200 
can actually take a screw without being
damaged<00:01:50.619> now<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.160> way<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.369> recommend<00:01:51.790> for

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
damaged now the way I recommend for

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.390 
damaged now the way I recommend for
especially<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:53.020> TV<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.440> to<00:01:53.619> use<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.950> adhesive

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
especially a TV is to use the adhesive

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.130 
especially a TV is to use the adhesive
tape<00:01:54.580> that's<00:01:54.790> included<00:01:55.240> it's<00:01:55.360> two-sided<00:01:55.990> and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
tape that's included it's two-sided and

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.320 
tape that's included it's two-sided and
you<00:01:56.860> go<00:01:57.009> ahead<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.340> put<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.670> adhesive<00:01:58.150> tape

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
you go ahead and put the adhesive tape

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.240 
you go ahead and put the adhesive tape
on<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.720> green<00:01:59.050> side<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.619> LED<00:01:59.770> strip

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
on the green side of the LED strip

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.700

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
fast-paced and then there's a sort of

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:48.560 
fast-paced and then there's a sort of
smooth<00:03:34.420> slowly<00:03:35.410> transitioning<00:03:36.070> color<00:03:36.460> mode
