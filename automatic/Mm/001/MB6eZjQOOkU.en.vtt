00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.379 
another weapon and today we're going to
be<00:00:09.780> looking<00:00:09.870> at<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.200> an-94<00:00:11.040> so<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.969> few<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.300> you

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
be looking at the an-94 so a few of you

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.730 
be looking at the an-94 so a few of you
guys<00:00:12.509> may<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:12.900> seen<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.500> trail<00:00:13.679> you

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
guys may have seen this in the trail you

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.379 
guys may have seen this in the trail you
can<00:00:13.860> see<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.099> pictures<00:00:14.400> from<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.910> trailer<00:00:15.269> on

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
can see the pictures from the trailer on

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.029 
can see the pictures from the trailer on
the<00:00:15.509> right<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:16.109> looks<00:00:16.289> very<00:00:16.379> similar<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the right it looks very similar to the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.220 
the right it looks very similar to the
ak-47<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> very<00:00:18.330> similar<00:00:18.690> gun<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.109> it

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
ak-47 and it is a very similar gun to it

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.620 
ak-47 and it is a very similar gun to it
but<00:00:19.439> we<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:19.949> actually<00:00:20.250> seen<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.670> an-94<00:00:21.210> in

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
but we have actually seen the an-94 in

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.599 
but we have actually seen the an-94 in
the<00:00:21.689> call<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.990> duty<00:00:22.230> series<00:00:22.529> before<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.400> of

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
the call of duty series before so is of

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.040 
the call of duty series before so is of
course<00:00:23.730> an<00:00:23.939> assault<00:00:24.180> rifle<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.510> she<00:00:24.630> comes<00:00:24.930> with

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
course an assault rifle a she comes with

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.630 
course an assault rifle a she comes with
two<00:00:25.260> variants<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.740> comes<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> fully

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
two variants it comes with a fully

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.670 
two variants it comes with a fully
automatic<00:00:27.029> variant<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.720> also<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> burst<00:00:28.439> fire

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
automatic variant and also a burst fire

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.290 
automatic variant and also a burst fire
variant<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.609> actually<00:00:29.820> really<00:00:29.970> strange

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
variant and it's actually really strange

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.370 
variant and it's actually really strange
because<00:00:30.420> typically<00:00:30.750> when<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.140> burst

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
because typically when we have burst

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
because typically when we have burst
fire<00:00:31.590> guns<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:31.920> think<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> m16<00:00:32.820> stuff<00:00:33.059> like

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
fire guns we think of the m16 stuff like

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.819 
fire guns we think of the m16 stuff like
that<00:00:33.210> has<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> free<00:00:33.960> round<00:00:34.110> burst<00:00:34.410> but<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.710> one

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
that has a free round burst but this one

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.799 
that has a free round burst but this one
he<00:00:34.920> actually<00:00:35.040> has<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> two-round<00:00:35.850> burst<00:00:35.969> was

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
he actually has a two-round burst was

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.959 
he actually has a two-round burst was
designed<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.590> 1980s<00:00:38.460> all<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> way<00:00:38.850> up

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
designed in the 1980s all the way up

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.490 
designed in the 1980s all the way up

first<00:00:40.649> put<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:40.950> production<00:00:41.370> hence<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> name

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
first put in production hence the name

am 94 its manufacturer was is matched a

am 94 its manufacturer was is matched a
pretty<00:00:45.030> famous<00:00:45.270> Russian<00:00:45.899> manufacturer

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
pretty famous Russian manufacturer

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.690 
pretty famous Russian manufacturer
though<00:00:46.800> pretty<00:00:46.950> much<00:00:47.129> produced<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
though pretty much produced all the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.090 
though pretty much produced all the
ak-47s<00:00:48.570> are<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> world<00:00:48.989> larrea<00:00:49.680> fire<00:00:49.890> on

the fully automatic very the variant

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.670 
the fully automatic very the variant
that<00:00:51.690> I'm<00:00:51.840> saying<00:00:52.079> we're<00:00:52.260> probably<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
that I'm saying we're probably going to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.290 
that I'm saying we're probably going to
be<00:00:52.770> seen<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.190> game<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.579> around<00:00:53.760> 600<00:00:54.239> rounds

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
be seen in the game is around 600 rounds

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.810 
be seen in the game is around 600 rounds
per<00:00:54.420> minute<00:00:54.570> pretty<00:00:55.260> typical<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.039> ak-47

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
per minute pretty typical for the ak-47

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.639 
per minute pretty typical for the ak-47
it<00:00:57.000> always<00:00:57.180> has<00:00:57.329> quite<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.719> low<00:00:57.989> fire<00:00:58.260> rate<00:00:58.289> bits

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
it always has quite a low fire rate bits

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.139 
it always has quite a low fire rate bits
pretty<00:00:58.859> high<00:00:58.980> damage<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> game<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
pretty high damage in the game on the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.180 
pretty high damage in the game on the
burst<00:01:00.780> 5<00:01:00.989> Aaron<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.530> actually<00:01:01.770> fire<00:01:02.070> up

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
burst 5 Aaron it can actually fire up

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.349 
burst 5 Aaron it can actually fire up
but<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.460> an<00:01:02.550> eighteen<00:01:02.879> hundred<00:01:03.239> rounds

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
but it's an eighteen hundred rounds

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.149 
but it's an eighteen hundred rounds
minute<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.170> that's<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.470> within<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> two

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
minute and that's just within the two

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.800 
minute and that's just within the two
rounds<00:01:05.549> their<00:01:05.670> burst<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.150> doing<00:01:06.689> some

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
rounds their burst out doing some

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.090 
rounds their burst out doing some
research<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.409> gun<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.830> actually

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
research on this gun it's actually

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.010 
research on this gun it's actually
really<00:01:08.340> quite<00:01:08.580> cool<00:01:08.820> some<00:01:09.299> things<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.869> do

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
really quite cool some things it can do

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.420 
really quite cool some things it can do
is<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.650> actually<00:01:10.680> delay<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
is that you can actually delay the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.250 
is that you can actually delay the
recoil<00:01:11.909> until<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> rounders<00:01:12.720> actually<00:01:12.990> left

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
recoil until the rounders actually left

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.899 
recoil until the rounders actually left
the<00:01:13.350> barrel<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.310> basically<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.700> just

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the barrel so it's basically that just

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.460 
the barrel so it's basically that just
means<00:01:15.030> its<00:01:15.210> way<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> reduce<00:01:15.720> recoil<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.290> i

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
means its way to reduce recoil because i

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.870 
means its way to reduce recoil because i
know<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.710> quite<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.369> would<00:01:17.580> recall

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
know this quite a lot of up would recall

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.789 
know this quite a lot of up would recall
with<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> ak-47<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.320> that'd<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.560> pretty<00:01:19.680> cool

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
with the ak-47 so that'd be pretty cool

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.320 
with the ak-47 so that'd be pretty cool
if<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.159> integrated<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.790> into<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.150> game

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
if they integrated that into the game

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.969 
if they integrated that into the game

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
finally we have the ammo that it comes

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.620
