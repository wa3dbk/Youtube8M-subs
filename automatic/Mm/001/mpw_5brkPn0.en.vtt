00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.400 
used it a lot now and now I can actually
say<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.850> my<00:02:35.850> recommendation<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.870> firmly

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
say that my recommendation is firmly

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.650

entrenched<00:02:37.890> on<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.430> lens<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.420> very

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
entrenched on this lens and it is very

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.350 
entrenched on this lens and it is very
surprising<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:41.280> took<00:02:41.489> everything<00:02:41.880> short

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
surprising and it took everything short

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.300 
surprising and it took everything short
of<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.810> loaded<00:02:43.140> weapon<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.590> my<00:02:43.739> head<00:02:44.010> to

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
of a loaded weapon to my head to

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.250 
of a loaded weapon to my head to
actually<00:02:44.760> come<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.239> conclusion<00:02:45.420> out<00:02:46.140> of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
actually come to that conclusion out of

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.259 
actually come to that conclusion out of
a<00:02:46.350> Tamron<00:02:46.830> lens<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.459> doesn't<00:02:47.760> mean<00:02:47.850> I'm

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
a Tamron lens and that doesn't mean I'm

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.830 
a Tamron lens and that doesn't mean I'm
not<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.989> Nikon<00:02:49.980> fanboy<00:02:50.670> certainly<00:02:51.540> not<00:02:51.690> the
