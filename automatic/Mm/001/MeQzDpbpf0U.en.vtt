00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
them set up in Ark survival evolved you

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.139 
them set up in Ark survival evolved you
can<00:00:44.579> ride<00:00:44.910> these<00:00:45.660> giant<00:00:46.350> frogs<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.550> it's

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
can ride these giant frogs and it's

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.970 
can ride these giant frogs and it's
going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.750> amazing<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.590> these<00:00:49.710> guys<00:00:49.920> are

going to be amazing so these guys are

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.680 
going to be amazing so these guys are
from<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.670> Late<00:00:50.879> Cretaceous<00:00:50.910> they<00:00:51.570> are

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
from the Late Cretaceous they are

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.020 
from the Late Cretaceous they are
carnivores<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.829> eat<00:00:53.010> mostly<00:00:53.219> bugs<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:53.940> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
carnivores they eat mostly bugs but of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.580 
carnivores they eat mostly bugs but of
course<00:00:54.270> will<00:00:54.390> eat<00:00:54.480> any<00:00:54.690> meat<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.199> feed<00:00:55.440> it

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590

course will eat any meat if you feed it
to<00:00:55.770> them<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.210> be

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
to them and they are going to be

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.689 
to them and they are going to be
tameable<00:00:58.020> more<00:00:58.829> importantly<00:00:59.250> they're<00:00:59.430> going

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
tameable more importantly they're going

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.720 
tameable more importantly they're going
to<00:00:59.789> be<00:00:59.879> ridable<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.520> bounce

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
to be ridable so you can just bounce

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.420 
to be ridable so you can just bounce
around<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> frog<00:01:03.680> it's<00:01:04.680> gonna<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:05.010> pretty

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
around on a frog it's gonna be pretty

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.120 
around on a frog it's gonna be pretty
weird<00:01:05.909> pretty<00:01:06.150> great<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.750> don't<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.710> think

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
this is a dangerous prospect though as

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.850 
this is a dangerous prospect though as
secretions<00:01:29.579> from<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.939> beelzebufo<00:01:30.659> skin<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.520 
secretions from the beelzebufo skin and
saliva<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> narcotic<00:01:33.659> effect<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.200> most

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
saliva have a narcotic effect on most

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.350 
saliva have a narcotic effect on most
creatures<00:01:36.650> okay<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.670> thing's<00:01:38.850> big<00:01:39.119> not

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
creatures okay so this thing's big not

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.190 
creatures okay so this thing's big not
massive<00:01:39.810> though<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.130> ride<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.930> but<00:01:42.930> it'll

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
massive though you can ride it but it'll

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.120 
massive though you can ride it but it'll
make<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:44.060> increase<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.210> torpor<00:01:45.600> level
