00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
wizard obviously is that it's pretty

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.170

easy<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.539> defeat<00:01:03.989> them<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:05.159> having<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
easy to defeat them but having the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.289 
easy to defeat them but having the
