then you take some tape fasten the edges

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.920 
then you take some tape fasten the edges
to<00:01:02.070> make<00:01:02.100> sure<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.730> your<00:01:02.910> stencil<00:01:03.420> does<00:01:03.690> not

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to make sure that your stencil does not

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.190 
to make sure that your stencil does not
move<00:01:04.199> around<00:01:04.760> grab<00:01:05.760> some<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.270> your<00:01:06.510> wire<00:01:06.840> nail

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
this type of nail works best because it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.570 
this type of nail works best because it
has<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> flatter<00:01:10.080> head<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.010> your<00:01:11.220> string

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
has a flatter head so that your string

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
has a flatter head so that your string
can<00:01:11.729> actually<00:01:12.119> catch<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.990> then

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
can actually catch on to it and then

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.960 
can actually catch on to it and then
we're<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.010> hammer<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.490> right<00:01:14.790> around

we're going to hammer this right around
the<00:01:15.479> edges<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.470> tap<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.040> three<00:01:17.070> times<00:01:17.520> make

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the edges so tap it three times make

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.940
