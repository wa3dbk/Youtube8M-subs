00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350 

I<00:00:00.089> wanted<00:00:00.810> to<00:00:00.930> do<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.170> demo<00:00:01.439> of<00:00:01.560> just<00:00:02.520> Fresnel<00:00:03.179> as

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
I wanted to do a demo of just Fresnel as

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.230 
I wanted to do a demo of just Fresnel as
a<00:00:03.389> shader<00:00:03.780> because<00:00:04.140> it's<00:00:04.290> such<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.500> flexible

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
a shader because it's such a flexible

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.390 
a shader because it's such a flexible
shader<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.629> it's<00:00:07.379> so<00:00:07.560> easy<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.980> use<00:00:08.040> and

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
shader and it's so easy to use and

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.759 
shader and it's so easy to use and
cinema<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.179> tried<00:00:09.480> finding<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.990> Fresnel<00:00:10.469> and

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
cinema I tried finding the Fresnel and

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.999 
cinema I tried finding the Fresnel and
Maya<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.120> it's<00:00:12.269> quite<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:13.049> process<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.860> get

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
Maya and it's quite a process to get

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.430 
Maya and it's quite a process to get
that<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.429> there<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.450> Fresnel<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.020> cinema

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
that in there but the Fresnel in cinema

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.620 
that in there but the Fresnel in cinema
is<00:00:16.699> awesome<00:00:17.699> because<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.119> use<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.539> on

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
is awesome because you can use it on

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.120 
is awesome because you can use it on
just<00:00:18.840> about<00:00:18.930> anything<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:19.680> very<00:00:19.890> easy

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
just about anything and it's very easy

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.820 
just about anything and it's very easy
accessible<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.869> what<00:00:21.990> Fresnel<00:00:22.439> does<00:00:22.619> is

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
accessible so what Fresnel does is

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.130 
accessible so what Fresnel does is
basically<00:00:23.039> looks<00:00:23.640> at<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.970> camera<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.570> based

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
basically looks at the camera and based

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.609 
basically looks at the camera and based
on<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> angle<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:27.029> camera<00:00:27.240> decides<00:00:28.230> where

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
on the angle of the camera decides where

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.320 
on the angle of the camera decides where
objects<00:00:29.279> are<00:00:29.340> be<00:00:29.460> shaded<00:00:29.880> right<00:00:30.029> now<00:00:30.179> we're

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
objects are be shaded right now we're

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.700 
objects are be shaded right now we're
looking<00:00:30.420> at<00:00:30.660> everything<00:00:30.900> being<00:00:31.199> shaded<00:00:31.470> by

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
looking at everything being shaded by

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.400 
looking at everything being shaded by
lights<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.369> shadows<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.570> camera<00:00:33.989> looks<00:00:34.290> at

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
lights and shadows the camera looks at

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.860 
lights and shadows the camera looks at
perspectives<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.969> shader<00:00:36.239> what's

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
perspectives but the shader what's

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.840 
perspectives but the shader what's
covering<00:00:37.230> materials<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:38.129> based<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
covering materials is not based on the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.760 
covering materials is not based on the
camera<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.899> let's<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.200> create<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.500> new

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
camera so let's just create a new

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.790 
camera so let's just create a new
material<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:42.680> one<00:00:43.680> use<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.250> Fresnel<00:00:45.090> is

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
material and one use of Fresnel is

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.369 
material and one use of Fresnel is
simply<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> tune<00:00:47.460> shader<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.870> poor<00:00:49.170> man's

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
simply as a tune shader the poor man's

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.840 
simply as a tune shader the poor man's
tuned<00:00:49.710> shaders<00:00:50.190> let's<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.640> turn<00:00:50.789> on

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
tuned shaders let's just turn on

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.549 
tuned shaders let's just turn on
luminance<00:00:51.860> select<00:00:52.860> Fresnel<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:55.079> let's<00:00:55.289> click

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
luminance select Fresnel and let's click

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.880 
luminance select Fresnel and let's click
it<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.860> sort<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.280> reverse<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.739> create<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it and sort of reverse this and create a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.540 
it and sort of reverse this and create a
really<00:00:59.219> hard<00:00:59.550> edge<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:01.440> let's<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.520> ahead

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
really hard edge and so let's go ahead

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.649 
really hard edge and so let's go ahead
and<00:01:02.670> fly<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.570> our<00:01:04.010> main<00:01:05.010> queue<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.850> you

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and fly this to our main queue and you

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.160 
and fly this to our main queue and you
will<00:01:06.780> see<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.320> has<00:01:07.350> kind<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.310> cartoon

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
will see that it has kind of a cartoon

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.510 
will see that it has kind of a cartoon
quality<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.380> preview<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> show

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
quality the preview is not going to show

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.750 
quality the preview is not going to show
it<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:12.299> when<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.570> render<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.310> basically<00:01:14.310> we're

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
it but when we render it basically we're

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.210 
it but when we render it basically we're
seeing<00:01:15.030> black<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> edge<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.170> white<00:01:16.920> words

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
seeing black on the edge and white words

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.060 
seeing black on the edge and white words
facing<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> camera<00:01:18.380> it's<00:01:19.380> far<00:01:19.710> too<00:01:19.740> much

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
facing the camera it's far too much

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.490 
facing the camera it's far too much
blacks<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.880> need<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> move<00:01:21.390> our<00:01:21.630> Fresnel<00:01:22.170> way

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
blacks we need to move our Fresnel way

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.469 
blacks we need to move our Fresnel way
over<00:01:22.979> here<00:01:23.280> give<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.240> skinnier<00:01:25.009> stroke<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
over here give it a skinnier stroke and

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.539 
over here give it a skinnier stroke and
now<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.840> sort<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.590> little<00:01:29.250> bit<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.430> a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
now you get sort of a little bit of a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.609 
now you get sort of a little bit of a
teen<00:01:29.820> shader<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> let's<00:01:31.530> apply<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.540> the

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
teen shader so let's apply it to the

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.140 
teen shader so let's apply it to the
cloner<00:01:34.619> objects<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.310> well<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:35.909> see

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
cloner objects as well and you can see

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.780 
cloner objects as well and you can see
it<00:01:36.299> how<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.869> works<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:38.189> know<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.490> did<00:01:38.670> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
it how it works you know it did it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.580 
it how it works you know it did it
various<00:01:39.210> different<00:01:39.570> angles<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.290> then<00:01:40.380> let's

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
various different angles and then let's

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.350 
various different angles and then let's
also<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.159> make<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.610> color<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.180> looks

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
also just make it a color so it looks

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.030 
also just make it a color so it looks
more<00:01:42.710> cooking<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.500> poor

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
more cooking like so it's it's a poor

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.679 
more cooking like so it's it's a poor
man's<00:01:50.250> teen<00:01:50.579> shader<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.240> obviously<00:01:51.630> not

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
man's teen shader it's obviously not

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.340 
man's teen shader it's obviously not
perfect<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.250> gives<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:54.259> kind<00:01:55.259> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
perfect but it can it gives you kind of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.609 
perfect but it can it gives you kind of
a<00:01:55.470> rough<00:01:55.770> approximation<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.880> cartoon

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
a rough approximation of a cartoon

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.310 
a rough approximation of a cartoon
because<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:58.799> looking<00:01:59.159> at<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> edges<00:02:00.320> so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
because it's looking at the edges so

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.830 
because it's looking at the edges so
that's<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:01.829> use<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> team<00:02:03.000> shader<00:02:03.540> but

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
that's one use of the team shader but

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.119 
that's one use of the team shader but
the<00:02:03.990> other<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.680> I've<00:02:04.799> used<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
the other one that I've used in this

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.589 
the other one that I've used in this
scene<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.640> download<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.270> on

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
scene that you can download is on

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.670 
scene that you can download is on
objects<00:02:10.590> if<00:02:10.739> we<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.340> straight<00:02:11.670> render

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
objects if we do just a straight render

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.949 
objects if we do just a straight render
you<00:02:13.920> can<00:02:14.069> see<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> floor<00:02:14.640> creates<00:02:15.359> this<00:02:15.480> awful

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
you can see the floor creates this awful

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.580 
you can see the floor creates this awful
looking<00:02:16.670> black<00:02:17.670> line<00:02:18.299> as<00:02:18.719> it<00:02:18.780> needs<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
looking black line as it needs the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.300 
looking black line as it needs the
horizon<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:21.060> it'd<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.299> really<00:02:21.480> nice<00:02:22.129> would<00:02:23.129> be

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
horizon so it'd be really nice would be

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.130 
horizon so it'd be really nice would be
to<00:02:23.549> apply<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:25.140> checkerboard<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.840> have<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
to apply this checkerboard and have the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.470 
to apply this checkerboard and have the
floor<00:02:28.439> fade<00:02:28.829> out<00:02:29.040> as<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.579> means<00:02:29.790> away<00:02:30.060> from<00:02:30.329> us

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
floor fade out as it means away from us

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.869 
floor fade out as it means away from us
this<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.349> a<00:02:31.379> lot<00:02:31.709> like<00:02:31.980> how<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:34.549> lake<00:02:35.549> in<00:02:35.819> the

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
this is a lot like how a lake in the

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.030 
this is a lot like how a lake in the
mountains<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.599> when<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.109> look<00:02:37.319> close<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.980> can

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
mountains is when you look close you can

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.410 
mountains is when you look close you can
see<00:02:38.340> through<00:02:38.609> it<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:38.849> when<00:02:38.969> you<00:02:39.030> look<00:02:39.150> farther

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
see through it but when you look farther

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.479 
see through it but when you look farther
away<00:02:39.629> you're<00:02:40.349> getting<00:02:40.620> more<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.859> an<00:02:40.950> angle<00:02:41.129> and

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
away you're getting more of an angle and

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.819 
away you're getting more of an angle and
it<00:02:41.549> becomes<00:02:41.760> reflective<00:02:42.139> in<00:02:43.139> this<00:02:43.319> case<00:02:43.590> we're

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
it becomes reflective in this case we're

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.280 
it becomes reflective in this case we're
going<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.010> put<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.430> Fresnel<00:02:44.969> on<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.480> Alpha

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
going to put the Fresnel on the Alpha

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.839 
going to put the Fresnel on the Alpha
Channel<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.799> I've<00:02:46.889> already<00:02:47.099> done<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.579> all

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
Channel and I've already done this all

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.099 
Channel and I've already done this all
you<00:02:48.000> have<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.389> turn<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.659> on<00:02:48.780> if<00:02:48.959> it's

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
you have to do is turn it on if it's

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.140 
you have to do is turn it on if it's
turned<00:02:50.069> off<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:51.150> looks<00:02:51.329> like<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:52.939> and<00:02:53.939> I've

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
turned off it looks like this and I've

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.530 
turned off it looks like this and I've
got<00:02:54.359> my<00:02:54.739> textures<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:55.950> if<00:02:56.939> you<00:02:57.060> turn<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.419> on

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
got my textures and if you turn it on

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.190 
got my textures and if you turn it on
the<00:02:58.319> floor<00:02:58.620> gradually<00:02:59.250> fades<00:02:59.549> out<00:02:59.819> as<00:03:00.200> it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the floor gradually fades out as it

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.309 
the floor gradually fades out as it
moves<00:03:01.409> away<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.540> i<00:03:03.569> have<00:03:03.750> another<00:03:03.989> floor

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
moves away so i have another floor

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.750 
moves away so i have another floor
underneath<00:03:04.620> here<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.129> has<00:03:05.280> like<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.489> river

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
underneath here that has like a river

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.789 
underneath here that has like a river
texture<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:07.079> can<00:03:07.200> see<00:03:07.349> it's<00:03:07.500> getting

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
texture and you can see it's getting

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.319 
texture and you can see it's getting
overwritten<00:03:10.340> actually<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.370> need<00:03:11.760> when<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.209> need

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
overwritten actually I need when I need

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.720 
overwritten actually I need when I need
to<00:03:12.540> make<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:12.989> work<00:03:13.049> better<00:03:13.469> oh<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:14.340> see<00:03:14.549> it

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
to make this work better oh I see it

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.179 
to make this work better oh I see it
turned<00:03:14.939> on<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.450> have<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.230> turn<00:03:16.379> off<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:16.950> floor

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
turned on I have to turn off this floor

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.050 
turned on I have to turn off this floor
if<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.489> want<00:03:17.669> that<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:18.030> actually<00:03:18.150> work<00:03:19.849> so<00:03:20.849> if

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
if I want that to actually work so if

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.430 
if I want that to actually work so if
there's<00:03:21.239> no<00:03:21.419> floor<00:03:21.750> under<00:03:21.989> there<00:03:22.139> then<00:03:22.319> it

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
there's no floor under there then it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.369 
there's no floor under there then it
just<00:03:22.590> kind<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.829> fades<00:03:23.190> out<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:24.290> creates<00:03:25.290> this

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
just kind of fades out and creates this

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.159 
just kind of fades out and creates this
nice<00:03:25.620> seamless<00:03:26.040> backdrop<00:03:26.819> what<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.810> was<00:03:27.959> going

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
nice seamless backdrop what I was going

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.979 
nice seamless backdrop what I was going
to<00:03:28.290> demonstrate<00:03:28.470> was<00:03:29.159> sort<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.549> how<00:03:29.819> to<00:03:30.750> make<00:03:30.959> a

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
to demonstrate was sort of how to make a

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.500 
to demonstrate was sort of how to make a
trai<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:32.189> look<00:03:32.459> like<00:03:32.669> it<00:03:32.849> more<00:03:33.030> like<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.209> river

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
trai it look like it more like a river

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.649 
trai it look like it more like a river
and<00:03:34.049> so<00:03:34.889> if<00:03:35.310> that's<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.790> case<00:03:35.970> then<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:36.419> need<00:03:36.479> to

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
and so if that's the case then I need to

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.689 
and so if that's the case then I need to
select<00:03:36.989> my<00:03:37.290> floor<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.769> I'm<00:03:37.829> going<00:03:38.099> to<00:03:38.220> invert

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
select my floor and I'm going to invert

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.030 
select my floor and I'm going to invert
the<00:03:39.540> Fresnel<00:03:40.049> so<00:03:40.199> it<00:03:40.260> becomes<00:03:40.530> transparent

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
the Fresnel so it becomes transparent

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.929 
the Fresnel so it becomes transparent
closer<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.829> then<00:03:43.829> as<00:03:44.099> we<00:03:44.430> move<00:03:44.639> away<00:03:44.790> it

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
closer and then as we move away it

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.149 
closer and then as we move away it
becomes<00:03:45.389> less<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:45.689> less<00:03:45.900> transparent<00:03:46.769> until

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
becomes less and less transparent until

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.569 
becomes less and less transparent until
it's<00:03:47.310> solid<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.930> if<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.139> return<00:03:49.319> on<00:03:49.709> reflection

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
it's solid so if I return on reflection

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.530 
it's solid so if I return on reflection
as<00:03:51.030> well<00:03:52.579> but<00:03:53.579> would<00:03:53.729> give<00:03:53.909> it<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.180> kind<00:03:54.239> of

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
as well but would give it that kind of

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.289 
as well but would give it that kind of
late<00:03:54.989> feeling<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:55.859> here<00:03:56.280> we're<00:03:56.699> as<00:03:56.849> close<00:03:56.909> to

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
late feeling so here we're as close to

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.719 
late feeling so here we're as close to
us<00:03:57.449> it's<00:03:57.780> transparent<00:03:58.470> as<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:59.159> move<00:03:59.340> away<00:03:59.489> it

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
us it's transparent as you move away it

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.999 
us it's transparent as you move away it
becomes<00:04:00.060> more<00:04:00.329> and<00:04:00.479> more<00:04:00.569> opaque<00:04:01.409> until<00:04:01.859> it's

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:02.009 
becomes more and more opaque until it's

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.909 
becomes more and more opaque until it's
reflected<00:04:03.199> and<00:04:04.199> if<00:04:04.259> they're<00:04:04.409> objects<00:04:04.769> back

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
reflected and if they're objects back

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.499 
reflected and if they're objects back
there<00:04:05.129> to<00:04:05.220> reflect<00:04:05.579> like<00:04:05.759> mountains<00:04:06.150> then<00:04:06.389> we

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:06.509 
there to reflect like mountains then we

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:09.349 
there to reflect like mountains then we
would<00:04:06.689> see<00:04:06.870> them<00:04:07.040> so<00:04:08.040> it's<00:04:08.519> really<00:04:08.699> handy<00:04:08.970> for

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
would see them so it's really handy for

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.360 
would see them so it's really handy for
things<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:09.989> fading<00:04:10.470> floors<00:04:10.829> or<00:04:11.189> making

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
things like fading floors or making

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.499 
things like fading floors or making
transparency<00:04:12.739> let's<00:04:13.739> go<00:04:13.859> ahead<00:04:13.949> and<00:04:14.509> turn

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:15.509 
transparency let's go ahead and turn

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.649 
transparency let's go ahead and turn
that<00:04:15.810> off<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.320> let's<00:04:16.470> hide<00:04:16.739> this<00:04:17.509> the<00:04:18.509> other

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
that off and let's hide this the other

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.990 
that off and let's hide this the other
thing<00:04:18.959> it's<00:04:19.139> really<00:04:19.409> good<00:04:19.590> at<00:04:19.769> is<00:04:20.009> just<00:04:20.459> basic

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
thing it's really good at is just basic

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.230 
thing it's really good at is just basic
material<00:04:21.989> design<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.550> think<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:23.849> don't<00:04:24.029> want

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
material design and I think I don't want

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.190 
material design and I think I don't want
my<00:04:24.830> floor

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
my floor

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.110 
my floor
so<00:04:28.200> if<00:04:28.440> you<00:04:28.590> just<00:04:28.800> take<00:04:29.010> straight<00:04:29.460> old<00:04:29.700> chrome

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
so if you just take straight old chrome

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.810 
so if you just take straight old chrome
or<00:04:30.690> reflective<00:04:31.650> material<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:32.250> apply<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.520> to

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
or reflective material and apply it to

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.050 
or reflective material and apply it to
say<00:04:33.030> this<00:04:33.210> object<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:35.160> really<00:04:35.340> typically

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
say this object it really typically

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.910 
say this object it really typically
doesn't<00:04:36.240> look<00:04:36.540> that<00:04:36.570> realistic<00:04:37.410> because<00:04:37.590> it's

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
doesn't look that realistic because it's

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.350 
doesn't look that realistic because it's
so<00:04:38.160> shiny<00:04:38.670> and<00:04:40.460> what<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:41.550> can<00:04:41.700> do<00:04:41.820> is<00:04:42.090> apply

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
so shiny and what you can do is apply

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.220 
so shiny and what you can do is apply
Fresnel<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.160> reflection<00:04:44.670> channel<00:04:45.230> so

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
Fresnel to the reflection channel so

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.110 
Fresnel to the reflection channel so
here<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.590> am<00:04:46.710> on<00:04:46.920> a<00:04:46.980> reflection<00:04:47.520> channel<00:04:47.910> and

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
here I am on a reflection channel and

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.870 
here I am on a reflection channel and
I'll<00:04:48.210> apply<00:04:48.480> Fresnel<00:04:49.170> and<00:04:49.550> that<00:04:50.550> makes<00:04:50.760> it

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
I'll apply Fresnel and that makes it

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.410 
I'll apply Fresnel and that makes it
opaque<00:04:51.270> in<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:53.100> foreground<00:04:53.520> or<00:04:53.880> what's

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
opaque in the foreground or what's

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.910 
opaque in the foreground or what's
painting<00:04:54.750> towards<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.350> camera<00:04:55.590> then<00:04:55.890> the

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
painting towards the camera then the

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.000 
painting towards the camera then the
edges<00:04:56.400> become<00:04:56.730> highly<00:04:57.090> reflective<00:04:57.620> so<00:04:58.620> it

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
edges become highly reflective so it

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.130 
edges become highly reflective so it
creates<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.520> much<00:04:59.790> more<00:05:00.030> realistic<00:05:00.240> feeling

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
creates a much more realistic feeling

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.980 
creates a much more realistic feeling
and<00:05:01.320> volume<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:02.010> reflection<00:05:02.670> if<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:03.720> wanted

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
and volume of reflection if you wanted

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.530 
and volume of reflection if you wanted
more<00:05:04.260> reflective<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:05.250> can<00:05:05.430> adjust<00:05:05.550> the

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
more reflective you can adjust the

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.420 
more reflective you can adjust the
Fresnel<00:05:07.020> amount<00:05:07.350> in<00:05:07.500> here<00:05:07.770> or<00:05:07.980> you<00:05:08.100> can<00:05:08.160> also

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
Fresnel amount in here or you can also

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.760 
Fresnel amount in here or you can also
just<00:05:08.730> simply<00:05:09.180> change<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.780> mixed<00:05:10.230> drink<00:05:10.500> so

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
just simply change the mixed drink so

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.890 
just simply change the mixed drink so
that<00:05:10.950> it's<00:05:11.610> almost<00:05:11.910> totally<00:05:12.540> reflective<00:05:14.900> so

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
that it's almost totally reflective so

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.600 
that it's almost totally reflective so
just<00:05:16.200> to<00:05:16.350> show<00:05:16.560> you<00:05:16.590> that<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:17.070> difference<00:05:17.460> i

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
just to show you that the difference i

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.520 
just to show you that the difference i
also<00:05:18.000> did<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.480> to<00:05:18.660> a<00:05:18.690> blue<00:05:19.020> reflective

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
also did that to a blue reflective

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.310 
also did that to a blue reflective
material<00:05:20.460> and<00:05:20.840> let's<00:05:21.840> see<00:05:21.990> what<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.170> looks

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
material and let's see what it looks

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.560 
material and let's see what it looks
like<00:05:22.470> with<00:05:22.740> and<00:05:23.010> without<00:05:23.180> Fresno<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.330> you<00:05:24.420> can

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
like with and without Fresno and you can

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.110 
like with and without Fresno and you can
see<00:05:24.780> sort<00:05:25.350> of<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:25.590> difference<00:05:25.920> so<00:05:26.130> let's<00:05:26.940> turn

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
see sort of a difference so let's turn

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.610 
see sort of a difference so let's turn
it<00:05:27.240> up<00:05:27.300> all<00:05:27.480> the<00:05:27.510> way<00:05:27.660> on<00:05:27.900> this<00:05:28.050> one<00:05:28.400> first<00:05:30.620> no

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
it up all the way on this one first no

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.960 
it up all the way on this one first no
Fresnel<00:05:32.270> so<00:05:33.270> let's<00:05:33.600> clear<00:05:33.960> this<00:05:34.170> and<00:05:34.850> it's<00:05:35.850> a

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
Fresnel so let's clear this and it's a

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.850 
Fresnel so let's clear this and it's a
blue<00:05:36.270> object<00:05:36.780> by<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:36.960> way<00:05:37.200> if<00:05:37.470> they<00:05:37.680> were<00:05:37.770> to

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
blue object by the way if they were to

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.480 
blue object by the way if they were to
look<00:05:37.980> in<00:05:38.160> here<00:05:38.400> you<00:05:38.550> can<00:05:38.670> see<00:05:38.850> it's<00:05:39.000> blue<00:05:39.390> but

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
look in here you can see it's blue but

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.450 
look in here you can see it's blue but
it's<00:05:41.490> basically<00:05:41.910> showing<00:05:42.210> up<00:05:42.420> its<00:05:42.600> chrome

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
it's basically showing up its chrome

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.610 
it's basically showing up its chrome
totally<00:05:44.460> reflective<00:05:47.540> if<00:05:48.540> i<00:05:48.720> add<00:05:48.900> Fresnel

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
totally reflective if i add Fresnel

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.330 
totally reflective if i add Fresnel
chula<00:05:49.980> this<00:05:50.520> blue<00:05:51.050> then<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.590> blue<00:05:52.890> of<00:05:53.220> the

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
chula this blue then the blue of the

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.030 
chula this blue then the blue of the
material<00:05:53.970> kind<00:05:54.120> of<00:05:54.240> shows<00:05:54.480> through<00:05:54.900> and<00:05:55.170> it

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
material kind of shows through and it

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.180 
material kind of shows through and it
becomes<00:05:56.310> a<00:05:56.550> lot<00:05:56.700> more<00:05:56.880> realistic<00:05:58.070> so<00:05:59.070> it's

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
becomes a lot more realistic so it's

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.440 
becomes a lot more realistic so it's
very<00:05:59.310> shiny<00:05:59.670> on<00:05:59.970> the<00:06:00.090> edges<00:06:00.510> but<00:06:02.180> less<00:06:03.180> shiny

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
very shiny on the edges but less shiny

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.330 
very shiny on the edges but less shiny
here<00:06:03.840> and<00:06:04.050> I<00:06:04.380> found<00:06:04.680> for<00:06:04.920> this<00:06:05.040> kind<00:06:05.280> of

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
here and I found for this kind of

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.710 
here and I found for this kind of
material<00:06:05.460> to<00:06:05.820> actually<00:06:06.000> turn<00:06:06.360> it<00:06:06.510> down<00:06:06.660> a

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
material to actually turn it down a

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.720 
material to actually turn it down a
little<00:06:06.990> bit<00:06:07.170> so<00:06:07.410> it's<00:06:07.550> more<00:06:08.550> or<00:06:08.700> less

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
little bit so it's more or less

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.940 
little bit so it's more or less
reflective<00:06:09.300> at<00:06:09.600> all<00:06:09.780> angles<00:06:10.050> but<00:06:10.440> just<00:06:10.680> less

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
reflective at all angles but just less

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.000 
reflective at all angles but just less
so<00:06:11.190> whereas<00:06:11.550> facing<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.060> camera<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:13.140> so<00:06:13.920> it

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
so whereas facing the camera and so it

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.490 
so whereas facing the camera and so it
can<00:06:14.160> create<00:06:14.400> a<00:06:14.490> very<00:06:14.790> realistic<00:06:15.600> kind<00:06:16.110> of<00:06:16.200> blue

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
can create a very realistic kind of blue

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.590 
can create a very realistic kind of blue
shape<00:06:16.860> that<00:06:17.100> changes<00:06:17.640> depending<00:06:18.300> on<00:06:18.420> where

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
shape that changes depending on where

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.720 
shape that changes depending on where
the<00:06:18.690> camera<00:06:19.050> is<00:06:19.880> so<00:06:20.880> that's<00:06:21.000> use<00:06:21.240> of<00:06:21.390> Fresnel
