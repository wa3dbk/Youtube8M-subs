it's gonna work

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.880 
it's gonna work
we'll<00:00:54.000> try<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.239> out<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.570> I'm<00:00:55.079> thinking<00:00:55.710> it'll

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
we'll try it out also I'm thinking it'll

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.340 
we'll try it out also I'm thinking it'll
cut<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> lot<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> glare<00:00:56.760> off<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> off<00:00:58.170> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
cut a lot of the glare off of the off of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.619 
cut a lot of the glare off of the off of
the<00:00:58.440> snow<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.039> that's<00:00:59.670> where<00:00:59.910> I'm<00:01:00.059> kind<00:01:00.539> of

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the snow so that's where I'm kind of

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.840 
the snow so that's where I'm kind of
most<00:01:00.899> excited<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.260> use<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.500> filter<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:02.670> soon
