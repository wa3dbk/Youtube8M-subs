00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
porygon is I don't know I always

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.100 
porygon is I don't know I always
imagined<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.329> if<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.750> went<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
imagined it like if you went to the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.959 
imagined it like if you went to the
computer<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.070> know<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.370> Tron<00:00:35.730> Legacy

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
computer like you know in Tron Legacy

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.910 
computer like you know in Tron Legacy
that<00:00:36.809> there'd<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.079> pouring<00:00:37.500> guns<00:00:37.649> floating

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that there'd be pouring guns floating

around<00:00:38.129> all<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> lakes<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:39.390> they'll<00:00:39.989> come

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
around all the lakes what they'll come

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.900 
around all the lakes what they'll come
to<00:00:40.290> think<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.739> I'm<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.129> sure<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.340> saw<00:00:41.640> too

boxes oh yeah but he's so ugly like
really<00:01:21.000> bad<00:01:21.240> graphics<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.140> look<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.800> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
really bad graphics and look I know I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.639 
really bad graphics and look I know I
know<00:01:23.369> he's<00:01:23.729> man-made<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.450> he's<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.840> rough

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
know he's man-made but he's so rough

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.520 
know he's man-made but he's so rough
like<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> work<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.520> progress<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.090> know<00:01:27.530> you're

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
like a work in progress you know you're

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
like a work in progress you know you're
like<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.800> dumb<00:01:29.130> genius<00:01:29.729> that's<00:01:30.060> true

porygon first evolution is an analog for

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
the evolution of 3d graphics especially

the evolution of 3d graphics especially
the<00:01:34.350> concept<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.830> subdivision<00:01:35.460> surfaces<00:01:35.910> oh

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
the concept of subdivision surfaces oh

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.930 
the concept of subdivision surfaces oh
is<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.710> what<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.280> start<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
is that what you like to start with the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.310 
is that what you like to start with the
crude<00:01:39.180> shape<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.960> use<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
crude shape and then you use like a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.320 
crude shape and then you use like a
weird<00:01:40.590> mesh<00:01:40.920> thing<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.460> divide<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.820> polygons

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
weird mesh thing to divide the polygons

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.730 
weird mesh thing to divide the polygons
into<00:01:42.570> smaller<00:01:42.899> shapes<00:01:43.229> until<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.590> looks

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
into smaller shapes until it looks

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.219 
into smaller shapes until it looks
smooth<00:01:44.130> why<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.840> read<00:01:46.110> it

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
smooth why do you know that I read it

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.029 
smooth why do you know that I read it
read<00:01:46.770> it

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
read it

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.859 
read it
yeah<00:01:47.369> pretty<00:01:47.850> interested<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.300> smoothness

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
yeah pretty interested in smoothness

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.540 
yeah pretty interested in smoothness
that's<00:01:49.410> why<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.710> pouring<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.070> too<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.430> much

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
that's why I like pouring on too so much

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.700 
that's why I like pouring on too so much
he's<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.940> way<00:01:51.390> smooth<00:01:51.950> smooth<00:01:52.950> point<00:01:53.520> oh

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
he's like way smooth smooth point oh

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.930 
he's like way smooth smooth point oh
well<00:01:55.710> when<00:01:56.009> you're<00:01:56.160> right<00:01:56.310> you're<00:01:56.490> right<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
well when you're right you're right and

pretty<00:02:28.670> sketch<00:02:29.030> for<00:02:29.300> how<00:02:29.360> vague<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.050> oh<00:02:30.319> it

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
pretty sketch for how vague it is oh it

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.009 
pretty sketch for how vague it is oh it
is<00:02:31.459> what's<00:02:32.060> probably<00:02:32.330> gonna<00:02:32.420> happen<00:02:32.840> when<00:02:32.959> you

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
is what's probably gonna happen when you

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.509 
is what's probably gonna happen when you
put<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> weird<00:02:33.380> disc<00:02:33.590> in<00:02:33.739> your<00:02:33.830> computer<00:02:34.250> you

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
put a weird disc in your computer you

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.000 
put a weird disc in your computer you
get<00:02:34.790> viruses<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:35.780> look<00:02:35.930> how<00:02:36.050> weird<00:02:36.319> porygon<00:02:36.680> Z

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
get viruses and look how weird porygon Z
