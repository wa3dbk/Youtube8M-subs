probably<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.850> biggest<00:00:33.149> thing<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.540> would

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
probably the biggest thing I would

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.720 
probably the biggest thing I would
recommend<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:34.710> much<00:00:34.890> research<00:00:34.950> on

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
recommend is to do as much research on

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.069 
recommend is to do as much research on
different<00:00:35.910> types<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.510> bikes<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.960> they're

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
different types of bikes what they're

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.770 
different types of bikes what they're
looking<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.770> bike<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:39.030> components

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
looking for in a bike the components

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.319 
looking for in a bike the components

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
that exists on bikes around them the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.170 
that exists on bikes around them the
class<00:00:42.840> will<00:00:43.110> reveal<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.040> lot<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> different

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
bike is a bicycle rides so I started

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.910 
bike is a bicycle rides so I started
here<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.640> know<00:00:53.760> warmed<00:00:54.210> up<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.600> inside<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
here you know warmed up the inside of it

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.400 
here you know warmed up the inside of it
so<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.910> bottom<00:00:57.390> portion<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.199> your

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
so that the bottom portion was in your

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.979 
so that the bottom portion was in your
heat<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.980> got<00:00:59.730> close<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.840> could

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
heat I got close here so that I could

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.200 
heat I got close here so that I could
spread<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.500> heat<00:01:01.649> all<00:01:01.859> over<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.969> then<00:01:03.059> when<00:01:03.180> I

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
spread the heat all over and then when I

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.010 
spread the heat all over and then when I
began<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:04.080> did<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> run<00:01:05.010> across<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.640> side<00:01:06.020> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
began I I did a run across this side and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.270 
began I I did a run across this side and
I<00:01:07.140> came<00:01:07.350> over<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.770> did<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> run<00:01:08.159> across

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
I came over here and did a run across

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.399 
I came over here and did a run across
this<00:01:08.700> side<00:01:08.970> being<00:01:09.210> careful<00:01:09.570> not<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.869> go<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.020> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
this side being careful not to go on to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.950 
this side being careful not to go on to
the<00:01:10.530> seat<00:01:10.799> tube<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.430> then<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.510> hit<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> little

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the seat tube and then I hit a little

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.359 
the seat tube and then I hit a little
bit<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.200> heat<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.619> back<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.979> make<00:01:14.130> sure

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
bit of heat in the back to make sure

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.230 
bit of heat in the back to make sure
it's<00:01:14.520> across

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
it's across

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.300 
it's across
generally<00:01:16.960> warmed<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.410> area<00:01:17.710> again<00:01:17.830> so<00:01:18.250> it

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
generally warmed the area again so it

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.990 
generally warmed the area again so it
had<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:18.490> nice<00:01:18.700> fill<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:21.130> bike<00:01:21.310> I'm<00:01:21.490> building<00:01:21.880> is

geometry<00:02:02.860> works<00:02:03.580> with<00:02:03.790> what<00:02:04.030> bike<00:02:04.330> so<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.860> was

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
geometry works with what bike so it was

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.880 
geometry works with what bike so it was
really<00:02:06.250> helpful<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.640> review<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.800> for<00:02:08.800> me

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890

I<00:02:08.920> found<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.340> brazing<00:02:09.820> aspect<00:02:10.510> of<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:10.720> because

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
I found the brazing aspect of it because

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.260 
I found the brazing aspect of it because
of<00:02:11.080> my<00:02:11.320> soldering<00:02:12.070> background<00:02:12.580> in<00:02:12.880> metals<00:02:13.180> and

of my soldering background in metals and

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.900 
of my soldering background in metals and
jewelry<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:14.170> be<00:02:14.290> easier<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.550> part<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:15.850> I

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
jewelry to be easier and the part that I

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.810 
jewelry to be easier and the part that I
like<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.180> most<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:17.500> single-speed<00:02:18.160> cross<00:02:18.550> bike

interested in making custom lugs

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.870 
interested in making custom lugs
I<00:02:37.950> started<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.040> little<00:02:39.220> project<00:02:39.790> right<00:02:39.970> here

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
I started this little project right here

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.960 
I started this little project right here
project<00:02:41.300> took<00:02:41.780> several<00:02:42.770> days<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.460> I<00:02:43.700> wasn't

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
project took several days so I wasn't

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.790 
project took several days so I wasn't
able<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.270> kind<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.480> finish<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.260> couple<00:02:45.710> of

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
able to kind of finish the couple of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.240 
able to kind of finish the couple of
jobs<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.700> decided<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.540> go<00:02:47.750> with<00:02:47.960> these<00:02:48.830> which

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
jobs so I decided to go with these which

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.820 
jobs so I decided to go with these which
I<00:02:49.670> thought<00:02:50.660> gave<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.900> better<00:02:51.140> look<00:02:51.350> for<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.590> cross

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
I thought gave a better look for a cross

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.020 
I thought gave a better look for a cross
lake<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:53.720> here<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:53.960> had<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.380> cut<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:54.950> lugs<00:02:55.760> down

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
lake and here I had to cut the lugs down

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.210 
lake and here I had to cut the lugs down
and<00:02:56.540> merge<00:02:56.990> them<00:02:57.230> together<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.860> create<00:02:57.890> a

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
and merge them together to create a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.050 
and merge them together to create a
single<00:02:58.460> look<00:02:59.180> the<00:03:00.110> front<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:01.580> industry

because it is very hard in terms of the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.020 
because it is very hard in terms of the
time<00:03:30.860> commitment<00:03:31.190> that<00:03:31.460> you<00:03:31.550> have<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:31.820> have<00:03:32.000> I

different<00:04:04.660> techniques<00:04:04.960> but<00:04:05.890> I<00:04:06.160> would

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
different techniques but I would

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.010 
different techniques but I would
recommend<00:04:06.430> that<00:04:06.730> people<00:04:06.910> have<00:04:07.240> a<00:04:07.630> good

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
make the dropout to work and he said

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.170 
make the dropout to work and he said
what<00:05:38.050> one<00:05:38.289> thing<00:05:38.439> you<00:05:38.530> could<00:05:38.710> do<00:05:38.889> is<00:05:39.159> make<00:05:39.460> them

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
what one thing you could do is make them

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.550 
what one thing you could do is make them
curved<00:05:40.449> I'm<00:05:40.689> like<00:05:40.840> how<00:05:40.960> hard<00:05:41.169> would<00:05:41.229> that<00:05:41.289> be

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
curved I'm like how hard would that be

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.559 
curved I'm like how hard would that be
and<00:05:41.770> what<00:05:42.159> he<00:05:42.219> said<00:05:42.400> to<00:05:42.610> me<00:05:42.729> was<00:05:42.969> that'd<00:05:43.300> be<00:05:43.330> too

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:43.569 
and what he said to me was that'd be too

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.110 
and what he said to me was that'd be too
hard<00:05:43.780> for<00:05:43.870> you<00:05:44.139> so<00:05:44.830> I<00:05:44.860> I<00:05:45.009> guess<00:05:45.490> I<00:05:45.610> just<00:05:45.639> abandon

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
hard for you so I I guess I just abandon

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.670 
hard for you so I I guess I just abandon
the<00:05:46.210> idea<00:05:46.240> and<00:05:46.539> so<00:05:46.659> I<00:05:46.719> borrowed<00:05:46.900> up<00:05:47.080> with<00:05:47.469> Doug

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
the idea and so I borrowed up with Doug

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.369 
the idea and so I borrowed up with Doug
who<00:05:47.949> said<00:05:48.159> it's<00:05:48.310> completely<00:05:48.490> possible<00:05:49.379> so

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:50.379 
who said it's completely possible so

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:52.550 
who said it's completely possible so
then<00:05:50.560> I<00:05:50.680> just<00:05:50.710> write<00:05:51.400> it<00:05:51.520> ran<00:05:51.669> with<00:05:51.849> it<00:05:51.879> really

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
then I just write it ran with it really

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.279 
then I just write it ran with it really
it's<00:05:54.090> incredibly<00:05:55.090> hard<00:05:55.389> to<00:05:55.539> do<00:05:55.689> everything

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
it's incredibly hard to do everything

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.689
