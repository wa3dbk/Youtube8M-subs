of<00:00:14.519> those<00:00:14.580> personal<00:00:15.030> conversations<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.900> have

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
of those personal conversations you have

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.410 
of those personal conversations you have
when<00:00:16.379> when<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> real<00:00:17.010> tough<00:00:17.279> situation<00:00:17.550> like

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
we love this sport and so I think our

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.590 
we love this sport and so I think our
sports<00:01:07.560> where<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.040> because<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> NASCAR<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
sports where it is because of NASCAR and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.130 
sports where it is because of NASCAR and
the<00:01:10.590> way<00:01:10.740> they<00:01:10.890> handle<00:01:11.189> things<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.900> so<00:01:12.900> this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the way they handle things and so this

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.740 
the way they handle things and so this
was<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> tough<00:01:13.740> one<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:13.950> us<00:01:14.540> but<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
was a tough one for us but as I

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.590 
was a tough one for us but as I
mentioned<00:01:16.790> sometimes<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.150> life<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.360> go

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
mentioned sometimes in life you go

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.260 
mentioned sometimes in life you go
through<00:01:18.810> tough<00:01:18.990> things<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.560> don't<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:19.799> it

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
through tough things you don't like it

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
through tough things you don't like it
but<00:01:21.270> we're<00:01:21.540> certainly<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> try<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
but we're certainly going to try and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.660

the right way I haven't haven't talked

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.920 
the right way I haven't haven't talked
about<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.270> no<00:01:30.450> idea<00:01:32.750> what<00:01:33.750> else

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
about that I have no idea what else

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.969 
about that I have no idea what else
NASCAR<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.770> planning<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.610> were<00:01:35.820> really

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
NASCAR is planning we just were really

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.230 
NASCAR is planning we just were really
with<00:01:37.979> them<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.280> morning<00:01:38.670> trying<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> handle

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
with them this morning trying to handle

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.399 
with them this morning trying to handle
this<00:01:39.360> weekend<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.750> Michael<00:01:43.200> had

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
this weekend and I think Michael had

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.999 
this weekend and I think Michael had
been<00:01:43.649> our<00:01:43.979> cars<00:01:44.310> before<00:01:45.110> has<00:01:46.110> raised<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:46.530> for

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
been our cars before has raised some for

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.760 
been our cars before has raised some for
us<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:48.450> actually<00:01:48.869> been<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.200> car<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.649> we

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
us and actually been in the car so we

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.690 
us and actually been in the car so we
kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.040> felt<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:51.119> such<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> short<00:01:51.750> notice

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
kind of felt like in such a short notice

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.550 
kind of felt like in such a short notice
we<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.909> him<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.180> lot<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.110> he's<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> great

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
we like him a lot we think he's a great

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.359 
we like him a lot we think he's a great
person<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.810> think<00:01:57.930> he<00:01:58.229> was<00:01:58.380> kind<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.250> a

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
person and so I think he was kind of a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.090 
person and so I think he was kind of a
natural<00:02:00.090> choice<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.329> us<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.710> right<00:02:01.860> now

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
natural choice for us I think right now

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.550 
natural choice for us I think right now
we're<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.700> trying<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.560> first

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
