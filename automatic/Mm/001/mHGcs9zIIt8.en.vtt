00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.930
 except for Kulik's best broken ankle, there's still two months left 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.469
 The Borussia Danner and Geese had to replace the championship without 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.759
 these three decided 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.039
 the more the others got involved in Berti Vogt's point 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.269
 laid by Volkart 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.269
 Free kick by Wittkamp the thrust 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.900
 he brought Heinke is a clear scorer 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.619
 initially a lot of things went wrong at Borussia the team seemed to be down 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.619
 to lack the strength and concentration of the Milanese game 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.790
 to defeat the HSV 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.540
 Still, Europe did not find Brunotte the right measure either 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.540
 later from her best side 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.170
 prepared the first hit 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.710
 and as always by return pass operated he even brought the ball itself over 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.710
 the line 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.910
 but now urged the HSV of a wait-and-see defensive attitude 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.140
 did not seem to hold much but attacked for long stretches 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.590
 scenes of this kind still remained rare had its reason 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.560
 Hamburg was missing a playmaker 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.790
 an organizer in midfield but especially in the defense that showed up 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.790
 at the latest at 2 2 0 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.930
 the flank given the actual preparatory work APA Brunotte done in the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.930
 Repetition we see the final phase 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.210
 the folks devalue today in the 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.490
 alternately space and you also cover third before the continuation of the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.900
 Attacking game 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.600
 the free man 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.300
 Competition of Vorstopper Gladbachs 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.300
 moving 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.940
 Stihl corner 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.940
 from 25 meters 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:14.119
 this meeting appears 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.099
 so depressed 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.759
 tried to turn over another hit 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:41.389
 Targus more and more nervous could grab this ball just before 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.029
 Op Karan had fallen 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.169
 the scene again 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.169
 like the structure another gate 4 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:54.169
 after the change, the HSV appeared composed and reached by Korbach 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.049
 after Stevic to slips 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.049
 already at 1 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:06.109
 Form weaknesses and here too numerous injuries Nokia now Volkert had 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.329
 substituted 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.870
 the stronger Borussia convincing now also the op a test here on the ball 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:14.869
 against HIV 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:16.819
 and then Kappel 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.819
 4 to 1 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.749
 of the HSV 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.470
 but in this attack again the combination Heinke Scope and behold 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.349
 home is 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:54.959
 none of the HSV 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.959
 and for a long time 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:05.299
 if a test but so continue today 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.169
 after this pass from 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.629
 against cold 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.999
 Back pass to destination 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.679
 Sachs was 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:17.679
 because you consider that Heinz RÃ¼hmann 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:36.449
 Silov's last goal for Borussia will be in the next session 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.879
 Play Alemannia Aachen
