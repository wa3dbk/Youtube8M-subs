sweating more and the pain is less than
the<00:01:07.460> way<00:01:07.610> proceeding<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:08.540> right<00:01:08.750> there<00:01:08.960> my

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140

set on pressing for whatever reason and

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.020 
set on pressing for whatever reason and
at<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:29.990> point<00:01:30.290> after<00:01:30.500> probably<00:01:31.250> four<00:01:31.550> sets<00:01:31.850> I

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
at that point after probably four sets I

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.330 
at that point after probably four sets I
kind<00:01:32.300> of<00:01:32.360> realized<00:01:32.780> it's<00:01:33.650> not<00:01:33.950> going<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.220> get

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
kind of realized it's not going to get

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.380 
kind of realized it's not going to get
better<00:01:34.400> then<00:01:35.390> I'll<00:01:35.510> go<00:01:35.720> with<00:01:35.900> a<00:01:36.200> man<00:01:36.950> time<00:01:37.250> or<00:01:37.850> a

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
better then I'll go with a man time or a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.600 
better then I'll go with a man time or a
two<00:01:38.660> board<00:01:38.950> usually<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.009> like<00:01:40.039> to<00:01:40.190> start<00:01:40.520> with

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
two board usually I like to start with

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.290 
two board usually I like to start with
foam<00:01:40.970> first<00:01:41.590> see<00:01:42.590> if<00:01:42.679> that's<00:01:42.920> if<00:01:43.190> that<00:01:43.940> helps

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
foam first see if that's if that helps

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.910 
foam first see if that's if that helps
it<00:01:44.450> because<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:44.869> does<00:01:45.080> for<00:01:45.350> price<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:45.649> it

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
it because it does for price and it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.050 
it because it does for price and it
gives<00:01:46.070> me<00:01:46.190> a<00:01:46.220> little<00:01:46.340> bit<00:01:46.520> more<00:01:46.700> range<00:01:46.940> of

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
gives me a little bit more range of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.029 
gives me a little bit more range of
motion<00:01:47.119> before<00:01:48.110> why<00:01:48.380> we're<00:01:48.590> going<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:48.979> a

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
motion before why we're going to a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.520 
motion before why we're going to a
hardboard<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.360> this<00:01:50.539> would<00:01:50.720> be<00:01:50.899> just<00:01:50.990> for

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
hardboard and this would be just for

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.230 
hardboard and this would be just for
regular<00:01:52.100> events<00:01:52.460> that's<00:01:52.670> not<00:01:52.880> for<00:01:53.119> back

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
regular events that's not for back

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.630 
regular events that's not for back
separate<00:01:53.660> work<00:01:53.840> or<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.740> board<00:01:55.039> or<00:01:55.340> any<00:01:55.520> of<00:01:55.580> the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
dynamic work that I program going I've

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.200

single board to be able to work around

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.890 
single board to be able to work around
that<00:02:13.430> injury<00:02:13.790> because<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.510> last<00:02:14.690> couple

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
that injury because the last couple

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.570 
that injury because the last couple
inches<00:02:15.170> while<00:02:15.890> they<00:02:16.010> aren't<00:02:16.190> important

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
they're not going to make that much

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.510 
they're not going to make that much
difference<00:02:17.770> because<00:02:18.770> whatever<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.250> put<00:02:19.490> on
