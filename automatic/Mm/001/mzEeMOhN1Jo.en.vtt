00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
of those projects is how can we use

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.100 
of those projects is how can we use

is an expert on UAVs unmanned aerial
vehicles<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:31.410> learned<00:00:31.619> from<00:00:32.000> BP<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.480> spring

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
vehicles we learned from BP the spring

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.310 
vehicles we learned from BP the spring
that<00:00:34.710> they<00:00:35.040> had<00:00:35.280> these<00:00:35.430> aircraft<00:00:35.870> but<00:00:36.870> because

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that they had these aircraft but because

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.290 
that they had these aircraft but because
BP<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> company<00:00:38.070> they<00:00:38.820> were<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.120> going<00:00:39.270> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
BP is a company they were not going to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.389 
BP is a company they were not going to
be<00:00:39.390> able<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> permissions<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.800> get<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
be able to get the permissions to get a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.940 
be able to get the permissions to get a
airspace<00:00:41.940> permit<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.420> do<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.600> kind<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.809> work

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
airspace permit to do this kind of work

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.680 
airspace permit to do this kind of work
so<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.789> thought<00:00:44.940> hey<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> research

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
so we thought hey this is a research

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.930 
so we thought hey this is a research
project<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.320> really<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:47.039> operationally

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
project it's really not operationally

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.970 
project it's really not operationally
ready<00:00:48.210> yet<00:00:48.510> that's<00:00:48.809> that's<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.410> would<00:00:49.590> love<00:00:49.770> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
ready yet that's that's we would love to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.920 
ready yet that's that's we would love to
help<00:00:50.070> them<00:00:50.309> figure<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.610> how<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.600> ease<00:00:51.719> about

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
help them figure out how is ease about

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.380 
help them figure out how is ease about
what<00:00:52.230> technology<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.770> suitable<00:00:53.309> help<00:00:54.210> them

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
what technology is suitable help them

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.000 
what technology is suitable help them
help<00:00:54.750> them<00:00:54.960> understand<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.590> limits<00:00:55.920> are

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
help them understand what the limits are

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.549 
help them understand what the limits are
and<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.340> benefits<00:00:56.879> are<00:00:57.379> it's<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> great
