sir all the holes line up perfect no
problem<00:03:09.180> at<00:03:09.330> all<00:03:10.910> wasn't<00:03:11.910> sure<00:03:12.120> if<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.300> was

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
problem at all wasn't sure if that was

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.940 
problem at all wasn't sure if that was
going<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.870> work<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.319> but<00:03:13.709> anyway<00:03:15.319> off<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.380> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
going to work it but anyway off to the

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:39.890 
going to work it but anyway off to the
next<00:03:17.099> step<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:17.760> guess<00:03:38.090> already<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.209> one<00:03:39.630> more

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
next step I guess already a one more

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.330 
next step I guess already a one more
screw<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.739> it's<00:03:40.920> in<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.370> really<00:03:41.610> tight<00:03:41.819> spot<00:03:43.340> so

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
screw and it's in a really tight spot so

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.210 
screw and it's in a really tight spot so
how<00:03:44.910> I'm<00:03:45.030> going<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.269> get<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.720> these<00:03:46.680> stupid

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
how I'm going to get that these stupid

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.890 
how I'm going to get that these stupid
things<00:03:47.250> aren't<00:03:47.880> magnetic<00:03:48.540> because<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.840> think

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
things aren't magnetic because I think

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.640 
things aren't magnetic because I think
they're<00:03:49.290> stainless<00:03:49.620> steel<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:52.200> anyway<00:03:52.530> I'm

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
they're stainless steel that anyway I'm

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.440 
they're stainless steel that anyway I'm
going<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:52.859> pause<00:03:53.070> on<00:03:53.430> come<00:03:53.910> back<00:03:53.940> and

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
going to pause on come back and

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.509 
going to pause on come back and
hopefully<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:55.200> can<00:03:55.320> find<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.890> way<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.070> get<00:03:56.310> that

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
hopefully I can find a way to get that

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.670 
hopefully I can find a way to get that
in<00:03:56.760> there<00:03:59.120> so<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.150> have<00:04:00.390> all<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.750> screws<00:04:01.079> put<00:04:01.440> in

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
in there so I have all the screws put in

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.610 
in there so I have all the screws put in
and<00:04:03.769> she's<00:04:04.769> in<00:04:04.980> there<00:04:05.160> nice<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.489> tight<00:04:06.590> now<00:04:07.590> my

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
and she's in there nice and tight now my

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.170 
and she's in there nice and tight now my
next<00:04:08.190> problem<00:04:08.640> is<00:04:10.160> I'm<00:04:11.420> gonna<00:04:12.420> need<00:04:14.120> at<00:04:15.120> least

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
next problem is I'm gonna need at least

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.610 
next problem is I'm gonna need at least
one<00:04:15.959> for<00:04:16.500> now<00:04:16.729> sada<00:04:17.750> connector<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:19.760> this

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
one for now sada connector and this

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.159 
one for now sada connector and this
proprietary<00:04:22.620> or<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:24.389> don't<00:04:24.810> know<00:04:24.930> if<00:04:25.020> its

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
proprietary or I don't know if its

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.570 
proprietary or I don't know if its
proprietary<00:04:25.889> but<00:04:26.220> it's<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.580> small<00:04:28.580> power

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
proprietary but it's a small power

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.950 
proprietary but it's a small power
supply<00:04:30.500> only<00:04:31.500> has<00:04:31.830> molex<00:04:32.520> so<00:04:32.940> I'm<00:04:33.630> going<00:04:33.900> to

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
supply only has molex so I'm going to

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.750 
supply only has molex so I'm going to
have<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.080> scrounge<00:04:34.500> around<00:04:34.830> see<00:04:35.310> if<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.550> can

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
have to scrounge around see if I can

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.800 
have to scrounge around see if I can
find<00:04:35.970> at<00:04:36.210> least<00:04:36.360> one

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.689 

adapter<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:41.050> know<00:04:41.289> I<00:04:41.469> have<00:04:41.830> one<00:04:42.129> around<00:04:42.430> here

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
adapter I know I have one around here

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.740 
adapter I know I have one around here
somewhere<00:04:42.759> so<00:04:44.159> I'll<00:04:45.159> come<00:04:45.520> back<00:04:45.759> after<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.360> find

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
somewhere so I'll come back after I find

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.969 
somewhere so I'll come back after I find
it<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:48.629> hopefully<00:04:49.629> like<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.229> said<00:04:50.439> I<00:04:50.469> can<00:04:50.740> find

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
it and hopefully like I said I can find

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.730 
it and hopefully like I said I can find
the<00:04:51.099> damn<00:04:51.340> thing<00:04:51.930> well<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.080> was<00:04:53.199> a<00:04:53.229> pain<00:04:53.500> in<00:04:53.530> the

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
the damn thing well it was a pain in the

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.860 
the damn thing well it was a pain in the
butt<00:04:53.979> but<00:04:54.610> I<00:04:54.669> just<00:04:54.969> get<00:04:55.150> through<00:04:55.360> modifying

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
butt but I just get through modifying

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.760 
butt but I just get through modifying
the<00:04:56.349> original<00:04:56.889> power<00:04:57.099> supply<00:04:58.110> what<00:04:59.110> I<00:04:59.139> did<00:04:59.439> was

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
the original power supply what I did was

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.429 
the original power supply what I did was
I<00:05:00.009> took<00:05:00.879> the<00:05:01.780> guts<00:05:02.050> out<00:05:02.469> of<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:02.979> regular<00:05:04.439> ATX

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:05.439 
I took the guts out of a regular ATX

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:11.969 
I took the guts out of a regular ATX
power<00:05:05.770> supply<00:05:06.310> like<00:05:06.580> this<00:05:06.849> one<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.870> I<00:05:11.710> put

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
power supply like this one and I put

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.219 
power supply like this one and I put
them<00:05:12.069> in<00:05:12.219> here<00:05:12.669> luckily<00:05:13.449> the<00:05:13.750> board<00:05:13.990> was

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
them in here luckily the board was

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.110 
them in here luckily the board was
exactly<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:14.979> same<00:05:15.310> size<00:05:15.699> and<00:05:16.240> I'm<00:05:17.169> hoping<00:05:17.650> the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
exactly the same size and I'm hoping the

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.170 
exactly the same size and I'm hoping the
confined<00:05:19.120> space<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.529> less<00:05:21.250> air<00:05:21.610> flow<00:05:22.680> want<00:05:23.680> to

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
confined space and less air flow want to

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.269 
confined space and less air flow want to
make<00:05:25.180> it<00:05:25.360> overheat<00:05:25.960> I'm<00:05:26.650> thinking<00:05:27.009> it

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:27.279 
make it overheat I'm thinking it

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.360 
make it overheat I'm thinking it
probably<00:05:27.819> won't<00:05:28.090> but<00:05:28.900> if<00:05:29.259> it<00:05:29.500> does<00:05:29.740> then<00:05:30.159> I'll

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
probably won't but if it does then I'll

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.260 
probably won't but if it does then I'll
just<00:05:30.400> I<00:05:31.560> know<00:05:32.560> drill<00:05:33.279> a<00:05:33.310> few<00:05:33.400> holes<00:05:33.879> in<00:05:34.180> the

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
just I know drill a few holes in the

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.200 
just I know drill a few holes in the
damn<00:05:34.479> thing<00:05:34.870> or<00:05:35.050> something<00:05:35.319> I<00:05:35.620> don't<00:05:35.680> know<00:05:36.210> try

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
damn thing or something I don't know try

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.559 
damn thing or something I don't know try
it<00:05:37.270> it<00:05:37.449> anyway<00:05:38.219> so<00:05:39.219> now<00:05:39.610> all<00:05:39.639> I<00:05:39.849> have<00:05:40.120> to<00:05:40.150> do<00:05:40.449> is

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:40.569 
it it anyway so now all I have to do is

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:46.920 
it it anyway so now all I have to do is
clean<00:05:40.870> up<00:05:41.080> this<00:05:41.259> fan<00:05:41.620> and<00:05:44.370> put<00:05:45.370> it<00:05:45.460> back<00:05:45.639> on<00:05:45.930> try

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
clean up this fan and put it back on try

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.140 
clean up this fan and put it back on try
right

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.360 

already<00:05:51.080> so<00:05:51.440> I<00:05:51.470> don't<00:05:51.770> know<00:05:51.950> if<00:05:52.040> you'll<00:05:52.190> be

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
already so I don't know if you'll be

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.030 
already so I don't know if you'll be
able<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.670> hear<00:05:52.790> me<00:05:53.180> or<00:05:53.330> not<00:05:53.560> this<00:05:54.560> thing's<00:05:54.860> a

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
able to hear me or not this thing's a

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.610 
able to hear me or not this thing's a
little<00:05:55.160> loud<00:05:55.490> with<00:05:55.940> the<00:05:56.090> side<00:05:56.360> panel<00:05:56.960> off<00:05:57.140> but

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
little loud with the side panel off but

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.710 
little loud with the side panel off but
you<00:05:58.630> can<00:05:59.630> see<00:06:00.530> that<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:01.340> hackintosh<00:06:02.240> is

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
you can see that the hackintosh is

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.400 
you can see that the hackintosh is
working<00:06:03.140> pretty<00:06:03.350> good<00:06:03.500> and<00:06:04.930> this<00:06:05.930> is<00:06:06.200> the

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
working pretty good and this is the

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.570 
working pretty good and this is the
rebuilt<00:06:06.950> power<00:06:07.490> supply<00:06:08.150> with<00:06:08.860> the<00:06:09.860> guts<00:06:10.130> from

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
rebuilt power supply with the guts from

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:17.460 
rebuilt power supply with the guts from
a<00:06:11.000> full-size<00:06:11.990> ATX<00:06:12.920> in<00:06:13.250> it<00:06:13.660> I<00:06:14.660> don't<00:06:15.440> tell<00:06:16.220> but

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
a full-size ATX in it I don't tell but

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.670 
a full-size ATX in it I don't tell but
this<00:06:18.470> one<00:06:18.770> is<00:06:19.040> one<00:06:19.340> of<00:06:19.460> those<00:06:19.640> many<00:06:20.680> towers

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
this one is one of those many towers

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.460 
this one is one of those many towers
it's<00:06:22.310> a<00:06:22.640> lot<00:06:23.480> narrower<00:06:23.870> than<00:06:24.260> a<00:06:24.680> ATX<00:06:25.550> power<00:06:26.470> so

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
it's a lot narrower than a ATX power so

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.300 
it's a lot narrower than a ATX power so
my<00:06:28.130> final<00:06:28.840> touch<00:06:29.840> on<00:06:30.260> this<00:06:30.560> is<00:06:31.430> I<00:06:31.730> took<00:06:32.450> off<00:06:32.720> the

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
my final touch on this is I took off the

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.700 
my final touch on this is I took off the
original<00:06:34.310> sticker<00:06:35.240> with<00:06:35.690> all<00:06:35.900> the<00:06:36.080> specs<00:06:36.440> for

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
original sticker with all the specs for
