00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.810
 as you say inside the video today I'm going 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.110
 to be teaching 5 nail designs are 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.780
 these 5 that I have here and they really are 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.390
 super cute super easy and super fast 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.379
 to do if you like them a lot 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.860
 give you the nails to make designs that 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.680
 other pretty as this is super 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.300
 perfect for you to me I really 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.199
 love to paint the nails 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.229
 I have a lot of glazes and I like it 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.589
 invent make me designs since I have 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:59.780
 so many colors because I make designs 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.699
 I really liked the first one the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.290
 second and the third are the ones that 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.510
 how I liked them and maybe I have 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.280
 I would have liked it all but 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.350
 I did not keep the others all 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.390
 they were as I wanted but still 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.909
 they are super cute 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.440
 everyone knows I loved them so if 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.190
 you want to know how it is done 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.680
 follow me 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.070
 first let's paint our nails the 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.960
 color that we like more then we go to 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.100
 open a skewer that has the tip of a 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.100
 side and the other not 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.210
 and not 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.810
 let's take the enamel and do 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.810
 dots 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.340
 be careful if your enamel is medium 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.619
 dry as it happened to me I was made a 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.510
 long strip and I got a little dirty 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.150
 base enamel 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:02:02.090
 now let's make like stripes with the 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:04.240
 part that does not have a point and we do what 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.240
 same 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:18.150
 the second one I 'm more beautiful for 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.600
 second they are also flowers but they are 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.520
 different in this let's make faults 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.660
 and then we will put a dot 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.660
 yellow in the middle 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.180
 for me this is the easiest of all 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.740
 like not much 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.740
 two 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.310
 this is a bit complicated we are going to 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.020
 fill the top of the nail 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.620
 White 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.620
 ah 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.710
 two 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.190
 first let's take the part that does not 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.540
 has a spike and we are going to make 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.540
 like three stripes 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.769
 this is another super easy and it is very 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.060
 cute you just have to make stripes 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.150
 with tasks 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.150
 and 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.980
 yes 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.980
 Y 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.330
 yes 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.040
 Y 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.580
 It is noble 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.290
 and for the last I started doing the 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.410
 small green dots but I realized later 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.620
 that you should start doing the black thing like that 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.940
 that starts black and then do the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.940
 little dots above 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.930
 and 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.270
 two 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.770
 and that's how our real hands are 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.590
 that is super easy superchulo to me 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.080
 they all liked but the topics 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:02.090
 loved using my favorites were the 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.770
 first the second and the fourth I love them 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.849
 but today I hope that you 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.099
