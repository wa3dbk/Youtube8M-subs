cardigan<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.729> don't<00:01:43.060> think<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.330> can<00:01:43.479> have<00:01:43.690> enough

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
cardigan I don't think I can have enough

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.080 
cardigan I don't think I can have enough
of<00:01:44.260> these<00:01:44.470> things<00:01:44.799> I<00:01:45.040> got<00:01:45.310> in<00:01:45.460> a<00:01:45.580> size<00:01:45.760> small

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
of these things I got in a size small

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.219 
of these things I got in a size small
this<00:01:46.690> was<00:01:46.960> originally<00:01:47.640> 4990<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.000> was<00:01:49.420> 12

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
this was originally 4990 and it was 12

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.760 
this was originally 4990 and it was 12
99<00:01:50.740> but<00:01:51.310> it's<00:01:51.430> kind<00:01:51.640> of<00:01:51.700> about<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:52.030> batwing

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
99 but it's kind of about a batwing

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.140 
99 but it's kind of about a batwing
three-quarter<00:01:53.770> sleeve<00:01:54.040> to<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.549> and<00:01:54.820> I<00:01:54.970> just

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
three-quarter sleeve to it and I just

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.880 
three-quarter sleeve to it and I just
thought<00:01:55.210> this<00:01:55.450> would<00:01:55.659> be<00:01:55.690> good<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.350> throw<00:01:56.560> over

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
thought this would be good to throw over

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.100 
thought this would be good to throw over
stuff<00:01:57.460> because<00:01:57.939> I<00:01:57.970> tend<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.390> do<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.780> lot

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
stuff because I tend to do that a lot

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.600 
stuff because I tend to do that a lot
apparently<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.920> don't<00:02:00.070> know<00:02:00.280> if<00:02:00.400> you<00:02:00.490> can

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
apparently I don't know if you can

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.210 
apparently I don't know if you can
really<00:02:00.790> go<00:02:00.970> wrong<00:02:01.000> with<00:02:01.299> a<00:02:01.710> $13<00:02:02.710> sweater<00:02:03.010> from

because<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.350> thought<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.770> same<00:02:37.950> thing<00:02:37.980> when<00:02:38.280> I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
because I thought the same thing when I

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.759 
because I thought the same thing when I
saw<00:02:38.550> pictures<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.360> online<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.410> kind<00:02:40.709> of

lingerie<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.310> guess<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.970> think<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:45.660> because<00:02:45.840> of

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
lingerie I guess I think it's because of

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.890 
lingerie I guess I think it's because of
like<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.590> lace<00:02:47.250> trimming<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.630> has<00:02:48.660> the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
like the lace trimming so it has the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.140 
like the lace trimming so it has the
lace<00:02:49.110> at<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.380> hem<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.980> dress<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:50.580> well<00:02:50.880> but

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
lace at the hem of the dress as well but

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.300 
lace at the hem of the dress as well but
this<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:52.080> actually<00:02:52.350> really<00:02:52.800> really

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
this is actually really really

this is actually really really
comfortable<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.780> think<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.290> looks<00:02:55.319> really

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560

cute<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.580> one<00:02:56.760> has<00:02:57.030> kind<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:57.660> a

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
cute and this one has kind of like a

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.490

tartan<00:02:58.860> plaid<00:02:59.459> pattern<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.019> then<00:03:01.260> I

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
tartan plaid pattern on it and then I

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.250 
tartan plaid pattern on it and then I
realized<00:03:02.310> when<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.580> was<00:03:02.670> trying<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.330> on<00:03:03.480> at<00:03:03.959> home

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
realized when I was trying it on at home

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.309 
realized when I was trying it on at home
that<00:03:04.319> it<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.180> reversible<00:03:06.180> whatever<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.140> price

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
that it is reversible whatever the price

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.650 
that it is reversible whatever the price
was<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.680> was<00:03:07.769> marked<00:03:08.010> up<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.220> 39<00:03:08.580> 99<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.420> then<00:03:09.450> I

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
was it was marked up to 39 99 and then I

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.770 
was it was marked up to 39 99 and then I
got<00:03:09.840> for<00:03:10.079> 1999<00:03:11.030> which<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.209> think<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.570> a

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
got for 1999 which I think it is a

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.170 
got for 1999 which I think it is a
little<00:03:13.170> bit<00:03:13.350> expensive<00:03:13.739> for<00:03:13.920> what<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:15.150> i

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
little bit expensive for what it is so i

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.030

originally was 5990 which i think is a

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.500 
originally was 5990 which i think is a
little<00:04:41.830> bit<00:04:42.160> expensive<00:04:42.460> it's<00:04:43.000> more<00:04:43.300> than<00:04:43.450> I

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
little bit expensive it's more than I

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.080 
little bit expensive it's more than I
would<00:04:43.840> normally<00:04:43.870> spend<00:04:44.380> on<00:04:44.740> accessories<00:04:45.400> but

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
would normally spend on accessories but

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.120 
would normally spend on accessories but

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.030 
in color with the lapels on it I think
it<00:06:23.390> looks<00:06:23.420> really<00:06:23.630> good<00:06:24.170> and<00:06:24.230> surprisingly<00:06:24.920> it

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
it looks really good and surprisingly it

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.490 
it looks really good and surprisingly it
fits<00:06:25.280> me<00:06:25.460> like<00:06:25.490> a<00:06:25.700> glove<00:06:25.790> is<00:06:26.480> a<00:06:26.540> size<00:06:26.870> medium<00:06:26.900> so

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
fits me like a glove is a size medium so

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.590 
fits me like a glove is a size medium so
I<00:06:27.530> think<00:06:27.620> it<00:06:27.830> runs<00:06:27.980> really<00:06:28.370> small<00:06:28.850> but<00:06:29.150> it<00:06:29.420> is

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
I think it runs really small but it is

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.240 
I think it runs really small but it is
roomy<00:06:30.020> enough<00:06:30.050> for<00:06:30.410> me<00:06:30.530> to<00:06:30.620> wear<00:06:30.770> like<00:06:30.980> one

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
roomy enough for me to wear like one

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.310 
roomy enough for me to wear like one
thick<00:06:31.490> sweater<00:06:31.820> with<00:06:32.060> it<00:06:32.240> which<00:06:32.630> is<00:06:32.810> perfect

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
thick sweater with it which is perfect

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.770 
thick sweater with it which is perfect
the<00:06:33.800> only<00:06:34.130> downside<00:06:34.340> to<00:06:34.670> it<00:06:34.730> is<00:06:35.000> the<00:06:35.240> pockets

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
the only downside to it is the pockets

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.140 
the only downside to it is the pockets
are<00:06:35.960> faux<00:06:36.650> pockets<00:06:37.280> like<00:06:37.490> they<00:06:37.700> just<00:06:37.910> like

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
are faux pockets like they just like

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
look like there's a pocket there's no

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.860 
look like there's a pocket there's no

pocket to it so I always stick my hands
in<00:06:41.960> pockets<00:06:42.350> though<00:06:42.470> I<00:06:42.620> don't<00:06:42.680> like<00:06:43.370> that<00:06:43.670> so
