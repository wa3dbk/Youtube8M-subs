00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
seen before anyway so pretty much what

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.300 
seen before anyway so pretty much what
you<00:00:25.140> want<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.590> when<00:00:26.010> you're<00:00:26.130> playing

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
you want to do is when you're playing

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.670 
you want to do is when you're playing
this<00:00:26.490> mission<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:27.210> find<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:28.080> just<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> build

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
this mission you find what just to build

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.470 
this mission you find what just to build
on<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> ground<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.220> don't<00:00:29.369> exactly<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.390> to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
on the ground you don't exactly have to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.450 
on the ground you don't exactly have to
do<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.750> one<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.619> then<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:31.890> fast<00:00:32.099> forwarded

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
do this one but then it's fast forwarded

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.560 
do this one but then it's fast forwarded
over<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:32.820> because<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.059> does<00:00:33.149> take<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> bit<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
over here because it does take a bit of

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.030 
over here because it does take a bit of
time<00:00:33.719> sometimes<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> wait<00:00:34.620> until<00:00:34.770> your

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
time sometimes but you wait until your

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.709 
time sometimes but you wait until your
killstreaks<00:00:35.489> available<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.090> then<00:00:36.360> once<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
killstreaks available and then once it

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.290 
killstreaks available and then once it
is<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.579> actively<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> killstreak<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.180> as

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
is you actively the killstreak and as

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.790 
is you actively the killstreak and as
you're<00:00:39.480> doing<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.989> pick<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> weapon

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you're doing that you pick up the weapon

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.950 
you're doing that you pick up the weapon
and<00:00:41.430> what's<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> do

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and what's that what that's going to do

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.119 
and what's that what that's going to do
is<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.469> take<00:00:43.590> your<00:00:43.680> tablet

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
out and you have to exit the the kill

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.319 
out and you have to exit the the kill
Street<00:00:47.129> really<00:00:47.370> quick<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.550> you're<00:00:48.059> pretty

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
Street really quick that you're pretty

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.790 
Street really quick that you're pretty
much<00:00:48.390> holding<00:00:48.629> your<00:00:48.870> tablet<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.469> hands

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
much holding your tablet in your hands

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200 
much holding your tablet in your hands
and<00:00:49.950> then<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.610> walk<00:00:50.820> around<00:00:50.969> with

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and then you can just walk around with

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.400 
and then you can just walk around with
it<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.390> can't<00:00:51.600> shoot<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:51.930> anything<00:00:52.199> then<00:00:52.350> you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
it you can't shoot or anything then you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.959 
it you can't shoot or anything then you
have<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> pretty<00:00:52.770> much<00:00:52.920> get<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.850> map

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
have to pretty much get out of the map

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.459 
have to pretty much get out of the map
so<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.210> jump<00:00:54.420> from<00:00:54.510> those<00:00:54.719> barrels<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
so you jump from those barrels to that

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.200 
so you jump from those barrels to that
tower<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.010> jump<00:00:56.730> into<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> water

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
tower right there jump into the water

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.090 
tower right there jump into the water
and<00:00:57.480> then<00:00:57.899> there's<00:00:58.199> kind<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.770> giant

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
and then there's kind of like a giant

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.529 
and then there's kind of like a giant
thing<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.180> all<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
thing that you have to do to get all the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
thing that you have to do to get all the
way<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.690> an<00:01:00.899> area<00:01:01.079> where<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:02.039> actually

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
way to an area where you can actually

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.860 
way to an area where you can actually
pick<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> signal<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> soccer<00:01:03.480> game<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
pick up the signal of the soccer game I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.020 
pick up the signal of the soccer game I
guess<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> could<00:01:04.140> say<00:01:04.439> silver<00:01:05.369> here<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.790> just

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
guess you could say silver here you just

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.270 
guess you could say silver here you just
get<00:01:06.180> into<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:06.900> your<00:01:07.380> kill<00:01:07.860> Street<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.159> get

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
get into you or your kill Street you get

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.000 
get into you or your kill Street you get
one<00:01:08.490> kill<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.090> exit<00:01:09.560> it's<00:01:10.560> necessary<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
one kill then you exit it's necessary to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.530 
one kill then you exit it's necessary to
get<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.460> kill<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.850> then<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.390> pretty

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
get that one kill and then you pretty

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.880 
get that one kill and then you pretty
much<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:13.110> no<00:01:13.350> gun<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.590> your<00:01:13.680> hands

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
running around like for some reason

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.240
