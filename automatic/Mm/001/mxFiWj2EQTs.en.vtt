00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.209
 I do 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:14.269
 The man did not work out so well 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:20.000
 Today I try to turn off the putin 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:29.360
 the already since I think forever in the 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:32.329
 rest will be from you yes I'm just one 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.850
 a bit dependent on artificial light because 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.289
 As I said, I have already d turned dad 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.510
 and that every time got crappy 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.760
 is I just start times so my 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.479
 Hair like most people know very rocky 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.179
 and calm and not so maximilian me 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:50.780
 used to have totally straight hair and then 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:53.359
 you get curly and yes 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.929
 every case my skin remembers him 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.789
 Quite often I have to say I have 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.889
 not any for years or so 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.319
 but I am currently on like 

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:06.049
 my hair really look better 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:09.799
 leaves as usual and it was I use 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.050
 At the moment, this is the good thing 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.110
 So jersey your book of lush for 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.370
 I find dry hair smells very good 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.860
 very pleasant in my opinion 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:25.280
 with coco and jasmine then I use 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:32.090
 if so from lush a second 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:37.330
 shampoo always alternately fix I would have 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.330
 These cans can not be on this box 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.090
 to buy such a stupid dose again 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.380
 for it spent three euros and him too 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.240
 I'll get it on under the shower too 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.979
 me on in this box is the miracle 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.039
 create 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.289
 that was wrong and that on dried 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.380
 it does not smell as great as the other one 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.940
 but it is definitely good for 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.610
 dry at least for mine 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.140
 dry then my absolute 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.370
 wonderful product that I now I believe 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.310
 for a year and a half or so 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.010
 consistently use and what I mean 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:25.470
 Hair is so getting in the handle 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:29.030
 the berner artist from badischer 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.739
 So what really works for me ? 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.480
 is feasible 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.950
 I looked at youtube me 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.170
 do not even know her name and 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.519
 totally recommended now because it is not 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.319
 Silicone contains word trade radar has 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.540
 Somehow many great things I've got myself 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.250
 always bought and for the first time mask 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.370
 used so 30 minutes to act 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.769
 and I've always been totally crazy 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.049
 thrilled as years makes it totally soft 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.410
 and supple and to that, too 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.180
 still great so man I am now 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.609
 I only use it as a conditioner 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.290
 sometimes as a mask and I can 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.299
 really really recommend it yes 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.980
 not at all finished and it is times 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.900
 a miracle product saved at all 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.810
 because I believe I have five euros 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.730
 for 250 milliliters and it really is one 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.620
 my absolute favorite product and 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.510
 i could not recreate this topic 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.500
 recorded my hair is routine 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.810
 somehow of lush a skin cream the 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.010
 one after washing the hair 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:34.019
 massaged into the dry hair and in it 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.599
 lets look so slightly yellowish 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.250
 green 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.390
 it smells nice a bit 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.400
 I'll just stop it 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.709
 I am also very beautiful 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.770
 product is relatively expensive you do not have to 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.750
 but I definitely think of everyone 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.420
 case that is worth the money 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.250
 those are the things that I so in the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.220
 shower bedside users directly 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.830
 I generally only have my hair under 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.740
 the shower afterwards not at all or only with 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.590
 a rough coarse came shake 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.060
 Actually - head over and over 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.060
 I only wash my hair in the evening and at night 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.709
 then let them dry overnight what 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.580
 else I have to care I do 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.019
 very long time that marc cain uses 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.310
 there was a third bottle you 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.950
 bought from it 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.730
 it is very expensive and is a real one 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.530
 strong silicone bomb but it has up 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.450
 every case a great one for the moment 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.550
 Effect that makes years so total 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.430
 shiny and pretty and supple and 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.540
 also smells like a judge at the beginning 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.760
 maybe a bit weird but it 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.000
 intel wants such a fresh air in 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.890
 the hair and i thought it was great though 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.580
 It's just a silicone in the judgment 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.470
 no nurse effect that's why I am 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.640
 of it now the bottle is now 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.790
 almost empty I believe that only one 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.720
 little rest in it if I am 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.550
 now switched to pure argan oil 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.030
 is there in the reformhaus the bottle is yes 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.280
 also relatively expensive I think 125 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.390
 milliliters for 23 euros 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.680
 but with me it is also in any case 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.580
 I also do it well 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.430
 Into the arms 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.860
 towel dry hair tips mostly 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.060
 and then let it go in there sometimes 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.979
 unfortunately I'm a bit much pure 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.450
 and get a bit ready but it 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.610
 not even a hair falls at all 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:28.630
 notice that are otherwise so bone dry 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.950
 the field not at all but 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.260
 Generally I have to my hair 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.610
 They say they are really dry 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.159
 are 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.389
 and because I have them each for a long time 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:41.340
 day has smoothed because I have my job 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:44.759
 and I have them earlier 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.699
 constantly tinted and colored and without 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.409
 Heat protection treats all sorts of things 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.719
 Products purely clapped my hair 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.060
 So you could actually do the whole thing 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.889
 cut off here are there you 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.710
 sometimes it never makes you very bad 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.439
 tiptoi or kill 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.780
 the hell you do your hands on yes 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:05.219
 this is about a hair routine i hope 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.199
 I was able to maybe start something 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:09.719
 In any case, this banner condition 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:15.110
 stop my absolute favorite product 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:15.110
 see you next time
