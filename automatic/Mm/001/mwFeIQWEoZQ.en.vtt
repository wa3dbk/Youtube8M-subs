 Dear colleagues and colleagues, On behalf of the General Hospital and the Faculty of Nuclear Medicine at the University of Bonn I am pleased to welcome you 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 The topic is a new e-learning program attended by Medigrads 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 The aim is to prepare colleagues who wish to follow up on their profession or work in Germany 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 This, of course, requires learning the German medical language you will learn in this program 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 We will also try to offer you some opportunities for specialization and training 

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:55.314
 Second, Germany is one of the most important supporters of international exchange 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 For example, the German Science Exchange offers opportunities for 50,000 students a year 

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:14.636
 There is also another body called Alexander von Hambold supporting and targeting scientific researchers in the medical field and others 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Through this program, we wanted to develop the ability of your understanding with German doctors to help you gain opportunities in Germany 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 All of this you can join remotely through our new software program 

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:42.970
 This means that before you come to Germany and before presenting you with any chance of specialization we will bring you to overcome the obstacles of understanding with doctors 

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:47.970
 This includes much more than what you have learned in language courses at the Goethe-Institut 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 It is very important that there are many colleagues who are fluent in German in general 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 But they do not know the medical language properly 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:16.220
 This program will bring you to follow up your competence in Germany
