00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.049
 Imagine 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.949
 how is the skeleton of a dinosaur? 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.989
 I do not think you can imagine. 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.429
 Parasaurolophus. Height 9 meters and weight 2,000 kg. 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.879
 We believe that this crest helps him to cultivate vegetation and production 

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:31.380
 sounds. To break his bone 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.610
 I would need the weight of a truck. 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.660
 Instead, 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.540
 to break a rabbit's bone is very easy, as easy as it is 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.190
 breaking a piece of glass. They have very small bones 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.040
 and very fragile. 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.260
 Roger, what's your name? Messi. 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.660
 And you know what Messi would suffer if he fell from the table down? 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.850
 Same thing if they would get rid of your hands. 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.589
 To stay! I'll show you a little schema a 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.050
 the rabbit bone system. 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.059
 Their skeleton consists of 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.230
 skull, 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.020
 cervical vertebrae, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.940
 the back paws and the front paws. You know why cats 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.000
 resist falls from high heights without it 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.350
 nothing, and the rabbits at the lowest heights 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.360
 can they break everything? 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.780
 Because the bones of the cats are very flexible and, undoubtedly, 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.509
 of rabbits 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.050
 are very rigid. 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.720
 As I said before, just like glass. 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.250
 The bones that break out most often are the large bones of the limbs, 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.500
 such as humerus, cubit and radius, 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.860
 femur and tibia.
