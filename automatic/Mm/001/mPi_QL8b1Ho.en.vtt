that can easily be seen on the video so

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:55.470 
that can easily be seen on the video so
for<00:02:45.290> example<00:02:50.830> this<00:02:51.830> one

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:06.860 

let<00:02:56.410> me<00:02:56.830> measure<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.900> you<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:03.519> length<00:03:03.849> is

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:18.650 

10<00:03:07.870> inches<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.780> base<00:03:11.080> is<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:16.120> base<00:03:16.450> is

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
10 inches and the base is the base is

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.000 
10 inches and the base is the base is
1/8<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:20.140> an<00:03:21.010> inch<00:03:21.280> wide<00:03:21.959> so<00:03:22.959> that's<00:03:23.260> how<00:03:23.530> small

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
1/8 of an inch wide so that's how small

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.080 
1/8 of an inch wide so that's how small
it<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.840> what<00:03:26.049> I'm<00:03:26.170> gonna<00:03:26.349> do<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:28.290> roll<00:03:30.090> this

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
it is so what I'm gonna do is roll this

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.140 
it is so what I'm gonna do is roll this
paper<00:03:31.950> using<00:03:34.110> using<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.260> metal<00:03:35.620> roller<00:03:36.150> so

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
paper using using the metal roller so

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.680 
paper using using the metal roller so
