00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
where's another plane that's far away i

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.140 
where's another plane that's far away i
wanna<00:01:25.229> i<00:01:26.430> want<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.490> show<00:01:27.610> everybody<00:01:27.820> what

wanna i want to show everybody what
another<00:01:28.509> plane<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:29.140> real<00:01:29.350> plane<00:01:29.710> looks<00:01:29.979> like

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
another plane a real plane looks like

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.490 
another plane a real plane looks like
with<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.460> blinkers<00:01:30.909> what<00:01:31.840> is<00:01:31.960> that<00:01:32.200> that's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
with the blinkers what is that that's

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.920 
with the blinkers what is that that's
not<00:01:32.680> its<00:01:32.860> satellite<00:01:33.310> whoa<00:01:34.180> wait<00:01:34.540> where'd<00:01:34.780> it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
not its satellite whoa wait where'd it

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.370 
not its satellite whoa wait where'd it
go<00:01:35.049> I<00:01:35.080> lost<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.770> so<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.609> lost<00:01:36.969> it<00:01:37.329> what<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.990> hell

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
is this still going did it make a turn

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.679 
is this still going did it make a turn
it's<00:01:41.380> going<00:01:41.740> slow<00:01:42.299> we're<00:01:44.039> we're<00:01:45.039> young<00:01:45.340> I

I wanna lose it over here all right
there's<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.620> blinkin<00:01:57.070> plane<00:01:57.310> see<00:01:57.640> the

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
there's a blinkin plane see the

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.450 
there's a blinkin plane see the
difference<00:01:58.120> between<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.630> two<00:01:58.810> of<00:01:58.840> them<00:01:59.460> where

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
difference between the two of them where

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:08.490 
difference between the two of them where
we're<00:02:01.020> way<00:02:02.020> up<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:06.460> can't<00:02:07.210> on<00:02:07.510> and<00:02:07.660> see<00:02:07.810> if<00:02:07.840> that

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
we're way up I can't on and see if that

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.470 
we're way up I can't on and see if that
thing<00:02:09.010> like<00:02:09.280> went<00:02:09.550> way<00:02:09.850> up<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.210> they<00:02:10.300> came

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
thing like went way up and they came

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.990 
thing like went way up and they came
back<00:02:10.660> then<00:02:10.960> I<00:02:12.660> don't<00:02:13.660> know<00:02:13.750> where<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.200> now

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.600 

well<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:20.050> that's<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.860> second<00:02:21.250> one<00:02:21.370> for<00:02:21.550> a
