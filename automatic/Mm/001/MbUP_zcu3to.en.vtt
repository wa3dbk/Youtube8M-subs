they're trying to show off here is the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.039 
they're trying to show off here is the
new<00:00:13.799> design<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.910> they're<00:00:15.299> using<00:00:15.599> for<00:00:15.750> their

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
new design that they're using for their

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.840 
new design that they're using for their
keyboard<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.010> usually<00:00:17.369> they<00:00:17.490> just<00:00:17.670> had<00:00:17.820> a

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
keyboard so usually they just had a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.870 
keyboard so usually they just had a
standard<00:00:18.330> trench<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.609> iPad<00:00:20.609> would<00:00:20.789> have

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
standard trench that the iPad would have

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880 
standard trench that the iPad would have
slide<00:00:21.090> into<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:22.289> then<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.500> can<00:00:22.619> just<00:00:22.769> you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
slide into and then you can just you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.410 
slide into and then you can just you
know<00:00:22.949> easily<00:00:23.310> flip<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.760> out<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.029> fold<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.390> back

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
know easily flip it out and fold it back

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.269 
know easily flip it out and fold it back
down<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:24.810> now<00:00:24.930> they're<00:00:25.080> doing<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.980> kind<00:00:26.220> of

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
down but now they're doing this kind of

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.140 
down but now they're doing this kind of
pressure<00:00:27.560> hold<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:29.880> easily

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
pressure hold so you can just easily

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.780 
pressure hold so you can just easily
pull<00:00:30.570> out<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> iPad<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.669> can

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
pull out the iPad like that and you can

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.540 
pull out the iPad like that and you can
pop<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.660> back<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:34.010> just<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.460> it's

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
pop it back in just like that and it's

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.000 
pop it back in just like that and it's
not<00:00:35.610> gonna<00:00:35.870> pop<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.320> old<00:00:37.530> trench

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
not gonna pop out like the old trench

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.190 
not gonna pop out like the old trench

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
design did he also get 135 degree

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.830 
design did he also get 135 degree
viewing<00:00:40.410> angle<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.489> well<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:41.910> backlit

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
metal material so it actually matches

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.130

keyboard<00:00:51.300> around<00:00:51.899> over<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:54.050> we<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
keyboard around over here we have a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.760 
keyboard around over here we have a
actual<00:00:56.129> full<00:00:56.430> case<00:00:56.879> design<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.780> set<00:00:58.739> up

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
actual full case design so it's set up

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.430 
actual full case design so it's set up
for<00:00:58.890> drop<00:00:59.340> testing<00:00:59.730> on<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> corners<00:01:00.570> zags

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
for drop testing on the corners zags

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.910 
for drop testing on the corners zags
hasn't<00:01:01.770> said<00:01:02.090> exactly<00:01:03.090> how<00:01:03.239> much<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:04.409> far<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
hasn't said exactly how much or far of a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.710 
hasn't said exactly how much or far of a
drop<00:01:05.100> it'll<00:01:05.400> survive<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.299> they<00:01:06.390> did<00:01:06.540> say<00:01:06.689> that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
drop it'll survive but they did say that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.690 
drop it'll survive but they did say that
they<00:01:06.869> did<00:01:07.110> do<00:01:07.260> drop<00:01:08.010> testing<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.610> will

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
they did do drop testing on it and will

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.550 
they did do drop testing on it and will
survive<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.210> basically<00:01:09.810> what<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.530> just

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
survive so basically what you do is just

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
survive so basically what you do is just
pop<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.040> guy<00:01:11.130> backwards<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.000> then<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.510> pull

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
pop this guy backwards and then you pull

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.300 
pop this guy backwards and then you pull
at<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.170> edges<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.280> just

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
at the edges like that and you can just

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.120 
at the edges like that and you can just
take<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> mini<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.259> pop

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
take out the mini like that and then pop

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.499 
take out the mini like that and then pop
it<00:01:17.250> back<00:01:17.280> together<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.790> again<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.119> has<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it back together and again this has the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.770 
it back together and again this has the
same<00:01:18.689> kind<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.710> 135<00:01:20.610> degree<00:01:20.880> viewing<00:01:21.299> angle<00:01:21.450> as

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
same kind of 135 degree viewing angle as

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.840 
same kind of 135 degree viewing angle as
well<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.159> backlit<00:01:23.460> keyboard

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
well as you can see the backlit keyboard

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.590 
well as you can see the backlit keyboard
both<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.840> gonna<00:01:24.990> go<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.350> $99<00:01:26.820> zags

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
both of these are gonna go for $99 zags

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.380 
both of these are gonna go for $99 zags
actually<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> reduce<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.890> price<00:01:29.040> of
