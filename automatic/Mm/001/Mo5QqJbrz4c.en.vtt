00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.600 

it<00:06:43.810> was<00:06:43.990> so<00:06:44.139> you<00:06:44.349> know<00:06:44.470> actually<00:06:45.099> some<00:06:45.430> of<00:06:45.520> it

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
it was so you know actually some of it

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.270 
it was so you know actually some of it
was<00:06:45.699> quite<00:06:45.759> moving<00:06:46.180> I<00:06:46.389> think<00:06:47.039> you<00:06:48.039> know<00:06:48.160> the

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
was quite moving I think you know the

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.159 
was quite moving I think you know the
result<00:06:48.610> was<00:06:48.729> what<00:06:48.940> was<00:06:49.629> intended<00:06:49.930> originally

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
result was what was intended originally

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.659 
result was what was intended originally
I<00:06:50.560> think<00:06:50.889> and<00:06:51.039> that's<00:06:51.099> great

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 
I think and that's great

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:53.670 
I think and that's great

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
particularly the Ives has a certain

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.010 
particularly the Ives has a certain
point<00:06:53.919> in<00:06:54.009> see<00:06:54.190> when<00:06:54.370> actually<00:06:55.180> the<00:06:55.539> trumpeter

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
point in see when actually the trumpeter

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.060 
point in see when actually the trumpeter
is<00:06:56.610> hundreds<00:06:57.610> of<00:06:57.669> miles<00:06:57.849> away
