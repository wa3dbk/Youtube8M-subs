00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:24.149
 I greet you on the channel sim girls I 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.739
 I think now is the time to start 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.019
 preparing for the new year 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:31.489
 today we will make some Christmas decorations 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.850
 decorations we need colored paper 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:40.890
 thread color matching colored paper 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:43.609
 scissors sewing needle and string of beads and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.589
 beads matching each other 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:52.050
 bright colored beads are so shiny 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:56.100
 for Christmas balls and thin 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.999
 wire and beads matching color 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.120
 this wire 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:02.940
 In addition, we also need an adhesive 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.070
 colored pencil and hot glue 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.490
 paper and cut out rectangles 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.420
 arbitrary size I have this one 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.799
 centimeter two and a half centimeters 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:21.869
 each rectangle is folded in half and 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:24.979
 cut the corners now glue it 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.979
 our thread 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:42.369
 make the next triangle i will 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:44.750
 alternate colors when sticking 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:49.060
 triangles make sure that they 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.590
 were turned in one direction 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.280
 glue triangles until 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.450
 the garland will not be for the desired length 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.090
 that's all this thing we have done to 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.780
 we need to make Christmas beads 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.350
 beads and beads matching each other 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.019
 color string them on a string 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.200
 arbitrary sequence with this 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.690
 I secure the sides in a knot with this 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:27.290
 sides when i reach the desired length 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:32.180
 I tack the needle and cling 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.079
 it turns out the knot tightly stitched 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.079
 cut off 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:45.410
 it turns out such beads to make 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.959
 Christmas balls we need wire 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.790
 This wire is special for crafts from 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.730
 beads and it is sold accordingly 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.370
 in the same place where the wire beads need 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.900
 thin enough which 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.790
 twisting will go into beads we need 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.590
 cut a small piece of take 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.810
 some round thing i take 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.000
 knitting needle well it could be another round 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.410
 an item such as a kebab stick or 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.410
 something else and so here 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.410
 twisting 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.319
 daria 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:29.980
 I cut off the excess wire to 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:34.450
 this tip was no longer than length 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.690
 beads deliver it will not 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.690
 sticking up 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.800
 I wear 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.800
 a little bead 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:52.860
 now I take a bead on a small 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.349
 the amount of hot glue and now 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.329
 glue loop 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.640
 I wait for a while until glue 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.340
 will freeze at the moment you run 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.030
 knees may form surplus until 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:12.420
 glue is not very stiff he can 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.420
 it will easily be removed to him briefly Sasha pockmarked 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.280
 it will be such a ball 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.470
 Well, that's all Christmas decorations for dolls 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.419
 we made all the pleasant creativity 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.419
 and see you in the next video 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.620
