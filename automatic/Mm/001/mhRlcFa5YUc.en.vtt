00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
ahead and take a closer look at the uni

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.189 
ahead and take a closer look at the uni
emotion<00:00:29.330> constructionwise<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.779> made<00:00:30.990> from

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
emotion constructionwise it's made from

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.650 
emotion constructionwise it's made from
a<00:00:31.349> soft<00:00:31.740> lightweight<00:00:32.250> neoprene<00:00:32.969> material<00:00:33.030> and

a soft lightweight neoprene material and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.840 
a soft lightweight neoprene material and
I'm<00:00:34.469> guessing<00:00:34.770> they<00:00:34.860> use<00:00:35.010> neoprene<00:00:35.460> because

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
I'm guessing they use neoprene because

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.610 
I'm guessing they use neoprene because
it's<00:00:36.030> lightweight<00:00:36.270> because<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.200> soft<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it's lightweight because it's soft and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.619 
it's lightweight because it's soft and
comfortable<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.790> also<00:00:38.910> allows<00:00:39.270> air<00:00:39.570> to

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
comfortable and it also allows air to

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.690 
comfortable and it also allows air to
circulate<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.590> allows<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> breathe

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
circulate and allows you to breathe

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.389 
circulate and allows you to breathe

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
while you're exercising now it does have

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.729 
while you're exercising now it does have
velcro<00:00:44.700> straps<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.809> custom<00:00:46.230> fit<00:00:46.379> your<00:00:46.530> needs

will get dirty and on the back of the
case<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.370> actually<00:03:11.400> has<00:03:12.000> some<00:03:12.630> instructions

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
case it actually has some instructions

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.800 
case it actually has some instructions
for<00:03:13.470> how<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:14.670> take<00:03:15.030> care<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.420> case<00:03:15.570> there's

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
for how to take care of the case there's

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.990 
for how to take care of the case there's
some<00:03:15.930> care<00:03:16.170> instructions<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.550> first<00:03:17.790> one

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
some care instructions and the first one

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.520 
some care instructions and the first one
is<00:03:18.030> 30<00:03:18.360> degrees<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.959> i'm<00:03:19.140> guessing<00:03:19.500> that

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
is 30 degrees and i'm guessing that

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.530 
is 30 degrees and i'm guessing that
celsius<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:20.790> you're<00:03:21.030> going<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.180> go<00:03:21.299> ahead<00:03:21.360> and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
celsius so you're going to go ahead and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.350 
celsius so you're going to go ahead and
watch<00:03:21.660> this<00:03:21.900> with<00:03:22.079> cold<00:03:22.470> water<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.160> i<00:03:24.000> would

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
watch this with cold water and i would

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.000 
watch this with cold water and i would
recommend<00:03:24.390> just<00:03:24.989> hand<00:03:25.230> washing<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.799> so<00:03:25.950> you

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
recommend just hand washing it so you

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.410 
recommend just hand washing it so you
don't<00:03:26.160> have<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.430> wet<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.700> screen<00:03:27.000> or<00:03:27.120> anything

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
don't have to wet the screen or anything

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.270 
don't have to wet the screen or anything
just<00:03:27.570> go<00:03:27.780> around<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.140> sides<00:03:28.380> hand<00:03:28.769> wash<00:03:29.010> it

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
just go around the sides hand wash it

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.039 
just go around the sides hand wash it
that's<00:03:29.820> what<00:03:30.000> i<00:03:30.030> did<00:03:30.150> i<00:03:30.329> actually<00:03:30.630> watched<00:03:30.870> it

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
that's what i did i actually watched it

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.770 
that's what i did i actually watched it
a<00:03:31.110> few<00:03:31.140> times<00:03:31.320> already<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.660> after<00:03:33.660> you're

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
a few times already and after you're

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.780 
a few times already and after you're
done<00:03:33.900> washing<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.650> dry<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.549> could<00:03:35.670> go

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
done washing it to dry it you could go

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.160 
done washing it to dry it you could go
ahead<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.030> throw<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.360> in<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.540> dryer<00:03:36.660> but<00:03:36.959> just

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
ahead and throw it in the dryer but just

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.630
