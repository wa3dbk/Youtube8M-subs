set of the ball boosters calling it good
I'm<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:41.010> sure<00:02:41.280> if<00:02:41.340> he's<00:02:41.459> gonna<00:02:41.549> replay<00:02:41.940> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
I'm not sure if he's gonna replay the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.730 
I'm not sure if he's gonna replay the
point<00:02:42.329> though

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:58.520 

this<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:46.890> amazing

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:10.020 

I've<00:02:59.530> been<00:02:59.890> watching<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.280> match

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.020 

very<00:03:10.300> unusual<00:03:10.860> there's<00:03:11.860> no<00:03:12.010> other<00:03:12.160> sport<00:03:12.520> that

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
very unusual there's no other sport that

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.460 
very unusual there's no other sport that
I<00:03:13.150> can<00:03:13.330> think<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.600> who<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:13.900> would<00:03:14.140> happen

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
I can think of who this would happen

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.370 
I can think of who this would happen
where<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.709> players<00:03:14.980> can<00:03:15.310> overrule<00:03:16.380> the

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
where the players can overrule the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.660 
where the players can overrule the
umpire<00:03:17.709> jobs<00:03:19.709> maybe<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.950> player<00:03:21.190> should<00:03:21.459> call

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
umpire jobs maybe the player should call

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.490 
umpire jobs maybe the player should call
the<00:03:21.819> lines<00:03:22.030> that's<00:03:22.630> what<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:22.840> propose<00:03:25.500> what

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
the lines that's what I propose what

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:38.230 
the lines that's what I propose what
habit<00:03:26.830> you<00:03:26.950> prefer
