00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
play see that okay so yeah I got the

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.330 
play see that okay so yeah I got the
right<00:03:15.280> shape<00:03:15.579> sides<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.890> only<00:03:18.010> thing<00:03:18.250> I

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
right shape sides and the only thing I

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.979 
right shape sides and the only thing I
like<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.670> let<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.970> raise<00:03:19.150> for<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.450> minute<00:03:19.780> I

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
like to let you raise for a minute I

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.539 
like to let you raise for a minute I
think<00:03:20.500> one<00:03:20.650> hour<00:03:20.799> and<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:20.980> half<00:03:21.159> to<00:03:21.340> two<00:03:21.489> hours

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
think one hour and a half to two hours

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.759 
think one hour and a half to two hours
would<00:03:21.939> be<00:03:22.090> more<00:03:22.299> than<00:03:22.450> enough<00:03:22.590> in<00:03:23.590> the

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
would be more than enough in the

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.740 
would be more than enough in the
temperate<00:03:24.250> room<00:03:24.549> there<00:03:25.269> we<00:03:25.390> are

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
temperate room there we are

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.199 
temperate room there we are
got<00:03:26.290> one<00:03:26.500> one<00:03:27.010> hour<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.519> half<00:03:27.700> two<00:03:27.909> hours

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
got one one hour and a half two hours

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.229 
got one one hour and a half two hours
and<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:29.319> gets<00:03:29.500> much<00:03:29.829> softer<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.549> you<00:03:31.090> know

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
and it gets much softer and you know

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.759 
and it gets much softer and you know
this<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.870> where<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.079> start<00:03:32.409> to<00:03:32.470> have<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.650> problem

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
this is where I start to have a problem

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.979 
this is where I start to have a problem
because<00:03:33.459> in<00:03:33.849> the<00:03:33.970> normal<00:03:34.299> situation<00:03:34.389> I<00:03:34.840> will

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
because in the normal situation I will

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.660 
because in the normal situation I will
bake<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.739> one<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.190> it'll<00:03:36.310> become<00:03:36.489> a

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
bake this one and it'll become a

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.000

it<00:03:39.159> a<00:03:39.190> little<00:03:39.340> bit<00:03:39.549> more<00:03:39.700> but<00:03:40.120> here<00:03:40.329> on<00:03:40.629> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
it a little bit more but here on the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.690 
it a little bit more but here on the
picture<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.349> I<00:03:41.440> got<00:03:41.620> here<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:42.250> bread<00:03:42.489> is

picture that I got here the bread is

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.780 
picture that I got here the bread is
divided<00:03:43.239> like<00:03:43.389> if<00:03:43.569> it<00:03:43.720> was<00:03:43.920> exactly<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:45.129> talking

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
divided like if it was exactly a talking

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.849 
divided like if it was exactly a talking
right<00:03:46.120> it's<00:03:46.900> almost<00:03:47.019> like<00:03:47.260> somebody<00:03:47.530> gets

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
right it's almost like somebody gets

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.069 
right it's almost like somebody gets
paid<00:03:48.069> one<00:03:48.280> piece<00:03:48.549> of<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:48.909> so<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:49.659> there<00:03:49.989> is

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
paid one piece of that so and there is

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.050 
paid one piece of that so and there is
this<00:03:50.230> sort<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.709> light<00:03:50.920> lying<00:03:51.280> around<00:03:51.549> which<00:03:51.909> I

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
this sort of light lying around which I

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.720 
this sort of light lying around which I
cannot<00:03:52.299> justify<00:03:52.720> myself<00:03:53.109> as<00:03:53.620> at<00:03:54.099> the<00:03:54.250> start<00:03:54.519> I

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
cannot justify myself as at the start I

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.280 
cannot justify myself as at the start I
thought<00:03:54.879> it<00:03:55.000> was<00:03:55.150> baked<00:03:55.359> upside<00:03:55.840> down<00:03:56.049> or

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
thought it was baked upside down or

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.839 
thought it was baked upside down or
something<00:03:56.470> like<00:03:56.650> that<00:03:56.829> obviously<00:03:57.220> is<00:03:57.639> not

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
something like that obviously is not

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:58.979 
something like that obviously is not
because<00:03:58.209> otherwise<00:03:58.359> they<00:03:58.599> would<00:03:58.750> have<00:03:58.780> found

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
because otherwise they would have found

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.170 
because otherwise they would have found
the<00:03:59.170> tin<00:03:59.409> in<00:03:59.530> yeah<00:03:59.680> so<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.459> only<00:04:00.609> thing<00:04:00.879> then<00:04:01.060> I

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
the tin in yeah so the only thing then I

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.860 
the tin in yeah so the only thing then I
sort<00:04:02.109> of<00:04:02.230> folder<00:04:02.739> body<00:04:02.949> it<00:04:03.430> could<00:04:03.609> be<00:04:03.699> them<00:04:03.879> in

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
sort of folder body it could be them in

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.809 
sort of folder body it could be them in
order<00:04:05.019> to<00:04:05.260> make<00:04:05.410> it<00:04:05.590> easy<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.980> carry<00:04:06.280> they

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
order to make it easy to carry they

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:07.800 
order to make it easy to carry they
would<00:04:06.970> have<00:04:07.090> baked<00:04:07.269> it<00:04:07.449> with<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.599> piece<00:04:07.780> of

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
would have baked it with a piece of

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.809 
would have baked it with a piece of
string<00:04:08.139> around<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:09.220> I'll<00:04:09.400> show<00:04:09.579> you<00:04:09.609> what

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
string around it and I'll show you what

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.470 
string around it and I'll show you what
I<00:04:09.879> told<00:04:10.349> I'll<00:04:11.349> put<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.769> string<00:04:12.220> as<00:04:12.489> I'm<00:04:13.180> going

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
I told I'll put the string as I'm going

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.649 
I told I'll put the string as I'm going
I'll<00:04:13.720> fix<00:04:14.109> it<00:04:14.230> in<00:04:14.669> this<00:04:15.669> also<00:04:16.000> will<00:04:16.329> guarantee

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659 
I'll fix it in this also will guarantee

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:20.460 
I'll fix it in this also will guarantee
the<00:04:17.380> fair<00:04:17.650> then<00:04:18.570> each<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.989> piece<00:04:20.139> of<00:04:20.289> bread

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
the fair then each of the piece of bread

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.689 
the fair then each of the piece of bread
will<00:04:21.099> be<00:04:21.780> roughly<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.050> same<00:04:23.949> size<00:04:24.220> because

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
will be roughly the same size because

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.140 
will be roughly the same size because
the<00:04:24.849> string<00:04:25.090> would<00:04:25.210> be<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.479> same<00:04:25.690> size<00:04:25.960> okay
