00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
today we're going to be showing you how

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.340 
today we're going to be showing you how
to<00:00:09.590> use<00:00:09.770> the<00:00:11.650> paper<00:00:12.650> bead<00:00:13.070> roller<00:00:13.699> that's<00:00:14.350> made

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
to use the paper bead roller that's made

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.310 
to use the paper bead roller that's made
of<00:00:15.529> metal<00:00:15.770> so<00:00:16.400> this<00:00:16.699> part<00:00:17.029> is<00:00:17.270> metal<00:00:17.900> and<00:00:18.080> this

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
of metal so this part is metal and this

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.040 
of metal so this part is metal and this
is<00:00:18.500> bamboo<00:00:19.630> so<00:00:20.630> our<00:00:20.859> materials<00:00:21.859> are<00:00:22.810> strips<00:00:23.810> of

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
is bamboo so our materials are strips of

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.839 
is bamboo so our materials are strips of
paper<00:00:24.849> cut<00:00:25.849> into<00:00:26.240> triangle<00:00:26.869> like<00:00:27.169> this<00:00:27.849> you

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
paper cut into triangle like this you

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.819 
paper cut into triangle like this you
can<00:00:29.179> cut<00:00:29.720> them<00:00:29.929> in<00:00:30.169> different<00:00:30.699> shapes<00:00:32.079> so<00:00:33.079> we

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
can cut them in different shapes so we

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.670 
can cut them in different shapes so we
have<00:00:34.360> this<00:00:35.360> smaller<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:38.120> narrower<00:00:39.050> your

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
have this smaller the narrower your

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.560 
have this smaller the narrower your
strip<00:00:40.580> of<00:00:40.790> paper<00:00:41.030> is<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:42.110> smaller<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.910> paper

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
strip of paper is the smaller the paper

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.050 
strip of paper is the smaller the paper

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
to dry the paper beads so let's start so

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.910 
to dry the paper beads so let's start so
let's<00:01:29.390> say<00:01:29.539> we<00:01:29.990> will<00:01:30.259> start<00:01:30.619> with<00:01:30.939> this<00:01:32.920> strip

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
let's say we will start with this strip

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.879 
let's say we will start with this strip
of<00:01:34.189> paper<00:01:34.810> so<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:37.389> important<00:01:38.389> part<00:01:38.889> to

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:39.889 
of paper so the important part to

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:43.059 
of paper so the important part to
remember<00:01:40.369> is<00:01:40.609> that<00:01:40.670> not<00:01:41.359> to<00:01:41.630> glue<00:01:41.929> in<00:01:42.380> the

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
remember is that not to glue in the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.330 
remember is that not to glue in the
beginning<00:01:43.609> of<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:45.170> paper<00:01:45.469> when<00:01:45.979> you<00:01:46.009> are

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
beginning of the paper when you are

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.849 
beginning of the paper when you are
rolling<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.709> paper<00:01:48.709> bead<00:01:49.069> so<00:01:50.109> you<00:01:51.109> will<00:01:51.350> start

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
rolling the paper bead so you will start

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.080 
rolling the paper bead so you will start
by<00:01:52.819> conditioning<00:01:53.719> this<00:01:54.039> at<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.249> base<00:01:55.490> making

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
by conditioning this at the base making

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.559 
by conditioning this at the base making
sure<00:01:56.450> it's<00:01:56.659> curled<00:01:57.109> up<00:01:57.259> like<00:01:57.409> that<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.569> the

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
sure it's curled up like that and the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.349 
sure it's curled up like that and the
right<00:01:59.810> side<00:02:00.139> will<00:02:00.529> I<00:02:00.829> mean<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.670> wrong<00:02:01.999> side

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
right side will I mean the wrong side

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.519 
right side will I mean the wrong side
will<00:02:02.959> be<00:02:03.139> the<00:02:03.259> one<00:02:03.469> facing<00:02:03.859> you<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:04.990> now<00:02:05.990> I

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:06.529 
will be the one facing you so now I

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:12.210 
will be the one facing you so now I
would<00:02:06.920> start<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.609> roll<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:09.619> metal<00:02:10.130> roller

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
would start to roll the metal roller

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.200 
would start to roll the metal roller
makes<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.430> easy

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
makes it easy

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.070 
makes it easy
you<00:02:14.600> can<00:02:14.870> roll<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.980> paper<00:02:16.250> be<00:02:16.640> tight<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.540> it

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
you can roll the paper be tight and it

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.530 
you can roll the paper be tight and it
will<00:02:18.590> not<00:02:18.830> have<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:20.560> big<00:02:21.560> hole<00:02:21.980> as<00:02:22.430> opposed<00:02:23.360> to

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
will not have a big hole as opposed to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
will not have a big hole as opposed to
if<00:02:23.720> you're<00:02:23.930> just<00:02:24.410> using<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:26.350> bamboo<00:02:27.350> skewer

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
if you're just using a a bamboo skewer

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.010 
if you're just using a a bamboo skewer
or<00:02:27.950> something<00:02:28.730> like<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.590> now<00:02:32.020> would

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
or something like that so now would

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.230 
or something like that so now would
start<00:02:33.500> rolling<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.850> paper<00:02:36.400> like<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.430> with

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
start rolling the paper like this with

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.660 
start rolling the paper like this with
both<00:02:38.450> hands<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:40.280> make<00:02:40.490> sure<00:02:40.850> that<00:02:41.330> it's<00:02:41.660> tight

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
both hands to make sure that it's tight

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.340 
both hands to make sure that it's tight
remember<00:02:43.670> there's<00:02:43.970> no<00:02:44.210> glue<00:02:44.540> at<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:44.960> point

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
remember there's no glue at this point

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.260 
remember there's no glue at this point
so<00:02:46.570> just<00:02:47.570> keep<00:02:47.840> rolling<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:49.640> will<00:02:50.320> glue<00:02:51.320> the
