when she blocks or every couple of

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.409 
when she blocks or every couple of
blocks<00:04:03.129> or<00:04:03.340> something<00:04:03.549> like<00:04:03.819> this<00:04:04.000> her<00:04:04.209> first

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
couple of blocks get the opponent

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.789 
couple of blocks get the opponent
stunned<00:04:07.540> now<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.049> would<00:04:08.139> be<00:04:08.199> a<00:04:08.290> pretty<00:04:08.470> cool

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
stunned now that would be a pretty cool

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.330

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
this could mean but that's just my

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.259 
this could mean but that's just my
