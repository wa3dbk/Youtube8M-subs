00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.590

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.930
 they passed by at the beginning of the game 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.239
 following the main path of the 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.519
 old tristan road you go 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.220
 end up encountering the carcass that 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.640
 seems to have been from an ox and a cow and 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.069
 It is there that people say that this level 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.470
 that you will access is a cow level 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.049
 because if you followed what I 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.260
 said until now they are in possession of the 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.900
 the shepherd's staff in your inventory 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.860
 as you approach the carcass you will go 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.410
 come across the spirit of the King cow 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.019
 King Cow is going to be able to 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.200
 you start a quest and when you finish 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:08.160
 This knows he'll open the doors. 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.319
 this new level called in himself shairo 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.680
 As you will see in the video, it is a 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:18.180
 level that has leaves flowers clouds 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.340
 happy rainbow over this easy 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.680
 level there is nothing who thinks that this 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.410
 level is child's play is going to 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.299
 difficulties because 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.139
 earphones are very strong 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.130
 the flowers as well as the clouds despite 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.280
 to smile 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.470
 they do not go easy on anyone and 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.049
 you have to keep in mind that 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.290
 if you are playing in normal mode 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.519
 When entering, do not bother with difficulty. 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.709
 difficulty mode will be 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.620
 automatically increased to the 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.840
 nightmare and so on 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.940
 So the people will leave you there. 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.069
 I'll show you all the 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.370
 items you need to achieve with 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:02.910
 The plans of the staff are you will not 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.440
 will see me accessing the level because I 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.840
 I can not get my first lawsuit 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.940
 take the plans to forge the 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.889
 In case of the pastor I can get my 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.329
 subsequent difficulties 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:18.150
 to get a nightmare mode on the engine 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.889
 even in fernandÃ£o mode and I do not 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.450
 I got in the first I can not forge 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.039
 the first case of the pastor 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.470
 you have to keep in mind also that if 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.660
 you are in a 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.760
 the most evolved modes besides having the 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.650
 plans to support the pastor's staff 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.680
 you have to have plans to make the 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.810
 upgrades the shepherd's infernal staff in the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.610
 hell mode the tormented staff of the 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.040
 pastor in torment 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.160
 and I already have the pastor's nightmare in the way 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.570
 Nightmare I have these plans for 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.010
 to upgrade we have no plans 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.220
 to make the original staff then 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.590
 I accessed the game through a friend who 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.380
 I had a staff and I accompanied him on the 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.910
 Personal mission , that's what I'll leave you 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.730
