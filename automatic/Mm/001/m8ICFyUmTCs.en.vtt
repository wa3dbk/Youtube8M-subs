00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.670 
it might look like here and over and
it's<00:01:10.060> probably<00:01:10.420> don't<00:01:10.750> look<00:01:10.870> like<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.230> next

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
it's probably don't look like the next

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.590 
it's probably don't look like the next
slides<00:01:11.890> probably<00:01:12.310> will<00:01:12.430> look<00:01:12.610> like<00:01:12.790> but

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600

slide here so i think sega could just
totally<00:01:25.060> destroy<00:01:25.770> microsoft<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.310> sony

totally destroy microsoft and sony
nintendo<00:01:28.270> could<00:01:28.540> but<00:01:28.930> they're<00:01:29.200> not<00:01:29.350> they're

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
they got their own new shooter and stuff
and<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.510> console<00:02:20.230> was<00:02:20.440> pretty<00:02:21.130> powerful<00:02:21.600> of

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
and the console was pretty powerful of

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.720 
and the console was pretty powerful of
more<00:02:22.870> powerful<00:02:23.290> than<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.530> ps4<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.160> stuff<00:02:24.430> it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
more powerful than the ps4 and stuff it

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.120 
more powerful than the ps4 and stuff it
could<00:02:25.480> lift<00:02:26.190> console<00:02:27.270> like<00:02:28.470> gaming<00:02:29.470> for<00:02:30.100> a

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
could lift console like gaming for a

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.440 
could lift console like gaming for a
little<00:02:30.340> more<00:02:30.640> because<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.970> think<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.270> will<00:02:31.390> be

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
little more because I think this will be

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.560 
little more because I think this will be
the<00:02:31.600> last<00:02:31.780> one<00:02:32.460> intendo<00:02:33.460> or<00:02:33.640> said<00:02:33.940> guru<00:02:34.150> or<00:02:34.510> a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
the last one intendo or said guru or a

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.220 
the last one intendo or said guru or a
new<00:02:34.900> company<00:02:35.700> comes<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.180> raises<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.050> bar

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
new company comes in and raises the bar

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.440 
new company comes in and raises the bar
for<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.560> technology<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.400> stuff<00:02:39.700> because

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
for the technology and stuff because

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.170 
for the technology and stuff because
Microsoft<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.680> Sony<00:02:41.830> is<00:02:42.220> are<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:42.970> playing

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
Microsoft and Sony is are just playing

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.850 
Microsoft and Sony is are just playing
it<00:02:43.330> safe<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.840> Nintendo's<00:02:44.320> going<00:02:44.530> for<00:02:44.680> little

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
kids and stuff but uh I could totally

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.740 
kids and stuff but uh I could totally
think<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:47.980> they<00:02:48.130> could<00:02:48.190> just<00:02:48.750> flat-out

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
think that they could just flat-out

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.060 
think that they could just flat-out
destroy<00:02:50.620> them<00:02:51.190> if<00:02:51.840> they<00:02:52.840> actually<00:02:53.070> could

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
destroy them if they actually could

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.300 
destroy them if they actually could
figure<00:02:54.459> out<00:02:54.610> how<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.930> mean<00:02:56.530> they<00:02:57.040> would

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
figure out how to but I mean they would

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.750 
figure out how to but I mean they would
with<00:02:57.490> this<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:58.300> would<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:58.690> be<00:02:58.840> awesome

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
with this this would just be awesome

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.100 
with this this would just be awesome
getting<00:03:00.760> like<00:03:00.940> call<00:03:01.180> duty<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.630> stuff<00:03:01.840> on<00:03:01.990> this

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
getting like call duty and stuff on this

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.580 
getting like call duty and stuff on this
would<00:03:02.350> totally<00:03:03.160> destroy<00:03:03.280> everyone<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.209> uh
