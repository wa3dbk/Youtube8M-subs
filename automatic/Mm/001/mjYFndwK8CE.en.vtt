00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.360
 your child goes on football and becomes 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.640
 requested or you do not train we 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.610
 to become 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.190
 of course you want that and suddenly you are 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.260
 sins already train you are excited 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.240
 start working with the group and consider 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.040
 all kinds of fun soccer tactics and 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.260
 nice trainings 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.700
 but what time do you show the children to you 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.160
 listen 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.579
 how do you keep them the same for a whole season 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.740
 motivated and enthusiastic like yourself 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.600
 And what do you do with the parents who are with 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.160
 the setup the tactics 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.380
 the referee and the exchange policy 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.850
 want to interfere 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.550
 football is not just talking about it 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.449
 game and you as a trainer but also to 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.449
 all the people around it 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.500
 my name is steven pont and i am 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.500
 psychologist 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.019
 everything revolves around my work 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.850
 how people interact 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:01.000
 whether that involves families at school or 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.040
 at work 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.050
 I know the similar patterns 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.420
 are in the development of relationships between 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.390
 people 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.400
 a certain culture arises and this 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.130
 I also saw the football field back then 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.500
 I was a trainer by being more aware of 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.720
 the influence of your behavior on players and 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.600
 parents ski that culture positively 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.460
 we affect me that has caused 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.630
 for more clarity and more pleasure 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.820
 in the trainership 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.890
 as a trainer I got all from my club 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.210
 room to choose my own method 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.030
 and that approach 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.799
 I 'd like to share you with you even though 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.110
 it sometimes seems something elusive 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.220
 you can certainly make culture 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.100
 key that for 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.659
 is mainly at the start of the season 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.189
 I looked through another trainer 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.780
 position the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.420
 and how that happened during the season 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.689
 further developed I saw for example 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.429
 General issuing the orders 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.990
 you actually made good use of the 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.909
 power over their team 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.009
 but I also saw their power more often 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.409
 eventually called opposition 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.759
 and resistance is always more creative than 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.709
 the power 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.899
 the generals therefore always had to 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.790
 more of the power bet and I found the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.080
 atmosphere with this kind of trainers as a result 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.080
 often below par 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.459
 on the other hand I also say care and 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.040
 everyone's friend the kids a good one 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.840
 feeling felt by cordiality but 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.120
 they often thought they were too nice 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.150
 and thus lost control 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.609
 their team eventually ran the risk 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.359
 that their team and parents have little respect 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.810
 more for them so what is going on 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.670
 wisdom 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.250
 as in many of my work it appears 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.280
 also here mainly to turn authority one 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.860
 mixture of power and care 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.950
 use this authority in a process where 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.160
 you say what you want to each other 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.990
 appeals in which culture you want it 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.380
 and appeals to people who don't 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.330
 keep the agreements 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.670
 but what exactly did I do to 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.560
 create culture within the team I found 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.349
 there in four important things 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.180
 my team required me to be reliable 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.920
 I was therefore always on time and off 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.380
 for example, never in an old one 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.050
 turning on sweatpants or something I was the 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.700
 I also expected the trainer 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.220
 children at the beginning and end of each 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.590
 training and every match in hand 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.470
 came to give so they immediately gave something 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.690
 personal attention 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.640
 I want the attention of the team without it 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.870
 having to paint my voice 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.209
 I therefore had a special kind 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.769
 bought a whistle in the party shop and with 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.319
 the kids practiced that they approach me 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.090
 arrived as soon as they become that way 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.640
 There is always the attention of the whole 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.709
 group and console quietly start with 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.900
 to talk 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.940
 I make the game fun more important than 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.860
 win because if you play alone 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.049
 you get from winning when you lose 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.940
 of course a problem during the 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.769
 training how of the we for example 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.319
 the youngest apps the tactics 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.180
 bomb as our goalkeeper the ball hard 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.980
 the kids had to move so fast 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.019
 possibly spread over the whole sheet 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.239
 the keeper had so different ones 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.010
 point of contact and even though we lost the 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.019
 match then we still had a bit 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.019
 won if the bomb was successful 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.390
 I mainly asked many questions 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.220
 I did not immediately start to rest 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.229
 but I first talk to the 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.560
 how players actually thought it was 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.630
 went and listen to that first 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.570
 I link that to what I had seen myself 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.780
 but players make so yourself first 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.639
 responsible for their own game as 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.440
 children come to play football you get the 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.389
 Parents there who are natural 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.790
 important for the football pleasure of it 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.740
 their child therefore also consider which culture 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.200
 you 'll make the old one fun 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.040
 season to have at the start of it 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.780
 season 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.490
 therefore all parents have at my home 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.990
 digs out 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.120
 because just like you of the players one 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.190
 team you need from your parents 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.290
 a group of yes it was 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.389
 of course very nice but I have too 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.090
 being able to discuss the culture as I do it 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.250
 before me I was clear about that 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.720
 my approach to the team 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.120
 for example, I have the first year 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.560
 said yes indicated that the children are in 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.540
 not too much in the first six months 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.729
 had to learn how to play football but she did 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.380
 had fun in the game and 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.000
 it especially had to get well with 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.280
 each other 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.260
 I didn't want a fuss around the bills and 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.880
 wanted to stress parents' stress 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.740
 fair distribution of playing time 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.660
 take away 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.330
 so I had made a schedule with which I 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.120
 the players change so that all children 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.310
 got exactly the same amount of playing time and the 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.070
 parents quietly along the sidelines 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.410
 child could enjoy clearly i wanted 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.479
 not that the emotions out of line it 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.890
 game within the line would be negative 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.300
 to influence 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.610
 of course it is nice to live with 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.470
 along the sidelines but on one 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.570
 positive way 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.310
 give instructions grumble on the 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.500
 Referee disapproval show 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.539
 and became me as a trainer during the 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.160
 want to discuss something but the game 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:01.050
 is out of the question 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.850
 like i said i wanted kids 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.670
 themselves were responsible for them 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.050
 sport that's why I discussed it 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.150
 important to me was that as the 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.580
 kids times the parents and could not 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.050
 children do not cancel the call themselves 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.090
 that way because the children 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.030
 seriously and that will strengthen the bond 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.770
 between me and my players 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.240
 so don't be afraid to be very clear 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.400
 are what culture 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.140
 You want to make parents think it's right 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.560
 nice to know what is expected of them 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.750
 and also the atmosphere and the performance 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.590
 of the team are better than the culture 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:37.230
 clarity gives culture should you 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.510
 so it doesn't come naturally 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.480
 so think carefully from day one how 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.490
 position yourself 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.830
 when you need the general more 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.720
 and when everyone's friend can 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.820
 to be 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.070
 as a trainer you are the most important 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.530
 switch by being aware of you 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.720
 influence on the behavior of players and 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.190
 You can have a positive culture for parents 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.510
 to make 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.940
 these are of course my examples 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.760
 but choose as a trainer in consultation with the 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.970
 club always your own approach and 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:12.160
 gives such authority to your authority 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.160
 I wish you a nice training position
