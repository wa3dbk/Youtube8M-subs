00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.250
 hello tankers with you 40 tons and this 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.220
 video I want to open a series of tutorials 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.369
 tactical videos where will be considered 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.630
 individual mistakes made by players in 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.769
 Randomly in this case I asked 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.599
 strangers to send me 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.369
 my replays and although I insisted on 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.950
 sent replays with statistics no higher 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.250
 five ten percent but this player 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.590
 made two mistakes in a row about which I 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.570
 now and gonna tell not in 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.910
 we will consider further in 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.340
 new videos see other mistakes here 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.640
 he rides lit continues to go 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.739
 forward I conclude that he wants 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.840
 drive here down the hill but 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.910
 look now I put his camera and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.820
 look what he does he now 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.430
 his tower turned here 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.100
 deviate to the right up and now he 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.380
 turned the camera and again well here it is 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.500
 Looks and the tower now turns 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.530
 behind the camera at this moment he gets 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.380
 ricochet from hellqueta and miracle well, that is 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.229
 a little bit he would not have turned the tower and was 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.990
 would break into the side of the tower so what 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.060
 mistake was made guys imagine 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.869
 myself that this is not a replay and I am now in battle 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.290
 you clamp the right button and right 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.750
 button you rotate the camera while your 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.930
 gun looks where it looked 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.329
 and when you drive towards the enemy then 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.820
 the best option where should go where 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.799
 should here in this case in to 3601 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.259
 should watch your barrel 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.140
 it's a little bit aside why because 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.149
 your gun mask up protects but here 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.890
 she 's kinda flat yet there 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.229
 with a great desire and you can punch 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.299
 slightly turning away that is she is also under 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.369
 angle will substitute her like less chance 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.219
 breaking through into the side of the tower is still impossible 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.439
 get here well and so here you are 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.930
 fix your trunk and clamp the right 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.289
 Turn the button and see where 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.340
 you want but do not rotate the house 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:18.959
 here so here further everything is standard 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.239
 he drives under this slope so well and 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.459
 here please 2 bids 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:29.150
 Well, that is not your rush hulk stage . Yes 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:33.269
 and with t 6 level waiting for him there and please 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.810
 KV-1 SU-100 kvass as many as three tanks but when 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.450
 two tanks and fri-shka are waiting on the other side 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.000
 and now look he turned now 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.930
 work there completely ignoring here 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.919
 of these hellquets and t-34 85 and see what 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.560
 what happens next here please 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:55.680
 hellcat dies and now look at 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.959
 from this side of it, kvass drove away with 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.639
 on this side he has another brew here and 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:06.060
 to in 1 to 2 heavy tanks and with this 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.430
 side he has one medium tank so here 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.739
 correctly in this case about tank 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.319
 here is this one mediocre and leave 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.739
 here here then already there if these here 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.079
 will go to catch them but shoot 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.720
 see what the player does he 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.579
 turns around and starts working on 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.879
 forge first there bide kvass here 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.790
 look here he is in the meantime 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.919
 look yes t-34 85 lacks it for 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.260
 relief but if you bothered to drive 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:37.169
 a little closer and completely defenseless 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.629
 karma is completely ie board and feed 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.760
 towers up so I say it again 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:45.150
 correctly pro tank one this one 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.760
 tank where less there where it is easier about 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.190
 tank it 1 then by this already 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.159
 work from all sides someone from here a 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.370
 here from here you are two mistakes 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.310
 were immediately noticed by me in battle even before 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.250
 end and did not look I do not plan them for 7 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:06.180
 10 pieces in one video will do them 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:10.790
 2 maximum 3 this time is enough with 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.790
 you were 40 tons wait for the continuation
