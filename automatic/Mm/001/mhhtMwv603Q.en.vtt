00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.270 
why we introduced the reconsideration
program<00:01:35.539> now<00:01:36.079> a<00:01:36.109> couple<00:01:36.619> of<00:01:36.740> details<00:01:37.039> on

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
program now a couple of details on

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.630 
program now a couple of details on
reconsideration<00:01:37.899> if<00:01:38.899> your<00:01:39.109> coin<00:01:39.350> already<00:01:40.069> has

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
reconsideration if your coin already has

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.480 
reconsideration if your coin already has
a<00:01:40.670> plus<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.569> it's<00:01:42.560> say<00:01:42.770> goes<00:01:43.009> from<00:01:43.189> a<00:01:43.249> five

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
a plus and it's say goes from a five

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.800 
a plus and it's say goes from a five
plus<00:01:43.909> to<00:01:44.179> a<00:01:44.210> six

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
plus to a six

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.950

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
that's counted as one numeric point so

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.690 
that's counted as one numeric point so
we<00:01:48.109> would<00:01:48.380> crack<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.799> out<00:01:48.889> and<00:01:49.069> get<00:01:49.219> upgraded

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
we would crack it out and get upgraded

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.020 
we would crack it out and get upgraded
if<00:01:50.389> it<00:01:50.539> goes<00:01:50.689> from<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.960> five<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.259> five<00:01:51.770> Plus<00:01:52.249> that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
if it goes from a five to five Plus that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.450 
if it goes from a five to five Plus that
doesn't<00:01:53.509> count<00:01:53.719> as<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.049> numeric<00:01:54.560> point<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.159> we

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
doesn't count as a numeric point so we

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.940 
doesn't count as a numeric point so we
wouldn't<00:01:55.759> crack<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.240> out<00:01:56.359> and<00:01:56.630> upgrade<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:56.990> so

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
wouldn't crack it out and upgrade it so

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.889 
wouldn't crack it out and upgrade it so
the<00:01:58.130> only<00:01:58.249> time<00:01:58.549> we<00:01:58.759> cracked<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.119> coin<00:01:59.389> out<00:01:59.420> is

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
the only time we cracked the coin out is

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.440 
the only time we cracked the coin out is
when<00:02:00.109> it<00:02:00.229> goes<00:02:00.409> up<00:02:00.439> from<00:02:01.310> one<00:02:01.789> number<00:02:01.999> to<00:02:02.420> the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
when it goes up from one number to the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.550 
when it goes up from one number to the
next<00:02:02.920> now<00:02:03.920> I've<00:02:04.280> seen<00:02:04.789> coins<00:02:05.179> and<00:02:05.659> old<00:02:06.049> holders
