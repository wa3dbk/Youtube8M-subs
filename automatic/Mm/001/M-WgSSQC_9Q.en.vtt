00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
we're putting it and I'm going to high

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.730 
we're putting it and I'm going to high
fire<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.530> we're<00:00:11.429> going<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.700> mix<00:00:12.410> very<00:00:13.410> good

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
fire and we're going to mix very good

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.580 
fire and we're going to mix very good
all<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.280> sugar<00:00:14.610> on<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> bottom<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:16.320> very

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
all this sugar on the bottom it's very

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.099 
all this sugar on the bottom it's very
important<00:00:17.190> at<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> beginning<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.420> mix<00:00:18.840> it

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
important at the beginning to mix it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.470 
important at the beginning to mix it
good<00:00:19.580> because<00:00:20.580> as<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:20.970> see<00:00:21.180> there<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
good because as you can see there is a

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.120 
good because as you can see there is a
lot<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.750> sugar<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.350> bottom<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:28.099> use<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
lot of sugar on the bottom I use a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.620 
lot of sugar on the bottom I use a
wooden<00:00:29.490> spoon<00:00:30.140> because<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.619> doesn't<00:00:32.600> leave<00:00:33.600> a

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
wooden spoon because it doesn't leave a

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.979 
wooden spoon because it doesn't leave a
taste<00:00:34.910> here<00:00:35.910> most<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.420> sugar<00:00:37.640> is<00:00:38.989> mixed

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
taste here most of the sugar is mixed

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
taste here most of the sugar is mixed
now<00:00:40.760> as<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:43.250> you<00:00:44.250> can't<00:00:44.579> see

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
now as you can see you can't see

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.580 
now as you can see you can't see
actually<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:45.480> some<00:00:45.719> fruit<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> bottom

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
actually but some fruit is on the bottom

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.729 
actually but some fruit is on the bottom
it<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.219> very<00:00:47.579> careful<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.410> high

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it have to be very careful on a high

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.200 
it have to be very careful on a high
fire<00:00:50.129> if<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.090> fruit<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:52.070> laying<00:00:53.070> down<00:00:53.340> there<00:00:53.670> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
fire if a fruit is laying down there it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.130 
fire if a fruit is laying down there it
might<00:00:54.480> burn<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.370> might<00:00:56.610> change<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.960> whole

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
might burn and it might change the whole

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.009 
might burn and it might change the whole
taste<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.039> jelly<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:03.019> important

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
taste of this jelly so it's important

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.710 
taste of this jelly so it's important
not<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> let<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.470> sit<00:01:04.769> there<00:01:05.450> we're<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
not to let it sit there we're going to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.469 
not to let it sit there we're going to
wait<00:01:06.930> takes<00:01:07.740> about<00:01:10.189> 10<00:01:11.189> minutes<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.790> think<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
wait takes about 10 minutes I think to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.810 
wait takes about 10 minutes I think to
boil<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:14.240> we<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.390> mix<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
boil and we will mix it so that the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.330 
boil and we will mix it so that the
sugar<00:01:18.030> once<00:01:18.420> settle<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> bottom<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.590> burn

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
sugar once settle to the bottom and burn

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.749 
sugar once settle to the bottom and burn
their<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.540> can't<00:01:21.810> leave<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.520> too<00:01:23.520> long

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
their you can't leave it too long

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.320 
their you can't leave it too long
without<00:01:24.619> taking<00:01:25.619> care<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.180> because<00:01:27.180> you

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
without taking care of it because you

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.170 
without taking care of it because you
don't<00:01:27.479> want<00:01:27.650> first<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.799> all<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> sugar<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
don't want first of all the sugar to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.859 
don't want first of all the sugar to
burn<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.810> bottom<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:32.430> fruits<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.479> start

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
burn on the bottom the fruits to start

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.410 
burn on the bottom the fruits to start
to<00:01:34.140> stick<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.680> bottom<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.250> burn<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.880> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
to stick to the bottom and burn or you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.190 
to stick to the bottom and burn or you
don't<00:01:36.630> want<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.140> boil<00:01:38.040> over<00:01:38.689> now<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.750> got<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
don't want it to boil over now we got to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.310 
don't want it to boil over now we got to
the<00:01:40.320> boiling<00:01:40.560> point<00:01:41.420> because<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.540> my<00:01:42.720> oven<00:01:43.140> I

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the boiling point because of my oven I

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.370 
the boiling point because of my oven I
decided<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.979> move<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> smaller<00:01:45.000> burner

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
decided to move it to a smaller burner

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.819 
decided to move it to a smaller burner
but<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.579> turn<00:01:48.149> your<00:01:48.540> burners<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
but you can just turn your burners to a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.800 
but you can just turn your burners to a
lower<00:01:50.549> flame<00:01:52.100> we<00:01:53.100> got<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> good

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
lower flame we got it to a good

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.649 
lower flame we got it to a good
temperature<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.969> simmering

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.599 

I<00:02:00.780> wanted<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.530> add<00:02:01.679> to<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.429> very

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
I wanted to add to that it's very

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.609 
I wanted to add to that it's very
important<00:02:03.179> not<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.420> cover<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.950> pot<00:02:06.619> don't

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
important not to cover the pot don't

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.889 
important not to cover the pot don't
cover<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.069> because<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.759> want<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.299> liquid<00:02:09.720> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
cover it because you want the liquid to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.280 
cover it because you want the liquid to
evaporate<00:02:11.209> some<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.629> course<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:13.049> all

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
evaporate some of it of course not all

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.560 
evaporate some of it of course not all
of<00:02:13.410> it
