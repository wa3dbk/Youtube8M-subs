just<00:06:19.479> called<00:06:19.659> diamond<00:06:20.199> because<00:06:20.860> it's<00:06:21.009> pretty

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:21.249 
just called diamond because it's pretty

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:23.070 
just called diamond because it's pretty
clear<00:06:21.639> it<00:06:21.909> doesn't<00:06:22.150> have<00:06:22.300> really<00:06:22.569> much<00:06:22.749> color
