 when the consumer presents to a 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.780

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.720
 outsiders and ultimately that if 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.580

 the individual I can file a complaint in 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.239
 ethics when you're on a text message 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.430
 poorly explained or to an error in 92 the 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.640
 replacement guarantee arrived in 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.000

 salon warranty is made on the quality 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.530
 of a product then something that

 shine too fast guaranteed 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.810
 not on the occurrence of an event there 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.830
 there is a tree falling on the car 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.150
 it's not because the car was not 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.010
 good is because a tree fell 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.410

 evolution dealers want hot 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.310
 for a simple and good reason it's 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.650
 that if we want insurance for a 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.569

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.640
 the same price yes if we have value to 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.280
 nine we arrogate a dealer no 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.830
 richard 9 without the comedy when it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.050

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.040

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.590
 that it comes out of new vehicles in 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.510
 accelerated increasingly seen twice 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.400
 money I understand that they can not 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.780
 be punished if they do not make a 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.579
 good product analysis because they 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.040

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.930
 defended by law but in fact

 right to make this top the consumer 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.080
 is unusual to be with him when

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.220
 m 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.380
 you give 2008 for example always 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.020
 again finance his car 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.330
 when by moore and when it's made that 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.760
 when charles car dealer 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.370
 is at $ 3,400 a month the car 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.690
 more than $ 3,400 a month all 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.080
 the others so that they sold you 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.390

 framed all sprinkled attention too 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.200
 because the problem we started 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.460
 see for a few years that's when 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.810

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.470
 nine his vehicle is a total loss 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.970
 it's quite simple on a cellar 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.370
 the embarrassment of the next new vehicle 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.590
 good if you like good recalled catcher 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.570
 know two leaders as you said earlier 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.180
 the first check of the depreciated value 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.620
 of your car then the second check 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.140
 to make up the difference 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.700
 but when you bought your mettle 9 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.020
 August to guarantee replacement or ta 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.060
 replacement value in his 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.620
 dealer you are obliged to redeem 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.140
 agrees that at the dealership 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.930

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.520
 same price the photographers look for your 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.870

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.760
 of insurance states parties taxes to the 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.430

 only you replace your vehicle is 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.790
 long we have people who have changed 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:47.300
