I'm sitting out here working yesterday I

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.600 
I'm sitting out here working yesterday I
did<00:00:06.970> a<00:00:07.000> quick<00:00:07.360> video<00:00:07.630> on<00:00:07.839> some<00:00:08.320> fat<00:00:08.650> wood<00:00:08.920> to

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
did a quick video on some fat wood to

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.310 
did a quick video on some fat wood to
answer<00:00:09.879> a<00:00:09.910> few<00:00:10.090> questions<00:00:10.330> of<00:00:10.660> people<00:00:10.990> had<00:00:11.139> and

answer a few questions of people had and

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.390 
answer a few questions of people had and
I<00:00:11.349> got<00:00:11.500> thinking<00:00:12.150> over<00:00:13.150> here<00:00:13.360> on<00:00:13.510> this<00:00:13.630> stump

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
I got thinking over here on this stump

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.690 
I got thinking over here on this stump
is<00:00:15.400> usually<00:00:15.880> where<00:00:16.059> i<00:00:16.090> press<00:00:16.660> out<00:00:16.900> the<00:00:17.700> crash

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
is usually where i press out the crash

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.400 
is usually where i press out the crash
Carter<00:00:19.090> that<00:00:19.210> I'm<00:00:19.329> making<00:00:19.630> and<00:00:19.840> as<00:00:20.020> you<00:00:20.200> can

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
Carter that I'm making and as you can

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.050 
Carter that I'm making and as you can
see<00:00:20.439> I<00:00:21.149> get<00:00:22.149> quite<00:00:22.419> a<00:00:22.450> bit<00:00:22.660> of<00:00:22.779> run<00:00:23.290> out<00:00:24.060> from

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
see I get quite a bit of run out from

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.300 
see I get quite a bit of run out from
the<00:00:25.210> fiberglass<00:00:25.899> resin<00:00:26.230> or<00:00:26.680> the<00:00:26.919> resin<00:00:27.250> that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
the fiberglass resin or the resin that

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.030 
the fiberglass resin or the resin that
I'm<00:00:27.489> whatever<00:00:27.880> resin<00:00:28.210> i'm<00:00:28.300> using<00:00:28.689> i<00:00:29.040> always

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
I'm whatever resin i'm using i always

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.440 
I'm whatever resin i'm using i always
thought<00:00:30.250> well<00:00:30.550> if<00:00:30.669> there<00:00:30.820> was<00:00:30.939> a<00:00:30.970> use<00:00:31.210> for<00:00:31.390> that

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
thought well if there was a use for that

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.369 
thought well if there was a use for that
resin<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:33.309> fat<00:00:33.579> would<00:00:33.760> gave<00:00:34.000> me<00:00:34.149> an<00:00:34.239> idea

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
resin the fat would gave me an idea

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.290 
resin the fat would gave me an idea
could<00:00:35.379> i<00:00:35.410> use<00:00:35.500> some<00:00:36.010> of<00:00:36.039> that<00:00:36.129> resin<00:00:36.670> as<00:00:36.879> a<00:00:36.940> fire

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
could i use some of that resin as a fire

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.369 
could i use some of that resin as a fire
starter<00:00:38.010> let's<00:00:39.010> find<00:00:39.250> out<00:00:39.429> together<00:00:39.640> shall<00:00:40.120> we

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
starter let's find out together shall we

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.410 
starter let's find out together shall we
all<00:00:41.379> right<00:00:41.530> so<00:00:41.649> I<00:00:41.710> picked<00:00:42.039> up<00:00:42.190> this<00:00:42.399> big<00:00:42.670> clump

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
all right so I picked up this big clump

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.489 
all right so I picked up this big clump
of<00:00:43.719> fiberglass<00:00:44.469> resin<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.899> great<00:00:47.230> some

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:47.499 
of fiberglass resin and it's great some

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:50.759 
of fiberglass resin and it's great some
here<00:00:47.679> just<00:00:47.710> using<00:00:48.190> a<00:00:48.280> knife<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.989> scraping

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
here just using a knife just scraping

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.720 
here just using a knife just scraping
little<00:00:50.980> shavings<00:00:51.429> of<00:00:51.640> it<00:00:53.339> and<00:00:54.339> the<00:00:54.460> thought

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
little shavings of it and the thought

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.540 
little shavings of it and the thought
was<00:00:54.969> well<00:00:55.179> maybe<00:00:55.390> I<00:00:55.480> could<00:00:55.780> collect<00:00:56.550> these

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
was well maybe I could collect these

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.989 
was well maybe I could collect these
shavings<00:00:57.940> put<00:00:58.420> them<00:00:58.539> in<00:00:58.629> a<00:00:58.690> container<00:00:59.850> use<00:01:00.850> it

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 
shavings put them in a container use it

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.090 
shavings put them in a container use it
as<00:01:01.120> a<00:01:01.149> fire<00:01:01.420> starter<00:01:01.870> well<00:01:02.350> here's<00:01:02.829> what<00:01:03.010> I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
as a fire starter well here's what I

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.960 
as a fire starter well here's what I
found<00:01:03.280> out<00:01:03.960> when<00:01:04.960> you<00:01:05.050> do<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:06.640> kind<00:01:06.880> of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
found out when you do that it kind of

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.929 
found out when you do that it kind of
crumble<00:01:07.299> almost<00:01:07.600> to<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.810> dust<00:01:08.520> doesn't<00:01:09.520> mean<00:01:09.820> it

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
crumble almost to a dust doesn't mean it

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.990 
crumble almost to a dust doesn't mean it
won't<00:01:10.060> work<00:01:10.270> but<00:01:11.049> there<00:01:11.170> won't<00:01:11.259> be<00:01:11.409> shavings

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
won't work but there won't be shavings

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.450 
won't work but there won't be shavings
more<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.090> a<00:01:13.180> dust<00:01:13.500> let<00:01:14.500> me<00:01:14.649> scrape<00:01:14.920> a<00:01:15.100> few<00:01:15.310> more

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
more of a dust let me scrape a few more

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.429 
more of a dust let me scrape a few more
get<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.119> little<00:01:16.329> bit<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.570> pile<00:01:16.840> we'll<00:01:17.079> see<00:01:17.290> how

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
get a little bit of a pile we'll see how

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.280 
get a little bit of a pile we'll see how
it<00:01:17.469> does<00:01:17.740> be<00:01:18.219> right<00:01:18.399> back<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.930> I've<00:01:20.079> got<00:01:20.259> a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
it does be right back and I've got a

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.880 
it does be right back and I've got a
small<00:01:20.619> pile<00:01:20.890> scraped<00:01:21.430> here<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:23.229> imagine<00:01:23.530> if

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
small pile scraped here and I imagine if

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.130 
small pile scraped here and I imagine if
this<00:01:24.549> works<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.090> if<00:01:25.210> this<00:01:25.390> is<00:01:25.450> something<00:01:25.810> that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
this works and if this is something that

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.620 
this works and if this is something that
I<00:01:26.200> decided<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:26.979> carry<00:01:27.219> it<00:01:27.820> probably<00:01:28.390> won't<00:01:28.570> be

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
I decided to carry it probably won't be

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.359 
I decided to carry it probably won't be
but<00:01:28.960> you<00:01:29.110> know<00:01:29.140> having<00:01:29.619> options<00:01:29.799> is<00:01:30.159> a<00:01:30.189> good

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
but you know having options is a good

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.510 
but you know having options is a good
idea<00:01:30.719> you<00:01:31.719> could<00:01:31.840> take<00:01:32.079> a<00:01:32.110> belt<00:01:32.950> sander<00:01:33.280> to

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
idea you could take a belt sander to

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.920 
idea you could take a belt sander to
that<00:01:34.140> large<00:01:35.140> pile<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.530> fiberglass<00:01:36.630> junk<00:01:37.630> and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
that large pile of fiberglass junk and

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.690 
that large pile of fiberglass junk and
make<00:01:38.680> pretty<00:01:38.950> quick<00:01:39.310> work<00:01:39.579> of<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:41.460> resin<00:01:42.460> and

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
make pretty quick work of the resin and

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.789 
make pretty quick work of the resin and
collect<00:01:43.149> that<00:01:43.329> and<00:01:43.600> put<00:01:44.079> it<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.259> container<00:01:44.560> and

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
collect that and put it in container and

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.380 
collect that and put it in container and
have<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> fire<00:01:45.219> starter<00:01:45.640> in<00:01:45.729> what<00:01:45.850> let's<00:01:46.119> see<00:01:46.299> if

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
have a fire starter in what let's see if

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.350 
have a fire starter in what let's see if
it<00:01:46.479> works

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.840 

sure<00:01:54.360> looks<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.780> does<00:01:58.520> what<00:01:59.520> kind<00:01:59.790> of

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
sure looks like it does what kind of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:35.420 
sure looks like it does what kind of
burn<00:02:00.060> time<00:02:00.330> we<00:02:00.510> get<00:02:00.690> out<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.050> small<00:02:01.410> pile

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.709 

not<00:02:36.420> too<00:02:36.599> bad<00:02:36.840> not<00:02:37.099> too<00:02:38.099> bad<00:02:38.359> so<00:02:39.359> small

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
not too bad not too bad so small

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.130 
not too bad not too bad so small
container<00:02:40.109> fiberglass<00:02:40.739> shavings<00:02:41.900> might<00:02:42.900> be<00:02:43.109> a

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
container fiberglass shavings might be a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.770 
container fiberglass shavings might be a
good<00:02:43.290> substitute<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.099> fire<00:02:44.340> starter<00:02:44.790> just

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
good substitute for a fire starter just

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.259 
good substitute for a fire starter just
another<00:02:46.079> tool<00:02:46.349> in<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.530> toolbox<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.939> then<00:02:48.150> I

another tool in the toolbox and then I

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.589 
another tool in the toolbox and then I
got<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.599> idea<00:02:49.489> when<00:02:50.489> I'm<00:02:50.640> shaping<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.120> handle<00:02:52.219> I

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
got the idea when I'm shaping a handle I

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.720 
got the idea when I'm shaping a handle I
get<00:02:54.599> a<00:02:54.629> I<00:02:54.989> make<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> mess<00:02:56.010> everywhere<00:02:56.310> that's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
get a I make a mess everywhere that's

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.309 
get a I make a mess everywhere that's
why<00:02:56.969> I<00:02:57.000> generally<00:02:57.510> do<00:02:57.599> it<00:02:57.719> out<00:02:57.840> here<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.079> don't

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
why I generally do it out here I don't

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.709 
why I generally do it out here I don't
have<00:02:58.439> a<00:02:58.469> desk<00:02:58.680> collection<00:02:59.159> system<00:02:59.519> so<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.269> do<00:03:00.510> it

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:00.719 
have a desk collection system so I do it

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.599 
have a desk collection system so I do it
out<00:03:00.959> on<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.469> sheet<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.769> plywood<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.340> the

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
out on the sheet of plywood in the

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.199 
out on the sheet of plywood in the
backyard<00:03:03.180> but<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:03.989> get<00:03:04.319> piles<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:05.040> piles<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.819> a

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
backyard but I get piles and piles of a

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.420 
backyard but I get piles and piles of a
mess<00:03:07.139> so<00:03:08.099> I<00:03:08.459> was<00:03:09.060> wondering<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.919> some<00:03:10.919> burlap

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
mess so I was wondering if some burlap

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.640 
mess so I was wondering if some burlap
red<00:03:12.359> white<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:12.780> blue<00:03:12.930> burlap<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:15.650> fiberglass

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
red white and blue burlap and fiberglass

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.119 
red white and blue burlap and fiberglass
resin<00:03:16.950> would<00:03:17.700> work<00:03:17.879> as<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> fire<00:03:18.359> starter<00:03:19.129> so

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
resin would work as a fire starter so

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.209 
resin would work as a fire starter so
I've<00:03:21.030> got<00:03:21.389> a<00:03:21.419> little<00:03:21.480> pile<00:03:21.919> we'll<00:03:22.919> see<00:03:23.069> what

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:23.219 
I've got a little pile we'll see what

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:34.040 
I've got a little pile we'll see what
happens

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.900 

it's<00:03:34.530> catching<00:03:34.770> a<00:03:34.950> spark<00:03:35.250> for<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.490> second<00:03:35.820> but

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
it's catching a spark for a second but

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.570 
it's catching a spark for a second but
it's<00:03:36.030> not<00:03:36.180> lightened<00:03:40.130> that<00:03:41.130> would<00:03:41.250> think<00:03:41.520> that

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
it's not lightened that would think that

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:53.990 
it's not lightened that would think that
it<00:03:41.820> would<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:52.350> does<00:03:52.560> eventually<00:03:53.000> little

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
it would and it does eventually little

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.780 
it would and it does eventually little
top<00:03:54.120> blew<00:03:54.540> out

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.819 

a<00:04:00.879> little<00:04:01.689> bit<00:04:01.810> tougher<00:04:01.959> than<00:04:02.260> just<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.620> plain

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
a little bit tougher than just a plain

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.959 
a little bit tougher than just a plain
old<00:04:02.860> resin<00:04:03.459> but<00:04:05.069> you<00:04:06.069> should<00:04:06.370> put<00:04:06.549> a<00:04:06.579> spark<00:04:06.939> to

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:06.969 
old resin but you should put a spark to

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:09.149 
old resin but you should put a spark to
a<00:04:07.090> lot<00:04:07.299> of<00:04:07.390> things<00:04:07.599> and<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:08.230> will<00:04:08.379> light<00:04:08.590> like

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
a lot of things and it will light like

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.009 
a lot of things and it will light like
my<00:04:09.310> workbench<00:04:09.700> when<00:04:10.000> I'm<00:04:10.090> grinding<00:04:10.329> things

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
my workbench when I'm grinding things

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.409 
my workbench when I'm grinding things
like<00:04:11.200> that

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.600 

thanks<00:04:17.419> for<00:04:17.570> watching
