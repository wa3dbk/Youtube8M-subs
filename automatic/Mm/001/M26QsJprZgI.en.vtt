00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.870 
what I most enjoy about the hundred for
50<00:01:45.899> years<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.770> lie<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.219> nimble<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
50 years it's it's lie it's nimble and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.149 
50 years it's it's lie it's nimble and
it<00:01:48.719> just<00:01:48.929> feels<00:01:49.170> small<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.740> don't<00:01:49.920> feel<00:01:50.130> like

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it just feels small you don't feel like

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.330 
it just feels small you don't feel like
you're<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.429> this<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.909> massive<00:01:51.829> motorcycle<00:01:52.829> but

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
you're on this a massive motorcycle but

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
you're on this a massive motorcycle but
it<00:01:53.429> still<00:01:53.640> holds<00:01:53.819> but<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.329> goes<00:01:54.479> fast<00:01:54.750> just

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
it still holds but and goes fast just

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.459 
it still holds but and goes fast just
like<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.319> 450<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.450> that's<00:01:57.450> why<00:01:57.929> I<00:01:58.020> enjoy<00:01:58.259> most

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
like a 450 so that's why I enjoy most

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:11.230 
like a 450 so that's why I enjoy most
about

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.300
