00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.490
 he I think is great and very cool of himself 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.830
 play because he is a little more 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.500
 similar to how was the big x 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.210

 showing how the game opens more 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.320
 simple things he this game 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.659
 unfortunately it 's only in Korean it does not have 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.909
 how to produce but is a game that 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.799
 Honestly speaking, I had a lot of fun. 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.630
 playing because he refers a little to 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.040
 mechanics during large as well as 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.869
 I had quoted for you. 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.280
 This game you can only be playing 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.710
 with following art 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.360
 but he and adopts those things a lot 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.670
 of RPG and everything else has the four 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.860
 sig classes for you to play and you 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.380
 You can go out there exploring the maps. 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.030
 killing bugs and things all as it goes 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.940
 have shown on the screen 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.069
 otc uses there to move and has the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.880
 buttons at 15 that ball from the right 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.890
 where was it 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.899
 as you can see the boys is not 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.690

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.670
 say and give to you spend enough 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.619
 time playing this fun game 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.060
 that's what I was doing with them 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.479
 arrives at the big exam 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.770
 so since we are in that vibe 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.960
 big daycare centers and many things I'm 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.610
 showing him to you so that you 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.500

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.020
