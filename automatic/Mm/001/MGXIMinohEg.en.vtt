00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.670 
stuff I didn't you know looking back at
it<00:02:39.970> now<00:02:40.060> it's<00:02:40.360> not<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.540> great<00:02:40.930> initial<00:02:41.440> setup

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
it now it's not a great initial setup

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.680 
it now it's not a great initial setup
because<00:02:41.950> it's<00:02:42.370> like<00:02:42.580> it's<00:02:42.819> time<00:02:43.120> just<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.599> you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
because it's like it's time just so you

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.240 
because it's like it's time just so you
have<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.989> keep<00:02:44.110> replaying<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.069> only

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
have to keep replaying it and you only

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.910 
have to keep replaying it and you only
have<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.549> specific<00:02:46.150> set<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.360> time<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.319> meet<00:02:47.739> all

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
have a specific set of time to meet all

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.920 
have a specific set of time to meet all
those<00:02:48.099> goals<00:02:48.430> now<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.180> don't<00:02:49.510> have<00:02:49.599> to<00:02:49.750> meet

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
those goals now you don't have to meet

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.080 
those goals now you don't have to meet
each<00:02:50.170> goal<00:02:50.769> every<00:02:51.040> time<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.549> can<00:02:51.730> complete

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
each goal every time you can complete

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.839 
each goal every time you can complete
one<00:02:52.269> then<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:52.720> know<00:02:53.370> go<00:02:54.370> back<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:54.730> do<00:02:54.819> another

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
one then you know go back and do another

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.400 
one then you know go back and do another
but<00:02:55.269> it's<00:02:55.390> kind<00:02:55.569> of<00:02:55.630> tedious<00:02:55.810> now<00:02:56.200> that

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
but it's kind of tedious now that

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.319 
but it's kind of tedious now that
looking<00:02:57.160> back<00:02:57.310> at<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.940> can<00:02:58.060> see<00:02:58.209> though

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
looking back at it you can see though

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.850 
looking back at it you can see though
that's<00:02:58.630> kind<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.260> layout<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.560> what<00:02:59.769> you

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
that's kind of the layout of what you

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.620 
that's kind of the layout of what you
you<00:03:00.220> know<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> things<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.760> can<00:03:01.209> jump<00:03:01.450> into

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
you know the things you can jump into

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.870 
you know the things you can jump into
and<00:03:01.900> try<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.230> do<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.590> then<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.250> earn<00:03:03.610> money

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
and try and do and then you earn money

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.000 
and try and do and then you earn money
and<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.269> can<00:03:04.510> buy<00:03:04.720> stats<00:03:05.290> for<00:03:05.500> your<00:03:05.590> character

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.400 
and you can buy stats for your character
that's<00:03:06.329> really<00:03:07.329> addictive<00:03:07.780> that's<00:03:08.049> certainly

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
that's really addictive that's certainly

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.410 
that's really addictive that's certainly
a<00:03:08.440> great<00:03:08.709> part<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.549> game<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.730> was<00:03:09.970> always

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
a great part of the game I was always

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.509 
a great part of the game I was always
into<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:10.959> always<00:03:11.290> I'd<00:03:12.040> always<00:03:12.220> do<00:03:12.400> my

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
into that I always I'd always do my

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.699 
into that I always I'd always do my
grinds<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.030> manuals<00:03:13.480> first<00:03:13.720> because<00:03:13.989> those

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
grinds and manuals first because those

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.289 
grinds and manuals first because those
are<00:03:14.860> really<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.160> core<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.459> trying<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.060> string

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
are really the core of trying to string

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.030 
are really the core of trying to string
together<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.660> really<00:03:16.870> long<00:03:17.110> trick<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.980> is

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
together a really long trick this is

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.009 
together a really long trick this is
some<00:03:18.549> new<00:03:18.700> footage<00:03:18.940> I<00:03:19.120> recorded<00:03:19.569> just<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.840> few

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
some new footage I recorded just a few

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:20.640 
some new footage I recorded just a few
days<00:03:20.170> ago

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
days ago

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.390 
days ago
and<00:03:20.799> I<00:03:20.829> still<00:03:21.069> have<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.310> original

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
doing pretty bad actually but I kind of

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.840 
doing pretty bad actually but I kind of
get<00:03:27.069> the<00:03:27.100> hang<00:03:27.310> of<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.519> later

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:09.339 
I was a lot of fun but I think that's

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:11.219

why<00:06:09.459> I<00:06:09.489> really<00:06:09.729> preferred<00:06:10.119> three<00:06:10.449> most<00:06:10.719> mostly

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
why I really preferred three most mostly

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.100 
why I really preferred three most mostly
