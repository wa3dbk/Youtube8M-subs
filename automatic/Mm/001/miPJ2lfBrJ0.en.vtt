video or playing the Cajon with brushes
and<00:00:21.640> that<00:00:21.789> will<00:00:21.910> show<00:00:21.939> you<00:00:22.119> how<00:00:22.360> to<00:00:22.419> do<00:00:22.630> the

grip<00:00:23.050> and<00:00:23.290> all<00:00:23.410> that<00:00:23.649> so<00:00:24.040> if<00:00:24.220> you<00:00:24.340> go<00:00:24.489> if<00:00:24.910> you're

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
grip and all that so if you go if you're

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.240 
grip and all that so if you go if you're
not<00:00:25.180> quite<00:00:25.419> sure<00:00:25.450> about<00:00:26.439> how<00:00:26.649> to<00:00:26.680> do<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:26.980> grip

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
not quite sure about how to do the grip

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.639 
not quite sure about how to do the grip
I'd<00:00:27.520> I'd<00:00:28.119> go<00:00:28.329> back<00:00:28.509> and<00:00:28.570> just<00:00:28.840> watch<00:00:29.079> that<00:00:29.110> it's

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
I'd I'd go back and just watch that it's

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.459 
I'd I'd go back and just watch that it's
not<00:00:29.800> too<00:00:30.009> long<00:00:30.450> and<00:00:31.450> then<00:00:31.630> come<00:00:31.960> back<00:00:31.989> and

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
not too long and then come back and

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.520 
not too long and then come back and
we'll<00:00:32.829> play<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.160> train<00:00:33.370> beep<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.290> groove

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
we'll play the train beep so the groove

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.650 
we'll play the train beep so the groove
on<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.800> brushes<00:00:36.070> is<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:36.850> same<00:00:37.120> pattern

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
on the brushes is the same pattern

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.950 
on the brushes is the same pattern
exactly<00:00:38.469> the<00:00:38.620> same<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:40.210> obviously<00:00:40.720> we<00:00:40.840> have

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
exactly the same but obviously we have

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.730 
exactly the same but obviously we have
brushes<00:00:41.230> at<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.590> end<00:00:41.710> of<00:00:41.860> our<00:00:41.920> hands<00:00:42.720> so<00:00:43.740> our

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
brushes at the end of our hands so our

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.370 
brushes at the end of our hands so our
arm<00:00:45.520> movement<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.540> wrist<00:00:46.780> movements<00:00:47.230> going

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
arm movement and wrist movements going

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.980 
arm movement and wrist movements going
to<00:00:47.470> be<00:00:47.530> slightly<00:00:47.770> different<00:00:48.340> so<00:00:49.120> still

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
to be slightly different so still

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.950 
to be slightly different so still
punching<00:00:50.470> out<00:00:50.590> the<00:00:50.620> sixteenths<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:55.840> the

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
punching out the sixteenths and then the

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:15.929 
punching out the sixteenths and then the
beat<00:01:13.829> so<00:01:14.829> let's<00:01:15.039> break<00:01:15.280> it<00:01:15.340> down<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.700> little

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
beat so let's break it down a little

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.020 
beat so let's break it down a little
slower<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:16.689> you'll<00:01:17.619> notice<00:01:17.979> my<00:01:18.219> my<00:01:18.700> arms

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
slower and you'll notice my my arms

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.559 
slower and you'll notice my my arms
moving<00:01:19.359> up<00:01:19.600> there<00:01:19.840> for<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:20.139> slap<00:01:20.439> tone<00:01:21.569> but

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
moving up there for the slap tone but

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.109 
moving up there for the slap tone but
still<00:01:22.959> we're<00:01:23.829> playing<00:01:24.159> we're<00:01:24.700> playing<00:01:24.969> the

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
still we're playing we're playing the

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.809 
still we're playing we're playing the
stroke<00:01:25.539> with<00:01:26.530> our<00:01:26.740> with<00:01:27.280> our<00:01:27.310> middle<00:01:27.700> finger

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819

the accents I'm just going I just want
the<00:02:33.940> sound<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.390> brush<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:35.020> you'll<00:02:35.980> hit

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
the sound of the brush so you'll hit

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:44.730 
the sound of the brush so you'll hit
like<00:02:37.209> on<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.510> sixteenth<00:02:43.560> because<00:02:44.560> it's

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
like on the sixteenth because it's

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.230 
like on the sixteenth because it's
really<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.130> brush<00:02:45.370> that's<00:02:45.610> giving<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.090> that

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.070 

and<00:02:57.610> all<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.940> beat<00:02:58.150> has<00:02:58.300> been<00:02:58.570> punched<00:02:58.960> out

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
and all the beat has been punched out

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.460 
and all the beat has been punched out
apart<00:02:59.470> from<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.740> accents<00:03:00.340> where<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:00.670> go<00:03:01.470> but

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
apart from the accents where I go but

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.590 
apart from the accents where I go but
all<00:03:02.620> most<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.280> beat<00:03:03.460> is<00:03:03.610> is<00:03:03.910> being<00:03:04.240> played

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
all most of the beat is is being played

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:19.560 
all most of the beat is is being played
with<00:03:04.810> my<00:03:04.990> right<00:03:05.230> hand<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.820> let's<00:03:18.850> take<00:03:19.330> that

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
with my right hand so let's take that

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.380 
with my right hand so let's take that
nice<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.080> slow

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
nice and slow

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:59.850 
nice and slow
