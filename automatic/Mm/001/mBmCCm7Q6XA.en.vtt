here because they're gonna take the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.840

longest<00:03:38.280> time<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.700> cook<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.980> then<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.550> think

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
longest time to cook and then I think

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.280

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
up here for a little while to get it

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.540 
up here for a little while to get it
started<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.830> then<00:03:46.830> I'm<00:03:46.980> gonna<00:03:47.070> come<00:03:47.250> back<00:03:47.280> in

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.680 
started and then I'm gonna come back in
a<00:03:47.610> little<00:03:47.730> bit<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:47.970> I'll<00:03:48.060> throw<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.390> meat<00:03:48.510> on

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
a little bit and I'll throw the meat on

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.090
