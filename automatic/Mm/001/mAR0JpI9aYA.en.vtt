and<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:22.000> said<00:02:22.060> oh<00:02:22.360> my<00:02:22.510> gosh<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.020> a

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
and I said oh my gosh this is a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.780 
and I said oh my gosh this is a
blueprint<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.709> what's<00:02:23.950> going<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.220> happen<00:02:24.610> to

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
blueprint of what's going to happen to

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.830 
blueprint of what's going to happen to
me<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:26.560> started<00:02:27.370> really<00:02:27.880> thinking<00:02:28.090> about<00:02:28.630> it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
me so I started really thinking about it

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.770 
me so I started really thinking about it
then<00:02:29.200> not<00:02:29.950> just<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.430> wrinkles<00:02:30.849> but<00:02:31.300> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
then not just the wrinkles but the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.160 
then not just the wrinkles but the
sagging<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.830> drooping<00:02:33.660> those<00:02:34.660> kinds<00:02:35.110> of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
sagging the drooping those kinds of

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.410 
sagging the drooping those kinds of
things<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.459> kind<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.760> happened<00:02:37.180> pretty

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
things and that kind of happened pretty

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.930 
things and that kind of happened pretty
quickly<00:02:37.750> because<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:39.069> seemed<00:02:39.400> like<00:02:39.580> my<00:02:39.760> mom

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
quickly because it seemed like my mom

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.729 
quickly because it seemed like my mom
started<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.510> age<00:02:40.630> really<00:02:40.930> quickly<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.530> my
