 than i know him and so who knows them and if anyone 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:13.139
 don't know run fools while you can in 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.870
 In general, the simple matter is simple. 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.690
 metatron each yourself a mouse get yes 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.240
 such that it was in its place but such 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.010
 there is no we will not deceive you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.470
 not yourself therefore before this was 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.650
 the long-suffering x7 and that changed 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.320
 buttons a million times well in general what's with her 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.239
 just did not happen was bought 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.550
 almost a thousand rubles and you see 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.920
 what happened to her this soft touch 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.890
 plastic and I don't like that coating 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.710
 that but climb with time and she 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.899
 the little hand doesn't fit all on it 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.390
 Here you see the two fingers still in 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.360
 walk where they live where mouse mouse 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.899
 it must be what it is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.200
 at all 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.710
 and this is the maximum 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.489
 big x7 but I decided to see what 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.930
 we do it at all yes yes yes yes yes yes 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.940
 as large as possible not to be 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.610
 unfounded let's let's ticker 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.790
 Iâ€™ll just put some dimensions 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.940
 Yes, that is, a pancake tripod that interferes that is 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.340
 the new mouse is the length and will be the length 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.729
 yes and so it is clear that the length here if 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.130
 align on the face is visible as far as 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.850
 it is longer that it is also wider 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.119
 all this interest has moved the devil well in short 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.700
 everything is clear to everyone and I started 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.920
 look for a mouse think what kind of climb 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.229
 on various sites found a lot of cool 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.080
 mice and remembered that once upon a time 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.780
 years ago and greased when the riser 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.790
 just starting to do something out of 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.770
 mice I had a mouse riser I do not remember 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.290
 title now I could not find 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.300
 she was huge and maybe I 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.220
 the hand was less yes no I had a hand 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.399
 such a general mouse was awesome to me 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.399
 she arranged she was more than ik-7 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:08.630
 but I gave her not having worked her floors 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.910
 weeks and so after that stayed with 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.819
 nose which was not only different 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.200
 stopped finding seven different 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.380
 modifications there are a little bit wider already they 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.170
 the point is not the point is that x7 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.750
 spoiled and started to drive full 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.280
 poop slop mice in which 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.890
 fly buttons on one-two-three 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.340
 and before i got into the internet raider mun 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.620
 it's expensive that there is still a damn camera 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.950
 interrupted the project I was distracted and in general 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.900
 Okay, what did I stop there he general 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.940
 looked at various expensive mice there 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.370
 various companies are now all sorts of fashionable but 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.520
 they are not satisfied with the performance characteristics have not 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.550
 good some self-respecting offices 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.560
 started writing mouse sizes there width 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.810
 jimu height they were all some 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.110
 little ones 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.780
 and the prices they had were quite high 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.180
 by all I speak already worth a whole thousand and 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.849
 and even large for a thousand rubles 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.760
 which is completely unreasonable for me 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.250
 the mouse I had to look for something else 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.110
 I also just went to the village shop 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.630
 and took the Chinese husband first come across 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.150
 so here leafed stopped leafed yes 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.459
 Who am I kidding the case I was looking for in Chinese 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.730
 store the biggest mouse and found it 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.550
 for $ 9 think about taking there too 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.319
 were written tth and know i was expecting that 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.299
 the Chinese are deceived will send some 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.910
 you know how tiny such a mouse is 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.010
 ordinary Chinese mice look but no 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.010
 they sent a huge full size 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.250
 the mouse is here even under the finger 5 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.470
 notches where you can put two fingers on 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.840
 like a classic like this 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.560

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.080

 me here this here this here and so 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.519
 fine 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.370
 although the little finger alone needs little space 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.440
 still something wider in general the hotel is excellent 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.530
 perfectly fits in your little finger all 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.900
 no matter how much space is missing but with 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.690
 such a movement is possible after all 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.870
 it is already there more or less 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.170
 normal mouse of course is simple 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.959
 optical without any film hindi fluke 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.709

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.690
 normally such a strap from her 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.419

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.690

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:56.380
 the button just opened well and actually 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.509

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.520
 dollars everything suits me solely 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.120
 that doesn't suit it again this is a soft-touch 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.680
 coverage that's ubiquitous right now 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.130
 present simply on all products he 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.979
 we are already in a terrible way 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.470
 it is ugly then becomes a 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.080
 quite a brutal bat you can 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.259

 looking for a big mouse but looking at brands 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.070
 it seems to them that it is dear to me too 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.680
 It seems that it is expensive to take 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.889
