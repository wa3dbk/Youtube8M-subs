00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.989
 good night 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.070
 doctor play opening the doors of 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.949
 sanatorium with one more mystery 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.500
 randy cone milk is a beautiful place to 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.800
 long river in the remote region of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.720
 nunavut in canada 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.390
 there is full of legends and stories from 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.989
 natives about the forest spirits 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.299
 about evil spirits on monsters she 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.570
 where there are still reports on the 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.100
 sales pressure 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.890
 but the greatest mystery that ever was 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.150
 resolved was the disappearance of all 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.180
 the villagers who lived by the lake 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.780
 in November 1930 a trader of 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.280
 Canadian skins called the lab 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.119
 I was in the middle of a snowstorm 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.490
 went to seek shelter for the night 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.710
 he approached a village and not imt 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.630
 and it is not they who die but they do not 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.190
 They like to be called so they are 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.380
 inuit worried feeling something 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.220
 was wrong he preferred to observe 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.760
 far the huts were there but only that 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.100
 no party of dogs nor voices nor 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.830
 movement and nothing 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.140
 he noticed that there was a smoke coming out 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.170
 the chimney of one of the huts and with its 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.000
 rich in fist taken by the most complete 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.220
 terror finally entered the village 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.040
 on entering the cabin he saw that the smoke 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.009
 exited the stove where a stew was 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.590
 boiling but almost burning 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.860
 only that's what he found the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.380
 residents were missing and in the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.940
 other huts 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.640
 there they were all abandoned 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.170
 doing a more detailed inspection 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.930
 found that the fishing boats of the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.070
 tribe were damaged as if someone 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.100
 was spoiled on purpose 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.960
 LÃ©o again searched every hut and 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.200
 tent still with hopes of 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.470
 find some sign of life against it 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.030
 the stock of food weapons and furs that 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.820
 would never have been left behind 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.160
 in another the cabin there was a table laid 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.160
 as if everyone had just finished dinner 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.320
 in another there was a coat with thread and 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.850
 needle as if the person who had 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.600
 sewing had evaporated in the air 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.260
 indicated that there had been a forced 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.060
 immediately in the fish deposit nothing 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.430
 had been removed 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.450
 there were no signs of fighting or 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.980
 confusion 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.230
 which would totally exclude the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.510
 possibility of having been attacked by 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.430
 looters since everything that was there 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.500
 of value or not in the same place as 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.250
 outskirts of the village there was 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.310
 nobody 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.700
 there were not even footprints in the snow 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.710
 the shelter no longer seemed so safe 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.810
 and he then resolved to face the cold and the 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.090
 tired to go to a station 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.430
 a few kilometers from the 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.530
 airplane 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.860
 I took the guards to help him 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.020
 Enter the station as you are tired and 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.540
 after a time already recovered he 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.820
 said that a message 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.610
 was sent to the police headquarters 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.640
 mounted on an emergency basis in 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.790
 few hours they arrived 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.300
 a rescue group follow to the lake and 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.950
 on the way stopped at the hunter's hut 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.510
 asked him some questions and the 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.610
 man said strange things 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.660
 were happening 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:20.180
 the nights lights very bright 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.970
 flying over the sky and flying objects in 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.750
 cylinder shape were for many 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.430
 hours and furniture hovering above the lake 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.410
 He and his two sons even counted 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.900
 more than 15 of those in one night 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.620
 all together they were terrified 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.090
 Did not even leave the cabin. 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.330
 a second group with the same time 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.540
 I was in the village and confirmed what 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.880
 had counted looking for the 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.300
 surroundings they were shocked to see the 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.020
 happened in the cemetery all the 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.790
 tombs had been opened and emptied 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.270
 and for the Inuit people this type of 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.910
 desecration is unacceptable 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.010
 then it was not done by them to 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.620
 possibility of having been an animal 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.140
 was also discarded when many 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.970
 snow carefully placed next to 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:16.700
 from the open pits but there was snow 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.060
 and when digging and digging they found 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:23.570
 bodies of the dogs in the village without any 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.830
 injury but some time of 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.740
 investigation 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.050
 all the hypotheses were considered and 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.990
 were discarded and they then 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:37.150
 They decided to come back and come back with more 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:41.410
 doubts than they had in the beginning 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:44.720
 on the way they saw in heaven the lights 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:49.990
 stopped lights they had never seen 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:53.060
 before and the Inuit people never appeared 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.340
 Where they went because they killed 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.320
 the dogs that were so important to 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.060
 they what they did with the corpses 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.700
 Why did they leave behind? 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.090
 your most precious assets and the lights 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.390
 were what would have been the passage 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.680
 sold by the village 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:17.510
 we'll never know 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.740
 next week I'll be back with one more 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:23.930
 mystery difficult to solve 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:30.640
 doctor play closing the doors of 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:30.640
 sanatorium, good night, I did not sleep
