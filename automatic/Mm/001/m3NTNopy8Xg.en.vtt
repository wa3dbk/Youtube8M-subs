00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.190
 there's good everyone here smells you're 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.939
 commenting and I bring you a new fashion 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.560
 a good ethic like all is leaving a 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.090
 app with a weapon that had never 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.950
 used in a gameplay there was never 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.570
 been an exclusive gameplay with this 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.210
 gun so good first thing all 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.199
 attentive to the class I was going with 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.480
 first benefit recognition for 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.650
 to take me out on wore blinders instead 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.259
 of stunners had been four 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.329
 specialist stripes the fad el 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.249
 good muffler I will explain a 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.250
 little how I used this weapon attentive 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:37.790
 4000 11-4 does not happen anything comes the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.410
 man in and he ran away and look knife not him 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.640
 killed with the c4 only picked up the 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.160
 my partner's sheet that he has killed 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.010
 in the skull so good after that 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.890
 start so incredible began the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.750
 love streak is never used as 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.550
 I said this weapon seriously there was never 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.680
 used 100% had tried how it was going 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.330
 with the accessories and all that you know that 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.790
 is a weapon that is given to us at level 70 and 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.110
 peak practically to 80 then yes 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.540
 you are determined to pass prestige 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.280
 quickly you barely have time to 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.710
 try the weapons not what you want is 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.370
 kill kill and kill with the weapons that 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.440
 do you have 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.750
 draw from the latest challenges and this 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.700
 So, good shape passes me the most 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.830
 quick as you can but good since 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.930
 I am in the last prestige I went 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.600
 to try this weapon and as you can see I have it 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.910
 with muffler he was not carrying a scavenger 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.750
 until the last to the last advantage 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.910
 that give me the gusts of 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.850
 specialist and good I'm playing low 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.560
 confirmed on a map as is coal or 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.200
 be neither the map nor the weapon were 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.910
 precisely the best and the truth is 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.930
 which is a very good game is a 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.480
 game in which I am moving 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.860
 continuously from one place to another 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.270
 we are controlling the points of 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.680
 reappearance and good 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.810
 concretely this weapon would be you want 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.270
 use or if you dare to use it is 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.060
 a weapon that first of all has 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.340
 very much a lot of recoil is not 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.610
 good for long distances is let 's say 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.900
 something like an ak-47 sometimes uses 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.420
 sometime then it's basically what 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.160
 similar as you are going to see as 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.990
 advance always I have run out of bullets 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.500
 the gathering wanted me out with 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.360
 missing so 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.600
 towards the impossible to catch that 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.730
 bags and finishing with the gun and how 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.470
 see to see the peephole is worth the measure with 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.900
 shines the red dot goes very well is a 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.450
 that improves a lot but good I wanted 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.920
 use muffler to get in 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.540
 inside the enemy or they were all 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.920
 appearing and because I like 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.140
 get used to the iron peepholes 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.490
 that is, the predetermined windows and 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.580
 Matt sank with a barrel you ask me 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.990
 like b1 there or I try to go for the one 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.520
 which win here because my partner 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.250
 he is not going to kill him I have three bullets in the 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.170
 gun passes my partner I say can not be 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.670
 it can not be that they kill not effectively 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.800
 it can not be because another one comes here 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.630
 it did not come so it is there it can not be 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.790
 Well, if it's hidden there, 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.500
 go to put and as I said is a weapon 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.239
 that now shoots I carry with silencer 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.510
 I wanted to get used to the extent of 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.739
 iron the normal peephole and yet 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.239
 let's say it's not going so well is a weapon 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.390
 that when it moves it covers you 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.220
 completely whole the peephole in addition 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.400
 has a circle above that is not 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.500
 let's say very nice that you go to 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.720
 easy to see how you are pointing but 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.310
 good is normal that goes very well to average 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.600
 long distance distance no more good 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.069
 at all as I was saying it has 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.769
 a lot of retreat 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.450
 as his rifle I was that I would almost 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.069
 more like a submachine gun than a rifle 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.260
 of assault is clear for example that 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.819
 it has much more precision in the 7 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.010
 we would say with silencer that this weapon 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.930
 with a silencer the key is that 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.389
 well we can shoot as always 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.189
 I shoot many times decision because 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.959
 does not move the weapon with the ak-47 with the 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.180
 hacr as you see 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.739
 if I heard that whenever I shoot and 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.290
 I'm pointing at someone from afar 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.959
 the shots are not as if you squeeze the 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.419
 trigger completely but that what 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.549
 better shot three bullets this in one 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:46.560
 thousandth what's right for the weapon and 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.599
 you see if you realize it is not 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.489
 continuous is not all right but that 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.989
 directly shot a little moment 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.879
 I think it's going too much gun left 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.290
 shoot stopped shooting is a 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.090
 thousandth that you hardly notice when you're 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.319
 watching the videos but nevertheless 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.019
 when I'm playing without that yes 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.340
 shot very little stopped shooting is 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.409
 for very little so that from just 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.970
 time for the weapon to return to its 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.100
 natural state so to speak 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.500
 to the ideal place where you are 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.350
 firing shooting firing and if 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.420
 was continuously firing let's go 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.250
 would be the basin weapon and the america 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.019
 also so as you see not to be 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.670
 that is halfway away or a 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.650
 distance that will not move the 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.690
 peephole always always with 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.830
 any hand either a submachine gun or 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.890
 high frustres always long distance 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.780
 the shot of little by little right now 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.860
 I was in this area in which you know 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.450
 that enemies always tend 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.550
 reappear right on the right there where 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.650
 they were the plates I see that they take the 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.380
 sheet as I told you in yesterday's video 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.090
 at the moment I'm there seeing that 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.850
 an enemy can come on the one hand what 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.830
 his is to take and leave the sheet there 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.190
 because the sheet is the only thing he's going to do 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.450
 is to help you is to say the sheet is going to be 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.710
 a place where the enemy comes 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.200
 it has to go through there by noses 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.780
 then if we leave in the sheet we will 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.400
 put denied denied for example then 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.080
 It is as it were one sensor 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.280
 movement or a clay moore that is going to 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.050
 notify if someone comes down that road 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.520
 so we do not need to cover that 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.500
 zone if there are three doors drained 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.820
 only two or three roads we cover 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.410
 only two and at the time that 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.569
 someone go around we are going to give 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.099
 account so we're going to be able to kill them 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.929
 a problem is something that always 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:20.439
 use one of the reasons why 

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:22.300
 sometimes it's not okay to take your own 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:25.449
 stage is to say the stages in which 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.119
 killed you so it's a data for 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.889
 point out the truth is that it is very useful and 

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:31.209
 they are things that as I go 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.189
 playing because I never remember 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:35.020
 comment them unless they are live 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.939
 in the moments when I usually comment 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.520
 these things but making a sub-machine gun we 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:41.439
 I had discussed the whole issue of shooting 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.849
 stop shooting is something that has you 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:44.469
 that coming from within is saying you do not 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.059
 you can catch with a gun even if it's a 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:49.139
 cr which is the one that has more precision of the 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:52.240
 you can not catch and put yourself there 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.889
 shoot sack why then because it 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.419
 you see the gun is not going to go where you are 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.159
 pointing to the beginning unless you're 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.839
 very bad notes to the foot starts to 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.449
 shoot and you put the head that 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:04.899
 it can be but let's say shoot 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:07.089
 shoot always shoot a measure with 

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:08.619
 a half distance shoot shoot 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.300
 shoot and then leave just the moment 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:12.429
 seeking the most one can stop 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.249
 shoot it so good at ten and room 

00:06:12.429 --> 00:06:17.370
 moa in a shot I do not know why I say I'm 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:19.710
 the hardest in the world I killed 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.270
 to 1 and you do not have love here you see that 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.280
 I'm about to die but just with the 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.800
 last and good sweeping the entire map and 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.380
 accents now I say look how good you have 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.850
 a love and one out there attentive because 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.680
 I make a fool of myself, I see no 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.180
 practical not that it persecutes me just like in 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.260
 the villa is killed by lamo and is killed by lamont 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.840
 I do not want to leave because he's going to kill me 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.729
 and you can see that my uncle sees me 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.990
 shooting please die for 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.210
 please die draft to die 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.010
 and effectively dies john woo more 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.680
 happy with licorice I'm running to catch 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:50.490
 my badges and good with this I say goodbye 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:53.280
 uap with incredible fat without pause but 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.229
 without hurry either the too fast h 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.780
 but hey, it gives me the exact time to 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.910
 explain you 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.290
