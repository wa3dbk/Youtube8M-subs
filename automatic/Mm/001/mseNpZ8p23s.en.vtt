00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
so this is a video for an origami tulip

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.310 
so this is a video for an origami tulip
flower<00:00:11.370> comes<00:00:12.360> with<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.540> tulip<00:00:12.900> on<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> top

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
flower comes with the tulip on the top

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.049 
flower comes with the tulip on the top
and<00:00:13.530> then<00:00:13.650> also<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.070> stem<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.549> leaf<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
and then also the stem and leaf on the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.550 
and then also the stem and leaf on the
bottom<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.929> order<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> make<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.379> top

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
bottom so in order to make the top

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.490 
bottom so in order to make the top
flower<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.369> tulip<00:00:18.109> go<00:00:19.109> ahead<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.320> grab<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
flower of the tulip go ahead and grab a

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.320 
flower of the tulip go ahead and grab a
sheet<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.800> paper<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.580> what<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:20.970> want<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.210> do

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
sheet of paper and what we want to do

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.470 
sheet of paper and what we want to do
start<00:00:21.990> with<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.380> white<00:00:22.650> side<00:00:22.680> up

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
start with the white side up

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.960 
start with the white side up
and<00:00:24.480> we're<00:00:24.630> going<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.840> use<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.470> book<00:00:26.250> fold<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.789> go

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
and we're going to use a book fold so go

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.419 
and we're going to use a book fold so go
ahead<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.330> fold<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.750> bottom<00:00:28.050> edge<00:00:28.230> up<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
ahead and fold the bottom edge up to the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.910 
ahead and fold the bottom edge up to the
top<00:00:29.640> edge<00:00:29.670> or<00:00:30.390> these<00:00:30.630> two<00:00:30.869> line<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.740> give

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
top edge or these two line up and give

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.440 
top edge or these two line up and give
it<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.099> precise<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.270> it's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
it this precise as you can so that it's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.930 
it this precise as you can so that it's
not<00:00:33.600> off<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> side<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.520> all<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:35.820> where

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
not off to the side at all but where

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.380 
not off to the side at all but where
they<00:00:36.059> all<00:00:36.290> meet<00:00:37.290> up<00:00:37.320> nicely<00:00:38.090> open<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.210> back

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
they all meet up nicely open that back

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.709 
they all meet up nicely open that back
up<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.809> then<00:00:40.290> do<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> other<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:40.800> as<00:00:40.890> well<00:00:41.719> so

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
up and then do the other one as well so

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.010 
up and then do the other one as well so
this<00:00:42.840> will<00:00:43.020> make<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> nice<00:00:44.000> plus<00:00:45.000> sign<00:00:45.690> right<00:00:45.870> in

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this will make a nice plus sign right in

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.459 
this will make a nice plus sign right in
the<00:00:46.140> middle<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> paper<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.520> that

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
the middle of the paper just like that

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.560 
the middle of the paper just like that
next<00:00:49.469> we're<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> do<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> blintz<00:00:50.760> fold<00:00:51.239> so

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
next we're going to do a blintz fold so

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.119 
next we're going to do a blintz fold so
we're<00:00:51.690> gonna<00:00:51.809> take<00:00:51.989> all<00:00:52.199> four<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> corners

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
we're gonna take all four of the corners

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.430 
we're gonna take all four of the corners
I'm<00:00:53.699> gonna<00:00:53.850> fold<00:00:54.090> them<00:00:54.270> into<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.660> X<00:00:54.930> Center

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
I'm gonna fold them into that X Center

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.319 
I'm gonna fold them into that X Center
that<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.860> made<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.340> right<00:00:56.940> there<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that we just made so right there in the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
that we just made so right there in the
middle<00:00:57.510> find<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.899> X<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.100> each<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.579> these

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
middle find that X and get each of these

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.110 
middle find that X and get each of these
corners<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.899> exactly<00:01:01.530> into<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.730> center

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
corners to go exactly into the center

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
corners to go exactly into the center
and<00:01:04.309> try<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.610> precise<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.570> so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and try to be as precise as you can so

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.690 
and try to be as precise as you can so
that<00:01:07.290> they're<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.590> overlapping<00:01:08.280> they're<00:01:08.610> not

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
that they're not overlapping they're not

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.010 
that they're not overlapping they're not
on<00:01:08.790> top<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.150> each<00:01:09.240> other<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.540> there's<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:09.840> too

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
on top of each other and there's not too

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.429 
on top of each other and there's not too
much<00:01:10.200> white<00:01:11.100> space<00:01:11.510> so<00:01:13.220> just<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:15.439> get

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
much white space so just like that get

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.990 
much white space so just like that get
all<00:01:16.710> four<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.100> those<00:01:17.490> corners<00:01:19.850> next<00:01:20.850> we're

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
all four of those corners next we're

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.880 
all four of those corners next we're
gonna<00:01:21.119> fold<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.600> entire<00:01:21.720> model<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.320> half<00:01:22.530> just

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
gonna fold the entire model in half just

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.200 
gonna fold the entire model in half just
take<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:23.549> corner<00:01:23.820> up<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> top<00:01:26.150> just<00:01:27.150> like

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
take one corner up to the top just like

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.770 
take one corner up to the top just like
that<00:01:27.770> next<00:01:28.770> we're<00:01:29.430> gonna<00:01:29.490> take<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.600> two

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that next we're gonna take the two

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.350 
that next we're gonna take the two
outside<00:01:31.530> corners<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.610> new<00:01:32.759> triangle<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
outside corners of this new triangle and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.289 
outside corners of this new triangle and
we're<00:01:33.450> gonna<00:01:33.570> fold<00:01:33.869> them<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:35.520> there's<00:01:36.090> no

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
we're gonna fold them up and there's no

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.390 
we're gonna fold them up and there's no
specific<00:01:36.600> spot<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:37.979> get<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.250> where

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
specific spot for this just get it where

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.660 
specific spot for this just get it where
it<00:01:38.490> lines<00:01:38.759> up<00:01:39.740> where<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.829> makes<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.130> nice<00:01:41.250> point

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it lines up where it makes a nice point

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.940 
it lines up where it makes a nice point
this<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.630> gonna<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> top<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> tulip

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
this is gonna be the top of the tulip

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.550 
this is gonna be the top of the tulip
and<00:01:44.250> make<00:01:44.909> sure<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.360> comes<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.290> this

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and make sure that it comes up to this

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.020 
and make sure that it comes up to this
spot<00:01:46.740> right<00:01:47.040> here<00:01:47.100> where<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> middle

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
spot right here where this is the middle

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.370 
spot right here where this is the middle
of<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> paper<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.630> don't<00:01:48.810> fold<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.170> where<00:01:49.290> it

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
of the paper so don't fold it where it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.740 
of the paper so don't fold it where it
comes<00:01:49.560> over<00:01:49.770> too<00:01:50.040> far<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.090> right<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
comes over too far but just right up to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.690 
comes over too far but just right up to
that<00:01:51.899> center<00:01:52.170> spot<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.649> try<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> get<00:01:53.460> them<00:01:53.579> as

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that center spot and try to get them as

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.429 
that center spot and try to get them as
symmetrical<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.810> within<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.170> same

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
symmetrical as you can within the same

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.530 
symmetrical as you can within the same
on<00:01:55.710> both<00:01:55.950> sides<00:01:57.439> just<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.540> once

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
on both sides just like that and once

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.969 
on both sides just like that and once
you've<00:02:00.689> done<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.899> these<00:02:01.770> are<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
you've done that these are the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.889 
you've done that these are the
preliminary<00:02:02.130> folds<00:02:02.850> instead<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.689> using

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
preliminary folds instead of just using

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.039 
preliminary folds instead of just using
it<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.770> simple<00:02:05.250> fold<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.729> front<00:02:06.030> or<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.750> fold

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
it as a simple fold in front or a fold

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.260 
it as a simple fold in front or a fold
behind<00:02:07.200> we're<00:02:07.560> gonna<00:02:07.680> actually<00:02:07.950> use<00:02:08.270> what's

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
behind we're gonna actually use what's

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.240 
behind we're gonna actually use what's
called<00:02:09.360> an<00:02:09.569> inside<00:02:09.899> reverse<00:02:10.319> fold<00:02:10.619> we're

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
called an inside reverse fold we're

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.770 
called an inside reverse fold we're
instead<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.730> flap<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:12.150> going<00:02:12.420> up<00:02:12.569> like

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
instead of the flap just going up like

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.380 
instead of the flap just going up like
this

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
this

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.149 
this
or<00:02:13.810> even<00:02:14.140> if<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.319> was<00:02:14.439> just<00:02:14.620> going<00:02:14.859> in<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.099> the

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
or even if it was just going in in the

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.069 
or even if it was just going in in the
back<00:02:15.370> we're<00:02:16.239> gonna<00:02:16.299> make<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.689> where<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.900> goes

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
back we're gonna make it where it goes

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.339 
back we're gonna make it where it goes
on<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.859> inside<00:02:18.629> so<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.719> way<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.870> do<00:02:20.079> that<00:02:20.200> is

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
on the inside so the way to do that is

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.619 
on the inside so the way to do that is
to<00:02:20.469> sort<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.709> open<00:02:20.859> the<00:02:21.069> paper<00:02:21.280> up<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:22.510> about

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
to sort of open the paper up to about

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.080 
to sort of open the paper up to about
right<00:02:22.810> here<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:23.200> can<00:02:23.349> see<00:02:23.620> these<00:02:24.370> lines<00:02:24.700> that

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
right here you can see these lines that

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.940 
right here you can see these lines that
we've<00:02:25.209> made<00:02:25.510> what<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.319> want<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.650> do<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:26.890> you

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
we've made what you want to do is you

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.660 
we've made what you want to do is you
want<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.159> make<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.920> creases<00:02:30.280> go<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.549> this

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
want to make the the creases go in this

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.819 
want to make the the creases go in this
direction<00:02:30.879> on<00:02:31.389> both<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.989> those<00:02:32.139> lines<00:02:32.379> so<00:02:32.680> one

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
direction on both of those lines so one

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.410 
direction on both of those lines so one
of<00:02:32.859> them<00:02:33.069> already<00:02:33.430> does<00:02:33.639> like<00:02:33.969> this<00:02:34.090> one<00:02:34.269> for

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
of them already does like this one for

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.000 
of them already does like this one for
example<00:02:34.510> right<00:02:34.840> here<00:02:34.870> already<00:02:35.469> wants<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.859> go

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
example right here already wants to go

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.770 
example right here already wants to go
in<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.790> direction<00:02:36.969> but<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.420> other<00:02:37.540> one<00:02:37.750> is

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
in this direction but the other one is

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.110 
in this direction but the other one is
folded<00:02:38.319> that<00:02:38.799> way<00:02:39.010> what<00:02:39.639> we<00:02:39.700> want<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:39.909> do<00:02:40.000> is

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
folded that way what we want to do is

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.559 
folded that way what we want to do is
reverse<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.609> now<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:43.090> paper<00:02:43.329> as

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
reverse that so that now this paper as

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.440 
reverse that so that now this paper as
well<00:02:43.840> right<00:02:44.230> along<00:02:44.439> that<00:02:44.620> crease<00:02:45.239> comes<00:02:46.239> up

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
well right along that crease comes up

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.349 
well right along that crease comes up
and<00:02:46.659> then<00:02:47.439> if<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.650> look<00:02:47.859> at<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.189> back<00:02:48.370> at<00:02:49.060> this

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
and then if you look at it back at this

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.390 
and then if you look at it back at this
spot<00:02:49.659> you<00:02:49.900> can<00:02:50.409> see<00:02:50.590> how<00:02:50.739> once<00:02:51.040> we<00:02:51.159> have<00:02:51.280> both

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
spot you can see how once we have both

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.470 
spot you can see how once we have both
of<00:02:51.489> those<00:02:51.609> creases<00:02:51.819> going<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.209> right<00:02:52.299> way<00:02:52.359> you

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
of those creases going the right way you

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.470 
of those creases going the right way you
can<00:02:52.659> sort<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.870> push<00:02:53.169> this<00:02:53.470> up<00:02:54.120> inside<00:02:55.120> and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
can sort of push this up inside and

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.099 
can sort of push this up inside and
it'll<00:02:55.959> reverse<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.879> spine<00:02:58.299> so<00:02:58.659> this<00:02:58.840> crease

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
it'll reverse the spine so this crease

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.300 
it'll reverse the spine so this crease
right<00:02:59.200> here<00:02:59.349> that<00:02:59.680> what's<00:02:59.859> going<00:03:00.069> in<00:03:00.219> this

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
right here that what's going in this

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.490 
right here that what's going in this
direction<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.849> now<00:03:00.969> going<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.269> go<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.689> flip<00:03:02.379> it

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
direction is now going to go and flip it

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.220 
direction is now going to go and flip it
inside<00:03:02.680> out<00:03:02.919> and<00:03:03.310> reverse<00:03:04.150> that's<00:03:04.810> an<00:03:04.900> inside

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
inside out and reverse that's an inside

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.640 
inside out and reverse that's an inside
reverse<00:03:05.379> fold<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:07.900> like<00:03:08.049> that<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:08.500> if<00:03:08.560> you

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
reverse fold just like that so if you

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.780 
reverse fold just like that so if you
look<00:03:08.769> at<00:03:08.889> it<00:03:08.950> from<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.129> top<00:03:09.189> you<00:03:09.340> can<00:03:09.459> see<00:03:09.700> how

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
look at it from the top you can see how

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.750 
look at it from the top you can see how
now<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:10.719> flap<00:03:11.049> has<00:03:11.530> been<00:03:11.739> put<00:03:11.950> on<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.189> middle

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
now this flap has been put on the middle

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.780 
now this flap has been put on the middle
of<00:03:12.909> the<00:03:13.239> paper<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:14.680> like<00:03:14.829> that<00:03:14.980> we<00:03:15.579> do<00:03:15.700> the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
of the paper just like that we do the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.140 
of the paper just like that we do the
same<00:03:15.969> thing<00:03:16.269> on<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:17.349> other<00:03:17.379> side<00:03:17.849> you<00:03:18.849> can<00:03:19.000> go

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
same thing on the other side you can go

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.969 
same thing on the other side you can go
ahead<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.449> just<00:03:19.510> see<00:03:20.379> I'm<00:03:20.470> taking<00:03:20.829> a<00:03:20.889> little

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:20.979 
ahead and just see I'm taking a little

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.409 
ahead and just see I'm taking a little
bit<00:03:21.159> of<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.280> shortcut<00:03:21.549> there<00:03:21.819> just<00:03:22.000> pushing<00:03:22.359> it

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
bit of a shortcut there just pushing it

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.719 
bit of a shortcut there just pushing it
straight<00:03:22.750> in<00:03:22.959> but<00:03:23.919> that's<00:03:24.099> the<00:03:24.220> exact<00:03:24.549> same

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:24.729 
straight in but that's the exact same

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:29.250 
straight in but that's the exact same
idea<00:03:25.889> just<00:03:26.889> like<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.810> then<00:03:28.810> finally

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
idea just like that and then finally

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.030 
idea just like that and then finally
we're<00:03:29.650> gonna<00:03:29.709> fold<00:03:30.239> this<00:03:31.239> edge<00:03:31.540> into<00:03:32.079> the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
we're gonna fold this edge into the

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.939 
we're gonna fold this edge into the
center<00:03:33.189> line<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:34.470> we're<00:03:35.470> gonna<00:03:35.590> do<00:03:35.799> that

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
center line and we're gonna do that

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.039 
center line and we're gonna do that
where<00:03:36.159> it<00:03:36.280> terminates<00:03:36.760> up<00:03:37.000> at<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:37.479> point<00:03:37.870> the

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
where it terminates up at this point the

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.749 
where it terminates up at this point the
top<00:03:38.260> of<00:03:38.439> the<00:03:38.530> tulip<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:40.209> we<00:03:40.419> fold<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:42.519> like

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:42.759 
top of the tulip so we fold just like

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:43.199 
top of the tulip so we fold just like
that

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
that

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.749 
that
where<00:03:44.109> it<00:03:44.169> comes<00:03:44.290> over<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:45.280> points<00:03:45.609> in<00:03:45.699> the

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:45.759 
where it comes over that points in the

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.030 
where it comes over that points in the
middle<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.359> goes<00:03:46.629> up<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.959> top<00:03:47.040> the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
middle and it goes up to the top the

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.710 
middle and it goes up to the top the
other<00:03:48.129> one<00:03:48.370> should<00:03:49.000> come<00:03:49.150> over<00:03:49.209> on<00:03:49.509> this<00:03:49.659> side

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
other one should come over on this side

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.780 
other one should come over on this side
and<00:03:50.129> basically<00:03:51.129> just<00:03:51.669> touch<00:03:52.560> right<00:03:53.560> there<00:03:53.799> the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
and basically just touch right there the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.449 
and basically just touch right there the
two<00:03:54.970> of<00:03:55.120> them<00:03:55.590> can<00:03:56.590> come<00:03:56.949> up<00:03:57.069> right<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.340> the

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
two of them can come up right to the

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.099 
two of them can come up right to the
same<00:03:57.639> spot<00:03:57.939> and<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.299> should<00:03:58.509> be<00:03:58.599> symmetrical

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
same spot and that should be symmetrical

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.550 
same spot and that should be symmetrical
just<00:03:59.799> like<00:03:59.919> that<00:04:00.069> flip<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.519> over<00:04:00.639> and<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:02.349> same

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
just like that flip it over and the same

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.729 
just like that flip it over and the same
thing<00:04:02.739> on<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:02.949> back<00:04:03.129> where<00:04:04.090> these<00:04:04.359> flaps<00:04:04.739> are

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
thing on the back where these flaps are

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.839 
thing on the back where these flaps are
gonna<00:04:05.919> line<00:04:06.159> up<00:04:06.370> with<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:06.639> ones<00:04:06.900> behind<00:04:07.900> them

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
gonna line up with the ones behind them

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.280 
gonna line up with the ones behind them
just<00:04:09.849> like<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.509> that<00:04:10.689> is<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.959> final

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
just like that and that is the final

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.569 
just like that and that is the final
step<00:04:12.599> for<00:04:13.599> the<00:04:13.689> flower<00:04:13.989> of<00:04:14.349> the<00:04:14.620> origami<00:04:15.159> tulip

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
step for the flower of the origami tulip

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.430 
step for the flower of the origami tulip
just<00:04:16.180> like<00:04:16.299> that<00:04:16.449> so<00:04:16.630> once<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:16.870> have<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.139> put

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
just like that so once you have that put

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.649 
just like that so once you have that put
that<00:04:17.530> aside<00:04:18.060> grab<00:04:19.060> another<00:04:19.209> sheet<00:04:19.419> of<00:04:19.509> paper

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:19.659 
that aside grab another sheet of paper

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.479 
that aside grab another sheet of paper
and<00:04:20.019> now<00:04:20.109> we're<00:04:20.229> going<00:04:20.409> to<00:04:20.470> make<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.949> stem<00:04:21.219> or

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
and now we're going to make the stem or

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.690 
and now we're going to make the stem or
the<00:04:21.549> leaf<00:04:22.169> it's<00:04:23.169> for<00:04:23.349> the<00:04:23.440> origami<00:04:23.770> flower<00:04:24.159> so

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
the leaf it's for the origami flower so

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.159 
the leaf it's for the origami flower so
the<00:04:24.789> first<00:04:25.000> step<00:04:25.210> for<00:04:25.240> making<00:04:25.719> the<00:04:25.870> stem

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
the first step for making the stem

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.379 
the first step for making the stem
on<00:04:26.349> the<00:04:26.680> lower<00:04:26.860> half<00:04:27.099> of<00:04:27.219> the<00:04:27.370> tulip<00:04:27.639> we're

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
on the lower half of the tulip we're

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.260 
on the lower half of the tulip we're
going<00:04:28.539> to<00:04:28.629> make<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:28.840> diagonal<00:04:29.199> fold<00:04:30.090> again<00:04:31.090> with

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
going to make a diagonal fold again with

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.600 
going to make a diagonal fold again with
the<00:04:31.360> white<00:04:31.539> side<00:04:31.780> up<00:04:31.860> we<00:04:32.860> fold<00:04:33.129> it<00:04:33.249> over<00:04:33.490> the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
the white side up we fold it over the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.119 
the white side up we fold it over the
the<00:04:34.150> color<00:04:34.389> will<00:04:34.629> come<00:04:34.810> out<00:04:34.990> get<00:04:35.860> it<00:04:35.949> nice<00:04:36.099> and

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.129 
the color will come out get it nice and

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.879 
the color will come out get it nice and
lined<00:04:36.460> up<00:04:36.749> all<00:04:37.749> the<00:04:37.870> way<00:04:37.990> across<00:04:38.199> a<00:04:38.620> nice

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
lined up all the way across a nice

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.070 
lined up all the way across a nice
diagonal<00:04:39.219> fold<00:04:39.580> then<00:04:40.240> open<00:04:40.599> it<00:04:40.719> up<00:04:40.810> we<00:04:40.990> only

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
diagonal fold then open it up we only

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.480 
diagonal fold then open it up we only
need<00:04:41.259> to<00:04:41.319> make<00:04:41.409> one<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.770> diagonal<00:04:42.219> folds

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
need to make one of the diagonal folds

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.429 
need to make one of the diagonal folds
on<00:04:42.580> this<00:04:42.729> one<00:04:42.909> and<00:04:43.419> we're<00:04:43.599> gonna<00:04:43.659> take<00:04:43.990> both<00:04:44.409> of

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:44.439 
on this one and we're gonna take both of

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:47.129 
on this one and we're gonna take both of
these<00:04:44.740> outside<00:04:45.249> edges<00:04:45.719> we're<00:04:46.719> going<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:46.960> make

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
these outside edges we're going to make

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.140 
these outside edges we're going to make
a<00:04:47.289> kite<00:04:47.680> fold<00:04:48.009> so<00:04:48.279> this<00:04:48.520> edge<00:04:48.729> right<00:04:48.759> here<00:04:48.969> is

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
a kite fold so this edge right here is

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.559 
a kite fold so this edge right here is
going<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:49.389> go<00:04:49.449> into<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.930> middle<00:04:50.229> of<00:04:50.319> the<00:04:50.439> paper

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
going to go into the middle of the paper

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.879 
going to go into the middle of the paper
just<00:04:52.569> like<00:04:52.840> this<00:04:53.080> let<00:04:53.409> me<00:04:53.469> do<00:04:53.590> that<00:04:53.680> on<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.860> top

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
just like this let me do that on the top

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.749 
just like this let me do that on the top
and<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:56.020> bottom<00:04:56.139> they<00:04:57.009> line<00:04:57.189> up<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.490> this<00:04:57.580> is

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
and the bottom they line up and this is

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.450 
and the bottom they line up and this is
called<00:04:57.999> a<00:04:58.180> kite<00:04:58.449> base<00:04:58.779> can<00:04:59.770> sort<00:04:59.979> of<00:05:00.039> see<00:05:00.250> from

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
called a kite base can sort of see from

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.100 
called a kite base can sort of see from
here<00:05:00.909> how<00:05:01.029> it<00:05:01.150> gives<00:05:01.449> it<00:05:01.569> that<00:05:01.599> nice<00:05:01.779> kite

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
here how it gives it that nice kite

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.469 
here how it gives it that nice kite
shape<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:03.460> we've<00:05:03.580> done<00:05:03.789> that<00:05:03.819> on<00:05:04.029> the<00:05:04.150> bottom

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
shape so we've done that on the bottom

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.610 
shape so we've done that on the bottom
and<00:05:04.629> now<00:05:04.779> we're<00:05:04.930> also<00:05:05.080> gonna<00:05:05.289> do<00:05:05.409> it<00:05:05.469> on<00:05:05.529> the

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
and now we're also gonna do it on the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.709 
and now we're also gonna do it on the
top<00:05:05.800> so<00:05:05.979> the<00:05:06.099> same<00:05:06.279> thing<00:05:08.250> over<00:05:09.250> here<00:05:09.719> like

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:10.719 
top so the same thing over here like

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:14.249 
top so the same thing over here like
this<00:05:10.960> and<00:05:11.550> this<00:05:12.550> paper<00:05:13.000> is<00:05:13.210> gonna<00:05:13.330> overlap<00:05:13.930> on

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
this and this paper is gonna overlap on

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.010 
this and this paper is gonna overlap on
the<00:05:14.560> top<00:05:14.770> of<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:16.539> one<00:05:16.689> that<00:05:16.810> we<00:05:16.900> did

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
the top of the one that we did

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.670 
the top of the one that we did
underneath<00:05:17.409> it<00:05:17.560> just<00:05:18.870> like<00:05:19.870> that<00:05:21.629> and<00:05:22.680> now

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
underneath it just like that and now

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.309 
underneath it just like that and now
once<00:05:23.949> we've<00:05:24.099> done<00:05:24.539> that<00:05:25.539> fold<00:05:25.900> we're<00:05:26.169> actually

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
once we've done that fold we're actually

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.779 
once we've done that fold we're actually
going<00:05:26.680> to<00:05:26.770> do<00:05:26.889> it<00:05:26.979> one<00:05:27.219> more<00:05:27.249> time<00:05:27.430> we're<00:05:27.699> going

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
going to do it one more time we're going

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.909 
going to do it one more time we're going
to<00:05:27.849> fold<00:05:28.029> these<00:05:28.240> edges<00:05:28.300> in<00:05:28.900> so<00:05:29.740> we're<00:05:29.830> gonna

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
to fold these edges in so we're gonna

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:36.540 
to fold these edges in so we're gonna
thin<00:05:30.370> it<00:05:30.400> down<00:05:32.129> once<00:05:33.129> more<00:05:33.279> on<00:05:33.729> the<00:05:34.360> bottom<00:05:35.550> so

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
thin it down once more on the bottom so

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.230 
thin it down once more on the bottom so
two<00:05:36.610> more<00:05:37.000> kite<00:05:37.300> folds<00:05:38.849> right<00:05:39.849> there<00:05:40.060> like

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
two more kite folds right there like

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.549 
two more kite folds right there like
that

00:05:43.549 --> 00:05:43.559 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:45.379 

and<00:05:44.129> then<00:05:44.219> after<00:05:44.519> this<00:05:44.639> we're<00:05:44.879> gonna<00:05:44.939> fold<00:05:45.239> the

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
and then after this we're gonna fold the

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.839 
and then after this we're gonna fold the
bottom<00:05:45.749> all<00:05:46.439> the<00:05:46.499> way<00:05:46.739> up<00:05:46.799> to<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.069> top<00:05:49.849> like

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
bottom all the way up to the top like

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.389 
bottom all the way up to the top like
that<00:05:51.119> so<00:05:51.779> that<00:05:51.869> these<00:05:52.079> two<00:05:52.289> points<00:05:52.529> are<00:05:52.739> now

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:53.399 
that so that these two points are now

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:54.769 
that so that these two points are now
coming<00:05:53.639> all<00:05:53.879> the<00:05:54.149> way<00:05:54.239> up<00:05:54.359> to<00:05:54.479> touch<00:05:54.629> each

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
coming all the way up to touch each

00:05:54.779 --> 00:06:00.469 
coming all the way up to touch each
other<00:05:58.099> like<00:05:59.099> that<00:05:59.339> and<00:06:00.209> then<00:06:00.299> we're<00:06:00.389> gonna

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
other like that and then we're gonna

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.359 
other like that and then we're gonna
fold<00:06:00.689> the<00:06:00.809> entire<00:06:01.079> thing<00:06:01.289> in<00:06:01.379> half<00:06:01.589> from<00:06:02.189> the

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:02.369 
fold the entire thing in half from the

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:04.279 
fold the entire thing in half from the
left<00:06:02.579> hand<00:06:02.789> side<00:06:02.999> over<00:06:03.599> to<00:06:03.809> the<00:06:03.929> right<00:06:04.109> hand

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
left hand side over to the right hand

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.169 
left hand side over to the right hand
side<00:06:04.499> so<00:06:04.529> we're<00:06:04.769> gonna<00:06:04.859> pull<00:06:05.759> the<00:06:05.909> whole<00:06:06.149> thing

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:06.179 
side so we're gonna pull the whole thing

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:08.599 
side so we're gonna pull the whole thing
over<00:06:07.139> now<00:06:07.529> there's<00:06:07.679> a<00:06:07.769> lot<00:06:07.919> of<00:06:08.039> paper<00:06:08.219> in<00:06:08.429> there

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:08.609 
over now there's a lot of paper in there

00:06:08.609 --> 00:06:12.369 
over now there's a lot of paper in there
but<00:06:09.509> try<00:06:09.719> and<00:06:09.779> be<00:06:09.869> as<00:06:09.959> precise<00:06:10.349> as<00:06:10.529> you<00:06:10.649> can

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:12.379 
but try and be as precise as you can

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:14.329 
but try and be as precise as you can
just<00:06:13.379> like<00:06:13.499> this<00:06:13.799> and<00:06:13.949> you'll<00:06:14.039> see<00:06:14.219> how

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:14.339 
just like this and you'll see how

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:16.489 
just like this and you'll see how
there's<00:06:14.549> one<00:06:15.449> sticking<00:06:15.839> out<00:06:16.079> a<00:06:16.109> little<00:06:16.319> bit

00:06:16.489 --> 00:06:16.499 
there's one sticking out a little bit

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:17.629 
there's one sticking out a little bit
right<00:06:16.589> there<00:06:16.799> all<00:06:16.949> we<00:06:17.069> want<00:06:17.219> to<00:06:17.279> do<00:06:17.369> is<00:06:17.459> we<00:06:17.519> want

right there all we want to do is we want

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.529 
right there all we want to do is we want
to<00:06:17.669> rotate<00:06:17.909> it<00:06:18.209> over<00:06:18.649> so<00:06:19.649> that<00:06:19.889> now<00:06:20.219> it's<00:06:21.179> lined

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
to rotate it over so that now it's lined

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.499 
to rotate it over so that now it's lined
up<00:06:21.749> along<00:06:21.989> that<00:06:22.199> outside<00:06:22.559> edge<00:06:22.739> of<00:06:22.889> the<00:06:23.009> leaf

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:23.509 
up along that outside edge of the leaf

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:27.709 
up along that outside edge of the leaf
you'll<00:06:24.509> see<00:06:24.809> once<00:06:25.289> that's<00:06:25.469> finished<00:06:26.599> you<00:06:27.599> have

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:27.719 
you'll see once that's finished you have

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.499 
you'll see once that's finished you have
a<00:06:27.749> nice<00:06:27.959> little<00:06:28.819> outside<00:06:29.819> leaf<00:06:30.059> you<00:06:30.209> can<00:06:30.359> make

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509 
a nice little outside leaf you can make

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:31.909 
a nice little outside leaf you can make
you<00:06:30.629> can<00:06:30.779> sort<00:06:30.959> of<00:06:31.019> pick<00:06:31.379> it<00:06:31.409> up<00:06:31.589> and<00:06:31.709> pull<00:06:31.889> it

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
you can sort of pick it up and pull it

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.329 
you can sort of pick it up and pull it
out<00:06:32.159> with<00:06:32.669> a<00:06:32.699> stem<00:06:33.119> right<00:06:33.359> there<00:06:34.219> and<00:06:35.219> then

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:35.339 
out with a stem right there and then

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:38.089 
out with a stem right there and then
what<00:06:35.819> you<00:06:35.999> have<00:06:36.179> the<00:06:36.509> tulip<00:06:36.809> flower<00:06:37.099> that'll

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
what you have the tulip flower that'll

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:42.709 
what you have the tulip flower that'll
go<00:06:38.189> right<00:06:38.399> on<00:06:38.549> top<00:06:38.759> of<00:06:38.789> it<00:06:40.129> and<00:06:41.599> that'll<00:06:42.599> give

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
go right on top of it and that'll give

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:46.669 
go right on top of it and that'll give
you<00:06:42.809> the<00:06:42.839> finished<00:06:43.259> origami<00:06:44.039> tulip<00:06:44.429> flower
