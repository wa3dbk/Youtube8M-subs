maybe closer to a 5 or about a 5.5
across<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> entire<00:01:03.090> line<00:01:03.359> now<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> banana

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
across the entire line now the banana

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080 
across the entire line now the banana

there's something else about this board
that<00:01:29.369> actually<00:01:29.759> gives<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> little<00:01:30.390> bit<00:01:30.479> more

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that actually gives it a little bit more

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
that actually gives it a little bit more
pop<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.680> bit<00:01:31.770> more<00:01:32.009> stability<00:01:32.369> it's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
pop and a little bit more stability it's

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.520 
pop and a little bit more stability it's
actually<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> sidewalls<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.290> say

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
actually the sidewalls and I say

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.649 
actually the sidewalls and I say
sidewalls<00:01:35.490> because<00:01:35.850> there's<00:01:36.000> actually<00:01:36.210> well

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
sidewalls because there's actually well

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.700 
sidewalls because there's actually well
of<00:01:36.720> course<00:01:36.869> they're<00:01:37.140> gonna<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.320> two<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> them

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
of course they're gonna be two of them

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.770 
of course they're gonna be two of them
but<00:01:37.829> there's<00:01:37.979> actually<00:01:38.520> an<00:01:38.790> internal<00:01:39.299> power

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
but there's actually an internal power

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.719 
but there's actually an internal power
transfer<00:01:40.770> sidewall<00:01:41.250> that's<00:01:41.430> made<00:01:41.549> out<00:01:41.670> of

transfer sidewall that's made out of
birch<00:01:42.119> wood<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:43.110> there's<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> ultra<00:01:43.619> high

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.230 
birch wood and then there's a ultra high
molecular<00:01:43.829> weight<00:01:44.310> inside<00:01:44.820> while<00:01:45.060> that's

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
molecular weight inside while that's

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.399 
molecular weight inside while that's
actually<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.689> outside<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> sandwich

construction<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.090> banana<00:01:48.420> magical<00:01:48.899> of

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
construction now the banana magical of

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.690 
construction now the banana magical of
course<00:01:49.259> looks<00:01:49.680> really<00:01:49.950> cool<00:01:50.100> there's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> bio

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
course looks really cool there's a bio

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.969 
course looks really cool there's a bio
beans<00:01:51.000> top<00:01:51.299> sheet<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.960> really<00:01:52.320> eco-friendly

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
beans top sheet it's really eco-friendly

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.130 
beans top sheet it's really eco-friendly
and<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.520> base<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.939> gonna<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.149> really<00:01:54.390> cool<00:01:54.659> too

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and the base is gonna be really cool too

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.050 
and the base is gonna be really cool too
but<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.890> thing<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.100> gonna<00:01:56.280> stay<00:01:56.520> nice<00:01:56.759> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
but the thing is gonna stay nice and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.209 
but the thing is gonna stay nice and
fast<00:01:57.299> because<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.380> co<00:01:58.619> sintered<00:01:59.189> base

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
fast because it's a co sintered base

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.550 
fast because it's a co sintered base
which<00:01:59.939> means<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.630> thing<00:02:00.840> absorbs<00:02:01.409> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
which means that this thing absorbs and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.109 
which means that this thing absorbs and
retains<00:02:01.890> tons<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.700> Wax

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
retains tons of Wax

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.670 
retains tons of Wax
now<00:02:03.420> right<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> factory<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.500> thing

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
now right out of the factory this thing

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.459 
now right out of the factory this thing
has<00:02:04.890> been<00:02:05.040> waxed<00:02:05.399> by<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.820> ball<00:02:06.030> J<00:02:06.299> um<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:06.990> when

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
has been waxed by one ball J um so when

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.749 
has been waxed by one ball J um so when
you<00:02:07.530> kick<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.770> out<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.009> bag<00:02:08.190> throw<00:02:08.610> some

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
you kick it out of the bag throw some

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.820 
you kick it out of the bag throw some
bindings<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.330> go<00:02:09.539> up<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.050> hill<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.410> you

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
bindings on it go up on the hill and you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.050 
bindings on it go up on the hill and you
know<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.129> forget<00:02:11.400> about<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.670> don't<00:02:11.819> worry

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
know kind of forget about it don't worry

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.059 
know kind of forget about it don't worry
worry<00:02:12.239> about<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.599> now<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.560> thing<00:02:13.860> even

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
worry about it now this thing even

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.680 
worry about it now this thing even

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
though it rides great in powder will

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.470 
though it rides great in powder will
also<00:02:16.110> ride<00:02:16.349> great<00:02:16.680> on<00:02:16.860> hardback<00:02:17.489> path<00:02:18.090> because

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
also ride great on hardback path because

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.690 
also ride great on hardback path because
