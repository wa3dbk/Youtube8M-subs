wheel<00:00:08.420> let's<00:00:09.420> just<00:00:09.599> see<00:00:09.750> here<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.230> blue<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:13.190> an

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
wheel let's just see here in blue and an

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.720 
wheel let's just see here in blue and an
axle<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:15.299> part<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.870> see<00:00:16.080> here<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.440> red

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
axle this part that you see here in red

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.130 
axle this part that you see here in red
at<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.940> wheel<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.779> got<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> axle<00:00:21.050> we<00:00:22.050> own

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
at the wheel and we got the axle we own

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.250 
at the wheel and we got the axle we own
axle<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:23.010> be<00:00:23.160> said<00:00:23.490> as<00:00:23.789> though<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.630> wheel<00:00:24.900> is

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
axle can be said as though the wheel is

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.529 
axle can be said as though the wheel is
a<00:00:25.289> lever<00:00:25.740> arm<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.400> that's<00:00:26.789> fixed<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
a lever arm and that's fixed to the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.259 
a lever arm and that's fixed to the
shaft<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.560> shaft<00:00:28.590> being<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.189> axle<00:00:29.609> let<00:00:30.179> me

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
shaft the shaft being the axle let me

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.420 
shaft the shaft being the axle let me
illustrate<00:00:30.420> how<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.529> actually<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.920> lever

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.229 

let<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.579> fulcrum<00:00:35.969> here<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> center<00:00:38.239> then

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
let the fulcrum here in the center then

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.080 
let the fulcrum here in the center then
you<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> lever<00:00:39.960> coming<00:00:40.680> out<00:00:40.969> to<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
you have the lever coming out to the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.770 
you have the lever coming out to the
outside<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.809> wheel<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:44.329> then<00:00:45.329> one<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.750> two

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
outside of the wheel and then one of two

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.940 
outside of the wheel and then one of two
things<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.320> happening<00:00:47.090> either<00:00:48.770> on<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
things is happening either on the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.900 
things is happening either on the
outside<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> shaft<00:00:52.399> is<00:00:53.399> either<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
outside of the shaft is either the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.729 
outside of the shaft is either the
effort<00:00:54.420> force<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:56.090> then<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.530> outside<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
effort force and then the outside of the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.380 
effort force and then the outside of the
wheel<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> resistance<00:01:00.480> force<00:01:01.399> or<00:01:02.399> it's

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
wheel is the resistance force or it's

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.469 
wheel is the resistance force or it's
vice<00:01:03.750> versa<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:05.100> orange<00:01:05.460> part<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
vice versa the orange part can be if the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.420 
vice versa the orange part can be if the
effort<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.200> blue<00:01:07.770> part<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
effort and the blue part can be the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.190 
effort and the blue part can be the
resistance<00:01:09.619> what<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:10.740> call<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.790> call

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
resistance what we call this is we call

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.249 
resistance what we call this is we call
the<00:01:13.200> driver<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.979> what's<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.369> driven<00:01:15.049> in<00:01:16.049> other

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the driver and what's it driven in other

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.899 
the driver and what's it driven in other
words<00:01:17.509> normally<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:20.040> wheel<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
words normally if you have a wheel and

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:21.440 
words normally if you have a wheel and
an<00:01:20.970> axel

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
an axel

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.240 
an axel
when<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.750> say<00:01:22.020> normally<00:01:22.439> what<00:01:22.710> most<00:01:22.950> people

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
when I say normally what most people

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.350 
when I say normally what most people
think<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> tire<00:01:24.830> we<00:01:25.830> all<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.580> on

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
think of like a tire we all like this on

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.530 
think of like a tire we all like this on
this<00:01:27.689> kind<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.310> this<00:01:29.310> would<00:01:29.610> carrying<00:01:30.180> thing

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
this kind of a this would carrying thing

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.310 
this kind of a this would carrying thing
whatever<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:33.150> motor<00:01:35.900> is<00:01:36.900> gonna<00:01:37.170> be

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
whatever that is the motor is gonna be

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.969 
whatever that is the motor is gonna be
attached<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> axle<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> axle<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.979> in

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
attached to the axle so the axle is in

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.120 
attached to the axle so the axle is in
this<00:01:41.909> case<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:43.200> driver<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:46.619> because<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
this case the driver and because the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.789 
this case the driver and because the
axle<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.670> moving<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.509> causes<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.380> wheel<00:01:49.560> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
axle is moving that causes the wheel to

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.520 
axle is moving that causes the wheel to
move<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:51.210> called<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.810> wheel<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.439> at

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
move so we called the wheel here at

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.830 
move so we called the wheel here at
what's<00:01:52.710> driven<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.740> axle<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.520> driving<00:01:57.299> the

what's driven the axle is driving the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.709 
what's driven the axle is driving the
wheel<00:01:58.430> but<00:01:59.430> it's<00:01:59.610> not<00:01:59.729> always<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.119> way<00:02:00.479> let

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
wheel but it's not always that way let

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.789 
that your hands are on is driving the
axle<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:39.329> in<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.540> case<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.200> wheel<00:02:40.440> is

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
axle so in this case the wheel is

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.630 
axle so in this case the wheel is
driving<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.340> axle<00:02:44.840> labeling<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.370> this<00:02:47.370> is

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
driving the axle labeling this this is

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.589 
driving the axle labeling this this is
the<00:02:47.970> driver<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:49.640> then<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.819> axle<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.510> the

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
the driver and then the axle and the

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.629 
the driver and then the axle and the
center<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.400> what's<00:02:53.400> being<00:02:53.639> driven<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:56.370> wheel

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
center is what's being driven the wheel

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.770 
center is what's being driven the wheel
is<00:02:56.970> driving<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.780> axle<00:02:59.510> there's<00:03:00.510> another

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
is driving the axle there's another

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.640 
is driving the axle there's another
example<00:03:01.319> of<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.560> wheel<00:03:01.799> driving<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> axle

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
example of the wheel driving the axle

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.890 
example of the wheel driving the axle
you<00:03:04.650> grab<00:03:04.829> a<00:03:04.889> hold<00:03:05.129> of<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.340> knob<00:03:05.579> and<00:03:05.940> you

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
you grab a hold of this knob and you

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.890 
you grab a hold of this knob and you
turn<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.700> because<00:03:08.700> you're<00:03:08.909> turning<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.599> that

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
turn it because you're turning it that

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.879 
turn it because you're turning it that
forces<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.769> axle<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.489> turn<00:03:12.349> so<00:03:13.349> in<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:13.620> case

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
forces the axle to turn so in this case

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:21.759 
forces the axle to turn so in this case
we<00:03:14.220> have<00:03:14.720> driver<00:03:17.419> and<00:03:18.419> we<00:03:18.540> have<00:03:18.720> what's<00:03:18.959> driven

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.229 

wheel<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:23.129> driving<00:03:23.699> the<00:03:23.849> axle<00:03:26.120> here's<00:03:27.120> the

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
wheel is driving the axle here's the

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.750 
wheel is driving the axle here's the
last<00:03:27.389> example<00:03:28.019> in<00:03:28.709> this<00:03:28.859> case<00:03:29.099> this<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.430> the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
last example in this case this is the

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.439 
last example in this case this is the
axle<00:03:30.419> driving<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.959> wheel<00:03:31.169> once<00:03:31.680> again<00:03:32.449> we

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
axle driving the wheel once again we

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.229 
axle driving the wheel once again we
have<00:03:33.569> this<00:03:33.750> some<00:03:34.319> type<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.709> motor<00:03:34.980> here<00:03:35.400> it's

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
have this some type of a motor here it's

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.550 
have this some type of a motor here it's
attached<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:36.900> axle<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:38.629> then<00:03:39.629> the<00:03:40.019> axle

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
attached to this axle and then the axle

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.960 
attached to this axle and then the axle
here<00:03:40.829> is<00:03:41.819> rotating<00:03:43.099> because<00:03:44.099> it's<00:03:44.310> rotating

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
here is rotating because it's rotating

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.839 
here is rotating because it's rotating
it's<00:03:45.569> going<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.900> cause<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.319> wheel<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.650> rotate

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
it's going to cause the wheel to rotate

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.530 
it's going to cause the wheel to rotate
so<00:03:47.849> here<00:03:48.299> we<00:03:48.510> have<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.989> axle<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.829> driver

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
so here we have the axle is the driver

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.879 
so here we have the axle is the driver
and<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:52.500> wheel<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:53.010> what's<00:03:53.280> being<00:03:53.519> driven
