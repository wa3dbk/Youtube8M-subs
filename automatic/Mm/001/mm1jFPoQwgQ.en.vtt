our fusion evolution system in these

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.380 
our fusion evolution system in these
games<00:01:41.930> you<00:01:42.320> collect<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:42.770> lot<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.040> loot<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.520> you

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
games you collect a lot of loot and you

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.630 
games you collect a lot of loot and you
outgrow<00:01:44.870> this<00:01:45.080> loop<00:01:45.320> pretty<00:01:45.560> quickly<00:01:45.830> with

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
outgrow this loop pretty quickly with

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.969 
outgrow this loop pretty quickly with
our<00:01:46.910> system<00:01:47.420> now<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.780> use<00:01:48.290> that<00:01:48.320> loot<00:01:48.770> to

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
our system now you use that loot to

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.120 
our system now you use that loot to
upgrade<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.729> gear<00:01:49.970> that<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.180> do<00:01:50.600> use<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.890> it

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
upgrade the gear that you do use so it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.800 
upgrade the gear that you do use so it
levels<00:01:52.490> up<00:01:52.610> with<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:53.420> if<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:53.660> have<00:01:53.780> a

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
levels up with you so if you have a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.570 
levels up with you so if you have a
really<00:01:54.290> good<00:01:54.560> step<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.100> want<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.400> keep

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
really good step that you want to keep

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.190 
really good step that you want to keep
but<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:55.880> get<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.060> really<00:01:56.420> crappy<00:01:56.780> store<00:01:57.110> you

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
but you get a really crappy store you

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.400 
but you get a really crappy store you
can<00:01:57.350> actually<00:01:57.530> mix<00:01:58.400> it<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:58.790> a<00:01:59.060> new<00:01:59.420> one<00:01:59.630> use<00:02:00.200> it

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
can actually mix it in a new one use it

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.320 
can actually mix it in a new one use it
eventually<00:02:01.130> players<00:02:01.520> can<00:02:01.820> evolve<00:02:02.060> their

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
eventually players can evolve their

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.270 
eventually players can evolve their
favorite<00:02:02.660> items<00:02:02.930> into<00:02:03.140> epic<00:02:03.560> new<00:02:03.800> versions

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
favorite items into epic new versions

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.480 
favorite items into epic new versions
