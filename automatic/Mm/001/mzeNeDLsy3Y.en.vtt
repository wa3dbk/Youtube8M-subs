00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.400
 Welcome back, lainey site. 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.760
 Today I have a very funny thing. 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.029
 of minecraft 1.8 how are you doing? 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.150
 added the arroba there is the arroba 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.040
 in you it is now possible to teleport 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.890
 one entity to another is a 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.100
 entity ne and several other things 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.220
 fun and it is possible to do 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.500
 a grenade in a nursery or a 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.630
 snowball explosive 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.900
 I have a very simple snowball 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.750
 and when the game she explodes in the 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.940
 place where it falls well 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.010
 Today I'm going to teach you to do this. 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.460
 explosive snowball that's really cool 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.430
 including the average cost is a ball 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.720
 explosive snow they can fall and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.479
 even up in the air right? 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.000
 It explodes, and you 're not listening to the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.580
 from the explosion due to my 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.520
 recorder it does not record the sound 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.249
 the microphone and the computer at the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.640
 Time, but it's okay, you can see it's a 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:26.520
 snowball explosive very very very 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.640
 useful and also very functional, right? 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.310
 and she does not have a bug does not have an error 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.530
 because it's how the block is block 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.799
 command and she uses the test out and tp only 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.899
 to steal and that is the arrogant that I 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.729
 I already explained in another video if you do not 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.259
 saw this video is my channel and it's there 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.469
 videos list 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.880
 the arroba tutorial then it is enough 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:58.859
 and go to the tutorial 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.490
 well first I'll select one 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:04.530
 slot that will be a b11 slot is that this 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.649
 slot has no system yet 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.590
 now organized in systems right lots 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.650
 and here we have a space here to 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.990
 build is our system right here I 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.180
 I'm going to put a comparator and I'm going 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.670
 build a clock clock is a system 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.580
 that turns on and off the redstone 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.170
 very quickly and I always use the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.959
 clock to do 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.220
 is to use a command block that uses the 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.500
 Test command is well here let's put 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.390
 a control block will remain this way 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.250
 remember this way and within that 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.090
 command console, let's leave the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.239
 technical command and for at least 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.480
 It means the right clothes before it was 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.840
 added in version 1.8 that now 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:59.250
 we can test an entity, ie the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.850
 mob or other entity such as 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.250
 Manicardi a boat, right? 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.709
 but if I put test was to steal it 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.970
 will test all the entities of the game 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.200
 he will have his computer turned on 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.840
 all the time 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:19.380
 so let's open the key here typing 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:21.180
 tip equal snowball and we closed the key 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.910
 What will he do now? 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.510
 test when the entity snowball 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.170
 is on the map it will detect in the 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.180
 hour 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:36.900
 ok and now we put a comparator of 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.180
 redstone here and when it detects 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.579
 our entity snowball it goes 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.030
 call this buyer by calling another 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.579
 The system that I'm going to do now 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.730
 here is we will put a block of 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:55.500
 command and in this block the commands are 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:04:01.579
 put the southern command solomon remedy 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:05.790
 tnt that will invoke a tnt bound ne 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:09.690
 in this yes coordinate is 100 blocks above 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.630
 not 100 is too much and we will put here 70 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.049
 blocks and if like the block that is 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.049
 There in the sky, you will not see 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:23.070
 until interconnected here we will open this 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:26.280
 key here edit fuse two points 10 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.500
 why get away two points ten rifles 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.830
 means the activation time it goes 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.740
 take a while to activate because this 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.310
 is the leave promise to have normal 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.760
 It will explode sooner. 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.410
 He was able to teleport to Tnt even 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.190
 that my snowball that's what I 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.120
 I'll do 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.150
 well then one year he detects the ball 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.960
 snow it will invoke a tnt there in the 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.310
 sky where no one can see but there 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.250
 will explode in the sky will not happen 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.070
 nothing then we have to put a 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.870
 repeater another control block here 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:07.260
 in this consortium of command 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:11.980
 Let's put the command tp at 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:14.710
 chip that will be the type of entity going 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.170
 be our tnt that will be there in the sky 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.020
 huh 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.840
 and we will import our tnt to ball 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.970
 of snow then the kind it will have and 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.780
 the entity has interpro 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:33.130
 amount of snowball that is Spanish 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:36.270
 good now key then what happens in 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:39.160
 Our system is very simple to understand. 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.770
 when I play snowball 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.520
 the for test will detect that it is is 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.710
 on the map will connect this buyer goes 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.650
 here that you have 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.540
 the command to invoke a tnt 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.910
 it will invoke a has that in the sky 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.550
 where I can not see right where nobody 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.240
 will see and will automatically have 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.180
 teleport tnt to our snowball and 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.920
 so the snowball will explode in the 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.150
 hour has a snowball effect 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.920
 explosive 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.400
 I'm going to get our snowball here. 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.340
 beauty 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.160
 now I'm going to throw her on the ground and like 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.400
 you can see it explodes and a system 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.460
 It's already working here you can see 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.010
 A very cool system, right? 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:31.600
 is even cost meters as there were already 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:34.360
 said in and then is this tutorial I 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.130
 I hope you understood there if 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.820
 You liked that I did not like it. 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.580
 to help 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.170
 add this video to favorites and 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.340
 then that's it 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.340
 Thank you for watching.
