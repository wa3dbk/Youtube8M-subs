00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.530
 hello let's make a very cool drawing 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.810
 I 'm going to teach you how to give a 3d effect of 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.970
 volume let's start making a 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.840
 spiral as you see on a cardboard or 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.840
 white paper 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.039
 and then we will go making some arcs 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.080
 as you see in this direction, everything is a 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.900
 same address to start giving 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.849
 volume to our spiral house of 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.849
 snail or snake whatever you want 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.450
 we do it throughout our entire 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.329
 spiral looks like a rope 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.579
 rolled for chosen two colors the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.079
 blue and green I recommend that you 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.809
 do with two colors but you can 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.610
 use the ones you want then we go 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.339
 to go placing coloring in a way 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.370
 alternating one yes and one no and what we're going 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.800
 to do is color stronger in the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.940
 part of the sides as you see in the part 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.880
 touching the spiral 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.860
 and more clearly in the central part 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.860
 let's do it like this with everyone 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:12.710
 squeeze paint is strong in the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.049
 sides and weak in the central part 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.940
 this will help us among other things then 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.310
 we will see more techniques to give volume 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.560
 You see, I'm in a tight spot on this side, 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.380
 doing now with the other color and 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.080
 weak on the inside part you can 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.450
 use crayons or paints 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.250
 these wooden markers also but 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.980
 it will be more difficult to give volume because 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.660
 you can tighten less with a marker 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.310
 in black and white if you do it with a 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.400
 pen can also work very well 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.400
 all right 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.330
 and try to find two colors that 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.159
 contrast each other to create this 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.189
 optical effect the green and orange 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.130
 they could also work very well 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.259
 yellow and purple red and blue colors 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.450
 complementary or as I have done blue 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.460
 and green are going pretty well, well, 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.930
 I have colored with the two colors and 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.270
 now let's use a pencil or 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.640
 graphite like I'm using now and 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.710
 let's mark the lines of the spiral 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.649
 let's shade the beige as I'm 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.900
 watching a little bit without squeezing too much 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.689
 let's make it one more centimeter or 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.530
 less in the middle of the line leaving us 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.530
 towards both sides 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.219
 along the entire spiral 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.720
 we are shadowing and we are going to mark 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.470
 all the center line we're going to press a 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.800
 little bit more in the center you see how I do 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.800
 I now 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.580
 We see all our drawing you see that it's already 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.780
 taking on the aspect of good as relief a 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.910
 3d 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.459
 that what it does is sink that area of 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.319
 the joints of the spiral and draw towards 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.020
 outside to create that volume 3 of the 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.970
 rest of the spiral 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.010
 what are we going to do now to increase 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.020
 even more this feeling do more 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.480
 clarita the central part using a 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.430
 beige eraser with eraser 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.770
 I erase a little bit not too many 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.510
 order me the color but quito 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.930
 intensity of color just in the part 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.930
 central 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.409
 here it simulates that it reflects light and you will see 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.909
 more volume in this part we have already 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.129
 removed volume in the part of the 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.890
 spiral of the spiral joint with the 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.080
 pencil and we are adding light in the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.920
 central part 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.840
 you see 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.390
 so we have left and we have created an effect 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.980
 three-dimensional here you see it easier 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.500
 I also put the drawing on the web 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.900
 with the link below that we can do 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.760
 also following this because for example 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.200
 our worms their snakes but in 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.090
 we will do it in a spiral 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.830
 It is important that when you do the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.450
 Stripes do it in a curved way because 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.480
 this is what really helps to have 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.459
 3d volume 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.769
 I will do it with different colors not 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.569
 it has to be black and here I am going 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.670
 to do differently so that what 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.720
 you see better I'm first shading with 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.420
 the pencil part of the meetings and 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.810
 now with the paintings alternately 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.180
 I'm going to use colors by squeezing more 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.700
 in the corners and more clearly in the 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.860
 central part and you see I used blue 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.680
 light and dark blue the other the fact 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.930
 with orange and yellow I'm going to do this 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.810
 not to whole orange sorry green and 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.870
 yellow and with red and pink and with 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.250
 an eraser paste the central part 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.840
 now what I do to place in 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.240
 our wall that we have dedicated to 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.880
 our works I'm going to put it on 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.410
 black cardboard so they have a 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.120
 species of marquito and also the black 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.050
 will help to highlight colors more 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.050
 bright we have put 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.159
 well, I almost have dividends 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.349
 that now you are going to see how it is being 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.090
 our wall in fact I'll put you 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.520
 the links to each of the videos here 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.650
 so that you choose the picture of you will know 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.659
 melted the 3d paintings that you already have 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.729
 seen that we have put the pictures 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:59.889
 abstract made with milk with enamel 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.710
 of nails psychedelic pictures 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:06.750
 esgraphed with waxes at the moment these 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.750
 but we're going to get it bye bye
