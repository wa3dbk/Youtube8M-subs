00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.950
 Hello everyone, this time we'll talk 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.800
 about the study of biography in the 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.470
 basic education 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.869
 Throughout the course it is sought that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.869
 students relate the components of the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.560
 geographic space to recognize and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.770
 face the contemporary world 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.419
 one of the purposes of geography 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.910
 is that the students have more 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:36.449
 awareness of space and value in the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.870
 diversity in the next video it 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.940
 will briefly explain the importance 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.940
 for the future teacher to know the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.000
 purposes of the study of geography 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.850
 the didactic approach the competences 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.399
 that develop the role of the student and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.079
 the teacher as well as the different 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.329
 work modalities that we can 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.990
 use with 200 resources 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.370
 didactic 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.370
 to promote their learning 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.850
 the purposes of studying the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.800
 geography for basic education 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.100
 they are mainly explaining relationships 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.080
 between social natural components 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.390
 economic and political cultural 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.340
 geographic space to know a 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.530
 integral vision of the space in 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.500
 local state national scales 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.140
 continental and global as well as mobilize 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.270
 concepts, skills and attitudes of 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.740
 situations of daily life for 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.320
 take over as part of the space 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.040
 geographical value natural diversity 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.970
 social, cultural and economic 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.970
 national identity 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.859
 in primary education the purposes 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.320
 they are based on acquiring concepts 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.060
 skills and attitudes to build 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.710
 national identity through the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.250
 recognition of natural diversity 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.409
 social cultural and economic space 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.270

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.310
 informed in the place where you live for 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.030
 the care of the environment and prevention 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.030
 of disasters 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.209
 didactic approach the subject of 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.209
 geography addresses the study of space 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.040
 geographical from a perspective 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.950
 formative from the development 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.010
 comprehensive concepts skills and 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.900
 attitudes the geographic space is 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.750
 conceives as the space socially 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.580
 perceived built lived and 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.650
 continuously transformed by the 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.770
 relationships and interactions of their 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.630
 components over time to 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.720
 from the basic knowledge of 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.120
 the geography the students will build a 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.190
 overview of space by 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.550
 recognition of relationships between 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.540

 contemporaries of society 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.810
 geographic competences to contribute 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.970
 to the achievement of competences for 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.880
 life and the features of the discharge profile 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.170
 the subject of geography presents 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.790
 five skills that you have to 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.150
 develop throughout education 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.710
 basic geographic skills are 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.620
 a means for the formation of 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.200
 pupils since they are oriented towards 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.640
 act based on their experiences of 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.740
 conscious reasoned reasoned form 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.540
 autonomous and creative in situations that 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.450
 they are presented inside and outside the 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.680
 school allowing them to unwind 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.250
 better way in the space where they live 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.620
 the role of the student 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.470
 from the formative perspective of the 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.990
 subject the student is considered a 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.150
 active subject that recognizes so 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.970
 gradual processes that enable their 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.090
 learning and development in relation to 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.070
 the natural and social environment surrounding 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.920
 gradually becomes aware and 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.410
 control of their learning so that 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.060
 plans regulates and evaluates its 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.000
 participation in said process 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.919
 as a builder of your knowledge the 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.680
 student develops his creativity and 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.810
 imagination as well as your ability to 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.840
 solve problems work 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.440
 collaboratively reinforce their self-esteem 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.810
 and increase your autonomy 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.880
 it is necessary for students to establish 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.600
 relationships between what they live in their 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.580
 space and what was learned in the subject 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.110
 by carrying out activities 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.630
 varied that favor the development 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.660
 comprehensive concepts skills and 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.610
 geographical attitudes that lead 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.390
 to make informed decisions and 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.390
 responsible 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.110
 the role of the teacher is required that the 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.630
 teacher facilite and learning 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.440
 considering previous knowledge 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.360
 interests expectations motivations 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.730
 experiences and context of the students 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.620
 the selection and implementation of 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.680
 strategies and teaching resources 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.590
 diverse relevant and effective for 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.870
 favor the achievement of learning and 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.930
 permanent planning and evaluation 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.240
 in the progress of the students 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.520
 the formative sense of the subject 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.100
 implies that their teaching be eliminated 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.919
 practices based on the memorization of 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.840
 data are not significant and 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.260
 priority to analysis in relationships 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.410
 of the geographic components 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:02.080
 in this sense the teacher does not assume the 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.600
 role of repeater of knowledge but that of 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.600
 promoter of the design and implementation of 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.160
 significant teaching strategies 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.680
 which vary according to the level and grade 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.650
 school and the particularities of each 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.260
 group which implies respect for the 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.620
 individuality and the different styles 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.170
 and rhythms of student learning 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.150
 with his intervention the teacher motivates and 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.160
 the students to reflect on the 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.750
 learning strategies and the 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.560
 geographic knowledge that are 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.129
 building 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.009
 work modalities 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.929
 the geography classes constitute a 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.969
 space for the teacher to propose 

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:43.389
 the students job opportunities 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:46.539
 diversified from sequences 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:49.269
 didactic and projects these two 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:51.699
 modalities seek to contribute to the achievement 

00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:56.009
 of the expected learning 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.009
 then they will be mentioned briefly 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.010
 and teaching resources 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.380
 the incorporation of various resources 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.420
 didactic promotes the achievement of 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.870
 learning and the development of 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.280
 competences so it's important 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.710
 involve the students in the election 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.830
 and the use of the most appropriate of 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.060
 according to the expected learning 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.680
 the didactic resources that 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.740
 recommend for work with the 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.820
 subject are several among them 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.820
 find the following
