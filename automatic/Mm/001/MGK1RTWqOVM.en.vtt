00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.980 
could close it up right now and nobody
would<00:01:49.159> ever<00:01:49.189> be<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.549> wiser

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
would ever be the wiser

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.899 
would ever be the wiser
it<00:01:51.229> wasn't<00:01:51.530> painful<00:01:51.619> is<00:01:51.979> very<00:01:52.159> inexpensive<00:01:52.580> I

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
it wasn't painful is very inexpensive I

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.300 
it wasn't painful is very inexpensive I
think<00:01:53.119> it<00:01:53.240> was<00:01:53.330> like<00:01:53.450> $35<00:01:54.440> took<00:01:54.830> about<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.070> month

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
think it was like $35 took about a month

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.789 
think it was like $35 took about a month
to<00:01:55.460> heal<00:01:55.790> before<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:56.270> could<00:01:56.420> change<00:01:56.659> it<00:01:56.900> I'm

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
to heal before I could change it I'm

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.530 
to heal before I could change it I'm
actually<00:01:57.979> considering<00:01:58.549> stretching<00:01:59.270> now

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
actually considering stretching now

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.749 
actually considering stretching now

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
lower the number is the bigger the gauge

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.199 
lower the number is the bigger the gauge
of<00:02:05.299> your<00:02:05.509> piercing<00:02:06.049> of<00:02:06.170> your<00:02:06.440> jewelry<00:02:07.209> so

through<00:02:09.770> spell<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.789> basically<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.420> would

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
through spell and basically I would

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.720 
through spell and basically I would
stretch<00:02:11.930> my<00:02:12.230> my<00:02:12.830> piercing<00:02:13.310> through<00:02:13.550> using

stretch my my piercing through using
pinchers<00:02:14.300> which<00:02:14.900> are<00:02:15.050> basically<00:02:15.470> like

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
pinchers which are basically like

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.229 
pinchers which are basically like
horseshoes<00:02:16.100> but<00:02:16.550> they're<00:02:16.940> shaped<00:02:17.180> like

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
horseshoes but they're shaped like

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.300

captive it's seamless basically it comes

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.110 
captive it's seamless basically it comes
as<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.959> loop<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.709> it<00:03:24.769> has<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:24.950> little<00:03:25.190> piece<00:03:26.090> you

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
as a loop and it has a little piece you

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.060 
as a loop and it has a little piece you
pull<00:03:26.510> out<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:27.079> hook<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.650> stick<00:03:28.040> it

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
pull out you hook it and you stick it

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.800 
pull out you hook it and you stick it
back<00:03:28.280> in<00:03:28.549> and<00:03:28.730> it's<00:03:28.820> really<00:03:29.000> hard<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.480> do<00:03:29.630> when

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
back in and it's really hard to do when

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.650 
back in and it's really hard to do when
