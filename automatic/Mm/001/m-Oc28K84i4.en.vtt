00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.099 
alpha trooper review or the Recon review
the<00:03:05.380> bad<00:03:05.590> things<00:03:05.980> now<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:07.000> cons<00:03:07.510> about<00:03:07.780> this

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
the bad things now the cons about this

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.199 
the bad things now the cons about this
is<00:03:08.349> that<00:03:08.379> you<00:03:09.069> have<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.280> stick<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.760> dart<00:03:10.000> all

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
is that you have to stick the dart all

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.849 
is that you have to stick the dart all
the<00:03:10.720> way<00:03:10.810> in<00:03:11.019> which<00:03:11.410> is<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.769> pain<00:03:12.510> sometimes

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
the way in which is a pain sometimes

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.490 
the way in which is a pain sometimes
because<00:03:14.859> so<00:03:15.790> if<00:03:16.269> you<00:03:16.720> push<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:17.139> all<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.410> way

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
because so if you push it it all the way

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.259 
because so if you push it it all the way
and<00:03:17.859> then<00:03:18.009> for<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.310> next<00:03:18.459> star<00:03:18.699> you<00:03:18.820> push<00:03:19.120> it

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
and then for the next star you push it

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.490 
and then for the next star you push it
in<00:03:19.359> all<00:03:19.509> the<00:03:19.570> way<00:03:19.690> but<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:19.989> don't<00:03:20.049> push<00:03:20.289> it<00:03:20.320> in

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
in all the way but you don't push it in

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.260 
in all the way but you don't push it in
all<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.739> way

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
all the way

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.630 
all the way
like<00:03:22.270> less<00:03:22.690> like<00:03:23.349> the<00:03:23.379> last<00:03:23.650> night<00:03:23.860> you<00:03:23.950> did<00:03:24.160> it

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
like less like the last night you did it

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.850 
like less like the last night you did it
will<00:03:25.180> get<00:03:25.660> stuck<00:03:28.260> other<00:03:29.260> bad<00:03:29.500> things<00:03:29.530> about

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
will get stuck other bad things about

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.660 
will get stuck other bad things about
this<00:03:30.629> it<00:03:31.629> requires<00:03:31.989> batteries<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:33.459> course

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
this it requires batteries of course

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.660 
this it requires batteries of course
three<00:03:33.970> double<00:03:34.300> A<00:03:34.390> batteries<00:03:35.459> which<00:03:36.459> i<00:03:36.610> think

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
three double A batteries which i think

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.449 
three double A batteries which i think
is<00:03:38.519> it's<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.640> lot<00:03:39.790> of<00:03:39.880> batteries<00:03:40.330> but<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:42.310> good

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
is it's a lot of batteries but the good

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.190 
is it's a lot of batteries but the good
side<00:03:42.640> is<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.360> not<00:03:43.510> like<00:03:43.720> D<00:03:43.989> batteries

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
side is that it's not like D batteries

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.400 
side is that it's not like D batteries
or<00:03:44.620> C<00:03:44.920> batteries<00:03:45.160> those<00:03:45.580> would<00:03:45.880> be<00:03:46.000> painful

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
or C batteries those would be painful

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.800 
or C batteries those would be painful
because<00:03:47.410> those<00:03:48.010> are<00:03:48.280> like<00:03:48.430> ten<00:03:48.910> dollars<00:03:49.480> for

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
because those are like ten dollars for

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.830 
because those are like ten dollars for
six<00:03:50.760> or<00:03:51.760> like<00:03:51.970> 544<00:03:54.360> okay<00:03:55.360> what<00:03:55.569> else<00:03:56.610> jams

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
six or like 544 okay what else jams

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:11.240 
six or like 544 okay what else jams
somewhat<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:58.989> lot<00:04:02.640> what<00:04:03.640> else<00:04:07.920> yeah<00:04:08.920> that's

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:24.520
