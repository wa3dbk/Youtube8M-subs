other side we sink and as you can see

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.599 
other side we sink and as you can see
the<00:01:26.979> picture<00:01:27.340> frame<00:01:27.670> was<00:01:28.149> actually<00:01:29.609> the

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609 
the picture frame was actually the

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.389 
the picture frame was actually the
picture<00:01:30.909> frame<00:01:31.119> was<00:01:31.270> actually<00:01:31.780> four<00:01:32.499> inches

picture frame was actually four inches
by<00:01:33.789> 6<00:01:34.390> inches<00:01:34.509> so<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:36.280> why<00:01:36.460> we<00:01:36.490> have<00:01:36.759> the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
by 6 inches so that's why we have the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.010 
by 6 inches so that's why we have the
ruler<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:37.539> we<00:01:37.689> can<00:01:37.869> cut<00:01:39.359> so<00:01:40.359> we<00:01:40.509> can<00:01:40.659> cut<00:01:40.869> the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
ruler so we can cut so we can cut the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.709 
ruler so we can cut so we can cut the
proper<00:01:41.409> amount<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:45.310> I'm<00:01:45.670> going<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.179> actually<00:01:46.359> I

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719
