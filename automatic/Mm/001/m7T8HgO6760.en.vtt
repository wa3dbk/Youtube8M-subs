00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
essentially what the whole entire game

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.639 
essentially what the whole entire game
is<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:56.090> mean<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.210> they<00:01:57.810> obviously<00:01:57.929> put<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.440> lot<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
is I mean I they obviously put a lot of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.190 
is I mean I they obviously put a lot of
thought<00:01:58.890> into<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.899> they<00:02:00.899> should<00:02:01.080> have<00:02:01.110> called

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
thought into it they should have called

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.740 
thought into it they should have called
this<00:02:01.470> game<00:02:02.270> pitfall<00:02:03.270> should<00:02:03.539> have<00:02:03.630> been

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
this game pitfall should have been

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.350 
this game pitfall should have been
fitted<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.380> was<00:02:05.250> stupid<00:02:05.520> now<00:02:05.789> you<00:02:05.850> should<00:02:06.330> have

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
fitted I was stupid now you should have

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.080 
fitted I was stupid now you should have
this<00:02:06.990> should<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.289> been<00:02:07.319> like<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:08.060> sequel<00:02:09.060> to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
this should have been like a sequel to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.120 
this should have been like a sequel to
pitfall<00:02:09.600> cuz<00:02:09.780> that's<00:02:09.929> all<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.829> you<00:02:10.950> go

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
pitfall cuz that's all you do is you go

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.380 
pitfall cuz that's all you do is you go
around<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.519> you<00:02:11.850> have<00:02:11.970> fallen<00:02:12.360> pits<00:02:14.390> well

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
around and you have fallen pits well

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.360 
around and you have fallen pits well
other<00:02:15.930> than<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.260> yeah<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.590> gotta<00:02:16.890> escape

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
other than that yeah you gotta escape

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.850 
other than that yeah you gotta escape
this<00:02:17.700> doctor<00:02:18.299> I'm<00:02:18.870> guessing<00:02:19.260> if<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.440> doctor

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
this doctor I'm guessing if the doctor

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.500 
this doctor I'm guessing if the doctor
from<00:02:20.010> all<00:02:20.220> my<00:02:20.370> research<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.970> since<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.390> he's

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
from all my research it since that he's

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.780 
from all my research it since that he's
a<00:02:21.540> doctor<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.799> can<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.310> course<00:02:23.519> walk

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
a doctor you can just of course walk

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.009 
a doctor you can just of course walk
over<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.239> pits<00:02:24.510> that's<00:02:24.750> fair<00:02:26.150> yeah<00:02:27.150> phones

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
over the pits that's fair yeah phones

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.080 
over the pits that's fair yeah phones
more<00:02:28.320> holes<00:02:28.530> collect<00:02:29.400> dots<00:02:29.670> which<00:02:29.970> are

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
more holes collect dots which are
