00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
defense that thing had but oh well I'm a

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.280 
defense that thing had but oh well I'm a
little<00:02:13.040> disappointed<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:13.959> so<00:02:14.959> hopefully

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
little disappointed in that so hopefully

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.899 
little disappointed in that so hopefully
it'll<00:02:15.560> have<00:02:15.739> some<00:02:15.890> more<00:02:16.069> success<00:02:16.400> later<00:02:16.640> I

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
it'll have some more success later I

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.089 
it'll have some more success later I
bring<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:17.930> guy<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.620> for<00:02:18.980> whatever

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
bring this guy in and for whatever

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.830 
bring this guy in and for whatever
reason<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.610> expected<00:02:20.000> him<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.180> switch<00:02:20.450> but<00:02:20.810> I

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
reason I expected him to switch but I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.479 
reason I expected him to switch but I
guess<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.080> don't<00:02:21.349> really<00:02:21.530> switch<00:02:22.010> out<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.220> wall

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
guess you don't really switch out a wall

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.330 
guess you don't really switch out a wall
when<00:02:22.730> it's<00:02:22.880> in

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
when it's in

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.309 
when it's in
condition<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.690> probably<00:02:25.019> wasn't<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
condition so that probably wasn't the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.220 
condition so that probably wasn't the
smartest<00:02:25.379> move<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:27.209> didn't<00:02:27.900> know<00:02:27.959> if<00:02:28.110> he

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
smartest move and I didn't know if he

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.710 
smartest move and I didn't know if he
wanted<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.530> use<00:02:28.769> charge<00:02:29.430> beam<00:02:29.670> or<00:02:29.910> ice<00:02:30.060> beam<00:02:30.360> or

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
wanted to use charge beam or ice beam or

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.869 
wanted to use charge beam or ice beam or
whatever<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.769> went<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.099> this<00:02:32.220> guy<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.430> resist

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
case i plot up and I knew I could have

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.530 
case i plot up and I knew I could have
lived<00:04:52.230> at<00:04:52.380> least<00:04:52.530> one<00:04:52.710> hit<00:04:52.830> anyway<00:04:53.160> so<00:04:53.540> now

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
lived at least one hit anyway so now

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.110 
lived at least one hit anyway so now
what<00:04:54.750> he<00:04:54.900> happens<00:04:55.380> here<00:04:55.740> if<00:04:56.040> he<00:04:56.640> destiny

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
what he happens here if he destiny

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.510 
what he happens here if he destiny
bonded<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.660> I<00:04:57.750> attacked<00:04:58.140> I<00:04:58.500> would<00:04:58.980> die<00:04:59.160> and<00:04:59.220> so

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
bonded and I attacked I would die and so

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.880 
bonded and I attacked I would die and so
would<00:04:59.640> he<00:04:59.880> but<00:05:00.450> if<00:05:00.540> I<00:05:00.690> plotted<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.410> he<00:05:01.500> didn't

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
would he but if I plotted and he didn't

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.130 
would he but if I plotted and he didn't
bond<00:05:02.100> since<00:05:02.820> I<00:05:02.970> realized<00:05:03.330> now<00:05:03.450> he<00:05:03.510> was<00:05:03.720> faster

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
bond since I realized now he was faster

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.470 
bond since I realized now he was faster

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
the worst that would have happened would

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.450 
the worst that would have happened would
have<00:05:14.970> been<00:05:15.120> that<00:05:15.630> we<00:05:15.780> trade<00:05:16.050> anyway<00:05:16.920> I<00:05:17.100> avoid

go see I haven't played in ages I don't

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.760 
go see I haven't played in ages I don't
know<00:06:32.880> anything<00:06:33.090> anymore<00:06:33.390> so<00:06:34.380> that<00:06:34.500> he<00:06:34.620> would

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
know anything anymore so that he would

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.880 
know anything anymore so that he would
die<00:06:34.950> and<00:06:35.280> I<00:06:36.000> guess<00:06:36.750> I<00:06:36.870> get<00:06:37.050> another<00:06:37.260> intimidate

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
die and I guess I get another intimidate

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.770 
die and I guess I get another intimidate
but<00:06:38.220> looking<00:06:39.000> back<00:06:39.030> a<00:06:39.180> second<00:06:39.630> time<00:06:39.660> I

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
but looking back a second time I

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.540 
but looking back a second time I
probably<00:06:40.140> shouldn't<00:06:40.680> have<00:06:40.710> since<00:06:41.250> he<00:06:41.340> had<00:06:41.460> the

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
probably shouldn't have since he had the

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.710 
probably shouldn't have since he had the
first<00:06:41.730> intimidate<00:06:42.240> I<00:06:42.300> probably<00:06:42.480> should<00:06:42.690> have

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
first intimidate I probably should have

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.870 
first intimidate I probably should have
tried<00:06:42.900> to<00:06:43.050> take<00:06:43.200> the<00:06:43.350> focus<00:06:43.500> punch<00:06:43.860> and<00:06:44.160> then
