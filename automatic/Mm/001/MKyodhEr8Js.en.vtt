00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.549
 Dr. massimiliano I have rossin 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.860
 I deal with dental aesthetics 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.170
 over the years I have refined my procedures 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.840
 clinics also through the use of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.640
 new technologies if used 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.949
 correctly allow to obtain 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.949
 extraordinary aesthetic results 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.460
 the patient had introduced himself to the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.759
 our observation with abrasions 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.610
 and institutions both on the upper arch and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.320
 abrasions due to lower arches 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.510
 probably to brushing 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.059
 energetic but partly also 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.579
 intake of acidic foods and sugars 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.620
 super refined 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.629
 the patient complained of his teeth 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.870
 yellow and argued that while engaging 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.389
 in daily home cleaning the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.239
 indeed his situation did not improve 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:59.519
 seemed to get worse 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.409
 analyzing the case it became clear that 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.530
 our patient had over time 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:07.350
 consumed all the dental enamel up to 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.610
 bring out the underlying dentin that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.689
 it has a coloring 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.750
 the solution was yellowish 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.909
 that of restoring lost enamel 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.680
 through four ceramic veneers 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.020
 on the four upper incisors the various ones 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.850
 stages of treatment have planned for 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.299
 first a gene session 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.229
 professional or take surveys 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.130
 periodontals and indoor radiographs wings in 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.100
 so as to exclude any injury or 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.710
 gum inflammation subsequently 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.409
 the preliminary interview was held with 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.020
 the patient to listen to his 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.329
 demands and expectations 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.299
 this allowed us to fill out one 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.920
 aesthetic folder that collects all the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.270
 information from and to the patient 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.700
 in this case the patient had 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.619
 in fact expressed the desire to 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.190
 restore shape and color 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.830
 original of his teeth in the same 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.069
 the photographs were taken 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.730
 of the face of his profile of the mouth of the 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.790
 smile 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.100
 the plans occluded there and were executed 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.090
 finally, phonetic proofs 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.980
 patient impressions were taken 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.380
 on these footprints have been developed 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.040
 of the plaster models on which the technicians 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.140
 they built a diagnostic wax-up 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.380
 fruit of the previous information 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:43.450
 that is, collected a simulation of what I was 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.390
 should have been the teeth of 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.010
 patient at the end of rehabilitation 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.700
 aesthetic at this point it is done 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.300
 previewing the practical result 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.520
 of the case study or pass 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.100
 from waxing on the models to 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.050
 direct reconstruction on abraded teeth i 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.100
 two central incisors and two lateral incisors 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.750
 tops with composite material 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.420
 this first intervention allowed us 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.820
 to redesign the morphology and the 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.150
 dental proportions allowing the 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.150
 patient after a single session to be able to 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.900
 view the future the result 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.300
 aesthetic the patient in the days 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.930
 later could get used to 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.310
 to the aesthetics of his new smile 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.140
 relating immediately with the family 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.050
 and with his acquaintances 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.510
 this phase of aesthetic verification gives us 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.730
 the ability to change to 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.470
 bonded composites all that the 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.110
 patient does not like shape length 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.360
 color and proportions we gave in 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.060
 substance the possibility to the patient of 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.710
 to experience a trial period with that 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.190
 that would have been his smile 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.190
 found 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.300
 the last part concerns the 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.240
 finalization with ceramic veneers 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.850
 It was taken an imprint of 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.910
 current situation of the patient ie with 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.760
 the bonded composite that is the model 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.070
 of inspiration to laboratory technicians 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.070
 for shape and dental proportions that 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.830
 the patient likes them on this new one 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:25.000
 model were built of 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.740
 provisionals and resin subsequently i 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.590
 the patient's teeth were 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.310
 carefully prepared in a little way 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.860
 invasive remaining in the tooth enamel 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.600
 a precision impression was taken 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.940
 for the construction of the facets in 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.870
 definitive ceramics and have been 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.000
 cemented temporary resin once 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.610
 pack the definitive facets in 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.250
 of lithium silicate is verified with the 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.190
 evidence of the case that everything was welcome 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.250
 the patient was glued 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.830
 the veneers to the teeth through the system 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.290
 adhesive the final result has 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.330
 met patient satisfaction 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.640
 which solved his problem 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.890
 aesthetic 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.630
 concluding that it is good to remember that each 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.580
 smile is unique 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.990
 every aesthetic solution must be sought 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.830
 through a careful visit 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.830
 specialist
