00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
but a couple of weeks before I needed a

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.229 
but a couple of weeks before I needed a
break<00:02:06.719> us<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:07.110> through<00:02:07.140> some<00:02:07.710> personal<00:02:07.860> issues

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
break us go through some personal issues

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.699 
break us go through some personal issues
now<00:02:09.239> I'm<00:02:09.539> kind<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.810> getting<00:02:09.899> over<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.410> whole

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
now I'm kind of getting over that whole

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.320 
now I'm kind of getting over that whole
hump<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.220> whatnot<00:02:11.580> I'm<00:02:11.730> feeling<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.120> little

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
hump and whatnot I'm feeling a little

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.280 
hump and whatnot I'm feeling a little
bit<00:02:12.420> better<00:02:12.569> but

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
bit better but

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.589 
bit better but
but<00:02:14.189> this<00:02:14.700> week<00:02:14.939> I<00:02:15.120> want<00:02:15.329> to<00:02:15.390> take<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
but this week I want to take the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.449 
but this week I want to take the
preparation<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.290> actually<00:02:16.709> get<00:02:17.010> all<00:02:17.219> those

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
preparation to actually get all those

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.459 
preparation to actually get all those
Wi-Fi<00:02:17.760> battles<00:02:18.359> so<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.659> way<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.870> won't<00:02:19.260> be

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
Wi-Fi battles so that way I won't be

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.229 
Wi-Fi battles so that way I won't be
behind<00:02:19.829> from<00:02:20.069> now<00:02:20.189> on<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.730> be<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:20.879> lot<00:02:21.209> more

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
behind from now on I can be a lot more

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.660 
behind from now on I can be a lot more
consistent<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.500> that's<00:02:22.739> probably<00:02:23.129> what<00:02:23.579> I'm

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
consistent so that's probably what I'm

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.199 
consistent so that's probably what I'm
going<00:02:23.879> to<00:02:23.939> be<00:02:24.030> doing<00:02:24.180> here<00:02:25.730> other<00:02:26.730> than<00:02:27.090> that

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
going to be doing here other than that

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.390
