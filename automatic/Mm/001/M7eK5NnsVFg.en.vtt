00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
for doing it because I figure one you

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.470 
for doing it because I figure one you
know<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.910> them<00:00:33.000> might<00:00:33.149> get<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> little

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
know then one of them might get a little

more water and it might die or you might

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.630 
more water and it might die or you might
get<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> couple<00:00:35.700> cranes<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:38.190> come<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.550> your

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
get a couple cranes so come on to your

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.500 
get a couple cranes so come on to your
pond<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.420> then<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> crows<00:00:40.079> fall<00:00:40.379> those<00:00:40.680> birds

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
pond and then the crows fall those birds

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.490 
pond and then the crows fall those birds
they're<00:00:42.510> not<00:00:42.629> crazy<00:00:42.870> code<00:00:43.789> parents

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.310 

keep<00:00:48.070> around<00:00:48.250> here<00:00:48.370> come<00:00:48.640> other<00:00:49.600> names<00:00:52.320> which

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
keep around here come other names which

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.540 
keep around here come other names which
aren't<00:00:53.500> so<00:00:53.650> nice<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:55.239> uh<00:00:55.270> there's<00:00:55.900> a<00:00:56.020> bird<00:00:56.550> but

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
aren't so nice but uh there's a bird but

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.740 
aren't so nice but uh there's a bird but
then<00:00:57.700> you<00:00:57.820> got<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.000> figure<00:00:58.090> your<00:00:58.360> crows<00:00:58.600> are

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
then you got to figure your crows are

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.670 
then you got to figure your crows are
going<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:58.930> come<00:00:59.020> down<00:00:59.140> here<00:00:59.290> too

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
going to come down here too

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.549 
going to come down here too
they're<00:01:00.580> gonna<00:01:00.670> eat<00:01:00.760> this<00:01:01.000> up<00:01:01.270> they<00:01:02.050> at<00:01:02.380> least

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
they're gonna eat this up they at least

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.619 
they're gonna eat this up they at least
one<00:01:02.770> of<00:01:02.860> them<00:01:02.950> and<00:01:03.250> then<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.119> guys<00:01:04.239> figure<00:01:04.449> one

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
one of them and then you guys figure one

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.840 
one of them and then you guys figure one
at<00:01:04.960> least<00:01:05.290> where<00:01:05.500> every<00:01:05.710> other<00:01:05.800> one<00:01:06.070> you<00:01:06.729> guys

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
at least where every other one you guys

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.700 
at least where every other one you guys
figure<00:01:07.119> you<00:01:08.020> might<00:01:08.140> get<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.320> little<00:01:08.380> more<00:01:08.560> rain

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
figure you might get a little more rain

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.469 
figure you might get a little more rain
one<00:01:08.890> time<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:09.250> that<00:01:09.280> one<00:01:09.490> might<00:01:09.640> die<00:01:09.820> when<00:01:10.360> the

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
one time and that one might die when the

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.480 
one time and that one might die when the
seats<00:01:10.690> might<00:01:10.840> die<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:12.070> you<00:01:12.130> guys<00:01:12.250> figure<00:01:12.460> that

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
seats might die so you guys figure that

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.850 
seats might die so you guys figure that
so<00:01:12.820> I<00:01:12.880> usually<00:01:13.150> put<00:01:13.270> two<00:01:13.450> we<00:01:14.380> used<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:14.710> put

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
so I usually put two we used to put

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.469 
so I usually put two we used to put
three<00:01:15.160> but<00:01:15.400> then<00:01:15.670> we<00:01:15.760> used<00:01:15.910> to<00:01:15.970> get<00:01:16.060> clumps<00:01:16.360> of

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
three but then we used to get clumps of

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.020 
three but then we used to get clumps of
two<00:01:16.630> pumps<00:01:17.229> it<00:01:17.350> feel<00:01:17.530> of<00:01:18.400> two<00:01:18.610> of<00:01:18.729> them<00:01:18.820> growing

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
two pumps it feel of two of them growing

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.430 
two pumps it feel of two of them growing
right<00:01:19.300> next<00:01:19.509> to<00:01:19.570> each<00:01:19.630> other<00:01:19.720> so<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.020> just<00:01:20.290> put

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
right next to each other so I just put

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.980 
right next to each other so I just put
two<00:01:20.590> now<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:22.000> know<00:01:22.060> at<00:01:22.270> least<00:01:22.360> one<00:01:22.630> was<00:01:22.840> going
