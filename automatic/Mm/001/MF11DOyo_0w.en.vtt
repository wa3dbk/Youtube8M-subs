strip these wires back using wire

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.490 
strip these wires back using wire
strippers<00:05:04.300> because<00:05:04.570> they<00:05:04.690> have<00:05:04.870> an<00:05:05.050> enamel

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
get the coating off you have to burn

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.010 
get the coating off you have to burn
them<00:05:09.160> with<00:05:09.310> a<00:05:09.340> flame<00:05:09.669> like<00:05:09.910> this<00:05:10.150> if<00:05:10.389> it

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
them with a flame like this if it

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.510 
them with a flame like this if it
catches<00:05:11.169> on<00:05:11.440> fire<00:05:11.620> just<00:05:11.889> blowed<00:05:12.160> out<00:05:12.190> quickly

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
catches on fire just blowed out quickly

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.830 
catches on fire just blowed out quickly
so<00:05:12.669> it<00:05:12.880> doesn't<00:05:13.150> burn<00:05:13.240> up<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.510> whole<00:05:13.660> wire

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
so it doesn't burn up the whole wire

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.200 
so it doesn't burn up the whole wire
after<00:05:14.460> burning<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.520> wire<00:05:15.699> you'll<00:05:15.940> need<00:05:16.120> to

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
after burning the wire you'll need to

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.760 
after burning the wire you'll need to
wipe<00:05:16.360> off<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.780> black<00:05:17.020> residue<00:05:17.470> that's<00:05:17.620> left

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
wipe off the black residue that's left

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.710 
wipe off the black residue that's left
either<00:05:18.190> with<00:05:18.490> your<00:05:18.580> fingers<00:05:18.970> or<00:05:19.150> an<00:05:19.360> alcohol
