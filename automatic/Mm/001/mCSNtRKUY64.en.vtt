soil<00:00:08.570> from<00:00:09.200> yard<00:00:10.160> waste<00:00:10.429> that<00:00:10.969> you<00:00:11.030> pick<00:00:11.420> up

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
soil from yard waste that you pick up

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:19.450 
soil from yard waste that you pick up
from<00:00:12.769> a<00:00:14.080> municipal<00:00:15.080> a<00:00:16.630> city<00:00:17.630> or<00:00:18.050> a<00:00:18.109> county<00:00:19.070> yard

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
from a municipal a city or a county yard

from a municipal a city or a county yard
waste<00:00:19.699> facility<00:00:20.619> so<00:00:21.820> this<00:00:22.820> is<00:00:22.970> basically<00:00:23.510> what

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
waste facility so this is basically what

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.330 
waste facility so this is basically what
you<00:00:24.289> have<00:00:25.480> when<00:00:26.480> you<00:00:26.570> go<00:00:26.689> to<00:00:26.750> the<00:00:26.900> facility

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
you have when you go to the facility

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.009 
you have when you go to the facility
it's<00:00:28.340> all<00:00:28.490> kind<00:00:28.820> of<00:00:28.939> thick<00:00:29.210> but<00:00:29.449> it's<00:00:29.599> it<00:00:29.840> is

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
it's all kind of thick but it's it is

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.140 
it's all kind of thick but it's it is
mulch<00:00:30.410> this<00:00:31.279> has<00:00:31.429> actually<00:00:31.519> been<00:00:31.730> sitting<00:00:31.970> for

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
mulch this has actually been sitting for

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.610 
mulch this has actually been sitting for
a<00:00:32.300> couple<00:00:32.540> days<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:32.720> it's<00:00:32.990> broken<00:00:33.260> down<00:00:33.560> a

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
a couple days so it's broken down a

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.160 
a couple days so it's broken down a
little<00:00:33.890> bit<00:00:34.210> but<00:00:35.210> what<00:00:35.360> it<00:00:35.480> is<00:00:35.510> is<00:00:36.250> you'll<00:00:37.250> see

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
little bit but what it is is you'll see

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.750 
little bit but what it is is you'll see
typically<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:40.010> yard<00:00:40.100> waste<00:00:40.340> facility

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
typically the the yard waste facility

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.340 
typically the the yard waste facility
will<00:00:40.850> have<00:00:41.000> like<00:00:41.180> a<00:00:41.210> large<00:00:41.480> pile<00:00:41.780> of<00:00:42.050> it<00:00:42.170> and

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
will have like a large pile of it and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.400 
will have like a large pile of it and
then<00:00:42.680> you<00:00:42.890> just<00:00:43.100> go<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:43.490> you<00:00:43.580> take<00:00:43.910> it<00:00:44.410> it's

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
then you just go and you take it it's

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.030 
then you just go and you take it it's
free

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
free

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.090 
free
sometimes<00:00:46.460> they<00:00:46.670> load<00:00:46.880> it<00:00:47.060> for<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:48.100> depending

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
sometimes they load it for you depending

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.390 
sometimes they load it for you depending
if<00:00:49.220> they<00:00:49.340> have<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:49.580> loader<00:00:50.240> or<00:00:50.480> not<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:51.710> what<00:00:52.250> you

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
if they have a loader or not so what you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.890 
if they have a loader or not so what you
do<00:00:52.580> is<00:00:54.520> you<00:00:55.520> get<00:00:55.640> yourself<00:00:55.820> or<00:00:56.570> make<00:00:56.750> yourself

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
do is you get yourself or make yourself

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.190 
do is you get yourself or make yourself
a<00:00:57.470> half<00:00:57.680> inch<00:00:57.920> screen<00:00:58.370> like<00:00:59.120> so<00:00:59.150> this<00:00:59.870> is<00:01:00.020> just

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
a half inch screen like so this is just

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.260 
a half inch screen like so this is just
a<00:01:00.290> half<00:01:00.470> inch<00:01:00.620> screen<00:01:01.070> I've<00:01:01.700> also<00:01:01.850> made<00:01:02.120> them

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
a half inch screen I've also made them

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.240 
a half inch screen I've also made them
out<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.840> quarter-inch<00:01:03.410> mesh<00:01:03.770> but<00:01:03.950> this<00:01:04.100> is

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
out of quarter-inch mesh but this is

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.250 
out of quarter-inch mesh but this is
half<00:01:04.430> inch<00:01:04.640> mesh<00:01:04.939> you<00:01:05.690> can<00:01:05.750> get<00:01:05.960> from<00:01:06.080> Home

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
half inch mesh you can get from Home

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.640 
half inch mesh you can get from Home
Depot<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:08.090> then<00:01:08.180> this<00:01:08.300> is<00:01:08.480> just<00:01:08.720> some<00:01:08.960> some

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
Depot and then this is just some some

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.590 
Depot and then this is just some some
one<00:01:09.800> by<00:01:09.980> two<00:01:10.150> frame<00:01:11.350> and<00:01:12.910> or<00:01:13.910> one<00:01:14.090> by<00:01:14.210> two<00:01:14.270> made

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
one by two frame and or one by two made

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.510 
one by two frame and or one by two made
into<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.870> frame<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.530> then<00:01:15.860> what<00:01:15.980> you<00:01:16.100> do<00:01:16.220> is<00:01:16.250> you

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
into a frame and then what you do is you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:27.010 
into a frame and then what you do is you
just<00:01:16.700> dump<00:01:16.970> this<00:01:20.410> like<00:01:21.410> so<00:01:25.570> you<00:01:26.570> just<00:01:26.720> kind<00:01:26.960> of

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
just dump this like so you just kind of

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.890 
just dump this like so you just kind of
rub<00:01:27.410> it<00:01:27.530> around<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:27.860> screen<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.600> smaller

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
rub it around the screen and the smaller

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.690 
rub it around the screen and the smaller
particles<00:01:30.530> will<00:01:30.740> fall<00:01:30.980> through<00:01:33.550> which<00:01:34.550> I'll

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
particles will fall through which I'll

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.030 
particles will fall through which I'll
show<00:01:34.909> in<00:01:35.090> just<00:01:35.120> a<00:01:35.390> second<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.860> get<00:01:37.010> a

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
show in just a second and you get a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.270 
show in just a second and you get a
pretty<00:01:37.370> a<00:01:37.610> pretty<00:01:37.700> nice<00:01:38.330> fine<00:01:38.920> mulch<00:01:39.920> through

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
pretty a pretty nice fine mulch through

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:49.660 
pretty a pretty nice fine mulch through
a<00:01:40.340> half<00:01:40.550> inch<00:01:40.820> screen<00:01:41.920> so

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.060 

if<00:01:50.630> I<00:01:50.720> had<00:01:50.870> this<00:01:50.990> up<00:01:51.200> on<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.350> table<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.890> would

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
if I had this up on a table that would

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.219 
if I had this up on a table that would
go<00:01:52.250> much<00:01:52.460> more<00:01:52.640> quickly

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
go much more quickly

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.429 
go much more quickly
usually<00:01:55.229> what<00:01:55.380> I'll<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:56.450> I'll<00:01:57.450> take<00:01:57.630> three

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
usually what I'll do is I'll take three

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.969 
usually what I'll do is I'll take three
or<00:01:58.859> actually<00:01:59.390> three<00:02:00.390> or<00:02:00.509> four<00:02:00.780> three<00:02:01.649> gallon

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
or actually three or four three gallon

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.630 
or actually three or four three gallon
pots<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.579> put<00:02:02.729> them<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:04.159> then<00:02:05.159> I

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
pots and put them like that and then I

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.300 
pots and put them like that and then I
can<00:02:06.119> fill<00:02:06.299> those<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:06.600> pretty<00:02:06.840> quick<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:08.129> this

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
can fill those up pretty quick but this

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.150 
can fill those up pretty quick but this
I<00:02:08.489> think<00:02:08.549> is<00:02:08.819> like<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.470> believe<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.679> ten<00:02:11.009> or

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
I think is like a I believe a ten or

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.190 
I think is like a I believe a ten or
eleven<00:02:11.489> gallon<00:02:11.849> pot<00:02:12.200> Landscaping<00:02:13.200> pot<00:02:15.200> and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
eleven gallon pot Landscaping pot and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.600 
eleven gallon pot Landscaping pot and
then<00:02:16.349> as<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:16.739> see<00:02:16.980> all<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.310> heavier

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
then as you can see all the heavier

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.430 
then as you can see all the heavier
stuff<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.330> thicker<00:02:18.569> mulch<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.110> left<00:02:19.349> behind

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
stuff the thicker mulch is left behind

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.050 
stuff the thicker mulch is left behind
then<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:22.799> throw<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.220> whether<00:02:23.879> you

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
then you can just throw that whether you

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:32.330 
then you can just throw that whether you
want<00:02:25.549> now<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.610> plant<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.090> right<00:02:27.360> here<00:02:31.340> that

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
want now the plant this right here that

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.960 
want now the plant this right here that
there<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.590> as<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.519> can<00:02:35.640> see<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:38.280> does<00:02:38.519> let<00:02:38.760> some

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
there so as you can see it does let some

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.170 
there so as you can see it does let some
of<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.120> little<00:02:39.360> sticks<00:02:39.660> through<00:02:41.150> but<00:02:42.150> overall

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
of the little sticks through but overall

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.979 
of the little sticks through but overall
it's<00:02:42.900> pretty<00:02:43.170> nice<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:45.180> packs<00:02:45.420> pretty<00:02:45.750> well

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
it's pretty nice it packs pretty well

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.920 
it's pretty nice it packs pretty well
into<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> ball<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:47.310> kind<00:02:47.519> of<00:02:47.579> spongy<00:02:48.859> so<00:02:50.930> I've

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
into a ball it's kind of spongy so I've

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.410 
into a ball it's kind of spongy so I've
done<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.319> quite<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.590> bit<00:02:52.709> over<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.129> last<00:02:53.420> four

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
done this quite a bit over the last four

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.479 
done this quite a bit over the last four
or<00:02:54.450> five<00:02:54.569> years<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:55.290> had<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> gentleman<00:02:55.950> name<00:02:56.370> was

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
or five years I had a gentleman name was

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.000 
or five years I had a gentleman name was
Jim<00:02:56.670> Kowalewski<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.540> New<00:02:57.660> Port<00:02:57.870> Richey<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.920> he

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
Jim Kowalewski in New Port Richey and he

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.430 
Jim Kowalewski in New Port Richey and he
actually<00:02:59.340> told<00:02:59.549> me<00:02:59.670> this<00:02:59.910> system<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:01.380> I

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
actually told me this system and I

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.170 
actually told me this system and I
couldn't<00:03:01.709> believe<00:03:01.799> how<00:03:02.040> simple<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.609> was<00:03:02.790> and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
couldn't believe how simple it was and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.050 
couldn't believe how simple it was and
the<00:03:03.569> fact<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.109> free<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.680> just

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
the fact that it's free is just

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.509 
the fact that it's free is just
fantastic

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
fantastic

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.809 
fantastic
so<00:03:09.560> one<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.769> good<00:03:10.919> things<00:03:11.160> about<00:03:11.310> this

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
so one of the good things about this

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.259 
so one of the good things about this
this<00:03:12.510> mulch<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.169> that<00:03:13.349> you<00:03:13.440> have<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> lot<00:03:13.950> of

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
this mulch is that you have a lot of

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.890 
this mulch is that you have a lot of
beneficial<00:03:15.269> bacteria<00:03:15.889> in<00:03:16.889> it<00:03:17.900> microorganisms

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
beneficial bacteria in it microorganisms

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.960 
beneficial bacteria in it microorganisms
and<00:03:19.290> what<00:03:19.440> have<00:03:19.620> you

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
and what have you

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.780 
and what have you
sometimes<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:23.489> can<00:03:23.639> get<00:03:23.760> warm<00:03:24.180> eggs<00:03:24.419> in<00:03:24.660> it

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
sometimes you can get warm eggs in it

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.909 
sometimes you can get warm eggs in it
you<00:03:26.790> know<00:03:26.910> native<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.359> your<00:03:27.450> area<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:28.109> then

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
you know native to your area and then

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.409 
you know native to your area and then
then<00:03:29.370> you'll<00:03:29.519> have<00:03:29.609> worms<00:03:29.880> for<00:03:30.150> your<00:03:30.239> soil

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
then you'll have worms for your soil

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.710 
then you'll have worms for your soil
which<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.840> always<00:03:31.019> good<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:33.030> then<00:03:33.419> the<00:03:33.510> last

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
which is always good and then the last

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.289 
which is always good and then the last
thing<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.049> just<00:03:34.200> want<00:03:34.349> to<00:03:34.410> touch<00:03:34.530> on<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:34.980> that

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
thing I just want to touch on is that

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.030 
thing I just want to touch on is that
this<00:03:36.299> is<00:03:36.569> this<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:36.989> considered<00:03:37.349> high<00:03:37.560> quality

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
this is this is considered high quality

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.309 
this is this is considered high quality
stuff<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.669> I<00:03:40.099> titled<00:03:41.099> this<00:03:41.160> video<00:03:41.579> how<00:03:41.849> to<00:03:41.880> make

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
stuff I I titled this video how to make

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.120 
stuff I I titled this video how to make
free<00:03:43.319> garden<00:03:43.680> soil<00:03:44.480> because<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.950> can

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
free garden soil because you can

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.159 
free garden soil because you can
actually<00:03:47.459> use<00:03:47.639> this<00:03:47.790> for<00:03:47.849> potting<00:03:48.359> soil<00:03:48.690> but

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
actually use this for potting soil but

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.569 
actually use this for potting soil but
it<00:03:49.319> is<00:03:49.440> lacking<00:03:49.739> certain<00:03:50.190> nutrients<00:03:51.180> um<00:03:52.579> but

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
it is lacking certain nutrients um but

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.080 
it is lacking certain nutrients um but
I've<00:03:53.700> found<00:03:54.000> especially<00:03:54.750> with<00:03:54.870> seed<00:03:55.079> starting

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
I've found especially with seed starting

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.580 
I've found especially with seed starting
that<00:03:57.090> if<00:03:57.419> you<00:03:57.540> use<00:03:57.629> a<00:03:57.660> quarter<00:03:58.049> inch<00:03:58.200> screen

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
that if you use a quarter inch screen

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.770 
that if you use a quarter inch screen
you<00:03:58.919> get<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.099> finer<00:03:59.370> mulch<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.569> finer

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
you get a finer mulch and the finer

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.590 
you get a finer mulch and the finer
mulch<00:04:01.109> has<00:04:01.379> worked<00:04:01.590> better<00:04:01.799> for<00:04:02.160> me<00:04:02.340> as<00:04:03.120> far<00:04:03.419> as

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
mulch has worked better for me as far as

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.499 
mulch has worked better for me as far as
the<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.840> seed<00:04:04.530> starting<00:04:04.979> but<00:04:05.549> if<00:04:05.669> you<00:04:05.789> went<00:04:06.090> if

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:06.509 
the the seed starting but if you went if

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:07.990 
the the seed starting but if you went if
you<00:04:06.660> filled<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.049> bucket

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
you filled this bucket

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.230 
you filled this bucket
you<00:04:09.000> probably<00:04:09.240> have<00:04:09.660> about<00:04:09.810> maybe<00:04:11.090> I'm<00:04:12.090> going

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
you probably have about maybe I'm going

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.670 
you probably have about maybe I'm going
to<00:04:12.300> guess<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.720> say<00:04:12.870> about<00:04:13.110> eight<00:04:13.350> or<00:04:13.500> ten

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
to guess and say about eight or ten

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.670 
to guess and say about eight or ten
pounds<00:04:14.190> of<00:04:14.540> you<00:04:15.540> know<00:04:15.660> half<00:04:16.080> inch<00:04:16.290> sifted

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
pounds of you know half inch sifted

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.360 
pounds of you know half inch sifted
mulch<00:04:16.890> or<00:04:17.130> quarter<00:04:17.400> inch<00:04:17.959> sifted<00:04:18.959> mulch<00:04:19.370> and

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
mulch or quarter inch sifted mulch and

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.580 
mulch or quarter inch sifted mulch and

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
if you want to buy that much mulch or

if you want to buy that much mulch or
not<00:04:22.740> mulch<00:04:25.490> garden<00:04:26.490> soil<00:04:26.760> if<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.120> want<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.330> buy

not mulch garden soil if you want to buy

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.090 
not mulch garden soil if you want to buy

Home<00:04:29.250> Depot<00:04:29.400> you're<00:04:29.850> going<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.030> spend<00:04:30.240> at

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
Home Depot you're going to spend at

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.140 
Home Depot you're going to spend at
least<00:04:30.330> four<00:04:30.630> or<00:04:30.690> five<00:04:30.870> dollars<00:04:31.100> so<00:04:32.150> typically

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
least four or five dollars so typically

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.480 
least four or five dollars so typically
to<00:04:33.480> fill<00:04:33.660> like<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:33.960> barrel<00:04:34.380> like<00:04:34.410> this<00:04:34.560> sifting

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
to fill like a barrel like this sifting

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.880 
to fill like a barrel like this sifting
it<00:04:35.550> through<00:04:35.730> a<00:04:35.760> half<00:04:35.970> inch<00:04:36.180> screen<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:37.680> might

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
it through a half inch screen it might

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.520 
it through a half inch screen it might
take<00:04:38.100> me<00:04:38.280> maybe<00:04:38.460> 15-20<00:04:39.150> minutes<00:04:39.450> that<00:04:40.440> the

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
take me maybe 15-20 minutes that the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.810 
take me maybe 15-20 minutes that the
quarter<00:04:40.800> inch<00:04:40.920> screen<00:04:41.160> takes<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.520> little<00:04:41.670> bit

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
quarter inch screen takes a little bit

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.200 
quarter inch screen takes a little bit
longer<00:04:42.770> that's<00:04:43.770> basically<00:04:44.190> it<00:04:44.460> so<00:04:44.760> if<00:04:45.090> you

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
longer that's basically it so if you

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.940 
longer that's basically it so if you
like<00:04:45.390> the<00:04:45.510> video<00:04:45.750> please<00:04:45.960> post<00:04:46.290> a<00:04:46.440> comment<00:04:46.860> and
