00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
that type of action but I'm kind of

that type of action but I'm kind of
feeling<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:24.320> well<00:04:24.740> we've<00:04:25.070> seen<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.370> lot<00:04:25.490> of

this type of action

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.420 
this type of action
Michael<00:04:27.319> Bay<00:04:27.470> so<00:04:27.530> it's<00:04:27.919> not<00:04:28.039> much<00:04:28.250> of<00:04:28.280> a

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
Michael Bay so it's not much of a

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.700 
Michael Bay so it's not much of a
stretch<00:04:28.669> for<00:04:28.940> him<00:04:29.060> so<00:04:29.449> I<00:04:29.840> don't<00:04:30.350> want<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.560> see

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
stretch for him so I don't want to see

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.010

him to write ghost recon producing cool

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.140 
him to write ghost recon producing cool
but<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.889> don't<00:04:34.250> think<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.520> should<00:04:34.550> use<00:04:34.850> up<00:04:35.030> his

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
but I don't think you should use up his

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.300 
but I don't think you should use up his
energy<00:04:35.509> directing<00:04:36.319> ghost<00:04:36.500> recon<00:04:36.710> at<00:04:37.130> least

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
not using up his vision because I'd like

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.129 
not using up his vision because I'd like
