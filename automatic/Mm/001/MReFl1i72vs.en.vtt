00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
which will eventually move over that

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.380 
which will eventually move over that
which<00:01:06.090> will<00:01:06.299> look<00:01:06.420> better<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:07.320> course<00:01:08.390> just

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.429 

so<00:01:27.360> yeah<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:29.460> trap<00:01:30.150> door<00:01:30.570> has<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.290> be

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.550 
both the best um highest detail thing
I've<00:01:36.150> done<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:37.110> far<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.079> probably<00:01:40.409> going

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
I've done so far this is probably going

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.399 
I've done so far this is probably going
to<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:40.829> use<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.360> show<00:01:42.649> eventually<00:01:48.140> yeah

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
well they probably got the idea from the

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.999 
well they probably got the idea from the
flipping<00:01:52.500> around<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:53.189> get<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.460> here<00:01:54.680> yeah<00:01:55.680> it's

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
flipping around to get up here yeah it's

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.190 
flipping around to get up here yeah it's
about<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> only<00:01:56.490> thing<00:01:56.909> for<00:01:57.570> which<00:01:57.689> I've<00:01:58.020> got

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
about the only thing for which I've got

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.280 
about the only thing for which I've got
half<00:01:58.500> decent<00:01:58.770> materials<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.689> yeah<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.229> is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
half decent materials so yeah this is

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.440 
half decent materials so yeah this is
the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.420 

from<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:09.460> tower<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:10.960> and<00:02:11.380> that<00:02:11.430> have

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
from the tower and that and that have

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.630 
from the tower and that and that have
been<00:02:12.670> seen<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.510> series<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.050> far<00:02:14.640> that

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
been seen in the series so far that

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.309 
been seen in the series so far that
reminds<00:02:16.000> me<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.300> have<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.600> put<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:16.900> side

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
reminds me I have to put in that side

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.410 
reminds me I have to put in that side
arch<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.680> yeah<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.100> would<00:02:21.280> be<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.459> little

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
arch so yeah this would be a little

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.240 
arch so yeah this would be a little
front<00:02:22.780> courtyard<00:02:23.770> type<00:02:24.400> thing<00:02:25.800> bars<00:02:26.800> should

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
front courtyard type thing bars should

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.050 
front courtyard type thing bars should
probably<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.810> bid

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
probably the bid

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.790 
probably the bid
well<00:02:31.060> there<00:02:31.780> should<00:02:31.959> probably<00:02:31.990> be<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.410> few<00:02:32.470> more

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
well there should probably be a few more

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:43.110 
well there should probably be a few more
bars<00:02:33.330> horizontally<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:37.709> vertically<00:02:42.120> so

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
bars horizontally and vertically so

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.509 
bars horizontally and vertically so
there<00:02:43.270> yeah<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.840> no<00:02:44.830> part<00:02:45.070> of<00:02:45.130> halls<00:02:45.310> is

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
there yeah and no part of halls is

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.130 
there yeah and no part of halls is
really<00:02:45.760> complete<00:02:46.150> without<00:02:46.440> spikes<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:49.140> skewer

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
really complete without spikes to skewer

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.449 
really complete without spikes to skewer
anything<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:50.800> gets<00:02:50.890> about<00:02:51.160> halfway

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
anything that gets about halfway

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.199 
anything that gets about halfway
underneath<00:02:52.060> before<00:02:52.300> it<00:02:52.890> lowers<00:02:55.800> shish<00:02:56.800> kebobs

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
underneath before it lowers shish kebobs

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.449 
underneath before it lowers shish kebobs
say<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.330> least

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459
