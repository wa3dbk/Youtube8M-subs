00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.460
 we are the browning stand with friedrich 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.730
 colombier manager italy that we 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.840
 presents the new amaral rifle then 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.119
 the marra carbine and a carbine that 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.820
 concentrates a lot of news 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.420
 interesting and a rifle armament 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.070
 linear and one thing to say when when 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.230
 I would have armed the rifle with the shutter 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.230
 remains closed in the box 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.950
 the second thing is that this carbine a 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.320
 outline movement asks only one 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.410
 unique movement that to pull 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.150
 the shutter and closes itself one 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.309
 carbine I found from the normal there 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.360
 four mummies are a carbine 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.739
 movement and linear there are two i 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.739
 clean movements we have only one 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.810
 this allows a great speed in the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.210
 around the sea the art 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.140
 in this way the bus can be used easily 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:19.170
 in the beat with a boar safe 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.690
 of leverage and this is also a novelty is 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.100
 this groove and also to date was the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.450
 hunting for hunting purposes 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.080
 at the time go to the chamois in 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.360
 substance all the hunters who go to 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.250
 hunting in batting but which also has a 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.800
 a couple of times a year they wanted to go to the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.310
 suede will come first time they may have 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.520
 a fully plowed rifle both for the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.410
 hunting in batting opens the hunt and of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.369
 lurking we have lightened it 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.270
 click both on a 2 kilo and this 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.770
 carbine also lives on wood 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.259
 particularly nice we wanted 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.500
 make a very nice rifle a lot 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.450
 nice for the hunters they want 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.830
 do and various types of ungulate hunting 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.810
 so in essence it is no longer 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.179
 It is necessary to have two weapons but this weapon 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.950
 focuses 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:15.680
 single weapon ii for years we talked about 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.349
 weapon specialized specialized weapon 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.659
 for roe deer hunting with the 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.390
 wild boar for the first time 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:27.980
 we really talk and a weapon 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.980
 multipurpose the barrel goes to 56 and a rod 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.810
 of 56 cm with i is fine for both 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.430
 beaten and manageable both for the daughter 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.540
 and also the design is very good 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.060
 curate 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.060
 but the idV we find again the line of the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.709
 of the Zenit bar career 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.230
 we have the thirsty shutter e 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.799
 swivel that we now use from 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.439
 years that all the players know it is 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.109
 the hit and it was nothing but the closure anymore 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:59.450
 sure by far the reeds are the 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.870
 meats fn 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.500
 the shutter and a shutter and motors 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.629
 falling 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.269
 here we can see here the charger e 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:16.449
 sagging we can put a charger 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.449
 23 or even ten shots for the .30 caliber 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.730
 two words about the bar tracker always from 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.950
 part of frederick colombia we see 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.340
 these orange inserts as never before 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.459
 choice 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.970
 so singular then bach track was 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.410
 developed specifically for channels from 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.810
 those ranging from dirt in 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.410
 bushes the peculiarities of this 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.769
 boat are the non-slip inserts 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.730
 orange this is for a reason 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.790
 security for visibility 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.959
 then we crossed the cane the barrel 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.940
 47 cm is the reason e 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.739
 maneuverability and agility therefore one must 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.420
 be light must be a lot 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.700
 manageable this was the reason 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.120
 then there is a rib with the inserts in 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.120
 optic fiber 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.879
 fiber optic viewfinder so it's a 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:14.959
 handy rifle suitable for shooting 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:18.919
 instinctive and definitely made for i 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.660
 canals that go into the bushes during the 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.799
 very well beaten 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.799
 thank you again
