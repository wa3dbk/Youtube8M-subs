00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.049
 fury of a truck driver in Maipú after 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.150
 discuss with another driver the driver no 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.700
 he just ran over him but also in the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.330
 flight hit all the cars that were 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.330
 they crossed on the road 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.490
 the man with short hair and shirt 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.350
 Blanca is a truck driver who is furious 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.180
 your opponent is the driver of a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.669
 three-room truck that would have 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:36.960
 blocked the way and suddenly the last 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.590
 young woman shows her glasses on the day to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.800
 pay for the lenses that are broken 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:47.540
 then the lynx knight who does not 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.540
 He would pay the lenses and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.230
 not having the answer I expected it 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:59.080
 unleashes his fury goes up to his machines and 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.050
 begins his revenge by retreating 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.900
 only his opponent's truck collides 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.970
 but also runs over it thanks to 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.100
 God he manages to hold with the wheel 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.300
 because they change how you have a 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.150
 a couplet at that time did not have the 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.000
 copla or has a top wheel it is achieved 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.270
 hold the wheel and go backwards 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.950
 but at the time he was not in the middle 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.940
 collides that has crushed with all 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.190
 trucks but it did not end there and then the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.460
 truck driver came out destroying other 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.460
 trucks 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.610
 while the drivers threw him 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.270
 stones 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.270
 all right 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:48.970
 but even another truck must have 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.970
 back down so as not to add another victim 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.650
 and the house 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.399
 the street serafín zamora de maipú vide 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.490
 full of trucks of companies of 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:11.420
 telephony that must load equipment from 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.250
 a warehouse that situation generates daily 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.799
 conflicts with high trucks 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.269
 tonnage that pass by the place 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.370
 the problem that I believe that this street 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.370
 it is not enabled for the transit of 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.620
 trucks if you come at eight and 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.890
 mean in the morning the safest thing is that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.870
 find some problem 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.000
 Truckers insist that they are the 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.200
 telephone vans which 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.930
 park in places that do not 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.329
 they are blocking the passage of 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.610
 any vehicle and generating the 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:44.450
 conflicts that separate the vans from 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.750
 Movistar on both sides then it is 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.299
 difficult have there been problem give to dio 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.930
 fight the drivers or insults 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.560
 simonetto there is a problem with a 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.500
 windshield 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.330
 what they will see in the municipality of 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.640
 Maipú gave the reason to the 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.819
 truckers because the street has the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.380
 signage of not parking in fact the 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.550
 Warehouse company adds 15 infractions 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.840
 indeed this not only affects 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.769
 the free movement of people but 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.390
 that also the islands free movement 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.430
 of vehicles with clogging 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.690
 all this implies that we 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.610
 we have to do it there is no more in 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.370
 the law that effectively depart 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.230
 notify and send it to hundreds game 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.250
 police gas incident there was no 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.250
 complaint to the carabineros 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.880
 apparently for now it will continue 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.880
 reigning the law of the strongest
