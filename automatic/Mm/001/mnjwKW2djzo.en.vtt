00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Kuban carriers carried out the action 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.310
 protest if their problems do not turn 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.560
 Attention 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.240
 they can start the whole thing strike 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.190
 the cost of transportation of goods by which 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.599
 called transport companies on 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.880
 meeting in Krasnodar arrived more 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.980
 fifty people from all over the edge of that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.380
 decided and will strike learned 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.480
 Anna Sorokina 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.189
 for the sake of this meeting they refused rice 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.019
 in private entrepreneurs on their 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.179
 motor vehicles 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.399
 companies in such numbers gathered 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.599
 for the first time and from their work from in the hatch far from it 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.699
 not a joyous occasion 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.440
 from companies providing them with orders 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.420
 they hope to achieve a boost 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.180
 freight cost 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.570
 three years ago diesel fuel cost for example 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.579
 20 rubles diesel fuel jumped very up to 30 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.589
 rubles but the cost of transportation fell 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.220
 much lower than before 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.610
 if for example they gave 40 50 to Moscow 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.070
 thousand 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.979
 times so diesel fuel was cheap on 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.989
 data moment create 15 20 25 thousand 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.850
 and from the amount received most of 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.159
 will have to subtract calculate the approximate 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.500
 revenue from a trip from Krasnodar to Sochi and 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.080
 back to the driver is issued 18 thousand 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.909
 eight of them are spent on fuel around 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.070
 three gets a driver for work 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.890
 the remaining seven go on taxes 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.540
 pension deductions and auto repair in the end 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.450
 because of the small job earnings 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.220
 carrier throw many it shows by 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.350
 car sales sites now 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.479
 for example in Krasnodar region for sale 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.819
 more than three thousand freight exhibited 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.799
 auto and reason for selling as stated in 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.710
 most ads this change 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.719
 activity Vladimir Sergeev one of 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.850
 those who refuse to continue to work on 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.859
 motor transport companies 20 years 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.139
 having worked as a carrier decided to part 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:42.760
 with this profession forever your truck 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:45.040
 put up for sale that's all 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.620
 because it makes no sense to me for the quarter 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.540
 it will be necessary to pay 25 thousand per quarter 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.330
 only taxes it goes or 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.640
 salary was we often think further who 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.500
 us do suffer from reduced fees not 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.750
 only the driver themselves but also the quality 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.480
 speed and safety of delivery 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.100
 since funds for car repair 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.480
 Often not enough and if you raise the bet 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.770
 then everyone wins in this from car service and 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.510
 because drivers will go to them and 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.270
 more road safety will be more 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.030
 the whole will be the load why because well 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.620
 as if the car is working properly then it is already 90 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.810
 percent of what he gives normal 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.610
 condition and scheduled schedule 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.190
 Drivers cause discontent and 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.420
 opacity of wages 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.430
 the carrier does not always know how much 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.440
 for the delivery of the goods the employers pay 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.570
 what percentage of the amount laid 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.190
 to the performer in fact here is the official 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.810
 application in winter 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.470
 22 25,000 here's the official me from this 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.170
 application 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.940
 I have to give 4000 I get 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.560
 officially the dispatcher is now at this 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.590
 the moment you agree on this application 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.110
 selected part of my bid from absence 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.820
 work I am forced to settle for such 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.770
 conditions we have gathered in order to 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.019
 just think about this question or 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.820
 organize a single dispatcher at least 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.700
 in the southern federal district where will 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.530
 transparent rates are fixed here 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.600
 one of the solutions to the problem 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.670
 which carriers agree second 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.040
 option to unite under the flag 1 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.420
 logistics company to achieve a unified 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.030
 bets on the number of passed 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.280
 kilometers and if that they fail 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.050
 drivers are ready to strike and to her 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.820
 going to attract the disgruntled 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.950
 carriers from all over Russia
