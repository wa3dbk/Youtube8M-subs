00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
 we have not missed the hamster 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.670
 how can we find you with a little 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.670
 of flour come let's go inside video 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.809
 the house is very big and we have been able to 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.789
 lose by any corner because 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.860
 the hamsters are dwarfs and they get in 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.960
 every corner the first thing that 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.230
 we have to identify is in what 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.329
 room is for this very important 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.700
 close all the doors because of that 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.920
 can no longer be changed from a water to 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.130
 other 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.720
 we already have closed doors we have to 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.580
 give the order at home that nobody leaves 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.380
 no door open because if we do not 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.690
 let's go crazy if we start to 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.360
 change from one place to another let's do 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.140
 a little trick we're going to take some 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.650
 granites three in this case and in each 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.480
 room let's put three grains of 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.449
 the food that you like most 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.890
 the wheat is very good option we will put 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.440
 three granites on a plate 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.530
 in each room we are going to do this 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.050
 procedure in such a way that according 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.510
 go past the time and the animal will 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.210
 between hunger in the room wherever 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.710
 where the three grains disappear is in 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.650
 the room where the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.890
 Hamster goes without saying that we have 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.420
 of searching conscientiously for all 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.580
 corners that occur to us in the house 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.920
 it's very typical that they get behind the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.380
 refrigerator behind the washing machine that 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.440
 get between the cushions of the sofa and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.090
 they can also climb quite well but 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.520
 I'm going to tell you another trick that we can 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.060
 do with flour and it's catch a little 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.060
 Of flour 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.020
 and we are going to put 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.180
 a tad in a corner in each of the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.970
 rooms where we think that the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.250
 animal can pass the flour they love 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.860
 it smells pretty good for them because 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.560
 it's basically crushed wheat and when 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.270
 the animal comes near to smell it because 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.560
 it catches a lot of attention is going to leave 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.560
 marked his tracks 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.119
 You see how it stops when you kick 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:20.290
 As soon as we leave the marks marked 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.290
 and he leaves we already know that he has been here 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.470
 flour offers us many advantages 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.630
 it really acts like a photocopier 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.510
 as a photo machine of all the 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.870
 things that have happened there and even so 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.570
 you stop to tell we can see how it is 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.670
 the market the four pads 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.440
 of the fingers and that of the back leg or 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.440
 be that we know that it is a 100% hamster 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.510
 and that we have here the trick of the 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.239
 pool without water if still our 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.670
 fugitive is still not captured we are going to 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.769
 resort to some books and a bucket 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.770
 our pool without water to be able 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:01.760
 capture it as we do 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:06.140
 bucket and a block of books with this 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.600
 block of books we're going to turn it into 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.600
 a small staircase 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.980
 inside the pool we will put the 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.860
 food that you like 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.879
 being generous so that it smells good with 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.879
 the food that you like 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.400
 what is going to happen now that when 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.720
 our fugitive is swarming through the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.630
 home 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.640
 There will come a time when the smell of 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.350
 food will call you a lot of attention and like 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.290
 they are so curious 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.550
 will gradually go up the 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:47.490
 stairs and it will be thrown at a given moment 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:53.060
 to the pool without water and once you have 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.060
 fallen can not go out anymore you 're stuck 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.640
 but we should never rule out 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.040
 possibility of delivery 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.959
 voluntarily therefore one of the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.909
 best ways is to always leave the 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.760
 open cage to enter when you 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.340
 I hope you liked it and 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.250

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.150
 many more subscribe now that you
