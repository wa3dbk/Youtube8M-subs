great about Indies is that they don't

gives<00:00:15.240> them<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> flexibility<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.080> really

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
gives them the flexibility to really

really try new things indie video games
are<00:00:18.210> really<00:00:18.390> helping<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.750> think<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.050> push<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
are really helping I think to push the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.500 
are really helping I think to push the
boundaries<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.369> game<00:00:20.520> design<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:21.119> these<00:00:21.359> are

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
boundaries of game design in these are

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.330 
boundaries of game design in these are
pretty<00:00:21.750> much<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.109> saviors<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.560> video<00:00:22.980> games

in<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> beginning<00:00:29.820> video<00:00:30.119> games<00:00:30.480> were

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
in the beginning video games were

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.389 
in the beginning video games were
actually<00:00:31.170> independent<00:00:31.740> ventures<00:00:32.040> they

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
actually independent ventures they

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.160 
actually independent ventures they
started<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:32.940> people's<00:00:33.420> basements<00:00:33.660> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
started out in people's basements and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.110 
started out in people's basements and
garages<00:00:34.350> these<00:00:35.040> were<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.520> two-man<00:00:35.820> teams

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
garages these were one and two-man teams

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.270 
garages these were one and two-man teams
and<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:36.780> video<00:00:36.989> games<00:00:37.350> got<00:00:37.559> huge<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.219> you

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and then video games got huge and you

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.770 
and then video games got huge and you
ended<00:00:38.550> up<00:00:38.610> having<00:00:38.790> hundreds<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.510> people

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
ended up having hundreds of people

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.330 
ended up having hundreds of people
working<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.140> single<00:00:40.469> title<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.890> think<00:00:41.219> what's

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
working on a single title I think what's

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.619 
working on a single title I think what's
great<00:00:41.430> about<00:00:41.550> independent<00:00:42.090> video<00:00:42.270> games<00:00:42.450> now

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
great about independent video games now

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.880 
great about independent video games now
is<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.930> you're<00:00:43.050> seeing<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.320> return<00:00:43.680> to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
is that you're seeing this return to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.830 
is that you're seeing this return to
really<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:44.399> small<00:00:44.700> teams<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.300> teams<00:00:45.539> under

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
really really small teams so teams under

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.240 
really really small teams so teams under
the<00:00:45.960> size<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.289> ten<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.649> think<00:00:46.800> one<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the size of ten I think one of the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.130 
the size of ten I think one of the
biggest<00:00:47.430> problems<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> past<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.870> Indies

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
biggest problems in the past for Indies

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.959

Microsoft or Sony that process is going

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.360 
Microsoft or Sony that process is going
to<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> lot<00:00:55.469> longer<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.070> might<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.340> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to be a lot longer you might have a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
exciting is that it's not the difference

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.070 
exciting is that it's not the difference
between<00:01:17.850> me<00:01:18.240> purchasing<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.960> not

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
between me purchasing it and not

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.359 
between me purchasing it and not
purchasing<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.799> really<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.070> difference

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
purchasing it it's really a difference

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.770 
purchasing it it's really a difference
between<00:01:20.640> something<00:01:20.880> existing<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.659> not

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
between something existing and not

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.179 
between something existing and not
existing<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.619> that's<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.950> really

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
existing and I think that's a really

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.499 
existing and I think that's a really
exciting<00:01:23.400> thing<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:23.759> independent<00:01:24.420> game

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
exciting thing for independent game

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.860 
exciting thing for independent game

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
bouncing off enemies these are mechanics

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.110 
bouncing off enemies these are mechanics
this<00:01:32.950> is<00:01:33.010> different<00:01:33.520> than<00:01:33.640> something<00:01:33.940> like

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
this is different than something like

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.570 
this is different than something like
having<00:01:34.630> three<00:01:34.870> lives<00:01:35.200> which<00:01:35.620> is<00:01:35.800> a<00:01:35.830> rule<00:01:36.130> but

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
having three lives which is a rule but

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.340 
having three lives which is a rule but
it's<00:01:36.760> not<00:01:36.910> particularly<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:37.720> mechanic<00:01:38.230> because

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
it's not particularly a mechanic because

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.900 
it's not particularly a mechanic because
it<00:01:38.620> doesn't<00:01:38.890> push<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.340> towards<00:01:39.760> the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
it doesn't push you towards the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.280 
it doesn't push you towards the
interaction<00:01:40.510> in<00:01:40.660> the<00:01:40.750> game<00:01:40.930> on<00:01:41.230> a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
interaction in the game on a

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.620 
interaction in the game on a
moment-to-moment<00:01:42.070> basis<00:01:42.850> for<00:01:43.210> me<00:01:43.420> the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
moment-to-moment basis for me the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.900 
moment-to-moment basis for me the
mechanics<00:01:43.780> in<00:01:44.230> the<00:01:44.320> game<00:01:44.350> are<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:45.190> small

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
mechanics in the game are the small

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.540 
mechanics in the game are the small
systems<00:01:46.510> that<00:01:46.900> lead<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:48.010> emotional

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
systems that lead to the emotional

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.370 
systems that lead to the emotional
feeling<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.940> get<00:01:49.120> from<00:01:49.360> playing<00:01:49.600> game<00:01:49.930> what

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
feeling you get from playing game what

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.110 
feeling you get from playing game what
you<00:01:50.470> really<00:01:50.710> want<00:01:51.070> when<00:01:51.220> you<00:01:51.340> have<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.550> game<00:01:51.820> is

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
you really want when you have a game is

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.840 
you really want when you have a game is
systemic<00:01:52.930> significance<00:01:53.830> learning<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.670> it's

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
systemic significance learning that it's

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.240 
systemic significance learning that it's
okay<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.479> try<00:01:55.780> again<00:01:55.930> in<00:01:56.260> certain<00:01:56.590> context

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
okay to try again in certain context

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.160 
okay to try again in certain context
learning<00:01:57.910> how<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.360> approach<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.960> situation

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
learning how to approach a situation

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.170 
learning how to approach a situation
where<00:01:59.800> you're<00:01:59.950> uncomfortable<00:02:00.729> because<00:02:00.910> the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
where you're uncomfortable because the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.940 
where you're uncomfortable because the
games<00:02:01.420> making<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:01.960> uncomfortable<00:02:02.110> but<00:02:02.770> you

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
games making you uncomfortable but you

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.950 
games making you uncomfortable but you
decide<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.640> you're<00:02:03.940> going<00:02:04.150> to<00:02:04.270> tackle<00:02:04.780> it

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
decide that you're going to tackle it

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.620 
decide that you're going to tackle it
anyway<00:02:05.470> that's<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.580> purest<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.540> most

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
anyway that's the purest and most

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.169 
anyway that's the purest and most
exciting<00:02:08.259> motivation<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.040> system<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.580> I

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
exciting motivation of a system and I

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.910 
exciting motivation of a system and I
think<00:02:10.270> indie<00:02:10.810> video<00:02:10.899> games<00:02:11.320> have<00:02:11.709> the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
think indie video games have the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.470 
think indie video games have the
possibility<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.580> create<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.330> most

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
possibility to create the most

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.330 
possibility to create the most
interesting<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.230> unique<00:02:14.350> systems<00:02:14.950> because

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
interesting and unique systems because

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.090 
interesting and unique systems because
they're<00:02:15.850> driven<00:02:16.209> by<00:02:16.390> want<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.590> make<00:02:17.800> something

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
they're driven by want to make something

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.100 
they're driven by want to make something
and<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.790> express<00:02:19.209> yourself

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.830 

I<00:02:22.520> feel<00:02:23.520> like<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> lot<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:23.940> Triple<00:02:24.540> A<00:02:24.600> games

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
I feel like a lot of Triple A games

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.630 
I feel like a lot of Triple A games
approach<00:02:25.320> sound<00:02:25.620> design<00:02:25.920> from<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:26.520> a

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
approach sound design from just a

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.120 
approach sound design from just a

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
hyper-realistic perspective where as a

hyper-realistic perspective where as a
big<00:02:29.490> thing<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:29.730> indie<00:02:30.150> games<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.780> v<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.530> tone

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
big thing for indie games is v and tone

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.770 
big thing for indie games is v and tone
and<00:02:31.980> thinking<00:02:32.460> about<00:02:32.550> how<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.940> want<00:02:33.300> player<00:02:33.660> to

feel and what kind of feel I want the
music<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.640> convey<00:02:36.000> sort<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.840> like<00:02:36.960> an<00:02:37.080> animated

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
music to convey sort of like an animated

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.080 
music to convey sort of like an animated
film<00:02:37.710> or<00:02:37.920> something<00:02:38.100> you're<00:02:38.430> responsible<00:02:39.030> for

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
film or something you're responsible for

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.690 
film or something you're responsible for
the<00:02:39.660> entire<00:02:40.020> soundscape<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:41.340> not<00:02:41.550> like

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
the entire soundscape it's not like

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.400 
the entire soundscape it's not like
there's<00:02:41.880> any<00:02:42.030> physical<00:02:42.660> space<00:02:42.960> that<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.230> game

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
there's any physical space that the game

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.870 
there's any physical space that the game
is<00:02:43.530> taking<00:02:43.650> place<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.610> create

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
is taking place in so you have to create

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.420 
is taking place in so you have to create
all<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.390> from<00:02:45.660> scratch<00:02:45.900> for<00:02:46.530> Bastion<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.250> lot

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
all that from scratch for Bastion a lot

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.650 
all that from scratch for Bastion a lot
of<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.610> took<00:02:47.730> place<00:02:47.850> on<00:02:48.060> like<00:02:48.180> floating

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
of it took place on like floating

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.500 
of it took place on like floating
islands<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.410> sky<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.520> yeah<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:50.850> had<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.330> make

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
islands in the sky so yeah I had to make

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.880 
islands in the sky so yeah I had to make
up<00:02:51.660> what<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.840> would<00:02:52.020> sound<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.560> I

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
up what that would sound like and I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.410 
up what that would sound like and I
asked<00:02:53.190> myself<00:02:53.340> really<00:02:53.760> weird<00:02:54.000> questions

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
asked myself really weird questions

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.090 
asked myself really weird questions
throughout<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.840> process<00:02:55.440> like<00:02:55.650> what<00:02:55.920> does<00:02:56.040> it

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
throughout the process like what does it

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.770 
throughout the process like what does it
sound<00:02:56.430> like<00:02:56.520> when<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.910> hit<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.150> genie<00:02:57.510> with<00:02:57.750> a

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
sound like when you hit a genie with a

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.430 
sound like when you hit a genie with a
hammer<00:02:59.180> like<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.330> had<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.540> figure<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.110> out<00:03:01.260> you

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
hammer like I had to figure that out you

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.110 
hammer like I had to figure that out you
know<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.459> have<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.670> make<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.090> that

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
know so you have to make it so that

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.000 
know so you have to make it so that
it'll<00:03:03.570> play<00:03:04.140> over<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.470> over<00:03:04.560> again<00:03:04.770> without

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
it'll play over and over again without

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.860 
it'll play over and over again without
the<00:03:05.190> player<00:03:05.459> either<00:03:05.850> getting<00:03:06.330> sick<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.780> or

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
the player either getting sick of it or

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.300 
the player either getting sick of it or
even<00:03:06.900> really<00:03:07.350> noticing<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:07.860> it's<00:03:08.010> happening

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
even really noticing that it's happening

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.800 
even really noticing that it's happening
and<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.610> swing<00:03:08.820> your<00:03:08.910> hammer<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.360> sound<00:03:09.660> has

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
and you swing your hammer that sound has

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.449 
and you swing your hammer that sound has
to<00:03:09.959> be<00:03:10.050> like<00:03:10.170> really<00:03:10.440> satisfying<00:03:11.130> here

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
to be like really satisfying here

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.380
