00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.799
 alif seated at the pradettes was verbalized for wearing the facial veil 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.269
 following this event, about ten people took to the streets 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.880
 to support her immediately to police cars and bikers are 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.000

 how this control took place that they do their job 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.919
 but not that way there is a respect for the human 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.599
 not the way to be hotel the way to be she is disrespectful 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.279
 towards the other not even four cars and three bikers are not 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.680
 deigned the adq could eventually hinder on the side of the police it is said that the 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:38.620
 procedure is justified of course the stubborn commander 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.379
 from the intervention patrol to other senior officials 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.640
 for this immediately requires two vehicle reconciliations too 

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:45.240
 often 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.150
 we are a small event to lead him by promising a molotovs cocktails 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.160
 for products killed for this kind of scenario so we take all 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.420
 provisions for intervening in security second actor the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.940
 audiovisual technician from the school filmed the scene 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.180
 according to his testimony under the pretext he does not carry his papers on him 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.530
 while they are in his office he is taken to the police station where we are 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.490
 obliged to pass these images indeed today as a result of you confirming 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.660
 in any case filming is not what caused the fact 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.640
 to bring the person and again we were on a check 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.919
 identity 

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:17.389
 each time will be precise and the police are professionals they 

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:20.109
 know to what extent they verbalize off interpellates where he 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.659
 brings back people to the third act posts the professors of 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.289
 school come in front of the mouthpiece station to display their 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.459
 solidarity with their colleagues the picture of prayer makes the front page of the 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:29.080
 press 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.750
 no provocation according to the school it was time for the religious rite in 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.520
 this case the police union said they did not have a directive to do 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.150
 of the figure in verbalizing unlawfully includes the full veil 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
 in the Muslim school we feel he is not touching the soul 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.200
 something that is you saying to be able to slap on the backs of Muslims 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.760
 and as pointed out by the crif the Muslims in France today 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.600
 the place of the judge follows from the time 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.380
 it was to see him in 2004 in public schools now the niqab the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.409
 question of the woman who often comes back the question of the simple returns often the 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:04.910
 question we ask ourselves at the goal 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.140
 what's next and what are they really looking for other issues 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.329
 arises since it's a patrol was sent yesterday 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.199
 it's because the police were required, that is, they responded 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.319
 to a request what some might call denunciation 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.669
 who remembered this person will she again until when
