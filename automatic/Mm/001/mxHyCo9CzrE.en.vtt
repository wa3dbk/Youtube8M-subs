be<00:03:29.910> right<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.900> gives<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:31.440> smell

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
be right and that gives it the smell

I believe blondes would use the
chamomile<00:04:31.700> to<00:04:32.700> give<00:04:32.880> their<00:04:33.090> hair<00:04:33.270> highlights

chamomile to give their hair highlights

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.310 
chamomile to give their hair highlights
so<00:04:36.000> chamomile<00:04:36.479> instead<00:04:36.750> of<00:04:36.840> rats

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
so chamomile instead of rats

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.340 
so chamomile instead of rats
I<00:04:37.350> mean<00:04:37.800> rosemary<00:04:38.570> instead<00:04:39.570> of<00:04:39.690> roses<00:04:40.110> you
