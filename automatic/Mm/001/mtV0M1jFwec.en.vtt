00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello we are the 29 march 2014 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.730
 and as you can see I have 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.000
 the chance to have a greenhouse I grow 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.509
 now on muls and on composts 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.830
 plants 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.890
 I will try to explain to you 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.029
 how does it work we go first 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.029
 do a quick review 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.830
 so for information the soil of this 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.529
 greenhouse has not been worked since two 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.009
 years it means I have not returned 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.250
 the earth I simply added either 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.710
 vegetable waste like straws 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.840
 hay tons of grass and so on or 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.719
 vegetable compost from the compass of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.160
 green waste that I buy in a 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.110
 composting center 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.200
 it is a compost that was approved in 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.570
 organic farming and because it 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.300
 is free of sludge from the stations 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.129
 purification and secondly it heated 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.469
 at about 70 degrees which makes it 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.930
 is grain example so here we are going to you 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.940
 take an example on this board on 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.400
 this board we can see a great 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.020
 diversity of things me I do not I 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.950
 do not remove plants that want 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.810
 to grow all alone 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.490
 and then I'm just trying to promote 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.320
 the shoot of the one that interests me 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.920
 more so we'll take a few 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.030
 examples 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.439
 so first example here the spinach 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.030
 so that's a spinach plan a foot 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.210
 of spinach and as we can see 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.170
 the board we are covered to sow 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.420
 on this board 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.820
 in fact I simply covered 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.280
 green waste compost so the earth 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.920
 is never left bare and then I 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.329
 sowed the seeds on the fly on the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.980
 plank spinach seeds a small 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.150
 shortly before winter and then it's 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.530
 I simply covered them 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.810
 also some compost from 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.780
 green waste then I confess to 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.660
 way maybe very uniform which 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.620
 does you see that there are different 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.600
 different sizes different inches 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.570
 for example here we see very young 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.050
 shoots while there are spinach that 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.610
 are already willing formed where March 29 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.250
 it's been over two months now 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.160
 used in spinach in the greenhouse 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.790
 and so as you can see my c 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.940
 cut it is that repels beets 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.980
 center were sown there is also 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.330
 like I sow on the fly it's a 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.220
 problem as you can see 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.660
 there are extremely few weeds 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.020
 so I do not like the bad term 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.790
 herbs 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.650
 there is extremely little wait-and-see attitude in 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.440
 weeds that are painful and that 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.780
 I still remove the readings in 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.750
 especially because they will be little 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.840
 quickly completely invade the board 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.370
 this is this second board is also 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.500
 a good example of what we can do 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.930
 on composts of green waste so 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.900
 there as we can see we are 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.190
 with a number of plans there ya 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.560
 also a nice read I'm going 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.870
 snatched here there is a beet 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.440
 here there are leeks bordering 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.800
 each board 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.480
 in fact my organization is that I 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.940
 put all the alliaceous on the sides 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.260
 because it's like we can 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.720
 notice the boards in a form of 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.070
 but it is slightly rounded and the 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.980
 alliaceae are the plants that claims 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.690
 the least water so we put them rather 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.920
 on the sides and watering is done 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.300
 only middle of the board 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.120
 so as you can see there is 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.360
 a great diversity here for example 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.920
 these are the onions here at the salads 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.730
 that I transplanted from the board next door 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.270
 there we see an eye to lady 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:33.650
 do not hesitate to let it grow 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.600
 another is crazy here otherwise 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.830
 goes all around there are onions then 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.880
 I started transplanting seedlings 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.350
 tomatoes 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.470
 there are not tomatoes that I have 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.810
 produced 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.820
 even I bought them at the state of plans 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.170
 because you would have to have a greenhouse 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.740
 heated to make plans too 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.990
 as big as that so how do 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.570
 for to sow all these plants me 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.490
 I just keep as we can 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.260
 to see here these are the escaroles 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.090
 I kept the seeds of the year 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.340
 former 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.540
 I let them hang in the greenhouse 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.730
 and then from time to time but I have 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.520
 shaken the seed package sure but on 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.000
 my goals 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.650
 we will move then that's a good 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.840
 board example it can do a little 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.660
 clutter but overall there to 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.340
 on it are leeks and the 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.710
 leeks they were sown all 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.790
 simply by using heads of 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:30.120
 leek which we see that remains here 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.940
 flowers in leek feast see I 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.860
 just shook them on the board 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.270
 and that it gave me everything 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.860
 there we see that in some places these 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.440
 same traders if a complete flower that 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.540
 had to fall here always is it that I 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.669
 will soon get leeks that 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.690
 will allow me to do all my 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.980
 transplanting on the board opposite 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.650
 for once we are not on a 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.740
 compost culture one is on a 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.850
 culture on match so mauges luche 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.479
 finally we call it as we want or 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:03.060
 plant cover makes it the idea it's 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.440
 that it's a number of plants 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.160
 for example potatoes which is 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:13.290
 here can very well crossed the layer 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:15.000
 de munch is pushed underneath no 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.470
 when we put a munch 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.320
 here the earth finally is clearly in 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.930
 below and the different weeds do not 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.370
 not push so we keep this this 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.240
 layer that has two advantages 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.830
 when we put the match before autumn 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.880
 so especially outside in the greenhouse it's a 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.210
 little bit different because it takes 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.790
 water 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.470
 but what will happen is that of the 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.290
 same way as in the soil of a forest 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:44.520
 actually the earthworms every 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.260
 different insects will come by in 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.860
 underneath by the earth and will come 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.940
 eat break down the plant waste 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.800
 so they will create a 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.910
 circulation they are going to roam 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.840
 completely soil 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.270
 that's why we do not need 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.410
 to work the soil is there the soil did 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.170
 not been worked potatoes 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.150
 are we simply dismiss the match on 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.070
 bites the potatoes pretty much 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.110
 four or five centimeters deep 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.740
 but it sinks all alone and then 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.540
 then behind but we put the mulch back 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.250
 here we can see spontaneously that 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.290
 number of plants with 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.710
 Severe enough seeds can come 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.240
 even through the mulching that by 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.690
 example these are things that had to 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.390
 beets 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:30.440
 here they are beasts he died on 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:33.120
 a board like this one we also see 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.640
 the succession of different cultures 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.020
 it's really not a problem from 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.250
 the moment we are on a compost of 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.080
 green waste to cultivate different 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.400
 species our there then maybe it's 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.710
 not yet on this board where are we going 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.710
 better to drink it we'll go see it on 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.420
 the next board on the board 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.490
 next 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:56.210
 in fact we will see that in the middle of 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.560
 salads there are carrots 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:02.010
 just before he has to stay 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.840
 one or two there were radishes so 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:07.680
 finally if we look good we make a 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.870
 sowing group is both carrots 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.490
 take a very long time to get out of 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.710
 salads that take a little less time to 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.780
 going out will help says they come out very 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.460
 quickly as one pulls away 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.669
 the radishes finally we will do 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.050
 thinning plants at the same time 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:23.190
 salads and as we go 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.080
 tear the salad plants off 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.660
 instead carrots and therefore this 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.150
 there on the same culture on the same goal 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.410
 we can 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.440
 how would I say to really have 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:36.460
 different cultures so if ever the 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.460
 sony was not very
