just<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.579> if<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.850> person<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.239> gonna<00:01:00.390> lose

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
just like if a person was gonna lose

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.240 
just like if a person was gonna lose
weight<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.559> cut<00:01:01.770> back<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.129> that

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
weight you have to cut back on that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.950 
weight you have to cut back on that
calories<00:01:02.489> each<00:01:02.850> day<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.270> they<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.750> lose

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
calories each day so they can lose

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.109 
calories each day so they can lose
weight<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.129> same<00:01:05.309> principle<00:01:05.760> applies<00:01:05.909> if

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
weight so the same principle applies if

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
weight so the same principle applies if
you<00:01:06.210> want<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.570> gain<00:01:07.290> weight<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.920> eat

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
you want to gain weight you have to eat

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.310 
you want to gain weight you have to eat
more<00:01:08.520> if<00:01:09.299> you're<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.630> eating<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> don't
