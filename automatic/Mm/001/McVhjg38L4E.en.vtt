00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
we just want to grind these up a little

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.920 
we just want to grind these up a little
bit<00:01:51.470> not<00:01:51.800> so<00:01:52.040> they're<00:01:52.190> super<00:01:52.820> fine<00:01:53.030> next<00:01:53.780> we

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
bit not so they're super fine next we

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:02.710 
bit not so they're super fine next we
need<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:55.720> teaspoon<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:56.900> a<00:01:56.960> half<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.650> cumin<00:02:01.720> this

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
need a teaspoon and a half of cumin this

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.050 
need a teaspoon and a half of cumin this
is<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.020> product<00:02:03.590> called<00:02:03.830> nama<00:02:04.340> shoyu<00:02:04.610> which<00:02:04.910> is

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
is a product called nama shoyu which is

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.230 
is a product called nama shoyu which is
an<00:02:05.180> unpasteurized<00:02:05.930> soy<00:02:06.140> sauce<00:02:06.440> and<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:08.090> is

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
an unpasteurized soy sauce and this is

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.999 
an unpasteurized soy sauce and this is
going<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.290> going<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.470> be<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.679> binder

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
going to this is going to be the binder

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.970 
going to this is going to be the binder
that<00:02:10.160> holds<00:02:10.429> holds<00:02:10.910> this<00:02:11.120> mixture<00:02:11.450> together

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
that holds holds this mixture together

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.390 
that holds holds this mixture together
why<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.160> better<00:02:13.520> than<00:02:13.640> regular<00:02:14.630> self

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
why is that better than regular self

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.060 
why is that better than regular self
first<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.460> all<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.730> organic<00:02:17.180> and

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
first of all this is organic and

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.770 
first of all this is organic and
secondly<00:02:19.070> it's<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:19.790> unpasteurized<00:02:20.570> which

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
secondly it's it's unpasteurized which

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.300 
secondly it's it's unpasteurized which
means<00:02:20.990> it's<00:02:21.110> never<00:02:21.290> been<00:02:21.500> exposed<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.100> high

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
means it's never been exposed to high

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.699 
means it's never been exposed to high
heat<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.300> has<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.810> lot<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.200> nutritional

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
heat so it has a lot of the nutritional

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.320 
heat so it has a lot of the nutritional
properties<00:02:24.890> still<00:02:25.370> intact<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:26.180> that's

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
properties still intact and that's

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.530 
properties still intact and that's
that's<00:02:26.630> really<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.310> whole<00:02:28.310> basis<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.330> what

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
that's really the whole basis of of what

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.050 
that's really the whole basis of of what
we're<00:02:29.660> doing<00:02:29.690> here<00:02:29.900> with<00:02:30.020> raw<00:02:30.170> food<00:02:31.060> taking

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
we're doing here with raw food taking

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.850 
we're doing here with raw food taking
food<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.690> way<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:32.990> was<00:02:33.550> grown<00:02:34.550> initially<00:02:35.090> and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
food the way it was grown initially and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.290 
food the way it was grown initially and
yeah<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.160> just<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.550> just<00:02:37.580> not<00:02:38.030> doing

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
yeah and just and just not doing

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.090 
yeah and just and just not doing
anything<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.720> or<00:02:38.840> not<00:02:39.010> minimizing<00:02:40.010> the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
anything to or not minimizing the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.979 
anything to or not minimizing the
processing<00:02:40.640> so<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.690> still

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
processing so that so that it still

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.540 
processing so that so that it still
maintains<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.590> nutritional<00:02:43.160> properties

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
maintains the nutritional properties

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.370 
maintains the nutritional properties
that<00:02:43.850> it<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:44.150> began<00:02:44.420> with<00:02:44.600> in<00:02:44.780> vitamins

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
that it that it began with in vitamins

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.210 
that it that it began with in vitamins
and<00:02:45.560> minerals<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.720> enzymes<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.410> then

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
and minerals and the enzymes and then

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.910 
and minerals and the enzymes and then
this<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:49.400> for<00:02:49.760> ingredients<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:51.410> it's<00:02:51.590> taken

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
this is for ingredients and it's taken

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.390 
this is for ingredients and it's taken
us<00:02:52.239> two<00:02:53.239> minutes<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.660> make<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:55.220> notion

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
us two minutes to make so the notion

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.370 
us two minutes to make so the notion
that<00:02:55.730> raw<00:02:55.910> food<00:02:56.120> has<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.300> be<00:02:56.510> very<00:02:57.080> labor

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
that raw food has to be very labor

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.310 
that raw food has to be very labor
intensive<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.540> asked<00:02:59.540> it's<00:02:59.660> easier<00:03:00.110> than

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
intensive and and asked it's easier than

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.560 
intensive and and asked it's easier than
cooking<00:03:00.620> right<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.220> mean<00:03:01.400> we're<00:03:02.300> not<00:03:02.360> going<00:03:02.510> to

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
cooking right I mean we're not going to

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.530 
cooking right I mean we're not going to
burn<00:03:02.660> ourselves<00:03:02.780> tonight<00:03:03.470> hey<00:03:04.540> everybody's

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
burn ourselves tonight hey everybody's

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.740 
burn ourselves tonight hey everybody's
everybody's<00:03:05.840> heard<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.380> walnuts<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.750> soy

everybody's heard of walnuts and and soy
sauce<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.110> spices<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:09.830> it's<00:03:10.220> not<00:03:10.370> the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
sauce and spices so it's not the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.170 
sauce and spices so it's not the
ingredients<00:03:12.110> are<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.890> walnuts<00:03:13.310> raw<00:03:13.700> not

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
ingredients are so the walnuts raw not

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.420 
ingredients are so the walnuts raw not
roasted<00:03:14.780> or<00:03:14.959> solve<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.440> right<00:03:15.680> exactly<00:03:15.920> so

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
roasted or solve it right exactly so

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.800 
roasted or solve it right exactly so
that's<00:03:16.580> that's<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.090> that's<00:03:17.239> done<00:03:17.480> that's<00:03:17.690> our

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
that's that's it that's done that's our

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.220 
that's that's it that's done that's our
first<00:03:17.989> that's<00:03:18.620> our<00:03:18.739> first<00:03:18.980> part
