00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.860
 in this video I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.349
 a pencil case or box for 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.349
 put your school supplies I hope that 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.690
 like it is very easy original simple 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:17.680
 and recycled good the materials that 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.620
 we will use to make this case 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:26.280
 good are the following 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.280
 two bags of chips of the same size 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:35.020
 carlton that is thin that as a measure 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.020
 must measure 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:46.470
 the length of the bag 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:48.340
 by about 6 centimeters wide 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.370
 okay 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.760
 the length of the turn 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.420
 we are also going to use a glue 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.420
 that hits well 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.630
 scissors 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.870
 a stapler with staples obviously 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.820
 material to line and I'm using 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:12.510
 the newspaper to make it notice much more 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.020
 recycling 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020
 Y 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.469
 good velcro let's see how you do it 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.810
 first thing we're going to do is take a 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:25.109
 of the bags and we're going to flatten it very 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.109
 all right 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.540
 since we tested what we're going to do 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.960
 we take the scissors 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.640
 and what we are going to do is cut 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.850
 that part 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.850
 the shore is ok 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.710
 and here we cut 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.380
 let's take it stapler and let's 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.399
 record this part where it was open 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.399
 the bag is 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.480
 we will have something left for you 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.480
 okay 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.850
 Let's go see with the other bag 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.900
 good since we had done what we're going 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.129
 to do 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:42.950
 is to line the two rounds already previously 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:45.200
 made and we're going to line the cardboard 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.690
 with the blade magazine or what 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.220
 you have wanted to cover the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.220
 we lined up but thanks to something like that 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.430
 another doubt that something like that either 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.430
 previously lined 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.900
 Now what we are going to do is paste the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.709
 two bags 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.709
 stick them 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.380
 let's apply glue 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.280
 quite 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.280
 and we paste 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.689
 and we will have something like that 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.470
 since it is something like that what we are going to do 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.450
 is to take the cardboard 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.500
 and on one side of the bags 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.800
 suppose it was like that the cartridge case 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.880
 then the back 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.880
 let's paste 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.370
 the rectangle that measures just like this 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.370
 part and we're going to paste it 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.129
 like a centimeter here 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.670
 only as a type I will know how to apply a 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.670
 little glue 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.160
 we stick 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.010
 we turn around and that part we close it like that 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.699
 we mark well 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.470
 and we will now have the only thing that 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.470
 lack is to put the micro 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.669
 okay 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.669
 and let's stick 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.560
 why 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.990
 and who believe 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:18.150
 we will have left this 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.420
 with space to put what we 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.210
 we want 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.610
 it is an idea the truth that is quite 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.610
 original I hope this video has them 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:31.090
 liked and that put into practice the 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.740
 truth is that it is quite ingenious and 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.590
 good if this video you liked it 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.320
 forget that this video is given to me 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.620
 like to comment if it seemed good 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.090
 idea or if they will take them into account 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.400
 forget they can go through my channel
