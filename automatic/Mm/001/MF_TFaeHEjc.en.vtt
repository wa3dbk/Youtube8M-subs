00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
chains in here years ago and this pipe

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.639 
chains in here years ago and this pipe
to<00:00:32.520> sort<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.239> hold<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.570> together<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.140> it's

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
to sort of hold it together but it's

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.319 
to sort of hold it together but it's
completely<00:00:34.800> ripped<00:00:35.460> right<00:00:35.700> off<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.969> the

bottom<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.750> car<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:38.010> see<00:00:38.190> that

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
bottom of the car and you can see that

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.600 
bottom of the car and you can see that
the<00:00:38.579> control<00:00:39.300> arms<00:00:39.660> were<00:00:40.340> ripped<00:00:41.340> right<00:00:41.579> out

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the control arms were ripped right out

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.790 
the control arms were ripped right out
of<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.969> floor<00:00:42.210> structure<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.620> there's

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
of the floor structure so there's

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.270 
of the floor structure so there's
nothing<00:00:44.129> holding<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.640> together<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:46.280> see
