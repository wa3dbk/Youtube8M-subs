00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
chopping an onion takes no time at all

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.639 
chopping an onion takes no time at all
and<00:01:42.299> by<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.509> way<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> trick<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.500> your

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and by the way a trick to not have your

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.859 
and by the way a trick to not have your
eyes<00:01:43.770> water<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.520> keep<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.850> mouth<00:01:44.970> closed

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
eyes water is to keep your mouth closed

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.929 
eyes water is to keep your mouth closed
while<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.770> chop<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.159> onion<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.579> didn't<00:01:47.850> learn

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
while you chop the onion I didn't learn

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.090 
while you chop the onion I didn't learn
that<00:01:48.000> until<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.290> few<00:01:49.500> weeks<00:01:49.590> ago<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.009> it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that until like a few weeks ago and it

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.969 
that until like a few weeks ago and it
works<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.450> chop<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.780> your<00:01:51.810> onion<00:01:51.990> saute

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
works so you chop up your onion saute
