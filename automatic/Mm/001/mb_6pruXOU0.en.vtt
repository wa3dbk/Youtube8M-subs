with<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.750> profit<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:34.550> since<00:02:35.030> we<00:02:35.209> have

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
with the profit and so since we have

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.229

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.220 
to 1910 it contains 24 grams of silver
just<00:03:13.760> like<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.060> American<00:03:14.420> dollar<00:03:14.600> in<00:03:14.870> fact

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.860 
just like the American dollar in fact
the<00:03:16.010> American<00:03:16.430> dollar<00:03:16.700> rose<00:03:17.690> modeled<00:03:18.530> upon<00:03:18.859> a

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
the American dollar rose modeled upon a

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.780 
the American dollar rose modeled upon a

sampling of these coins by Thomas

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.940 
sampling of these coins by Thomas
Jefferson<00:03:24.069> so<00:03:25.359> this<00:03:26.359> is<00:03:26.510> what<00:03:26.660> happened<00:03:27.079> this

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
Jefferson so this is what happened this

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.620

we had a silver coin but that only

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.660 
we had a silver coin but that only
lasted<00:03:53.450> three<00:03:54.019> years<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:55.130> same<00:03:55.370> thing

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
lasted three years the same thing

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.010 
lasted three years the same thing
happened<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.209> it<00:03:56.329> then<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:57.459> silver<00:03:58.459> price

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
happened to it then the silver price

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.250 
happened to it then the silver price
rose<00:04:00.410> up<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.280> exceeded<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.150> value<00:04:02.390> of<00:04:03.020> the

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
circulation we've had been some attempts

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.100 
circulation we've had been some attempts
at<00:05:03.770> putting<00:05:03.950> 25<00:05:04.700> peso<00:05:05.270> coins<00:05:05.870> into

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
at putting 25 peso coins into

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.680 
at putting 25 peso coins into
circulation<00:05:06.740> with<00:05:07.130> silver<00:05:07.520> and<00:05:07.670> 100<00:05:08.480> peso

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.830 
circulation with silver and 100 peso
coins<00:05:09.050> but<00:05:09.980> even<00:05:10.100> those<00:05:10.490> I've<00:05:10.940> had<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.450> go<00:05:11.600> out

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
coins but even those I've had to go out

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.750 
coins but even those I've had to go out
of<00:05:12.020> circulation<00:05:12.230> because<00:05:12.800> silver<00:05:13.280> keeps<00:05:13.550> on

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
of circulation because silver keeps on

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.150 
of circulation because silver keeps on
rising<00:05:14.120> in<00:05:14.510> price<00:05:14.810> this<00:05:15.440> same<00:05:15.680> process

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
rising in price this same process

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.880 
rising in price this same process
happened<00:05:16.910> all<00:05:17.060> over<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.390> world<00:05:17.540> so<00:05:18.170> you<00:05:18.680> see

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
happened all over the world so you see

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.680 
happened all over the world so you see
if<00:05:19.070> we're<00:05:19.250> going<00:05:19.400> to<00:05:19.490> have<00:05:19.700> a<00:05:19.730> silver<00:05:20.150> coin<00:05:20.480> in

if we're going to have a silver coin in
circulation<00:05:21.200> the<00:05:22.040> first<00:05:22.340> thing<00:05:22.640> that<00:05:22.670> we<00:05:23.030> must

circulation the first thing that we must

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.860 
circulation the first thing that we must
do<00:05:23.630> is<00:05:24.160> realize<00:05:25.160> that<00:05:25.580> it<00:05:25.910> cannot<00:05:26.210> have<00:05:26.600> an

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
plate of the seventy two percent coin is

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.790 
plate of the seventy two percent coin is
the<00:06:15.300> same<00:06:15.540> as<00:06:15.720> over<00:06:15.990> here<00:06:16.139> on<00:06:16.230> the<00:06:16.320> other<00:06:16.350> chart

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
the same as over here on the other chart

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.870 
the same as over here on the other chart
and<00:06:17.060> it<00:06:18.060> shows<00:06:18.360> that<00:06:19.139> the<00:06:19.950> fall<00:06:20.280> in<00:06:20.700> the<00:06:20.850> value

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
and it shows that the fall in the value

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.740 
and it shows that the fall in the value
of<00:06:21.450> silver<00:06:21.990> did<00:06:22.650> not<00:06:22.980> affect<00:06:23.580> the<00:06:23.940> monetary

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
of silver did not affect the monetary

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.129 
of silver did not affect the monetary
value<00:06:25.260> of<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.620> one<00:06:25.830> peso<00:06:26.130> coin<00:06:26.750> I'll<00:06:27.750> repeat

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
value of the one peso coin I'll repeat

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.610 
value of the one peso coin I'll repeat
that<00:06:28.200> the<00:06:29.010> fall<00:06:29.460> in<00:06:29.820> the<00:06:29.940> value<00:06:29.970> of<00:06:30.570> silver<00:06:31.110> did

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
that the fall in the value of silver did

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.850 
that the fall in the value of silver did
not<00:06:31.889> affect<00:06:32.550> the<00:06:32.820> monetary<00:06:33.750> value<00:06:34.290> of<00:06:34.500> the<00:06:34.650> one

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
not affect the monetary value of the one

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.760 
not affect the monetary value of the one
peso<00:06:35.220> coin<00:06:36.979> so<00:06:38.060> you<00:06:39.060> can<00:06:39.270> have<00:06:39.479> a<00:06:39.720> coin<00:06:40.139> in

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
peso coin so you can have a coin in

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.730 
peso coin so you can have a coin in
circulation<00:06:41.479> whose<00:06:42.479> intrinsic<00:06:43.169> value<00:06:43.560> the

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
circulation whose intrinsic value the

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.900 
circulation whose intrinsic value the
party<00:06:44.070> do<00:06:44.630> Falls<00:06:45.630> that<00:06:46.340> you<00:06:47.340> cannot<00:06:47.639> have<00:06:47.880> a

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
party do Falls that you cannot have a

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.090 
party do Falls that you cannot have a
coin<00:06:48.210> in<00:06:48.389> circulation<00:06:48.870> once<00:06:49.290> the<00:06:49.470> circuit<00:06:49.889> the

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 
coin in circulation once the circuit the

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.780 
coin in circulation once the circuit the
intrinsic<00:06:50.910> value<00:06:51.240> exceeds<00:06:51.810> the<00:06:52.790> nominal

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:53.790 
intrinsic value exceeds the nominal

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.580 
intrinsic value exceeds the nominal
value<00:06:54.740> solution<00:06:56.030> not<00:06:57.030> to<00:06:57.330> have<00:06:57.600> an<00:06:58.200> engraved

value solution not to have an engraved

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.190 
value solution not to have an engraved
value<00:06:59.720> so<00:07:00.720> this<00:07:00.990> point<00:07:02.479> this<00:07:03.479> will<00:07:03.690> the<00:07:03.930> little

value so this point this will the little

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.770 
value so this point this will the little
silver<00:07:04.380> liberty<00:07:05.130> or<00:07:05.280> leave<00:07:05.460> it<00:07:05.580> that<00:07:05.610> coin<00:07:06.000> of
