00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
close to max stability really cool so

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.470 
close to max stability really cool so
that's<00:01:08.800> going<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:08.980> reduce<00:01:09.100> your<00:01:09.280> recoil<00:01:09.820> on<00:01:10.150> we

rifles<00:01:58.690> but<00:01:58.960> maybe<00:01:59.200> this<00:01:59.409> with<00:01:59.680> this<00:01:59.830> one<00:02:00.010> it

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
rifles but maybe this with this one it

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.100 
rifles but maybe this with this one it
could<00:02:00.310> work<00:02:00.520> fairly<00:02:00.760> well<00:02:00.880> so<00:02:01.570> we<00:02:01.690> have<00:02:01.810> blood

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
could work fairly well so we have blood

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.950 
could work fairly well so we have blood
mag<00:02:02.320> this<00:02:02.590> has<00:02:02.770> changed<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.250> refill<00:02:03.960> chat

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960

weapon<00:02:07.330> magazine<00:02:07.810> when<00:02:08.019> bloodied<00:02:08.710> this<00:02:09.340> is

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
weapon magazine when bloodied this is

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.889 
weapon magazine when bloodied this is
actually<00:02:09.729> kind<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:10.000> interesting<00:02:10.270> because<00:02:10.600> I

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
actually kind of interesting because I

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.440 
actually kind of interesting because I
believe<00:02:11.500> we<00:02:11.680> haven't<00:02:11.890> seen

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
believe we haven't seen

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.650 
believe we haven't seen
type<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:14.069> know<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.220> perk<00:02:14.670> ability<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.420> I

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
type of you know a perk ability so I

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.290 
type of you know a perk ability so I
guess<00:02:16.379> it's<00:02:16.410> when<00:02:16.800> you're<00:02:16.950> damaged<00:02:17.489> you're

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
guess it's when you're damaged you're

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.910 
guess it's when you're damaged you're
going<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.480> be<00:02:18.599> able<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.989> refill<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.560> weapon

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
going to be able to refill the weapon

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.229 
going to be able to refill the weapon
magazine<00:02:20.340> which<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:20.610> kind<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.120> interesting

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
magazine which is kind of interesting

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.360 
magazine which is kind of interesting
because<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.050> relatively<00:02:22.500> low<00:02:22.830> magazine

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
because of the relatively low magazine

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.119 
because of the relatively low magazine
side<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:24.300> black<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:25.050> blood<00:02:25.260> mag<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> very

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
side the black the blood mag is a very

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.820 
side the black the blood mag is a very
interesting<00:02:26.760> perk<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.349> then<00:02:28.349> we<00:02:28.500> have<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
interesting perk so then we have the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.130 
interesting perk so then we have the
following<00:02:29.069> we<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.489> after<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.630> we<00:02:30.840> have

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
following we have after that we have

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.140 
following we have after that we have
light<00:02:31.920> weight<00:02:32.160> which<00:02:32.430> pretty<00:02:32.700> much<00:02:32.790> grants

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
light weight which pretty much grants

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.339 
light weight which pretty much grants
your<00:02:33.239> agility<00:02:33.510> buzz<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.930> see<00:02:34.050> what<00:02:34.170> their

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
your agility buzz you see what their

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.729 
your agility buzz you see what their
stability<00:02:34.950> drops<00:02:35.550> down<00:02:35.780> dramatic<00:02:36.780> life<00:02:36.959> which

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
stability drops down dramatic life which

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.870 
stability drops down dramatic life which
is<00:02:37.769> kind<00:02:38.099> of<00:02:38.130> weird<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.489> know<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:38.670> don't

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
is kind of weird you know you don't

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.160 
is kind of weird you know you don't
really<00:02:39.000> see<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.390> light<00:02:39.599> weight<00:02:39.750> jumping<00:02:40.080> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
really see the light weight jumping the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.259 
really see the light weight jumping the
stability<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.620> far<00:02:40.920> down<00:02:40.950> after<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.090> we

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
stability that far down after that we

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.289 
stability that far down after that we
have<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.930> small<00:02:43.890> Borg<00:02:44.340> which<00:02:44.640> pretty<00:02:44.880> much<00:02:44.970> this

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
have a small Borg which pretty much this

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.270 
have a small Borg which pretty much this
one<00:02:45.540> I'm<00:02:46.019> pretty<00:02:46.410> sure<00:02:46.590> everybody<00:02:46.890> knows<00:02:47.040> what

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
one I'm pretty sure everybody knows what

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.740 
one I'm pretty sure everybody knows what
this<00:02:47.370> one<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.849> increases<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.360> range<00:02:48.599> of

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
this one is this increases the range of

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.880 
this one is this increases the range of
Italy<00:02:49.290> slowly<00:02:50.040> requires<00:02:51.410> reduces<00:02:52.410> magazine

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
Italy slowly requires reduces magazine

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.370 
Italy slowly requires reduces magazine
size<00:02:53.099> since<00:02:53.819> Ted<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.120> 90<00:02:54.420> no<00:02:54.569> probably<00:02:54.959> drop<00:02:55.230> it

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
size since Ted of 90 no probably drop it

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.059 
size since Ted of 90 no probably drop it
down<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.530> 17<00:02:56.190> somewhere<00:02:56.549> about<00:02:56.730> 1715<00:02:58.069> because

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
down to 17 somewhere about 1715 because

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.530 
down to 17 somewhere about 1715 because
really<00:02:59.280> effectively<00:02:59.730> get<00:02:59.940> this<00:03:00.060> with<00:03:00.209> final

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
really effectively get this with final

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.030 
really effectively get this with final
round<00:03:00.690> though<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.870> mean<00:03:01.170> final<00:03:01.500> round<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.799> look

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
round though I mean final round and look

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.530 
round though I mean final round and look
in<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.190> chamber<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.790> would<00:03:03.030> be<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.180> beast

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
in the chamber that I would be a beast

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.289 
in the chamber that I would be a beast
right<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.440> we<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.130> storm<00:03:05.370> this

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
right so we have I of the storm this

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.150 
right so we have I of the storm this
weapon<00:03:06.480> because<00:03:06.900> more<00:03:07.140> accurate<00:03:07.620> as<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.980> as

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
weapon because more accurate as you as

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.030 
weapon because more accurate as you as
your<00:03:08.700> health<00:03:08.940> gets<00:03:09.360> lowered<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.200> let's<00:03:10.410> say<00:03:10.620> I

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
your health gets lowered so let's say I

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.250 
your health gets lowered so let's say I
don't<00:03:11.519> know<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:12.000> one<00:03:12.329> is<00:03:12.540> going<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.019> work

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
don't know this one is going to work

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.680 
don't know this one is going to work
with<00:03:13.530> target<00:03:14.069> acquisition<00:03:14.220> because<00:03:14.910> if<00:03:15.480> it

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
with target acquisition because if it

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.210 
with target acquisition because if it
does<00:03:15.930> there's<00:03:16.530> actually<00:03:16.889> going<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.100> be<00:03:17.160> a

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
does there's actually going to be a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.009 
does there's actually going to be a
pretty<00:03:17.489> sick<00:03:17.790> perk<00:03:18.030> because<00:03:18.389> the<00:03:18.600> more<00:03:18.810> damage

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
pretty sick perk because the more damage

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.750 
pretty sick perk because the more damage
you're<00:03:19.290> taking<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.040> more<00:03:20.220> target

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
you're taking the more target

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.039 
you're taking the more target
acquisition<00:03:20.940> you're<00:03:21.480> going<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.660> have<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:21.780> don't

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
acquisition you're going to have I don't

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.420 
acquisition you're going to have I don't
know<00:03:22.139> if<00:03:22.230> it's<00:03:22.319> going<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.500> work<00:03:22.560> in<00:03:22.889> that<00:03:23.040> sense

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
know if it's going to work in that sense

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.759 
know if it's going to work in that sense
or<00:03:23.639> becomes<00:03:24.480> more<00:03:24.660> accurate<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.440> sense<00:03:25.650> of
