00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and tricks that I've learned over the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.899 
and tricks that I've learned over the
Europe<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.659> using<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> product<00:01:25.729> one<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
Europe of using this product one of the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.249 
Europe of using this product one of the
things<00:01:27.119> I've<00:01:27.330> learned<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> be

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
things I've learned is I have to be

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.219 
things I've learned is I have to be
super<00:01:28.829> diligent<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.119> coverage<00:01:30.509> there

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
super diligent with the coverage there

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.749 
super diligent with the coverage there
was<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> couple<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.740> times<00:01:31.799> where<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.220> missed<00:01:32.520> big

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
was a couple of times where I missed big

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.670 
was a couple of times where I missed big
chunks<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.299> roots<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.840> ended<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
chunks of roots and I ended up with a

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.980 
chunks of roots and I ended up with a
white<00:01:34.979> stripe<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.880> bright<00:01:36.090> red<00:01:36.299> stripe<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
white stripe and a bright red stripe and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.590 
white stripe and a bright red stripe and
it<00:01:37.079> wasn't<00:01:37.259> good<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:39.030> method<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.450> I've

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
it wasn't good so the method that I've

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.359 
it wasn't good so the method that I've
learned<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.759> put<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> very

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
learned to do this is I put a very

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.580 
learned to do this is I put a very
straight<00:01:44.369> part<00:01:45.210> right<00:01:45.720> down<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.110> middle<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
straight part right down the middle and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.060 
straight part right down the middle and
then<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.250> saturate<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.810> part<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.409> mash<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
then I saturate that part I mash the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.130 
then I saturate that part I mash the
stuff<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.149> use<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> spoon<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> put<00:01:52.049> it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
stuff in you just use a spoon to put it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.899 
stuff in you just use a spoon to put it
on<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.439> plastic<00:01:52.829> spoon<00:01:53.040> or<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> wooden<00:01:53.490> spoon<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
on a plastic spoon or a wooden spoon and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.179 
on a plastic spoon or a wooden spoon and
then<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.420> mash<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.110> all<00:01:55.409> around<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> part

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
then I mash it in all around the part

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.920 
then I mash it in all around the part
and<00:01:56.340> then<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.850> make<00:01:57.090> another<00:01:57.360> part<00:01:57.659> really

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
and then I make another part really

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.560 
and then I make another part really
close<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.950> one<00:01:59.130> mash<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.969> product<00:02:00.360> in

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
close to that one mash the product in

and no shampoo for two days so I usually

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.890 
and no shampoo for two days so I usually
leave<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.610> another<00:02:50.850> trick<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.569> I've<00:02:51.660> learned

leave it another trick that I've learned

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.960 
leave it another trick that I've learned
is<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.380> usually<00:02:52.739> leave<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.160> for<00:02:53.459> about<00:02:53.549> four

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
is I usually leave it for about four

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.720 
is I usually leave it for about four
weeks<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.630> used<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.650> push<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.280> with<00:02:56.310> the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
weeks I used to push it with the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.580 
weeks I used to push it with the
chemical<00:02:56.910> hair<00:02:57.269> dye<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.720> I'd<00:02:57.840> go<00:02:58.170> five

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
chemical hair dye and I'd go five

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.140 
chemical hair dye and I'd go five
sometimes<00:02:59.040> six<00:02:59.310> weeks<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.850> between

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
sometimes six weeks in between

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.090 
sometimes six weeks in between
treatments<00:03:00.330> but<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.140> find<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.799> roots

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
treatments but I find that the roots

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.880 
treatments but I find that the roots
show<00:03:02.580> more<00:03:03.450> with<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.840> product<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.530> could

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
show more with this product and it could

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.640 
show more with this product and it could
be<00:03:05.100> because<00:03:05.610> I'm<00:03:05.730> getting<00:03:05.910> older<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:07.230> I've

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
be because I'm getting older and I've

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.380 
be because I'm getting older and I've
got<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:07.860> higher<00:03:08.190> percentage<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.880> whites<00:03:09.150> and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
got a higher percentage of whites and

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.910 
got a higher percentage of whites and
grays<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.840> my<00:03:09.959> hair<00:03:10.170> maybe<00:03:10.319> that's<00:03:10.560> why<00:03:10.769> it

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
grays in my hair maybe that's why it

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.860 
grays in my hair maybe that's why it
shows<00:03:11.130> more<00:03:11.430> or<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:12.060> could<00:03:12.209> just<00:03:12.239> be<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.569> this

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
shows more or it could just be that this

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.789 
shows more or it could just be that this
product<00:03:13.319> works<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.430> way<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:16.140> hope<00:03:16.530> that

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
product works that way so I hope that

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.250 
product works that way so I hope that
