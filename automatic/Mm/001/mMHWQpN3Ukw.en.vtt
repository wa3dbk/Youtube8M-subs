about<00:00:45.870> since<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.620> rugby<00:00:46.920> ball<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.280> thought

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
about since it's a rugby ball I thought

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.340 
about since it's a rugby ball I thought
who<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:48.210> since<00:00:48.450> as<00:00:48.600> an<00:00:48.719> official<00:00:49.140> ball<00:00:49.320> I

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
who like since as an official ball I

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.060 
who like since as an official ball I
thought<00:00:49.680> it'd<00:00:49.800> be<00:00:49.829> made<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.280> leather<00:00:50.600> but

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
thought it'd be made out of leather but

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.889 
thought it'd be made out of leather but
like<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.190> said<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.699> reason<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.270> got<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.510> was

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
like I said the reason I got this was

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.750 
like I said the reason I got this was
because<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.379> an<00:00:55.530> official<00:00:55.770> game<00:00:55.949> ball<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
because it's an official game ball and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.240 
because it's an official game ball and
it<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.149> cheap<00:00:57.420> price<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.829> know<00:00:58.949> things

supposed to be like the highest quality

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.200 
supposed to be like the highest quality

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
what to what to look for if you're

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.760 
what to what to look for if you're
looking<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.270> one<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.630> them<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.560> size

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
looking for one of them so it's a size

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.859 
looking for one of them so it's a size
five<00:01:20.600> true<00:01:21.600> flight<00:01:22.189> pre<00:01:23.189> kicked<00:01:23.780> 9<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.900> 10<00:01:25.110> psi

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
five true flight pre kicked 9 to 10 psi

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.100 
five true flight pre kicked 9 to 10 psi
obviously<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.140> read<00:01:28.320> all<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.619> stuff<00:01:30.110> so

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
obviously you can read all that stuff so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.940 
obviously you can read all that stuff so
I<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.799> might<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:33.079> logo<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.110> Hong

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
I think that might be the logo for Hong

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.520 
I think that might be the logo for Hong
Kong<00:01:35.250> where<00:01:35.939> they<00:01:36.090> held<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.570> world<00:01:37.470> cup<00:01:37.770> at

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
Kong where they held this world cup at

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.230

little<00:02:25.110> pamphlet<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.890> came<00:02:26.130> with<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.340> I

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
little pamphlet that came with that I

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:37.240 
little pamphlet that came with that I
haven't<00:02:26.640> taken<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.060> off<00:02:27.239> yet<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.319> will

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.440 

outstanding<00:02:38.250> performance<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.000> all<00:02:39.209> weather

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
outstanding performance in all weather

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.780 
outstanding performance in all weather
conditions<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:40.379> guess<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> rugby<00:02:41.040> they<00:02:41.340> do<00:02:41.519> play

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
conditions I guess a rugby they do play

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.900 
conditions I guess a rugby they do play
in<00:02:41.910> all<00:02:42.030> weather<00:02:42.269> conditions<00:02:43.190> they<00:02:44.190> also<00:02:44.459> do

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
in all weather conditions they also do

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.420 
in all weather conditions they also do
in<00:02:45.180> football<00:02:45.900> american<00:02:46.530> football<00:02:46.560> but<00:02:47.190> they

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
in football american football but they

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.770 
in football american football but they
use<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.670> leather<00:02:48.030> ball<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.079> sport<00:02:50.780> it's

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
use a leather ball and that sport it's

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.520 
use a leather ball and that sport it's
really<00:02:52.200> bad<00:02:52.530> zooming<00:02:56.900> trying<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.019> see<00:02:58.260> if<00:02:58.380> it

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
really bad zooming trying to see if it

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.720 
really bad zooming trying to see if it
says<00:02:58.799> so<00:02:59.340> it's<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.579> high<00:02:59.790> grade<00:02:59.850> rubber<00:03:00.540> surface

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730

official match ball which like I said

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.259 
official match ball which like I said
I'm<00:03:36.319> surprised<00:03:36.800> about<00:03:37.040> her<00:03:37.760> he's<00:03:37.849> expensive

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
I'm surprised about her he's expensive

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.780 
I'm surprised about her he's expensive
as<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.569> is<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.140> thought<00:03:39.349> they<00:03:39.530> would<00:03:39.560> be<00:03:39.790> made

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
as it is I thought they would be made

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.330 
as it is I thought they would be made
out<00:03:40.819> of<00:03:40.970> leather<00:03:41.239> like<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.620> American

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
out of leather like the American

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.539 
out of leather like the American
football<00:03:43.580> all<00:03:44.180> right<00:03:44.360> here<00:03:44.890> but<00:03:45.890> here's<00:03:46.459> a

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
football all right here but here's a

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.960 
football all right here but here's a
size<00:03:46.880> comparison<00:03:48.400> I'm<00:03:49.400> an<00:03:49.519> official<00:03:49.940> game

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
size comparison I'm an official game

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.910 
size comparison I'm an official game
this<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:50.900> official<00:03:51.380> NFL<00:03:51.709> game<00:03:52.160> football<00:03:53.920> it's

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
this is official NFL game football it's

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.400 
this is official NFL game football it's
under<00:03:55.549> a<00:03:55.849> different<00:03:56.420> Commissioner<00:03:56.959> but<00:03:57.200> I

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
under a different Commissioner but I

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.839 
under a different Commissioner but I
don't<00:03:57.709> think<00:03:57.920> they<00:03:58.040> change<00:03:58.370> any<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:59.019> the<00:04:00.849> specs

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
don't think they change any of the specs

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.170 
don't think they change any of the specs
on<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:03.080> ball<00:04:03.260> so<00:04:03.560> rugby<00:04:04.400> ball<00:04:04.700> is<00:04:04.849> pretty

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
on the ball so rugby ball is pretty

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.030 
on the ball so rugby ball is pretty
similar<00:04:05.510> in<00:04:05.690> size<00:04:05.959> a<00:04:06.019> little<00:04:06.349> different<00:04:06.860> shape

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
similar in size a little different shape

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.729 
similar in size a little different shape
it<00:04:07.220> has<00:04:07.370> like<00:04:07.519> a<00:04:07.549> rounder<00:04:08.530> ends<00:04:09.530> right<00:04:09.680> here

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
it has like a rounder ends right here

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.970 
it has like a rounder ends right here
versus<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.400> pointed<00:04:10.940> ends<00:04:11.239> of<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:12.049> NFL

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
versus the pointed ends of the NFL

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:20.810 
versus the pointed ends of the NFL
football

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:28.110 

that<00:04:21.820> is<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.690> top<00:04:23.169> view<00:04:24.780> so<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.800> old<00:04:27.120> rugby

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
that is the top view so the old rugby

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.040 
that is the top view so the old rugby
footballs<00:04:28.930> used<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.770> have<00:04:30.540> laces<00:04:31.540> on<00:04:31.720> them<00:04:31.870> but

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
footballs used to have laces on them but

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.719 
footballs used to have laces on them but
I<00:04:32.110> guess<00:04:32.410> they<00:04:32.590> don't<00:04:32.740> they're<00:04:33.040> like<00:04:33.250> a<00:04:33.280> four

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
I guess they don't they're like a four

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.040 
I guess they don't they're like a four
panel<00:04:34.350> construction<00:04:35.350> now<00:04:35.919> and<00:04:36.810> I<00:04:37.810> guess

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
panel construction now and I guess

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.020 
panel construction now and I guess
they're<00:04:38.320> made<00:04:38.620> out<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.830> rubber<00:04:39.160> like<00:04:39.580> I<00:04:39.729> said

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
they're made out of rubber like I said

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:48.000 
they're made out of rubber like I said
versus<00:04:40.540> leather<00:04:40.900> as<00:04:41.229> they<00:04:41.860> used<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:46.740> so<00:04:47.740> yeah

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
versus leather as they used to so yeah

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.760 
versus leather as they used to so yeah
that's<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.370> ball<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:49.570> I<00:04:50.229> don't<00:04:50.410> know<00:04:50.500> if<00:04:50.620> you

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
that's the ball and I don't know if you

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.570 
that's the ball and I don't know if you
could<00:04:50.949> see<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.639> pimple<00:04:52.300> design<00:04:52.740> but<00:04:53.740> has<00:04:54.039> a

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
could see the pimple design but has a

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.430 
could see the pimple design but has a
pretty<00:04:54.910> good<00:04:55.030> grip<00:04:55.479> because<00:04:55.690> of<00:04:55.990> that<00:04:56.169> and

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
pretty good grip because of that and

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.640 
pretty good grip because of that and
yeah<00:04:59.440> that's<00:04:59.740> the<00:05:00.270> see<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:01.449> pimples<00:05:01.960> of<00:05:02.169> May

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650

pebbly like a basketball is so that's a

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.420 
pebbly like a basketball is so that's a
comparison<00:05:11.740> right<00:05:11.919> there<00:05:12.190> and<00:05:13.020> yeah<00:05:14.400> check<00:05:15.400> it

for<00:05:24.099> it<00:05:24.190> and<00:05:25.830> yeah<00:05:26.830> hopefully<00:05:27.130> I<00:05:27.340> will<00:05:27.460> get<00:05:27.910> to

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970

for it and yeah hopefully I will get to
try<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.330> sport<00:05:28.660> out<00:05:28.810> someday<00:05:29.080> and<00:05:29.700> hopefully

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
try the sport out someday and hopefully

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.240 
try the sport out someday and hopefully
this<00:05:31.090> is<00:05:31.419> the<00:05:31.479> top<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.139> the<00:05:32.320> live<00:05:32.530> ball<00:05:32.860> that

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.650 

will<00:05:36.250> be<00:05:36.370> used<00:05:36.729> so<00:05:38.520> should<00:05:39.520> make<00:05:40.240> for<00:05:40.450> a<00:05:40.510> good

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
will be used so should make for a good

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.350 
will be used so should make for a good
game<00:05:41.280> I'm<00:05:42.280> sure<00:05:42.520> that<00:05:42.789> you<00:05:42.970> could<00:05:43.090> probably

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
game I'm sure that you could probably

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.150 
game I'm sure that you could probably
play<00:05:43.630> rugby<00:05:44.020> with<00:05:44.380> just<00:05:44.680> like<00:05:44.800> either<00:05:45.039> a

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
play rugby with just like either a

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.629 
play rugby with just like either a
regular<00:05:46.050> ball<00:05:47.050> or<00:05:47.710> something<00:05:47.889> like<00:05:48.099> that<00:05:48.220> but

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
regular ball or something like that but

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.240 
regular ball or something like that but
uh<00:05:48.699> and<00:05:49.240> i<00:05:49.990> think<00:05:50.080> it's<00:05:50.410> nice<00:05:50.650> kind<00:05:50.979> of<00:05:51.010> having

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
uh and i think it's nice kind of having

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.960 
uh and i think it's nice kind of having
the<00:05:51.340> official<00:05:51.760> game<00:05:51.970> ball<00:05:52.000> and<00:05:53.820> it's<00:05:54.820> always

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
the official game ball and it's always

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.490 
the official game ball and it's always
worth<00:05:55.300> more<00:05:55.570> than<00:05:55.690> the<00:05:55.810> other<00:05:55.930> balls<00:05:56.169> if<00:05:56.380> i

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
worth more than the other balls if i

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.340 
worth more than the other balls if i
ever<00:05:56.590> do<00:05:56.830> get<00:05:57.010> rid<00:05:57.190> of<00:05:57.220> it<00:05:57.400> so<00:05:58.650> cool<00:05:59.650> thanks
