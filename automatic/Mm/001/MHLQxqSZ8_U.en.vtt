00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.640
Brothers of the mine rejoice !

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.500
Swing, swing, swing with me

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500
Raise your pick and raise your voice !

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.440
Sing, sing, sing with me

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.540
Down and down into the deep,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.500
Who knows what we'll find beneath ?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.520
Diamonds, rubies, gold and more

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.620
Hidden in the mountain store.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.460
Born underground,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.400
suckled from a teat of stone.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.180
Raised in the dark,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.280
the safety of our mountain home.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.140
Skin made of iron,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.020
steel in our bones,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.380
To dig and dig makes us free!

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.260
Come on brothers sing with me!

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.340
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.080
Diggy diggy hole,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.920
diggy diggy hole

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.020
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.780
Diggy diggy hole,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.660
digging a hole !

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.800
The sunlight will not reach this low

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.700
Deep, deep in the mine

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.780
Never seen the blue moon glow

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.540
Dwarves won't fly so high

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.840
Fill a glass and down some mead!

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.880
Stuff your bellies at the feast!

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.700
Stumble home and fall asleep

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.340
Dreaming in our mountain keep

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.900
Born underground,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.660
grown inside a rocky womb

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.660
The earth is our cradle;

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.680
the mountain shall become our tomb

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.520
Face us on the battlefield;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.540
you will meet your doom

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.680
We do not fear what lies beneath

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.560
We can never dig too deep

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.520
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.460
Diggy diggy hole,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.440

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.200

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.240
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.240
Diggy diggy hole,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.240
diggy diggy hole

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.080
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.140
Diggy diggy hole,

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.740
digging a hole !

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.120
Born underground,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.100
suckled from a teat of stone

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.840
Raised in the dark,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.900
the safety of our mountain home

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.780
Skin made of iron,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.740
steel in our bones

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.760
To dig and dig makes us free

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.820
Come on brothers sing with me !

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.680

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.620
Diggy diggy hole,

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.720
diggy diggy hole

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.680
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.620
Diggy diggy hole,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.700
