diseases caused by viruses and in
particular<00:00:27.830> about<00:00:29.650> bird<00:00:30.650> flu<00:00:30.679> and<00:00:31.189> swine<00:00:31.429> flu

particular about bird flu and swine flu
bird<00:00:33.620> flu<00:00:33.860> actually<00:00:34.550> was<00:00:34.760> first<00:00:35.120> reported<00:00:35.390> in

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
bird flu actually was first reported in

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.830 
bird flu actually was first reported in
about<00:00:36.800> two<00:00:37.129> thousand<00:00:37.489> three<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:38.000> this<00:00:38.510> was<00:00:38.809> in

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
about two thousand three and this was in

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.080 
about two thousand three and this was in
Southeast<00:00:39.590> Asia<00:00:39.770> where<00:00:40.129> they<00:00:40.280> were<00:00:40.340> quite

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
Southeast Asia where they were quite

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.840 
Southeast Asia where they were quite
large<00:00:41.360> outbreaks<00:00:41.989> in<00:00:42.289> poultry<00:00:43.129> populations

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
large outbreaks in poultry populations

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.340 
large outbreaks in poultry populations
and<00:00:44.680> millions<00:00:45.680> of<00:00:45.949> chickens<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:46.940> ducks<00:00:47.899> were

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
and millions of chickens and ducks were

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.610 
and millions of chickens and ducks were
culled<00:00:49.210> in<00:00:50.210> order<00:00:50.570> to<00:00:50.690> deal<00:00:51.050> with<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.320> disease

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
culled in order to deal with the disease

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.200 
culled in order to deal with the disease
but<00:00:51.859> and<00:00:52.129> they<00:00:52.219> also<00:00:52.399> were<00:00:52.699> quite<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:52.969> large

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
but and they also were quite a large

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.279 
but and they also were quite a large
number<00:00:53.690> of<00:00:54.640> fatalities<00:00:55.640> in<00:00:56.180> humans<00:00:56.600> which

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
number of fatalities in humans which

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.709 
number of fatalities in humans which
there<00:00:57.620> resulted<00:00:58.129> in<00:00:58.430> quite<00:00:58.699> big<00:00:59.329> concern

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
there resulted in quite big concern

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.419 
there resulted in quite big concern
around<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.170> world<00:01:00.379> where<00:01:01.039> this<00:01:01.190> might

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
around the world where this might

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.410 
around the world where this might
actually<00:01:01.640> then<00:01:02.179> become<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.230> global<00:01:03.500> epidemic

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
actually then become a global epidemic

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.990 
actually then become a global epidemic
and<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.950> virus<00:01:07.310> originally<00:01:07.820> only

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
and the the virus originally only

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.300 
and the the virus originally only
occurred<00:01:08.450> in<00:01:08.689> Southeast<00:01:09.080> Asia<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:09.560> then<00:01:09.740> over

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
occurred in Southeast Asia and then over

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.210 
occurred in Southeast Asia and then over
the<00:01:10.369> next<00:01:10.430> following<00:01:11.330> years<00:01:11.689> in<00:01:12.220> 2004-2005

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
the next following years in 2004-2005

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.440 
the next following years in 2004-2005
2006<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:14.600> did<00:01:14.869> also<00:01:15.290> occur<00:01:15.920> in<00:01:16.450> Europe

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
2006 it did also occur in Europe

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.710 
2006 it did also occur in Europe
actually<00:01:17.840> which<00:01:18.110> resulted<00:01:18.710> in<00:01:18.890> some<00:01:19.689> quite<00:01:20.689> I

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
actually which resulted in some quite I

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.020 
actually which resulted in some quite I
mean<00:01:21.079> the<00:01:21.280> public<00:01:22.280> was<00:01:22.430> really<00:01:22.729> worried

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
mean the public was really worried

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.080 
mean the public was really worried
actually<00:01:23.329> at<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.780> time<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.200> it<00:01:25.130> was<00:01:25.640> not

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
actually at the time and it was not

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.590 
actually at the time and it was not
clear<00:01:26.150> how<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.780> virus<00:01:27.200> actually<00:01:27.619> came<00:01:28.250> across

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
clear how the virus actually came across

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.460 
clear how the virus actually came across
from<00:01:29.600> Southeast<00:01:30.110> Asia<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:32.470> hypotheses

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
from Southeast Asia and the hypotheses

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.749 
from Southeast Asia and the hypotheses
were<00:01:33.710> that<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.040> might<00:01:34.220> be<00:01:34.340> related<00:01:34.549> to

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
were that it might be related to

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.889 
were that it might be related to
movement<00:01:35.540> of<00:01:35.600> wild<00:01:35.899> birds<00:01:37.210> we<00:01:38.210> don't<00:01:38.360> really

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
movement of wild birds we don't really

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.920 
movement of wild birds we don't really
know<00:01:39.140> how<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.619> disease<00:01:40.130> actually<00:01:40.430> spread<00:01:41.299> we

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
know how the disease actually spread we

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.280 
know how the disease actually spread we
have<00:01:42.200> various<00:01:42.560> hypotheses<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:43.720> in<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:45.049> in

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
have various hypotheses and in the in

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.950 
have various hypotheses and in the in
the<00:01:45.350> first<00:01:46.479> during<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.600> start<00:01:47.840> of<00:01:47.930> the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
the first during the start of the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.660 
the first during the start of the
epidemic<00:01:48.290> it<00:01:48.649> was<00:01:48.860> thought<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.189> was

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
epidemic it was thought that was

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.969 
epidemic it was thought that was
primarily<00:01:50.570> through<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.200> movement<00:01:51.590> of<00:01:51.649> wild

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
primarily through the movement of wild

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.730 
primarily through the movement of wild
birds<00:01:52.450> but<00:01:53.450> more<00:01:53.689> recently<00:01:54.140> we<00:01:54.469> have

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
birds but more recently we have

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.850 
birds but more recently we have
concluded<00:01:55.250> that<00:01:55.579> also<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.409> movement<00:01:57.409> of

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
concluded that also the movement of

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.100 
concluded that also the movement of
poultry<00:01:58.520> or<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.909> trade<00:01:59.180> in<00:01:59.420> poultry<00:01:59.840> in

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
poultry or the trade in poultry in

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.840 
poultry or the trade in poultry in
whether<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:00.530> is<00:02:00.649> legal<00:02:01.039> or<00:02:01.100> illegal<00:02:01.280> might

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
whether that is legal or illegal might

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.980 
whether that is legal or illegal might
have<00:02:02.030> played<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.270> role<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:03.100> while<00:02:04.100> we<00:02:04.219> were<00:02:04.369> all

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
have played a role and while we were all

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.430 
have played a role and while we were all
trying<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.939> control<00:02:07.939> bird<00:02:08.450> flu<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.050> were

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
trying to control bird flu and were

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.200 
trying to control bird flu and were
conducting<00:02:10.160> intensive<00:02:10.550> surveillance<00:02:10.880> and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
spend a lot of money in Southeast Asia

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.850 
spend a lot of money in Southeast Asia
and<00:02:13.190> in<00:02:13.340> Asia<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.730> control<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.480> disease

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
and in Asia to control the disease

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.970 
and in Asia to control the disease
suddenly

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
suddenly

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.589 
suddenly
in<00:02:16.340> early<00:02:17.090> 2009<00:02:17.720> we<00:02:18.080> had<00:02:18.519> human<00:02:19.519> cases<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:20.269> a

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
in early 2009 we had human cases of a

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.600 
in early 2009 we had human cases of a
virus<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.470> was<00:02:21.739> called<00:02:22.099> swine<00:02:22.700> flu<00:02:22.970> and

in whatever I mean about march april and
2009<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.180> virus<00:02:32.390> spread<00:02:32.959> very<00:02:33.230> very<00:02:33.560> quickly

2009 the virus spread very very quickly

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.289 
2009 the virus spread very very quickly
over<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.220> next<00:02:34.430> couple<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:34.730> months<00:02:34.879> around

the<00:02:35.420> world<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.650> interesting<00:02:37.129> thing

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
the world and the interesting thing

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.460 
the world and the interesting thing
about<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:37.819> comparison<00:02:38.420> with<00:02:38.450> bird<00:02:39.200> flu

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
about that in comparison with bird flu

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.000 
about that in comparison with bird flu
is<00:02:39.739> that<00:02:40.220> this<00:02:40.760> virus<00:02:41.110> because<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:42.319> was<00:02:42.530> very

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
is that this virus because it was very

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.160 
is that this virus because it was very
effective<00:02:43.160> at<00:02:43.849> transmitting<00:02:44.510> from<00:02:44.629> human<00:02:45.079> to
