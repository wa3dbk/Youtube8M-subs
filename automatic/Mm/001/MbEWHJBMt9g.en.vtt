I'm not going to solve the eggs because
there's<00:02:24.380> enough<00:02:24.650> salt<00:02:24.980> in<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.970> rest<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.569> at

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
there's enough salt in the rest of it at

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.539 
there's enough salt in the rest of it at
this<00:02:27.380> point<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:27.920> mixed<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.519> all<00:02:28.610> together

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
this point I just mixed it all together

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.339 
this point I just mixed it all together
then<00:02:31.549> comes<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.000> fun<00:02:32.239> part<00:02:32.480> I'm<00:02:32.900> going<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.200> put
