00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.450
 tears are new album this year 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.360
 have since traveled to the north 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.360
 for this reason we can interview another one at the end of the works 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.560
 and will take over 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.519
 yes as it should be nice to work 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.369
 yesterday the phone spoke with a new album yes it was lovely it was one 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.739
 cozy and sporty and 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.140
 nice with the band experience 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.490
 collective nice to show something different from myself just the musicality 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.380
 lille and i'm walking around and politics the american who wants to get rid of 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.479
 but I could get lost yesterday 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.829
 You have already lost a little on you and approved 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.340
 ria now the certainty as with a band with honest bananas the weather 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.910
 to burn something else or don't say something 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.490
 but I certainly have 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.930
 7 arm PhD student id2 it is the first victory this album what you have it is 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.790
 in the meantime all done a lot, no I have talk I have 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.690
 experienced this 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.510
 I had made 40 songs for these roads, there have only been twelve 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.910
 in the end 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.480
 and that has been very much occupied with that I have done that video clips me 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.970
 have it 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.220
 it is nothing else that you do not have everything I worked on 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.040
 album 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.820
 at the time i wrote one for different people transporting van 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.140
 a French thing done 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.720
 and then but actually you put yes your numbers I assume yes x of which 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.140
 the text half got anp 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.220
 where do you get inspiration from 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.350
 all kinds of events 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.430
 stories from others 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.240
 like fictional story too 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.160
 that's how the VVV fantasies 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.380
 and also for years also things are just the rouck itself I think is going to be bearded 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.450
 it easier 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.720
 where are you already running a company that mainly 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.000
 mainly revolves around ladies, however, he gave up too much for a contraction 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.980
 which stone have you chosen now I have chosen more 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.440
 purely because that other theme of getting from the ceo is sex 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.009
 these benefits 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.239
 You could say it is a big compliment because there is Ken 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.889
 really the king why that and who has really done great things too 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:17.969
 outside ormi young say 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.290
 but so you can imagine how drastic are there are 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.849
 of course all about sex 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.150
 you still have one with a certain idea or a certain back of mind 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.249
 whoever wrote your songs or watched several ladies year round 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:35.730
 Many numbers are those that are best doctors to do for example crazy hey that's it 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.010
 oldest song of the CD that was made in 2007 so it's a very different one 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.010
 lady only thank you for example 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:49.579
 we are that way yes and what we expect a lot in the coming period what 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.059
 can remedy anyway many performances here and there I do not have 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.879
 want to go to coach tour 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.019
 yes what can talk and goes after the summer 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.810
 he can better score package say the members of offering to schools than 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:07.139
 I can continue with festivities in high school 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.489
 sometimes the final guest artist 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.919
 so that is something itself ex what I want to do after the summer 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.289
 bah bah frankly I am very focused on that at the moment 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.389
 I want to do and 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.150
 perhaps still checked if there is a new CD for next year but first this is 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:25.279
 that this year and many families of course 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:28.689
