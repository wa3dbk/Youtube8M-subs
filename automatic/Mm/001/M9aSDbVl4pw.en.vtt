00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.300
 my biggest success on the 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.090
 I had a trade show at need for speed 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.430
 I was the first and the press team there 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.080
 regardless of that , it was cool too 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.849
 as before, really play too 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.710
 Can you after the trailer was mine 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.380
 first reaction so that looks cool 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.359
 my second reaction sees this in real 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.829
 also so good and at least in this one 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.230
 alpha version you play now 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.489
 could be on the playstation 4 that 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.619
 really need for speed 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.729
 cool from which of course benefits 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.269
 of course strongly on it 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:36.739
 Completely night that means you have 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.149
 just a lot of light effects this 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.690
 all rain affected and so further 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.629
 can already be seen 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.769
 yes and what you mean is my impression 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.269
 Overall impression is that they actually 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.579
 have tried out of this over 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.170
 twenty-year history of the series 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.359
 to do some best of and this one 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.969
 this need for speed reboot really 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.769
 Let's start 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.480
 and I have to say that seems like one 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.199
 pretty cool thing to become so 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.489
 one has almost five columns after 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.480
 where you can play you can do it yourself 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.250
 I want to decide that very much now 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.750
 I want to be a race driver more willing 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.920
 I want to be your author 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.840
 focus on training 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.450
 and depending on what you look for 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.740
 I focus on him and points 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.200
 gets better in it so i have to 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.820
 example at the end of the time race has 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.530
 get me the most points for 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.730
 actually the trading skills 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.610
 others have the most points for 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.230
 get started with the cops 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.940
 that means depending on how you are being yourself 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.650
 his gameplay focus will be on you 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.840
 in the storm player of rewarded that 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.040
 works like so at least 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.870
 basis of what I have seen so far 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.710
 I'm pretty good 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.720
 Of course that was a very small one 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.610
 exhibitor she could now do three maximum 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.840
 have four races driving from open world 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.840
 I not seen much of the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.490
 you could not see the story yet, but 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.950
 that was pretty much played 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.720
 made a lot of fun thinks my biggest 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.310
 Plus point is that you look at yourself 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.620
 even choose the driving behavior 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.180
 that I want to vote I want me 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.490
 I really want to drive very fast 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.380
 know you drive and you can feel it 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.450
 really the developers promise 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.800
 that there are no better or no 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.080
 you play worse but you give 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.090
 that no matter which way you take that 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.200
 It is always playful to master that 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.679
 you always have a chance against others 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.970
 driver 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.620
 this is so the crew the greatest 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.840
 question mark that I am at the moment 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.040
 still have 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.810
 but you will see that now if the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.880
 coming versions come 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.280
 if that really does happen anyway 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.520
 the overall impression need for speed cool 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.520
 Thing
