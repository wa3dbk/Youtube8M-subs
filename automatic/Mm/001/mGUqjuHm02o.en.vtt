00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
get those products from vitacost but

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.310 
get those products from vitacost but
they<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.280> super<00:00:44.700> super<00:00:45.030> expensive<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:46.050> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
they are super super expensive if I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.020 
they are super super expensive if I
can't<00:00:46.530> find<00:00:46.770> anything<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.280> works<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.700> well<00:00:47.730> I

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
can't find anything that works as well I

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.510 
can't find anything that works as well I
would<00:00:48.480> repurchase<00:00:48.660> them<00:00:49.230> both<00:00:49.410> but<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.219> just

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
would repurchase them both but I just

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.580 
would repurchase them both but I just
feel<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.300> would<00:00:51.329> only<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.750> fair<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.350> try<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
feel like it would only be fair to try a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.139 
feel like it would only be fair to try a
couple<00:00:52.890> other<00:00:53.129> products<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:53.879> if<00:00:53.969> there's

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
couple other products and see if there's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.670 
couple other products and see if there's
anything<00:00:54.449> that's<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.199> less<00:00:55.320> pricey

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
anything that's a little less pricey

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.340 
anything that's a little less pricey
still<00:00:56.250> more<00:00:56.730> natural<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.600> less<00:00:57.809> expensive

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
still more natural but less expensive

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.569 
still more natural but less expensive
that's<00:00:58.530> going<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> same<00:00:59.190> thing<00:00:59.399> so
