00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
it just shouldn't happen at all or that

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.550 
it just shouldn't happen at all or that
council<00:02:48.790> should<00:02:48.910> be<00:02:49.030> more<00:02:49.270> selective<00:02:49.960> I

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
council should be more selective I

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.260 
council should be more selective I
understand<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.400> they<00:02:51.550> need<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.760> they're

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
understand that they need to they're

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.060 
understand that they need to they're
under<00:02:52.510> pressure<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.990> make<00:02:53.170> cuts<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:53.770> I<00:02:53.830> think

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
under pressure to make cuts but I think

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.120 
under pressure to make cuts but I think
that<00:02:54.310> they<00:02:54.430> should<00:02:55.530> think<00:02:56.530> about<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.950> more

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
that they should think about it more

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.380 
that they should think about it more
where<00:02:57.400> they're<00:02:57.550> actually<00:02:57.670> going<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.240> make
