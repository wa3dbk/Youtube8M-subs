00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.250
 However 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.250
 But 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:13.830
 hero 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.829
 It's the circumstances surrounding it when it comes to forecast difficulties 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.279
 It has not changed 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.550
 I'm an actor 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.740
 It was totally different though it was said that there was actually a feeling 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.119
 From the US side to the statement 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.119
 Airtime is concerned 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.920
 But talk about it 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.020
 Something like rating is going around 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.940
 Although I participated in it, it was interesting to use it that way in the last day 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.770
 Is not it 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.090
 Seeing objectively one step higher 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.950
 Iwate That's why I thought it was interesting 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.950
 If you receive an explanation on the net 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.750
 that 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.360
 Top 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.180
 Features of that 7th steamer 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.210
 It's totally different 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.660
 I went around 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.660
 Talked to one side 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.049
 Village 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.590
 boy 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.590
 I'm dead 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.670
 I have some products this year 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.720
 If you try Tottori 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.080
 Be shy 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.050
 Increase annual rate 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.240
 that 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.000
 When it gets bigger 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.479
 At last I think that my own self-confidence comes 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.280
 What 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.730
 I think it would be crazy to say that I would meet 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.930
 Before the war 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.160
 I'm troubled 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.790
 There was a person in charge of measures for emerging fish models 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.490
 I am a tourist destination 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.490
 Conquering the age at Sapporo Dome 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.829
 Become a miss campus 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.690
 Become a female ana 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.600
 Pro baseball player has warned 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.910
 It is called 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.520
 Accelerate with medium current 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.940
 Susuto inalco transition to this 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.940
 It is 1 1 9 9 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.360
 do you do seo 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.129
 That's why I have to ask 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.729
 That attachment 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.559
 It's a light oil, right? 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:20.859
 But just surrounded the village requisition people 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:26.199
 The number of cigarettes 37.3 times that of Keiji would be difficult 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.729
 I'm putting together the essence of what I already do 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:32.029
 sent 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.029
 But this still hits the bottom 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.769
 Because four people are twenty four 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.859
 But with each store that helped the most 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.219
 The tobacco grandchild was backed up 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.069
 Bobsleigh is different I chose # 1 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.029
 I think there are many halls because I hate young birds 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.079
 It was with 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.479
 It is such a thing 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.479
 However 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:07.550
 That's
