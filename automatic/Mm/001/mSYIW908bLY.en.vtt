00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.640
 a huge hello to everyone summer flew by 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.099
 and personally I didn't even have time to notice 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.650
 just like one week and approaching 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.679
 study time is coming holiday 1 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.540
 September and not perfectly understandable desire 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.090
 girls in this day look like something 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.969
 especially beautiful so as an option I 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.110
 decided to offer this makeup 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.450
 pink colors 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.079
 I think he is perfect young 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.530
 I looked at the girls such makeup in 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.710
 film princess protection program if not 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.219
 wrong this is a disney movie and there i am 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.329
 noticed is very often used exactly 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.640
 such a makeup plan 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.160
 I hope you will like it in any 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.100
 case I invite you to view as I 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.290
 did this makeup 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.740
 I have already prepared my face for makeup 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.869
 used her led cream from misha 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.380
 fixed it with its compact powder about 30 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.080
 stained 0 1 1 for cheeks i used 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.119
 nyx blush as a shadow base 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.130
 I have a base from Sedona Lace 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.350
 on all moving eyelids I will apply this 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.750
 light shade except external 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.360
 corner of the eye this shade of the palette 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.280
 nicknames to make it more vivid and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.579
 saturated i will use it in 2 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.579
 layer 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.590
 so that in the future there will be no problems with 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.260
 feathering for a start, I will work 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.540
 bold folds and bones for this I'll take 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.540
 flesh shadow from nekit palette 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.120
 in the outer corner of my eye I'll 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.680
 use here such a bright saturated 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.680
 pink eye shadow 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.989
 so that the makeup looked gently I 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.390
 I will shade this shade 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.510
 my task is not to shade the borders 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.280
 colors namely color itself therefore stew 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.280
 we extinguish still we shade 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.620
 after i shaded pink 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.900
 shade I tighten the water in the middle 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.030
 rolling century on a light shade so 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.480
 very smoothly shaped 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.480
 transition 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.950
 you 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.310
 for the lower eyelid I would not advise 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.740
 use some bright shades 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.210
 shadows so for the lower eyelid I'll 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.190
 use all the same natural 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.270
 the shade of the shadows that I used in 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.270
 fold areas 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.479
 in order to give depth to our 

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:07.969
 look and 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.489
 to make our makeup played after all 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:11.269
 brightness i will use black 

00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:13.669
 shadow cast 

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:14.629
 to emphasize the growth line of the upper 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.569
 eyelashes 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:21.429
 my task is not to draw an arrow but simply 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.429
 underline eyelash growth 

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:28.399
 then I blend this line with 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:31.779
 fluffy brush and all the same 

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:31.779
 natural shade of shadows 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.760
 to connect the line top and bottom 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.790
 century I literally put 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:04.710
 light print with bevelled brush 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:08.750
 The outer corner of the eye is not the most important 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.750
 forget to shade this dark shade 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.530
 to complete eye makeup for me 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.080
 need only apply mascara and 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.350
 add light black to the very kink 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.350
 eyebrows 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.840
 our 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:53.569
 for lips i decided to use pink 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:55.460
 Do I shine on this and everything to everyone 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:59.889
 thank you so much for watching and up 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.889
