00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.780
 you will need by roll or a 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.360
 elderly person so I used the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.480
 pasteur machine so that the thickness on 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.390
 the same two years for two pieces of 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:31.099
 size different matches against and a 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:35.040
 small clove paste blue and red 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:38.690
 a cutter and the toothpick 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.690
 the first step will be 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:46.450
 I will take you rest two 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:49.030
 round look always we cut you 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.980
 small round lice in large which 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.290
 is very difficult to explain I you 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.760
 the game so in fact you're going to do 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.800
 against these cuts and the little rats in 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.300
 the better you removed that we did not 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.590
 need 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.950
 here and you keep all the fishermen 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.260
 did that with your four reds and 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.460
 your three rounds white so here I have 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.010
 all my little ones 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.280
 so here I 'm going to superimpose them in 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.260
 function of the so where raining I 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.700
 finished in group docks 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.300
 there it will be white and game and 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.780
 superimposed like this I see there 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.400
 try such good rest and 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.840
 so you go for some breaks and everything 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:37.569
 the world notes at home because these sites 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.569
 in fact you're going to take a red from 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:48.940
 young people were going to return thierry roge them 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:54.400
 white rounds that you have cut 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.400
 before just before the 1st to see 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.360
 still try to make it so 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.460
 that does not make it down to tampico 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.460
 the surplus but still try 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:15.220
 really very close a month there is not 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:15.220
 too much but I know what we are black 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:24.709
 then you will take your like 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:31.880
 that and that's what it is here so it's 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:34.910
 because those here and there where I said 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:42.440
 to simply flatten the tea is very 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:47.660
 simple and so that's my fine dough 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:50.470
 and you will wrap the cake in this 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.470
 fine dough 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.140
 then you can cut so I have 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.000
 already done so that's how he gives he 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.300
 is not super well done but is not 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 not super bad either we go after you 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.370
 can texture is like that if here it's 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.360
 first of all to have a status of vouzan did 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.360
 more shoes of coubisou
