00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
puts it just a little bit thinner than

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.160 
puts it just a little bit thinner than
an<00:00:39.120> eighth<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.360> an<00:00:39.450> inch<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.870> that's<00:00:39.989> what

side they do yeah that's to protect the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.119 
side they do yeah that's to protect the
shine<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.200> polish<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.590> comes<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:49.980> from<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
shine the polish that comes in from the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.430 
shine the polish that comes in from the
factory<00:00:50.340> okay<00:00:51.149> now<00:00:51.449> what<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.140> stainless

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
factory okay now what is it in stainless

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.470 
factory okay now what is it in stainless
steel<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.190> makes<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.640> perfect<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.300> food

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
steel that makes it perfect for the food

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.569 
steel that makes it perfect for the food
industry<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.559> keeps<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> from<00:00:55.920> rusting

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
industry and that keeps it from rusting

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.520 
industry and that keeps it from rusting
well<00:00:57.030> basically<00:00:57.270> stainless<00:00:57.840> steel<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.230> rust

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
well basically stainless steel is rust

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
well basically stainless steel is rust
proof<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.460> won't<00:00:59.670> rust<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.510> hot

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
proof so it won't rust and it's a hot

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.650 
proof so it won't rust and it's a hot
surface<00:01:01.020> non-porous<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.250> food<00:01:02.579> food<00:01:03.239> juices

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
surface non-porous so food food juices

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660 
surface non-porous so food food juices
won't<00:01:03.899> sink<00:01:04.559> into<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> or<00:01:05.040> anything<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
won't sink into it or anything and it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.030 
won't sink into it or anything and it
has<00:01:05.820> good<00:01:06.030> longevity<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.500> mostly<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
has good longevity and it's mostly a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.280 
has good longevity and it's mostly a
nickel<00:01:08.520> alloy<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.450> steel<00:01:09.689> right<00:01:10.020> yeah

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
nickel alloy with the steel right yeah

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.289 
nickel alloy with the steel right yeah
nickel<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> main<00:01:11.369> alloys<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
nickel is one of the main alloys in the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.000 
nickel is one of the main alloys in the
stainless<00:01:12.540> steel<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.560> stands<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
stainless steel I think it stands to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.950 
stainless steel I think it stands to
cook<00:01:14.220> make<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.580> non<00:01:14.729> corrosive<00:01:15.119> what<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:15.900> you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
cook make it non corrosive what do you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.480 
cook make it non corrosive what do you
pay<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.229> goods<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> sheet<00:01:17.220> goods

refer<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.870> shear<00:01:44.000> but<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.150> it<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.420> long

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
refer to as a shear but is it one long

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.970 
refer to as a shear but is it one long
blade<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.200> whole<00:01:46.350> weight<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.710> machine

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
blade the whole weight of the machine

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.670 
blade the whole weight of the machine
there<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.910> 12<00:01:48.420> feet<00:01:48.690> long<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.170> 12<00:01:49.440> foot

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
there but it is 12 feet long the 12 foot

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.070 
there but it is 12 feet long the 12 foot
long<00:01:49.830> against<00:01:50.160> a<00:01:50.280> steel<00:01:51.230> steel<00:01:52.230> blade<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
long against a steel steel blade and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.440 
long against a steel steel blade and
they're<00:01:55.080> referring<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.920> plan<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.730> sheet<00:01:57.150> here

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
they're referring to a plan a sheet here

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.300 
they're referring to a plan a sheet here
yeah<00:01:57.720> what<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.050> call<00:01:58.320> these<00:01:58.530> while<00:01:58.830> we<00:01:59.010> refer

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
yeah what we call these while we refer

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.950 
yeah what we call these while we refer
to<00:01:59.340> these<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.850> breakdown<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.690> is<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
to these is breakdown this is the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.600 
to these is breakdown this is the
engineering<00:02:01.440> from<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.800> office<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.250> comes<00:02:02.430> out

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
engineering from the office it comes out

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.640 
engineering from the office it comes out
in<00:02:02.790> here<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.150> determines<00:02:03.660> cut<00:02:03.840> sizes<00:02:04.140> in

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
in here and it determines cut sizes in

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.650 
in here and it determines cut sizes in
the<00:02:05.310> layout<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> piece<00:02:06.030> all<00:02:06.420> right

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
the layout of the piece all right

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.150 
the layout of the piece all right
they're<00:02:06.900> going<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.170> share<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:07.619> piece<00:02:07.920> here

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
they're going to share this piece here

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.470 
they're going to share this piece here
right<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.640> size<00:02:08.880> length<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.630> width<00:02:11.480> the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
right to size length and width the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.030 
right to size length and width the
sheets<00:02:12.780> got<00:02:13.020> quite<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.320> bit<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.650> weight<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.830> it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
sheets got quite a bit of weight to it

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.350 
sheets got quite a bit of weight to it
so<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.340> takes<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.580> little<00:02:14.700> bit<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.970> line<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.180> up

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
so it takes a little bit to line it up

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.390 
so it takes a little bit to line it up
for<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.630> measurement

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.600 

is<00:02:22.879> this<00:02:23.090> an<00:02:23.269> electric<00:02:23.690> guitar<00:02:24.500> yes<00:02:25.310> it's

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
is this an electric guitar yes it's

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.160 
is this an electric guitar yes it's
electrically<00:02:26.120> powered<00:02:26.390> but<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.930> has<00:02:27.140> a

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
electrically powered but it has a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.350 
electrically powered but it has a
flywheel<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.280> picks<00:02:28.489> up<00:02:28.580> all<00:02:28.819> its<00:02:29.000> tonnage

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
flywheel so it picks up all its tonnage

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.970 
flywheel so it picks up all its tonnage
and<00:02:29.480> inertia<00:02:29.810> from<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.170> flywheel<00:02:30.650> spinning

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
and inertia from the flywheel spinning

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.339 
and inertia from the flywheel spinning
Wow<00:02:33.069> how<00:02:34.069> how<00:02:34.909> much<00:02:35.390> thickness<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.930> steel<00:02:36.140> can

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
Wow how how much thickness of steel can

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.259 
Wow how how much thickness of steel can
it<00:02:36.470> cut<00:02:36.709> this<00:02:37.250> thing<00:02:37.489> here<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.730> big<00:02:38.000> share

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
it cut this thing here is a big share

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.660 
it cut this thing here is a big share
don't<00:02:38.510> cut<00:02:38.690> up<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.930> 1/4<00:02:39.200> gauge<00:02:39.650> capacity<00:02:40.430> full

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
don't cut up to 1/4 gauge capacity full

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
length of the blade at 12:08 in place so

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.500 
length of the blade at 12:08 in place so
it<00:02:46.159> doesn't<00:02:46.430> come<00:02:46.579> down<00:02:46.610> flat<00:02:47.030> but<00:02:47.209> more<00:02:47.390> like

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
it doesn't come down flat but more like

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.509 
it doesn't come down flat but more like
a<00:02:47.540> guillotine<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.500> doesn't<00:02:48.890> come<00:02:49.010> down<00:02:49.190> at<00:02:49.370> an

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
a guillotine it doesn't come down at an

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.160 
a guillotine it doesn't come down at an
angle<00:02:49.670> comes<00:02:50.000> down<00:02:50.180> stop<00:02:50.450> at<00:02:50.629> this<00:02:50.780> end<00:02:50.989> will

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
angle comes down stop at this end will

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.259 
angle comes down stop at this end will
work<00:02:51.349> its<00:02:51.560> way<00:02:51.590> right<00:02:51.890> across<00:02:52.159> great<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:53.060> once

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
work its way right across great so once

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.190 
work its way right across great so once
you<00:02:53.709> Wow<00:02:54.709> once<00:02:55.310> you've<00:02:55.489> cut<00:02:55.730> your<00:02:55.910> sheet<00:02:56.810> metal

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
you Wow once you've cut your sheet metal

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.960 
you Wow once you've cut your sheet metal
your<00:02:57.379> your<00:02:57.560> stainless<00:02:58.010> steel<00:02:58.250> what's<00:02:58.849> the

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
your your stainless steel what's the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.430 
your your stainless steel what's the

next step well then what they do they

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.259 
next step well then what they do they
take<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.829> over<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.099> the<00:03:01.310> layout<00:03:01.640> area<00:03:01.910> on<00:03:02.150> the

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
take it over to the layout area on the

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.400 
take it over to the layout area on the
bench<00:03:02.480> here<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.840> they<00:03:02.900> put<00:03:03.109> it<00:03:03.200> up<00:03:03.290> for

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
bench here and they put it up for

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.240 
bench here and they put it up for
scribing<00:03:05.049> this<00:03:06.049> is<00:03:06.200> what<00:03:06.379> we<00:03:06.500> call<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.920> layout

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
scribing this is what we call the layout

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.220 
scribing this is what we call the layout
station<00:03:07.849> Bob<00:03:10.540> all<00:03:11.540> right<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:11.870> they've<00:03:12.019> just

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
station Bob all right so they've just

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.830 
station Bob all right so they've just
cut<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.560> sheet<00:03:12.890> on<00:03:13.099> the<00:03:13.730> big<00:03:13.940> blade<00:03:14.239> over<00:03:14.450> there

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
cut a sheet on the big blade over there

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.979 
cut a sheet on the big blade over there
and<00:03:15.109> then<00:03:15.379> they're<00:03:15.829> laying<00:03:16.159> out<00:03:16.989> basically

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
and then they're laying out basically

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.080 
and then they're laying out basically
all<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.230> other<00:03:18.379> cuts<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.489> holes<00:03:19.909> and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
all the other cuts and and holes and

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.339 
all the other cuts and and holes and
things<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.420> have<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:20.720> be<00:03:20.750> done<00:03:20.989> in<00:03:21.049> the

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
things that have to be done in the

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.110 
things that have to be done in the
fabricating<00:03:21.950> that's<00:03:22.190> right<00:03:22.459> they<00:03:22.700> take<00:03:22.940> this

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
fabricating that's right they take this

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.030 
fabricating that's right they take this
break<00:03:23.480> down<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.140> they're<00:03:24.470> going<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.709> slide

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
break down and they're going to slide

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.759 
break down and they're going to slide
that<00:03:25.310> piece<00:03:25.640> with<00:03:26.299> this<00:03:26.480> image<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.169> elegantly

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
that piece with this image and elegantly

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.210 
that piece with this image and elegantly
notching<00:03:28.459> bending<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.359> hole<00:03:29.569> locations

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.040 

so<00:03:34.760> that's<00:03:34.940> pretty<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:35.330> a<00:03:35.420> complicated

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
so that's pretty it's a complicated

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.330 
so that's pretty it's a complicated
thing<00:03:36.080> is<00:03:36.320> what<00:03:36.500> you're<00:03:36.620> building<00:03:36.800> here<00:03:37.040> is<00:03:37.310> a

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
thing is what you're building here is a

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.340 
thing is what you're building here is a
three<00:03:37.670> base<00:03:37.910> sink<00:03:38.300> right<00:03:38.540> that's<00:03:38.870> correct

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
three base sink right that's correct

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.190 
three base sink right that's correct
and<00:03:39.440> you've<00:03:40.340> got<00:03:40.550> to<00:03:40.760> precisely<00:03:41.390> locate<00:03:42.020> all

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
and you've got to precisely locate all

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.040 
and you've got to precisely locate all
the<00:03:42.230> bends<00:03:42.710> all<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.580> cuts<00:03:43.820> all<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.660> holes<00:03:44.870> and

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
the bends all the cuts all the holes and

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.360 
the bends all the cuts all the holes and
everything<00:03:45.380> else<00:03:45.500> that<00:03:45.680> goes<00:03:45.740> in<00:03:46.010> there<00:03:46.160> well

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
everything else that goes in there well

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.860 
everything else that goes in there well
this<00:03:46.520> is<00:03:46.700> where<00:03:46.850> it<00:03:46.970> all<00:03:47.030> stops<00:03:47.360> it<00:03:47.510> has<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.780> be

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
this is where it all stops it has to be

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.390 
this is where it all stops it has to be
accurate<00:03:48.080> over<00:03:48.530> here<00:03:48.680> cuz<00:03:48.920> we're<00:03:49.130> held

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
accurate over here cuz we're held

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.300 
accurate over here cuz we're held
between<00:03:49.820> measurements<00:03:50.710> when<00:03:51.710> the<00:03:51.860> product<00:03:52.250> is

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
between measurements when the product is

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.010 
between measurements when the product is
finished<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:52.820> it<00:03:52.940> all<00:03:53.060> starts<00:03:53.480> over<00:03:53.750> here<00:03:53.870> so

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
finished and it all starts over here so

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.240 
finished and it all starts over here so
we've<00:03:54.140> got<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.290> be<00:03:54.350> very<00:03:54.470> accurate<00:03:54.740> over<00:03:55.100> here

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
we've got to be very accurate over here

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.010 
we've got to be very accurate over here
okay<00:03:55.910> then<00:03:56.060> what<00:03:56.210> happens<00:03:56.510> at<00:03:56.660> this<00:03:56.810> station

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
okay then what happens at this station

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.990 
okay then what happens at this station
over<00:03:57.380> here<00:03:57.410> well<00:03:58.010> what<00:03:58.250> we<00:03:58.340> do<00:03:58.520> over<00:03:58.670> here<00:03:58.820> is

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
over here well what we do over here is

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.510 
over here well what we do over here is
we<00:03:59.090> punch<00:03:59.480> various<00:04:00.020> shapes<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:00.560> round<00:04:01.160> holes

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
we punch various shapes and round holes

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.660 
we punch various shapes and round holes
this<00:04:02.060> one<00:04:02.240> here<00:04:02.480> is<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.660> faucet<00:04:03.320> location<00:04:03.860> so

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
this one here is a faucet location so

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.900 
this one here is a faucet location so
this<00:04:05.180> is<00:04:05.570> pneumatic<00:04:06.170> it's<00:04:07.040> a<00:04:07.250> flywheel

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
this is pneumatic it's a flywheel

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:16.660 
this is pneumatic it's a flywheel
operation<00:04:08.750> again<00:04:09.020> I<00:04:09.050> get<00:04:09.320> supply<00:04:09.740> with<00:04:15.670> yellow

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
operation again I get supply with yellow

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.360 
operation again I get supply with yellow
a<00:04:17.000> lot<00:04:17.269> of<00:04:17.420> course<00:04:17.660> there<00:04:17.870> oh<00:04:18.049> yeah<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.739> lot<00:04:19.250> of

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
a lot of course there oh yeah a lot of

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.860 
a lot of course there oh yeah a lot of
resistance<00:04:19.609> of<00:04:19.820> some<00:04:19.970> stamps<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:20.510> stops<00:04:20.750> a

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
resistance of some stamps it stops a

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.340 
resistance of some stamps it stops a
bunch<00:04:21.080> of<00:04:21.230> sand<00:04:22.300> there<00:04:23.300> we<00:04:23.390> go<00:04:23.540> -<00:04:23.870> faucet

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
bunch of sand there we go - faucet

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.670 
bunch of sand there we go - faucet
Hall's

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
Hall's

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.820 
Hall's
okay<00:04:25.640> and<00:04:26.000> then<00:04:26.330> what<00:04:26.540> about<00:04:26.630> back<00:04:26.900> here<00:04:27.290> well

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
okay and then what about back here well

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.980 
okay and then what about back here well
what<00:04:28.340> we<00:04:28.460> do<00:04:28.610> over<00:04:28.880> in<00:04:28.940> this<00:04:29.060> operation<00:04:29.810> is

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
what we do over in this operation is

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.700 
what we do over in this operation is
called<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.980> plasma<00:04:31.460> cutting<00:04:32.560> alright<00:04:33.560> so

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
called the plasma cutting alright so

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.430 
called the plasma cutting alright so
this<00:04:33.830> is<00:04:34.010> how<00:04:34.130> you<00:04:34.190> go<00:04:34.490> about<00:04:34.760> making<00:04:35.440> square

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
this is how you go about making square

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.740 
this is how you go about making square
cuts<00:04:36.740> or<00:04:36.980> round<00:04:37.280> cuts<00:04:37.580> in<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:38.270> interior<00:04:38.720> of

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
cuts or round cuts in the interior of

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.480 
cuts or round cuts in the interior of
the<00:04:38.900> sheet<00:04:39.200> exact<00:04:39.800> because<00:04:40.010> we<00:04:40.130> have<00:04:40.220> no<00:04:40.370> way

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
the sheet exact because we have no way

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.280 
the sheet exact because we have no way
of<00:04:40.520> working<00:04:40.790> our<00:04:41.000> way<00:04:41.030> in<00:04:41.240> from<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.540> edge<00:04:41.660> this

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
of working our way in from the edge this

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.080 
of working our way in from the edge this
will<00:04:42.500> make<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.710> cut<00:04:43.070> right<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.730> middle<00:04:43.910> and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
will make a cut right in the middle and

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.550 
will make a cut right in the middle and
that's<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.330> sink<00:04:44.600> cavity<00:04:45.050> he's<00:04:45.169> cutting<00:04:45.470> out

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
that's a sink cavity he's cutting out

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.300 
that's a sink cavity he's cutting out
will<00:04:45.770> weld<00:04:45.980> the<00:04:46.070> sink<00:04:46.310> right<00:04:48.070> it's<00:04:49.070> cutting

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
will weld the sink right it's cutting

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.250 
will weld the sink right it's cutting
the<00:04:49.370> corners<00:04:49.760> for<00:04:49.940> us<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.390> he's<00:04:50.540> just<00:04:50.780> using<00:04:51.020> a

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
the corners for us and he's just using a

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.890 
the corners for us and he's just using a
little<00:04:51.460> stamped<00:04:52.460> out<00:04:52.580> skirt<00:04:52.910> up<00:04:53.060> just<00:04:53.660> as<00:04:53.780> a

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
little stamped out skirt up just as a

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.520 
little stamped out skirt up just as a
jig<00:04:55.390> go<00:04:56.390> through<00:04:56.570> all<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.810> corners<00:04:57.140> for<00:04:57.350> us<00:04:57.440> to

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
jig go through all the corners for us to

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:04.130 
jig go through all the corners for us to
help<00:04:57.710> tie<00:04:57.890> them<00:04:58.040> together

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.380 

so<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.800> plasma<00:05:05.190> cutter<00:05:05.310> basically<00:05:05.910> is<00:05:06.030> super

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
so the plasma cutter basically is super

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.780 
so the plasma cutter basically is super
heating<00:05:06.720> it<00:05:06.840> and<00:05:07.230> melting<00:05:07.860> right<00:05:08.040> through<00:05:08.280> to

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
heating it and melting right through to

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.460 
heating it and melting right through to
stainless<00:05:09.030> steel<00:05:09.360> exactly<00:05:10.110> now<00:05:10.230> we<00:05:10.290> have

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
stainless steel exactly now we have

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.110 
stainless steel exactly now we have
compressed<00:05:10.920> air<00:05:11.130> in<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.280> bottle<00:05:11.760> that<00:05:11.850> blows

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
compressed air in the bottle that blows

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.910 
compressed air in the bottle that blows
that<00:05:12.390> slag<00:05:12.690> away<00:05:13.050> at<00:05:13.200> the<00:05:13.320> point<00:05:13.620> of<00:05:13.770> its

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
that slag away at the point of its

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:42.790 
that slag away at the point of its
melting<00:05:14.310> I<00:05:14.520> see<00:05:14.960> makes<00:05:15.960> a<00:05:16.110> nice<00:05:16.290> neat<00:05:16.590> cut

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.499 

all<00:05:43.800> right<00:05:44.160> so<00:05:44.370> that's<00:05:44.580> an<00:05:44.729> interior<00:05:45.060> cut

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
all right so that's an interior cut

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.180 
all right so that's an interior cut
we've<00:05:45.720> seen<00:05:45.960> holes<00:05:46.289> punched<00:05:46.680> we've<00:05:46.949> seen

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
we've seen holes punched we've seen

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.219 
we've seen holes punched we've seen
perimeter<00:05:48.060> cuts<00:05:48.300> what<00:05:48.569> about<00:05:48.750> when<00:05:48.870> you<00:05:48.960> bend

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
perimeter cuts what about when you bend

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.110 
perimeter cuts what about when you bend
the<00:05:49.500> stuff<00:05:49.770> well<00:05:50.220> that<00:05:50.370> happens<00:05:50.789> over<00:05:51.090> here

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
the stuff well that happens over here

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.700 
the stuff well that happens over here
Bob<00:05:51.479> at<00:05:51.630> this<00:05:51.780> machine<00:05:51.960> called<00:05:52.380> the<00:05:52.500> power

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
Bob at this machine called the power

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.670 
Bob at this machine called the power
brake<00:05:53.690> all<00:05:54.690> right<00:05:54.990> now<00:05:55.110> this<00:05:55.289> is<00:05:55.410> a<00:05:55.440> pretty

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
brake all right now this is a pretty

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.219 
brake all right now this is a pretty
impressive<00:05:56.009> break<00:05:56.580> yes<00:05:58.849> and<00:06:00.020> what<00:06:01.020> are<00:06:01.139> we

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
impressive break yes and what are we

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:01.879 
impressive break yes and what are we
doing<00:06:01.470> with<00:06:01.590> it

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
doing with it

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.390 
doing with it
what's<00:06:02.160> the<00:06:03.139> putting<00:06:04.139> a<00:06:04.259> roll<00:06:04.530> in<00:06:04.830> that<00:06:05.009> it's<00:06:05.250> a

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
what's the putting a roll in that it's a

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.339 
what's the putting a roll in that it's a
it's<00:06:05.639> a<00:06:05.759> two-step<00:06:06.330> process<00:06:06.630> now<00:06:07.169> that's

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
it's a two-step process now that's

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:08.689 
it's a two-step process now that's
around<00:06:07.590> 90<00:06:07.889> degrees<00:06:07.919> they'll<00:06:08.310> hit<00:06:08.490> it<00:06:08.610> a

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
around 90 degrees they'll hit it a

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.820 
around 90 degrees they'll hit it a
second<00:06:09.180> time<00:06:09.360> it'll<00:06:09.930> come<00:06:10.139> around<00:06:10.259> 180

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
second time it'll come around 180

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.469 
second time it'll come around 180
degrees<00:06:13.070> so<00:06:14.070> that<00:06:14.099> that's<00:06:14.490> how<00:06:14.729> you<00:06:14.789> make<00:06:15.150> the

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
degrees so that that's how you make the

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.080 
degrees so that that's how you make the
kind<00:06:15.990> of<00:06:16.080> the<00:06:16.139> bullnose<00:06:16.590> or<00:06:17.039> circular<00:06:17.699> edges

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
kind of the bullnose or circular edges

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.999 
kind of the bullnose or circular edges
that's<00:06:18.479> what<00:06:18.660> we<00:06:18.750> call<00:06:18.960> as<00:06:19.139> a<00:06:19.169> bullnose<00:06:19.560> edge

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:20.009 
that's what we call as a bullnose edge

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:26.750 
that's what we call as a bullnose edge
it's<00:06:20.430> about<00:06:20.580> half<00:06:20.820> a<00:06:20.910> circle<00:06:21.150> basically<00:06:21.479> yeah

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.640 

oh<00:06:26.820> yeah<00:06:27.330> so<00:06:27.720> you<00:06:27.810> can<00:06:27.960> control<00:06:28.320> how<00:06:28.470> much

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
oh yeah so you can control how much

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.380 
oh yeah so you can control how much
pressure<00:06:28.920> he<00:06:29.160> does<00:06:29.580> with<00:06:29.760> the<00:06:29.880> foot<00:06:30.090> pedal

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
pressure he does with the foot pedal

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.430 
pressure he does with the foot pedal
over<00:06:30.600> there<00:06:30.750> it's<00:06:30.930> a<00:06:30.990> foot<00:06:31.200> pedal<00:06:31.380> right<00:06:33.440> now

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
over there it's a foot pedal right now

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.080 
over there it's a foot pedal right now
how<00:06:34.620> do<00:06:34.680> you<00:06:34.770> rate<00:06:35.040> these<00:06:35.280> these<00:06:35.640> instruments

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
how do you rate these these instruments

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.090 
how do you rate these these instruments
these<00:06:36.480> brakes<00:06:37.050> I<00:06:37.320> mean<00:06:37.470> I'm<00:06:37.620> used<00:06:37.770> to<00:06:37.860> seeing

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
these brakes I mean I'm used to seeing

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.010 
these brakes I mean I'm used to seeing
the<00:06:38.340> kind<00:06:39.000> of<00:06:39.090> roofers<00:06:39.420> carry<00:06:39.660> around<00:06:39.780> in

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
the kind of roofers carry around in

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.270 
the kind of roofers carry around in
their<00:06:40.140> truck<00:06:40.410> oh<00:06:40.560> there's<00:06:40.800> a<00:06:40.860> little<00:06:40.950> pretty

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 
it's all welded construction now why is

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.950 
it's all welded construction now why is
this<00:07:20.040> galvanized<00:07:20.610> well<00:07:21.060> it's<00:07:21.240> a<00:07:21.360> cost<00:07:21.630> saver

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
this galvanized well it's a cost saver

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.510 
this galvanized well it's a cost saver
because<00:07:22.170> it's<00:07:22.530> underneath<00:07:22.950> and<00:07:23.280> you<00:07:23.340> don't

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 
because it's underneath and you don't

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.370 
because it's underneath and you don't
see<00:07:23.790> it<00:07:23.940> so<00:07:23.970> why<00:07:24.300> waste<00:07:24.540> the<00:07:24.690> stainless<00:07:25.170> steel

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 
see it so why waste the stainless steel

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.020 
see it so why waste the stainless steel
right<00:07:25.740> and<00:07:25.980> did<00:07:26.070> you<00:07:26.160> say<00:07:26.310> this<00:07:26.400> was<00:07:26.460> our<00:07:26.670> field

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.030 
right and did you say this was our field

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.060 
right and did you say this was our field
