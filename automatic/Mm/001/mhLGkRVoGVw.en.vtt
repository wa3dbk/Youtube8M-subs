00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.170 
hammock model it's an 8 to 5 I usually
ride<00:00:17.980> in<00:00:18.220> 8<00:00:18.550> or<00:00:18.849> an<00:00:19.689> 8<00:00:19.869> -<00:00:20.200> but<00:00:20.800> uh<00:00:20.829> on<00:00:21.430> mega<00:00:21.790> just

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
ride in 8 or an 8 - but uh on mega just

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.089 
ride in 8 or an 8 - but uh on mega just
needs<00:00:22.360> to<00:00:22.480> be<00:00:22.599> so<00:00:22.779> much<00:00:22.899> bigger<00:00:23.140> and<00:00:23.470> I<00:00:23.710> ride<00:00:23.950> it
