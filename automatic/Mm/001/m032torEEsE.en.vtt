00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.780 

so<00:00:02.879> sometimes<00:00:03.449> hens<00:00:03.899> build<00:00:04.350> their<00:00:04.650> nests<00:00:05.220> way

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
so sometimes hens build their nests way

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.810 
so sometimes hens build their nests way
too<00:00:05.850> deep<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.980> an<00:00:08.130> example<00:00:08.550> of

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
too deep and this is an example of

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.450 
too deep and this is an example of
unless<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.050> too<00:00:10.440> deep<00:00:10.679> if<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.040> could<00:00:11.219> see

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
unless that is too deep if you could see

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.289 
unless that is too deep if you could see
in<00:00:11.550> there<00:00:11.900> she<00:00:12.900> doesn't<00:00:13.380> have<00:00:13.679> much<00:00:14.179> lining<00:00:15.179> in

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
in there she doesn't have much lining in

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.439 
in there she doesn't have much lining in
the<00:00:15.389> nest<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:16.039> it<00:00:17.039> goes<00:00:17.220> down<00:00:17.550> down<00:00:18.029> down

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
the nest and it goes down down down

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.859 
the nest and it goes down down down
pretty<00:00:18.960> darn<00:00:19.260> deep<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.119> not<00:00:21.119> padding<00:00:21.660> at<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
pretty darn deep and not padding at the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.769 
pretty darn deep and not padding at the
bottom<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.220> not<00:00:24.090> me<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.269> good<00:00:24.510> three

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
bottom so it's just not me a good three

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.150 
bottom so it's just not me a good three
inches<00:00:24.810> deep<00:00:25.260> from<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> top

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
inches deep from the top

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.300 
inches deep from the top
and<00:00:26.609> that's<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.779> hard<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.410> eggs

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
and that's going to be hard for the eggs

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.889 
and that's going to be hard for the eggs
to<00:00:29.640> incubate<00:00:30.289> in<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.560> nest<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.520> what<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.450> in

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to incubate in that nest so what I do in

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.330 
to incubate in that nest so what I do in
this<00:00:34.050> case<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.610> just<00:00:35.610> put<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:37.040> padding<00:00:38.040> in

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
this case is just put some padding in

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.069 
this case is just put some padding in
there<00:00:39.590> I've<00:00:40.590> lined<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.489> best<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.210> way<00:00:42.390> she

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
there I've lined the best the way she

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.310 
there I've lined the best the way she
should<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.530> lined<00:00:43.770> her<00:00:43.980> nest<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.550> then<00:00:45.320> so

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
should have lined her nest but then so

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.020 
should have lined her nest but then so
just<00:00:46.350> take<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> little<00:00:47.309> bit<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.820> actually

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
just take a little bit this is actually

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.290 
just take a little bit this is actually
the<00:00:51.030> tail<00:00:54.320> it's<00:00:55.320> what<00:00:55.500> both<00:00:55.680> finches<00:00:56.129> use<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the tail it's what both finches use to

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.390 
the tail it's what both finches use to
line<00:00:57.480> their<00:00:57.690> nests<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:59.370> I<00:01:00.210> just

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
line their nests and I just

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.660 
line their nests and I just
cut<00:01:02.120> it<00:01:02.270> down<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:02.480> little<00:01:02.750> bit<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.230> that<00:01:03.670> when

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
cut it down a little bit so that when

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.300 
cut it down a little bit so that when
the<00:01:04.820> egg<00:01:04.970> goes<00:01:06.370> on<00:01:07.370> top<00:01:07.700> of<00:01:07.940> it<00:01:08.920> there<00:01:09.920> will<00:01:10.100> not

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
the egg goes on top of it there will not

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.950 
the egg goes on top of it there will not
be<00:01:10.340> any<00:01:10.670> areas<00:01:11.420> that<00:01:11.450> they<00:01:11.960> could<00:01:12.200> fall<00:01:12.380> down

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
be any areas that they could fall down

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.660 
be any areas that they could fall down
underneath<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:15.979> head<00:01:16.130> will<00:01:16.250> go<00:01:16.400> in<00:01:16.520> there

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
underneath and the head will go in there

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.770 
underneath and the head will go in there
and<00:01:16.729> sit<00:01:17.120> and<00:01:17.950> fuss<00:01:18.950> around<00:01:19.130> with<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:20.479> too<00:01:20.750> and

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
and sit and fuss around with it too and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.990 
and sit and fuss around with it too and
get<00:01:21.110> it<00:01:21.260> exactly<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.860> way<00:01:21.979> she<00:01:22.010> wants<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.760> so

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
get it exactly the way she wants it so

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.700 
get it exactly the way she wants it so
now<00:01:23.990> if<00:01:24.170> we<00:01:24.229> go<00:01:24.500> back<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.920> look<00:01:25.040> at<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.310> nest

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
now if we go back and look at the nest

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.500 
now if we go back and look at the nest
it's<00:01:27.710> not<00:01:27.979> as<00:01:28.160> deep<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.790> it<00:01:29.030> looks<00:01:29.210> like<00:01:29.270> the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
it's not as deep and it looks like the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.040 
it's not as deep and it looks like the
eggs<00:01:29.690> will<00:01:29.990> have<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.170> nice<00:01:30.560> soft<00:01:32.380> padded<00:01:33.380> area

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
eggs will have a nice soft padded area

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.190 
eggs will have a nice soft padded area
that<00:01:36.050> will<00:01:36.200> cushion<00:01:36.380> them<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:38.200> eventually

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
that will cushion them and eventually

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.950 
that will cushion them and eventually
will<00:01:39.350> cushion<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.649> babies<00:01:40.009> after<00:01:40.190> they<00:01:40.430> hatch

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
will cushion the babies after they hatch

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.719 
will cushion the babies after they hatch
so<00:01:41.960> that's<00:01:42.170> what<00:01:42.410> I<00:01:42.440> do<00:01:42.590> when<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.310> look<00:01:43.520> at<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
so that's what I do when I look at the

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.359 
so that's what I do when I look at the
nest<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.180> see<00:01:44.300> that<00:01:44.479> it's<00:01:44.630> too<00:01:44.869> deep<00:01:45.340> so<00:01:46.340> you

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
nest and see that it's too deep so you

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.859 
nest and see that it's too deep so you
always<00:01:46.580> want<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:46.910> look<00:01:47.030> at<00:01:47.149> your<00:01:47.300> nest<00:01:47.479> because

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
always want to look at your nest because

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.930 
always want to look at your nest because
sometimes<00:01:48.320> they<00:01:48.500> are<00:01:48.619> too<00:01:48.830> deep<00:01:49.070> sometimes

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
sometimes they are too deep sometimes

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.240 
sometimes they are too deep sometimes
the<00:01:50.149> hen<00:01:50.420> will<00:01:50.630> actually<00:01:51.050> build<00:01:51.259> a<00:01:51.590> craziness

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
the hen will actually build a craziness

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.950 
the hen will actually build a craziness
too<00:01:52.670> high<00:01:52.880> but<00:01:53.119> most<00:01:53.330> of<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.479> time<00:01:53.660> it's<00:01:53.869> gonna

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
too high but most of the time it's gonna

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.010 
too high but most of the time it's gonna
be<00:01:54.340> just<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.460> little<00:01:55.490> too<00:01:55.729> deep<00:01:56.119> if<00:01:56.360> they<00:01:56.810> don't

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
be just a little too deep if they don't

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.719 
be just a little too deep if they don't
build<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.380> nest<00:01:57.590> right<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.310> what<00:01:58.550> you're

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
build the nest right and and what you're

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.090 
build the nest right and and what you're
seeing<00:01:58.910> here<00:01:59.000> if<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.229> can<00:02:00.470> see<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.800> with<00:02:00.979> the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
seeing here if you can see that with the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.150 
seeing here if you can see that with the
light<00:02:01.130> I'm<00:02:01.430> trying<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:01.850> get<00:02:01.970> in<00:02:02.090> there<00:02:03.100> this<00:02:04.100> is

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
light I'm trying to get in there this is

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.190 
light I'm trying to get in there this is
a<00:02:04.310> good<00:02:04.550> nest<00:02:04.759> right<00:02:05.000> here<00:02:05.270> this<00:02:05.630> is<00:02:05.780> about<00:02:05.899> the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
a good nest right here this is about the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.109 
a good nest right here this is about the
way<00:02:06.319> you<00:02:06.380> want<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:06.800> so<00:02:07.280> if<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.459> can<00:02:07.640> get<00:02:07.789> them

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
way you want it so if you can get them

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.630 
way you want it so if you can get them
what's<00:02:08.569> your<00:02:08.750> nest<00:02:08.929> look<00:02:09.110> like<00:02:09.259> that

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
what's your nest look like that

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.070 
what's your nest look like that
sometimes<00:02:10.640> they<00:02:10.819> don't<00:02:11.060> build<00:02:11.450> much<00:02:11.810> of<00:02:11.990> a

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
sometimes they don't build much of a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.070 
sometimes they don't build much of a
nest<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.590> that's<00:02:13.130> okay<00:02:13.490> too<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:14.030> mean<00:02:14.630> I've<00:02:14.870> got

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080

and then you will get hens that build a

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.910 
and then you will get hens that build a
nicer<00:02:52.160> nests<00:02:52.810> this<00:02:53.810> hand<00:02:54.110> is<00:02:54.230> built<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.590> really

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.830 
lining in the middle and on the outside
she's<00:03:03.680> got<00:03:03.920> all<00:03:04.160> her<00:03:05.380> more<00:03:06.790> thick<00:03:07.840> firmer

she's got all her more thick firmer
nesting<00:03:09.500> material<00:03:09.890> on<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.069> outside<00:03:10.099> so<00:03:10.879> this

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
nesting material on the outside so this

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.220 
nesting material on the outside so this
is<00:03:11.689> like<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.230> ideal<00:03:12.260> nest<00:03:13.159> right<00:03:13.370> here

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
is like the ideal nest right here

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.660 
is like the ideal nest right here
but<00:03:14.409> as<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.650> can<00:03:14.769> see<00:03:14.830> hens<00:03:15.190> will<00:03:15.370> make<00:03:15.519> all

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
but as you can see hens will make all

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.330 
but as you can see hens will make all
different<00:03:15.790> kinds<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.269> nuts<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:17.040> any<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.220> them

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
different kinds of nuts and any of them

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.229 
different kinds of nuts and any of them
are<00:03:18.489> okay<00:03:18.849> as<00:03:19.000> long<00:03:19.269> as<00:03:20.400> their<00:03:21.400> brood<00:03:21.790> patches

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
are okay as long as their brood patches

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.820 
are okay as long as their brood patches
against<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.690> eggs<00:03:22.840> so<00:03:23.200> when<00:03:23.379> it<00:03:23.470> gets<00:03:23.650> too

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
against the eggs so when it gets too

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.430 
against the eggs so when it gets too
deep<00:03:24.010> like<00:03:24.040> that<00:03:24.250> one<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.549> showed<00:03:24.879> you<00:03:24.940> just<00:03:25.930> put

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
deep like that one I showed you just put

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.830 
deep like that one I showed you just put
a<00:03:26.470> little<00:03:26.799> bit<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.069> fluff<00:03:27.879> in<00:03:28.060> there<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.480> little

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
a little bit of fluff in there a little

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.220 
a little bit of fluff in there a little
bit<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.140> padding<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.680> you'll<00:03:29.860> be<00:03:30.010> fine
