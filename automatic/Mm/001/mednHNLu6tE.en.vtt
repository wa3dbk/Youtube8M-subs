and<00:04:04.190> I'm<00:04:04.640> invented<00:04:05.450> a<00:04:05.600> game<00:04:05.630> they'll

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
and I'm invented a game they'll

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.140 
and I'm invented a game they'll
incorporate<00:04:06.650> both<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.430> headbands<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.030> the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
incorporate both the headbands and the

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.030 
incorporate both the headbands and the
arrow<00:04:08.360> so<00:04:08.840> basically<00:04:09.350> it's<00:04:09.470> laser<00:04:09.830> tag

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
arrow so basically it's laser tag

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.040 
arrow so basically it's laser tag
instead<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.550> a<00:04:10.610> laser<00:04:10.820> gun<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.239> have<00:04:11.480> this<00:04:11.720> bow

instead of a laser gun you have this bow
and<00:04:12.080> arrow<00:04:12.470> but<00:04:13.130> it's<00:04:13.250> gonna<00:04:13.400> be<00:04:13.940> a<00:04:13.970> laser<00:04:14.390> tag

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
and arrow but it's gonna be a laser tag

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.840 
and arrow but it's gonna be a laser tag
arrow<00:04:15.080> and<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.590> don't<00:04:15.769> have<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.100> like<00:04:16.280> hit
