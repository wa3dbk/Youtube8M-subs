00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.400
 f then today I had to talk about something really really interesting 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.109
 a thing I am using lately is also a lovely discovery 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:15.589
 signs you know you are streaked crispi I think by now you know of 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:16.570
 by heart 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.029
 so this thing actually made me discover it a year 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.229
 mariolina there is a girl from the forum in girona 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.090
 rt in fact used his product cited the book aion the package 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.430
 for it a little aku 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.520
 I'm experimenting varmo ud in fact I bought it already for a while verona - 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.860
 you spoke immediately because I'm still experiencing it and it's one thing 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.590
 really really good you know that I do 3000 and 3004 for the hair and there 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.920
 I always talk about that too. I want to share because I find it formidable 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.240
 here it is 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.170
 then 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.820
 to powdered milk for infants if this is practically what you are 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.960
 damned 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.379
 in fact you can read is a powdered disease for infants later affinity 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.270
 this someone of the blow when it must be said 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.530
 and it is number one then I tell you already that this milk powder you if it 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.250
 you want to try it out of books but where you can find it all 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.430
 women if you see other market there are various markedly confused ones 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.520
 obviously then you don't have to take them who we should not viviano we must 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.260
 give 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.490
 roast children that there is from here we take the thing more with one more thing 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.860
 economic with try this one of the group that in fact and 900 grams of 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.860
 product and costs around 8 hours euroma 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.440
 I have 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.750
 night to you too I would say that it's too much I think that soon it's not too much 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.070
 because if you make a point it costs like 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.510
 for less than one euro every 100 grams of winding producer I don't think it is 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.340
 dead - things that really a lot to the quantity 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.380
 and drink badly if we don't deliver it deaf or protect well here I think that to 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.780
 end of the year 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.310
 avenida things track but there were only this in smaller pencil 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.020
 big so i had to come here and now but in the end i think that not 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.020
 I will eat also because I have tried it also see how 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:13.859
 the fantastic king from megaupload galaxy - just like the galatine son I find it 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.269
 fantastic at least I also eat back sincerely 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.239
 then this crazy 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.060
 webpatente you can find it also from other brands rm the cheapest this 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.400
 framework completed I however offer many girls have found the missile 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.959
 that constant of - listing even in ethnic stores 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.469
 so maybe you can also see something cheaper than 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.050
 live phone you find yourself falling introduced puts on your head from the cup 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.600
 at the same price will also be the number two things from 6 to 12 months contains - 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.589

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.009
 why I stand between the number one of the puppa 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.080
 then this broken bread for those who go to do good 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.230
 because the accounts - mainly the alien force + stainless fabers ce 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.129

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.359
