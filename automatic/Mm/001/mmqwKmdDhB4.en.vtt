00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
going to break down this groove into

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
going to break down this groove into
three<00:00:53.190> sections<00:00:53.430> although<00:00:54.150> it<00:00:54.269> takes<00:00:54.420> place

over<00:00:54.839> two<00:00:55.079> bars<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.589> best<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.040> spend<00:00:56.250> a

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
over two bars it's best that we spend a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.439

the<00:00:57.780> snare<00:00:57.960> drum<00:00:58.260> sort<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.500> halfway<00:00:58.680> through

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the groove so what I thought we'd look

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.439 
the groove so what I thought we'd look
at<00:01:00.809> first<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.410> beats<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.969> beat<00:01:03.149> three

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
at first is beats one up to beat three

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.180 
at first is beats one up to beat three
so<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.930> first<00:01:04.199> initial<00:01:04.440> snare<00:01:04.800> here<00:01:05.009> and

these accents in the right place and it
goes<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.069> this

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.090 

or<00:01:59.540> at<00:01:59.690> least<00:01:59.720> I<00:01:59.930> think<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.230> does<00:02:00.380> anyway<00:02:00.740> so

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
or at least I think it does anyway so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.980 
or at least I think it does anyway so
we're<00:02:01.190> going<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.400> do<00:02:01.460> an<00:02:01.550> accent<00:02:01.970> on<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.210> on

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
we're going to do an accent on the on

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.300 
we're going to do an accent on the on
beat<00:02:03.290> three<00:02:03.530> with<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:03.710> right<00:02:03.890> hand<00:02:04.160> but

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
beat three with the right hand but

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.410 
beat three with the right hand but
you're<00:02:04.430> gonna<00:02:04.520> be<00:02:04.610> our<00:02:04.670> first<00:02:04.910> note<00:02:05.180> on<00:02:05.330> the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
you're gonna be our first note on the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.859 
you're gonna be our first note on the
snare<00:02:05.630> drum<00:02:05.900> when<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:06.380> go<00:02:06.560> three<00:02:07.160> E<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.869> AH

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
four E and AH one E and so we've got

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.440 
four E and AH one E and so we've got
most<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.490> our<00:02:16.610> accents<00:02:17.030> are<00:02:17.120> coming<00:02:17.300> on<00:02:17.390> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.760 
got an accent on three and then one and
the<00:02:28.970> end<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.330> one<00:02:29.540> if<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.380> want<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.620> sort<00:02:30.740> of

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
the end of one if you want to sort of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.810 
the end of one if you want to sort of
break<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.070> down<00:02:31.160> like<00:02:31.220> this<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.580> probably

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
break it down like this it probably

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.900 
break it down like this it probably
usually<00:02:31.910> think<00:02:32.270> right<00:02:32.810> left<00:02:33.560> left<00:02:33.890> left<00:02:34.580> right

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
usually think right left left left right

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.930 
usually think right left left left right
left<00:02:35.570> right<00:02:35.930> left<00:02:36.110> that's<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:37.640> if<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.820> want

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
left right left that's it so if you want

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.490 
left right left that's it so if you want
to<00:02:38.000> think<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.270> it<00:02:38.300> like<00:02:38.360> this<00:02:38.690> is<00:02:38.959> right<00:02:39.260> to

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
to think of it like this is right to

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.910 
to think of it like this is right to
left<00:02:39.770> left<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:44.350> then<00:02:45.350> once<00:02:45.590> you've<00:02:45.740> got<00:02:45.890> that

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
left left and then once you've got that

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.740 
left left and then once you've got that
pot<00:02:46.280> there<00:02:46.520> we're<00:02:47.000> going<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.180> move<00:02:47.300> on<00:02:47.510> what

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
pot there we're going to move on what

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.930 
pot there we're going to move on what
going<00:02:47.900> on<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.260> will<00:02:48.410> be<00:02:48.740> too<00:02:49.130> okay<00:02:49.550> it<00:02:49.760> gets

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
going on to it will be too okay it gets

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.510 
going on to it will be too okay it gets
a<00:02:50.030> little<00:02:50.180> bit<00:02:50.390> simpler<00:02:51.230> but<00:02:51.770> we're<00:02:52.430> gonna

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
a little bit simpler but we're gonna

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.830 
a little bit simpler but we're gonna
have<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.700> start<00:02:52.940> alternating<00:02:53.390> what<00:02:53.750> we're

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
have to start alternating what we're

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.480 
have to start alternating what we're
going<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.020> do<00:02:54.140> for<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.380> end<00:02:54.560> because<00:02:54.770> in<00:02:55.370> the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
going to do for the end because in the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.710 
going to do for the end because in the
track<00:02:56.350> Nathan<00:02:57.350> follow<00:02:58.160> he'll<00:02:58.640> follow<00:02:59.180> will<00:02:59.450> I

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
track Nathan follow he'll follow will I

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.440 
track Nathan follow he'll follow will I
think<00:02:59.990> that's<00:03:00.080> his<00:03:00.230> name<00:03:00.410> he<00:03:01.010> he<00:03:01.820> sort<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.090> just

okay kick drums nice need to remember
just<00:03:56.590> lands<00:03:56.830> on<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.040> right<00:03:57.220> hand<00:03:57.460> on<00:03:57.700> beat<00:03:57.910> two

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
just lands on the right hand on beat two

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.040 
just lands on the right hand on beat two
and<00:03:58.330> then<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.510> end<00:03:58.660> of<00:03:58.840> 2<00:03:58.990> and<00:04:00.420> then<00:04:01.420> that's

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
and then the end of 2 and then that's

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.690 
and then the end of 2 and then that's
pretty<00:04:02.320> much<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:02.800> if<00:04:02.950> we<00:04:03.040> just<00:04:03.190> play<00:04:03.430> that

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
pretty much it so if we just play that

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.280 
pretty much it so if we just play that
with<00:04:04.060> what<00:04:04.240> we<00:04:04.330> did<00:04:04.540> for<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.780> first<00:04:04.840> measure

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
with what we did for the first measure

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.550 
with what we did for the first measure
we've<00:04:06.010> pretty<00:04:06.280> much<00:04:06.370> got<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:08.050> know<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.230> basic

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
we've pretty much got you know the basic

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.990 
we've pretty much got you know the basic
concepts<00:04:09.010> of<00:04:09.070> this<00:04:09.190> actual<00:04:09.430> group<00:04:09.610> so<00:04:09.820> here<00:04:09.940> we

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
concepts of this actual group so here we

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:23.220 
concepts of this actual group so here we
go<00:04:21.150> just<00:04:22.150> open<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.510> hi-hat<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.810> bit<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.110> get

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
go just open the hi-hat a bit to get

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:41.700 
go just open the hi-hat a bit to get
luck<00:04:23.410> in<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.560> intro<00:04:39.960> ok<00:04:40.960> so<00:04:41.230> we've<00:04:41.350> also<00:04:41.440> got<00:04:41.680> a

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
luck in the intro ok so we've also got a

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.110 
luck in the intro ok so we've also got a
couple<00:04:41.920> of<00:04:42.040> other<00:04:42.130> options<00:04:42.550> what<00:04:42.730> we<00:04:42.820> can<00:04:42.970> also

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
couple of other options what we can also

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.550 
couple of other options what we can also
do<00:04:43.480> is<00:04:44.130> just<00:04:45.130> play<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:46.660> snare<00:04:46.720> drums<00:04:47.200> on<00:04:47.440> the

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
do is just play the snare drums on the

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.350 
do is just play the snare drums on the
three<00:04:47.950> and<00:04:48.220> then<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.520> e<00:04:48.550> of<00:04:48.790> three<00:04:49.090> so<00:04:49.300> I'm

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
three and then the e of three so I'm

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.000 
three and then the e of three so I'm
going<00:04:49.390> to<00:04:49.510> get<00:04:49.660> this<00:04:52.110> so<00:04:53.110> get<00:04:53.260> this<00:04:53.380> three<00:04:53.800> E

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
going to get this so get this three E

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.450 
going to get this so get this three E
and<00:04:54.100> a<00:04:54.850> four<00:04:55.530> note<00:04:56.530> you<00:04:56.860> can<00:04:56.890> even<00:04:57.190> just<00:04:57.280> let

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
and a four note you can even just let

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.150 
and a four note you can even just let
that<00:04:57.580> hi-hat<00:04:57.820> ring<00:04:58.270> out<00:04:58.420> for<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.750> entire<00:04:59.160> beat

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
that hi-hat ring out for the entire beat

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.550 
that hi-hat ring out for the entire beat
for<00:05:00.400> or<00:05:00.640> what<00:05:01.630> you<00:05:01.720> can<00:05:01.990> do<00:05:02.140> as<00:05:02.260> well<00:05:02.440> as<00:05:02.470> you

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
for or what you can do as well as you

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.120 
for or what you can do as well as you
can<00:05:02.740> just<00:05:02.950> sort<00:05:03.040> of<00:05:03.130> go<00:05:03.310> three<00:05:03.790> E<00:05:04.030> and<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:05.080> four<00:05:05.140> E

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
can just sort of go three E and a four E

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.450 
can just sort of go three E and a four E
and<00:05:06.810> it's<00:05:07.810> played<00:05:08.230> at<00:05:08.350> quite<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.590> rapid<00:05:08.950> pace<00:05:08.980> so

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
and it's played at quite a rapid pace so

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.710 
and it's played at quite a rapid pace so
you<00:05:09.730> know<00:05:09.850> it's<00:05:10.000> not<00:05:10.090> that<00:05:10.150> sound<00:05:10.390> too<00:05:10.600> too

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
you know it's not that sound too too

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.390 
you know it's not that sound too too
similar<00:05:10.930> but<00:05:11.140> I'll<00:05:11.260> give<00:05:11.410> you<00:05:11.530> an<00:05:11.890> example<00:05:11.980> of

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
similar but I'll give you an example of

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.130 
similar but I'll give you an example of
both<00:05:12.670> so<00:05:12.940> here<00:05:13.090> we<00:05:13.120> go<00:05:13.270> I'll<00:05:13.480> include<00:05:13.960> the

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
both so here we go I'll include the

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:28.810 
both so here we go I'll include the
whole<00:05:14.230> Grove

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.980 

okay<00:05:29.820> so<00:05:29.880> every<00:05:30.330> now<00:05:30.420> and<00:05:30.510> again<00:05:30.540> I'll<00:05:30.840> just

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
okay so every now and again I'll just

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.780 
okay so every now and again I'll just
open<00:05:31.170> hitting<00:05:31.650> the<00:05:31.710> beat<00:05:31.860> for<00:05:32.100> letting<00:05:32.730> it

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
open hitting the beat for letting it

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.130 
open hitting the beat for letting it
ring<00:05:33.030> on<00:05:33.120> its<00:05:33.240> own<00:05:33.420> and<00:05:33.630> there's<00:05:33.840> a<00:05:33.870> couple<00:05:33.990> of

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
ring on its own and there's a couple of

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.390 
ring on its own and there's a couple of
times<00:05:34.260> where<00:05:34.590> I'm<00:05:34.650> actually<00:05:34.770> sort<00:05:34.980> of<00:05:35.070> hitting

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
times where I'm actually sort of hitting

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.950 
times where I'm actually sort of hitting
it<00:05:35.520> while<00:05:35.760> it's<00:05:35.910> open<00:05:36.330> so<00:05:36.780> it's<00:05:36.930> the

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
it while it's open so it's the

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.830 
it while it's open so it's the
difference<00:05:37.290> between<00:05:38.210> or<00:05:40.820> like<00:05:41.820> that<00:05:42.090> okay<00:05:42.750> and

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
difference between or like that okay and

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.150 
difference between or like that okay and
I<00:05:42.870> think<00:05:42.990> there's<00:05:43.110> a<00:05:43.140> couple<00:05:43.470> of<00:05:43.680> times<00:05:43.830> in<00:05:44.100> the

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
I think there's a couple of times in the

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.740 
I think there's a couple of times in the
track<00:05:44.430> where<00:05:44.670> we<00:05:44.760> just<00:05:44.910> actually<00:05:45.030> finishes<00:05:45.630> on

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
track where we just actually finishes on

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:59.150 
track where we just actually finishes on
beat<00:05:45.900> three<00:05:46.170> I<00:05:46.350> think<00:05:47.220> it's<00:05:57.650> yeah<00:05:58.650> I<00:05:58.920> think

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
beat three I think it's yeah I think

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.260 
beat three I think it's yeah I think
it's<00:05:59.340> a<00:05:59.370> cup<00:05:59.490> of<00:05:59.520> time<00:05:59.730> T<00:05:59.850> finishes<00:06:00.150> on<00:06:00.240> the

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
it's a cup of time T finishes on the

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.240 
it's a cup of time T finishes on the
year<00:06:00.450> three<00:06:00.690> as<00:06:00.810> well<00:06:00.960> so<00:06:01.650> all<00:06:01.920> you've<00:06:02.100> got<00:06:02.220> to

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
year three as well so all you've got to

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.310 
year three as well so all you've got to
do<00:06:02.400> is<00:06:02.520> take<00:06:02.730> those<00:06:02.940> ideas<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.720> then<00:06:03.990> sort<00:06:04.260> of

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
do is take those ideas and then sort of

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.810 
do is take those ideas and then sort of
mix-up<00:06:04.650> you<00:06:04.830> just<00:06:05.040> follow<00:06:05.190> the<00:06:05.340> same<00:06:05.550> sort<00:06:05.790> of

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
mix-up you just follow the same sort of

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.280 
mix-up you just follow the same sort of
pattern<00:06:06.030> that<00:06:06.210> Nathan<00:06:06.540> uses<00:06:06.810> on<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:06.990> actual

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
pattern that Nathan uses on the actual

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.260 
pattern that Nathan uses on the actual
track<00:06:07.560> I<00:06:07.830> can't<00:06:08.400> necessarily<00:06:08.550> off<00:06:08.970> the<00:06:09.060> top<00:06:09.240> of

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
track I can't necessarily off the top of

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.370 
track I can't necessarily off the top of
my<00:06:09.330> head<00:06:09.390> but<00:06:09.570> once<00:06:10.020> you've<00:06:10.110> got<00:06:10.230> them<00:06:10.290> all

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
my head but once you've got them all

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.430 
my head but once you've got them all
down<00:06:10.560> that<00:06:10.920> they're<00:06:11.100> not<00:06:11.280> too<00:06:11.550> bad<00:06:11.820> and<00:06:12.350> it's<00:06:13.350> a

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
down that they're not too bad and it's a
