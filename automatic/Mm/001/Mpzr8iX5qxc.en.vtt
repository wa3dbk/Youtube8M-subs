 show you how to mask a pimple 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.509
 the problem of pimples faced by all who 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.539

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.670

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.939
 someone faced her unfortunately 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.680
 constantly and in this case is very important for 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.230
 disguise pimples so that it doesn't 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.080
 looked like some kind of very thick layer 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.149
 plaster most hangers after 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.360
 applying tones is getting less 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.250
 visible or disappear altogether if 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.739
 anyway they glances you want 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.170
 completely disguise them or pimples 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.140
 pretty strong inflamed 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.460
 red we need green 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.590
 corrector here is such a green in 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.079
 many brides constantly surprise me 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.480
 because as you see there is even green on 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.239
 majo's face is not oh what if it is not 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.250
 friend disappears then the water will stay like me 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.250
 I'll be on a photo with a green face 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.990
 don't be afraid it won't be visible later 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.119
 just on the principle of color correction to 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.430
 mask red pimple need 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.740
 take advantage of green then green 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.720
 neutralize red is the main 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.090
 principle which you need to remember if 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.119
 you red pimples something just 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.280
 use the green corrector I have it 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.130
 professional palette then on and whom 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.740
 here all all all colors of the rainbow can 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.409
 say and most of you in life they 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.750
 not useful and therefore sense to spend 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.090
 it is not quite look himself something of 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.810
 budget for example recently on girls 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.909
 my told that the shop is part of jeans 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.310
 cosmetics in general it is considered kind of like 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.610
 professionally but she absolutely not 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.649
 dear and there are sold exactly refill and 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.899
 such a green corrector that is 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.270
 just one green corrector jar 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.159
 you can afford it just enough 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.090
 for life, if not even more and 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.000
 it will cost well not 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.380
 only a hundred rubles somewhere with 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.019
 corrector we figured out now 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.450
 let's get down to how 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.000
 directly mask the pimple itself 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.280
 here I download you joy 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.410
 in order to disguise it first 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.930
 I put a tone he did it to the end 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.120
 not blocked so im we have to take 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.830
 small synthetic brush 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.340
 absolutely anyone can be a brush for 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.560
 lip brows for just about anything 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.500
 synthetic brush can generally take 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.630
 some kind of brush that they sell there 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.150
 art stores 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.220
 there should be even a penny as 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.769
 Here is a brush that nails 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.680
 they paint in general any way you are 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:48.700
 synthetic brush we type the corrector 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.730
 on the brush and now we need 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:57.160
 she carry our green corrector on 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:00.030
 pimple we inflicted 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.500
 directly him and a little 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.380
 shade the sides that is to say this 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.739
 there was no stain the main color should nose 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.310
 on the pimple to get around the edges and feathering 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.680
 men in our tons here you see what 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.349
 green color overlapped my 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.359
 red pimple but of course so we don't 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.319
 we can leave it so we need 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:28.440
 take another drop of foundation 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:31.120
 we type it on a finger so here 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.419
 patting movements right along 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.819
 green we mask the green here 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:40.209
 it is very important not to smear this 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.190
 all that you drew green there because 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.380
 which otherwise pimple just 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.829
 reappears because green 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.150
 you need to spread it here from above 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:54.269
 pripechat us green not 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.269
 smearing it like this 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:10.720
 and edges 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:13.060
 in the same tone we shade our 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.160
 pimple is no longer visible if it is over 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.310
 a great deal will be required 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.050
 to disguise it and on top of course 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.690
 it is necessary to powder 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.360
 but powder again u not smearing a 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.730
 here so slightly pat that's all 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.380
 just a couple of minutes and we 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.660
 disguised our red pimple and I 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.520
 I wish you clear skin so that there is no 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.460

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.410
