00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 very good to all how are and 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.580
 welcome to a new video in the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.870
 carla na diary today we are going to 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.059
 start a series where we will go 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 collecting mysteries of speculations 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.840
 theories and other things about history 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.670
 of word that apart from our program 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.529
 the teacher called to answer 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.529
 questions today we're going to start 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.570
 with the goliath of the valley of the bones 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.279
 we know that in de soleil the place where 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.869
 we are now one of the few 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.970
 places where there are still forces of 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.349
 the fiery legion but also in this 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.060
 place especially in the valley of the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.890
 bones we find these giant bones 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.290
 that you can see that they have a 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.579
 much larger than my DNI and 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.910
 we know that drains them and woman in 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.710
 special are quite high on the ground 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.210
 we can find different spots 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.770
 as of footprints and I can also 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.149
 find corpses of which 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.309
 apparently they are soldiers who have 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.899
 been fighting the neck of the bones 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.149
 has a particular history since the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.520
 centaurs the race that we found by 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.230
 these lares do not come here because 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.059
 They consider that what we do is cursed 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.219
 we can find for example this is 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.530
 necromancer pair since they are probably 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.320
 those responsible for the lifting of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.150
 these skeletons in order with respect to 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.950
 what we come to today 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.200
 the ministry of our series is revealed 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.970
 such as goliath from that which 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.530
 basically are these that we are here 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.480
 are two giant skeletons that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.210
 probably you when you come to do 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.940
 missions here you have seen them or doing 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.680
 archeology have also found them 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.290
 basically we do not know what they are or 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.180
 who they will be or what they are called but yes 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.370
 I can, let's analyze them a bit 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.960
 let's start with your hand we can see that 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.390
 has armor which makes us think 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.730
 which is something soft would have been part of 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.600
 an army was a soldier or else it was 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.510
 someone important 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.180
 we see the skull has a gigantic eye 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.040
 and a model is very similar to the one 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.110
 I saw in the old montilla we can see 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.090
 that the shape of the skull is similar to the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.220
 to get the god of the troll out of their 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.800
 gurus we can also see what is the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.960
 ribs that gives us to understand that it was 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.729
 an extremely large animal and that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.470
 now he is lying on the ground but 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.869
 he probably would have been stopped 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.210
 it would be much bigger to get back the size 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.740
 from the mouth that is quite large not 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.490
 is it going to be that it closes right now 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.320
 but we can see that the centaurs and 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.240
 the skeletons go around here but what 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.550
 more interesting besides the ribs 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.590
 is this the tip of what 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.510
 apparently it's the tail so so 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.110
 which we can think two things first 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.090
 that is a make a giant that is to the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.040
 theory to which I cover myself more than is 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.650
 a giant apart also has like 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.590
 arms a trident that we can think that 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.560
 it's a giant we can also think 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.600
 that is a kind of snake like 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.370
 pull style is a snake 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.800
 that way or there's another kind of 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.410
 snake that we can find in all 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.850
 steel as for example there is an attachment one 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.270
 kind of snake god when 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.480
 we had a honeycomb on the island 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.100
 hilarious 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.600
 we have to defeat it but more 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.030
 precisely these seem to be a 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.190
 giant nagaa species or they could well 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.440
 have been ancient gods maybe because 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.230
 we can see that there are arrows on his arm 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.360
 or rather I do not know if they look like arrows 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.860
 but they look like spears stuck in the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.920
 armor which gives us to understand that 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.080
 they have attacked us so in addition to thinking 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.450
 at how big they had been these 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.550
 animals I can see the eye that I by 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.740
 example now I can get in and it 's an eye 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.960
 pretty big I do not want to imagine what 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.000
 what was this 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.880
 in its time when the animal still 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.490
 he was alive and as to whether he was a 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.530
 ancient god has a size although it is 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.570
 relatively large is not to say the 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.100
 size of a true ancient god by 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.480
 which I can think that was can 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.670
 have been a servant of the gods 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.650
 old as for example it is or bot in 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.560
 the teacher's sword in dark cost 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.030
 which also had a giant size but 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.170
 nothing remained but their posts here 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.080
 we can see for example a general plan 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.800
 we see that is more like a naga one 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.050
 make giant for let's say a servant of 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.790
 the old ones and here we are going to play with the 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.400
 theories and speculations that you 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.540
 have the ones that I can throw at you is that 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.610
 is a giant an ancient god or some 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.490
 servant of the ancient gods nothing 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.290
 giant would the possibility the truth 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.610
 that we have seen some giant naga 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.380
 like for example the warlord ' 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.170
 nai in your examples cured we have seen them 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.290
 that are really very giants and they are a 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.010
 sort of nagaa something like deformed 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.680
 basically the bone valley what 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.380
 we find here in suns and these two 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.390
 giant nobody knows who killed them 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.830
 what they do tell us very briefly 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.020
 they are a mission that gives us 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.759
 bowling around here where he tells us that 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.409
 we have to come and kill the 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.270
 skeletons that are in this area and 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:34.969
 he only mentions them as the two 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.259
 giant skeletons of the valley but 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:38.090
 looking for some information is 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.389
 could find that they are considered 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.879
 like the goliats the two volleys and good 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.710
 we do not know who or what killed them 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:48.289
 confrontation between them could be a 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.810
 unlikely because it should have been 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.000
 given just both a death blow in 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.889
 the final battle and having just fallen one 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.310
 in front of the other but most likely 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.659
 that they had killed him so I hope that 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.490
 comment what do you think if 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.440
 they are giant gas here they can see the 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.300
 location in solÃ©s if they are gas 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.039
 giant gods old servants by 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.349
 ancient god or some other races that 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.659
 maybe we do not find it yet and that 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.430
 we can see it in the near future 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.599
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.599
 our going back to the next
