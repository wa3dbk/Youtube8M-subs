00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.870 
is easy to work with as the Royal proud
because<00:02:20.930> it's<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.230> little<00:02:21.500> harder<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.280> texture

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
because it's a little harder and texture

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.470 
because it's a little harder and texture
so<00:02:23.750> it's<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.230> little<00:02:24.440> harder<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.580> work<00:02:25.610> with<00:02:25.820> so

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
so it's a little harder to work with so

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
so it's a little harder to work with so
be<00:02:26.990> warned<00:02:28.120> yeah<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:29.540> hard<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.020> work<00:02:30.260> with

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
be warned yeah it's hard to work with

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.160 
be warned yeah it's hard to work with
and<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.190> didn't<00:02:31.460> want<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.880> like<00:02:32.540> put<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.050> a

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170

and I didn't want to like put it in a
microwave<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:34.480> melt<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.870> for<00:02:36.530> this<00:02:36.710> cuz<00:02:36.920> I

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
been the best combo but even with that

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.950 
been the best combo but even with that
said<00:06:24.930> my<00:06:25.199> hair<00:06:25.500> still<00:06:25.800> feels<00:06:26.729> really<00:06:27.540> good

defined<00:06:32.850> and<00:06:33.270> that's<00:06:33.449> probably<00:06:33.690> because<00:06:34.080> I

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
defined and that's probably because I

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.040 
defined and that's probably because I
left<00:06:34.440> them<00:06:34.680> in<00:06:35.070> for<00:06:35.520> two<00:06:35.970> days<00:06:36.180> and<00:06:36.540> my<00:06:36.720> twists

left them in for two days and my twists
were<00:06:37.290> a<00:06:37.350> little<00:06:37.949> smaller<00:06:38.280> not<00:06:38.729> as<00:06:39.389> small<00:06:39.840> as<00:06:40.199> I

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
were a little smaller not as small as I

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.670 
were a little smaller not as small as I
did<00:06:40.650> on<00:06:40.800> when<00:06:40.949> the<00:06:41.100> couple<00:06:41.940> videos<00:06:42.060> ago<00:06:42.680> but

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
did on when the couple videos ago but

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.010 
did on when the couple videos ago but
they<00:06:43.800> were<00:06:43.860> a<00:06:44.010> little<00:06:44.250> smaller<00:06:44.580> so<00:06:44.940> yeah<00:06:45.780> this

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
they were a little smaller so yeah this

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.909 
they were a little smaller so yeah this
is<00:06:46.080> the<00:06:46.320> result

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
is the result

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:51.610 
is the result
um<00:06:47.360> so<00:06:48.500> as<00:06:49.500> you<00:06:49.740> can<00:06:50.190> tell<00:06:50.250> my<00:06:50.520> twists<00:06:51.210> look

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
different from the video that I posted

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.320 
different from the video that I posted
Friday<00:06:54.060> with<00:06:54.389> the<00:06:54.419> shade<00:06:55.410> moisture<00:06:55.800> souffle

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
Friday with the shade moisture souffle

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.150 
Friday with the shade moisture souffle
versus<00:06:57.330> this<00:06:57.600> there's<00:06:58.410> a<00:06:58.530> big<00:06:58.860> difference

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
versus this there's a big difference

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.100 
versus this there's a big difference
between<00:06:59.430> those<00:06:59.760> two<00:06:59.820> products<00:07:00.479> so<00:07:00.539> I<00:07:00.600> cannot

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
between those two products so I cannot

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.189 
between those two products so I cannot
actually<00:07:01.470> wait<00:07:02.039> to<00:07:02.250> try<00:07:02.490> this<00:07:02.550> souffle<00:07:03.180> on<00:07:03.570> a

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 
actually wait to try this souffle on a

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.969 
actually wait to try this souffle on a
clean<00:07:04.949> hair<00:07:05.280> so<00:07:05.610> just<00:07:05.940> to<00:07:06.060> recap<00:07:06.449> what<00:07:07.320> I<00:07:07.680> did

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
clean hair so just to recap what I did

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.860 
clean hair so just to recap what I did
use<00:07:08.190> this<00:07:08.310> one<00:07:08.520> leaving<00:07:08.729> was<00:07:09.030> the<00:07:09.060> oyon<00:07:09.419> hairdo

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.290 
use this one leaving was the oyon hairdo
and<00:07:10.229> then<00:07:10.919> I<00:07:11.039> twist<00:07:11.400> it<00:07:11.490> with<00:07:11.610> the<00:07:11.760> bursar<00:07:12.180> or

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
and then I twist it with the bursar or

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.290 
and then I twist it with the bursar or
pomade<00:07:12.780> and<00:07:13.050> as<00:07:13.800> I<00:07:13.949> said<00:07:14.010> previously<00:07:14.370> this<00:07:15.120> is
