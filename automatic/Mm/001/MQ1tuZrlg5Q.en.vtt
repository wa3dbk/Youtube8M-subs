00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.130
 Word from the mouth of God I want 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.690

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.130
 Word of God to our hearts 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.480
 It is who is in the guys in the letter 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.310
 to the Romans that the apostle Paul 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.690
 wrote the Romans 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:11.620
 in chapter 8 verse 28 that says so 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.860
 and we know that all things have contributed 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.340
 together for the good of those who love 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.750
 to the God of those who are called by 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:28.470
 your decree then that word here she 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:32.139
 teaches us that all things contribute 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.419
 same situations in which we have been 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.150

 your heart with this person you helped 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.780
