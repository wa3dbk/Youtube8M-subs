00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
several raids against and that was

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.860 
several raids against and that was
really<00:01:33.870> deep<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.390> eastern<00:01:36.390> part<00:01:36.690> of

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
really deep out to the eastern part of

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.680 
really deep out to the eastern part of
germany<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:37.620> had<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.950> cross<00:01:38.580> vast<00:01:39.120> areas

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
germany so they had to cross vast areas

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.320

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
buffer fighters not only on the way

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.190 
buffer fighters not only on the way
there<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:44.820> also<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.210> course<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.810> way<00:01:45.930> back

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
there but also of course on the way back

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.500 
there but also of course on the way back
as<00:01:46.440> well<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.370> just<00:01:47.400> when<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> bombs<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.300> gone

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
as well so just when the bombs have gone

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.870 
as well so just when the bombs have gone
the<00:01:48.960> job<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.350> still<00:01:49.590> only<00:01:49.890> half<00:01:50.310> done<00:01:50.610> now<00:01:50.820> you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the job is still only half done now you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.270 
the job is still only half done now you
can<00:01:51.119> see<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.479> bomb<00:01:51.630> bay<00:01:51.840> doors<00:01:51.869> are<00:01:52.530> open<00:01:53.100> so

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
can see the bomb bay doors are open so

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.640 
can see the bomb bay doors are open so
the<00:01:53.400> aircraft<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.060> lining<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:55.110> reality

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
the aircraft is lining up in reality
