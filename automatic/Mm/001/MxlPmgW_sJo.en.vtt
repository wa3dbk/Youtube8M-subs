00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.810 
you want to take them off so you put
those<00:04:20.200> on<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:23.500> then<00:04:23.680> basically<00:04:23.890> my<00:04:24.310> mask<00:04:24.550> just

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
those on and then basically my mask just

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.840 
those on and then basically my mask just
kind<00:04:25.090> of<00:04:25.120> hangs<00:04:25.330> on<00:04:25.540> here<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:27.190> feels<00:04:27.730> very

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
kind of hangs on here and it feels very

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.430 
kind of hangs on here and it feels very
comfortable<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.510> really<00:04:28.780> really<00:04:29.230> like<00:04:29.410> it

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
comfortable I really really like it

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.260 
comfortable I really really like it
keeps<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.160> straps<00:04:30.610> out<00:04:30.760> of<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:30.910> way<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.180> it

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
keeps the straps out of the way and it

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.560 
keeps the straps out of the way and it
kind<00:04:32.020> of<00:04:32.080> keeps<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.500> nightmare<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.570> getting

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
kind of keeps the nightmare of getting

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.110 
kind of keeps the nightmare of getting
straps<00:04:34.960> adjust<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.500> all<00:04:35.590> that<00:04:35.800> it<00:04:36.760> keeps<00:04:37.000> it

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
straps adjust and all that it keeps it

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.970 
straps adjust and all that it keeps it
pretty<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.510> keeps<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:38.080> helmet<00:04:38.470> supported<00:04:38.890> and

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
pretty it keeps the helmet supported and

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.500 
pretty it keeps the helmet supported and
that's<00:04:39.130> most<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:39.790> reason<00:04:40.060> why<00:04:40.180> I<00:04:40.210> don't

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
that's most of the reason why I don't

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.550 
that's most of the reason why I don't
have<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:41.080> chins<00:04:41.680> drop<00:04:41.920> down<00:04:42.130> is<00:04:42.280> just<00:04:42.310> because

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
have the chins drop down is just because

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.980 
have the chins drop down is just because
it'll<00:04:44.560> get<00:04:44.650> away<00:04:44.890> of<00:04:45.070> that<00:04:45.100> and<00:04:45.540> it's<00:04:46.540> it's

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
it'll get away of that and it's it's

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.550 
it'll get away of that and it's it's
really<00:04:47.380> awkward<00:04:47.530> to<00:04:47.830> have<00:04:47.950> I<00:04:49.290> don't<00:04:50.290> think<00:04:50.470> I'm

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
really awkward to have I don't think I'm

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.900 
really awkward to have I don't think I'm
