 will give us the opportunity to apply 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.130
 damage after destroying your tank 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.189
 also shoot down within a certain radius 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.380
 caterpillars opponent 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.270
 wizard escape perk very useful for 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.509
 light tanks because you will 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.119
 the ability to quickly get out of the light that 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.689
 for any Lt. shki and nursery rhymes very 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.790
 useful master camouflage and giving away 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.950
 increase bonuses from disguise from 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.570
 camouflage well only if you are standing in 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.090
 bushes that by the way to some extent 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.159
 stupid but if thatâ€™s a bonus 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.020
 bush then it would be too imbo 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.470
 so we need to be happy and so 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.220
 the bonus is quiet and pass the cake reducing 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.630
 fine to disguise during your ride 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.759
 muffled shot first diminishing 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.340
 fine masking after your shot 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.140
 swimming lessons perk that gives us 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.240
 bonus to time during flooding 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.310
 tank that is if suddenly he on some 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.259
 and want to swim across the island to 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.500
 the island then this perk will be useful to you 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.940
 but again this will all be very rare 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.920
 counting killed coat of arms which 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.530
 opportunity for your commander to see 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.450
 wounded crews of enemy tanks 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.990
 what will be most useful on 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.060
 global map and team fights 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.280
 platoon coordination allows the radio operator 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.560
 report location sovzvodnogo on 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.270
 map regardless of distance honestly 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.040
 saying i highly doubt the utility 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.870
 This foam well, at least for those 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.820
 tanks which have a bad radio station 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.270
 the player likes this perk 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.400
 useful but still extremely rare power in 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.320
 the number of first level enhancers 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.630
 possession of the main specialty of the crew 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.760
 your tango and danko in the closest 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.800
 sovzvodnyh yes of course it is already a little 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.960
 looks like some mom lpg well in 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.000
 Basically this perk will be useful and plum 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.640
 implements correctly then nothing bad in 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.740
 this will not be an ambush 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.160
 transferring bonus to disguise your 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.260
 the tank and the nearest Sovvzvodny sk cut 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.150
 gear coat of arms allowing mechanical drive 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.100
 set the tank in motion even after 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.840
 destroy your engine 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.600
 but with all this it will move 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.730
 extremely slow zealous commander 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.980
 with this berk your team with crying take 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.810
 God that greatly improves all the basic 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.700
 characteristics but only in the case 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.570
 if your tank has less 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.760
 ten percent strength tolerance 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.390
 pain useful perk reduces chance 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.220
 Crete Crew Course Emergency and 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.989
 service very useful perk 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.670
 allowing your mechanic to repair 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.160
 faster caterpillars but only when 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.290
 100 percent pumping attention to 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.269
 the details of the tank for which your gunner 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.019
 learns to detect weak points 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.360
 enemy tank priority targets perk 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.700
 radio operator to tag tanks with 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.090
 low margin of safety as enemy 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.920
 so and allied photographic memory 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.720
 Perk allows for childhood shows 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.700
 the latter instead of the visibility of the enemy 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.090
 tank a few more seconds after that 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.850
 how he disappeared from the light of the conservation 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.769
 supplying a small chance to the commander 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.190
 save consumables after it 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.260
 efficiently and warehousing 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.600
 This perk allows the loader to take 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.640
 additional ammunition shells but 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.210
 naturally it will be a little maximum 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.850
 five percent of the ammunition fire 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.770
 Burke allowing the team 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.630
 keep important equipment in case of fire 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.750
 which reduces the chance of a crit of some kind 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.980
 an important module during a fire 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.260
 explosives expert bright 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.480
 increasing the scattering radius of the fragments 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.610
 projectile that will naturally be useful 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.500
 for arts and for tanks with large caliber 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.130
 which often use high-explosive 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.770
 shells 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.910
 Well, the last one for today is a perk 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.160
 keen eye 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.630
 giving the commander the opportunity to see 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.300
 enemy consumables 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.160
 which by the way is very useful and very cool 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.400
 but still in the randomness it is unlikely to be 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.230
 somehow decide summing up I would like to 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.270
 note that these perks are really 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.460
 interesting if they add something they somehow 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.650
 to diversify the gameplay and especially 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.240
 help for platoon fights and somehow there 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.550
 for which team fights 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.530
 what do you think you must write in 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.970
 comments well you want 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.040
