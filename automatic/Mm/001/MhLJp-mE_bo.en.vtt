the review that I did that this camera

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.140 
the review that I did that this camera
does<00:00:57.850> not<00:00:57.880> do<00:00:58.920> audio<00:00:59.920> like<00:01:00.670> you<00:01:00.760> can't<00:01:01.000> hear

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
does not do audio like you can't hear

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.110 
does not do audio like you can't hear
the<00:01:01.270> audio<00:01:01.510> after<00:01:01.870> you<00:01:02.520> play<00:01:03.520> something<00:01:03.880> a<00:01:06.120> lot

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
the audio after you play something a lot

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.970 
the audio after you play something a lot
of<00:01:07.150> people<00:01:07.320> said<00:01:08.320> that<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.460> camera<00:01:10.120> takes

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
of people said that the camera takes

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.860 
of people said that the camera takes
pictures<00:01:11.980> and<00:01:12.250> it<00:01:12.370> lags<00:01:12.640> like<00:01:12.910> I<00:01:13.180> guess<00:01:13.390> the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
pictures and it lags like I guess the

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.100 
pictures and it lags like I guess the
shutter<00:01:14.230> speed<00:01:14.620> is<00:01:14.830> slow<00:01:15.550> so<00:01:16.450> i'm<00:01:16.630> going<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:16.900> go

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
shutter speed is slow so i'm going to go

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.100 
shutter speed is slow so i'm going to go
and<00:01:17.380> show<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.190> some<00:01:18.670> of<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.940> features<00:01:19.240> that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
like there is a fisheye effect which is

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:05.050 
like there is a fisheye effect which is
a<00:01:56.440> pretty<00:01:57.440> cool<00:02:02.590> doesn't<00:02:03.590> take<00:02:04.040> slow<00:02:04.520> pictures

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
a pretty cool doesn't take slow pictures

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.540 
a pretty cool doesn't take slow pictures
for<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.420> people<00:02:05.869> who<00:02:06.080> think<00:02:06.800> this<00:02:07.009> camera<00:02:07.400> has

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
for the people who think this camera has

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.530 
for the people who think this camera has
a<00:02:07.610> lag<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:09.050> don't<00:02:09.890> think<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.220> does<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.820> lot<00:02:11.480> of

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
a lag I don't think it does a lot of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.670 
a lag I don't think it does a lot of
people<00:02:11.959> say<00:02:12.230> when<00:02:13.160> we<00:02:13.310> go<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.580> legs<00:02:14.470> why<00:02:15.470> would

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
people say when we go to legs why would

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.370 
people say when we go to legs why would
it<00:02:15.800> lag<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.370> does<00:02:16.640> not<00:02:16.850> take<00:02:17.300> slow<00:02:17.780> pictures

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380
