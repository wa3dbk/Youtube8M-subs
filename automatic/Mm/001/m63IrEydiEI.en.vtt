Sun was moving further and further south

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.330 
Sun was moving further and further south
bringing<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.299> our<00:01:27.659> winter<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.740> would<00:01:28.950> notice

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
bringing on our winter they would notice

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.770 
bringing on our winter they would notice
that<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.610> would<00:01:29.729> go<00:01:29.880> further<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.540> further

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that it would go further and further

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.300 
that it would go further and further
until<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.619> stopped<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.729> they<00:01:33.329> said<00:01:33.979> thank<00:01:34.979> God

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
until it stopped and they said thank God

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.160 
until it stopped and they said thank God
the<00:01:35.549> thing<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.909> stopped<00:01:36.299> because<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:36.869> he<00:01:36.960> keeps

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the thing is stopped because if he keeps

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.910 
the thing is stopped because if he keeps
going<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.009> gonna<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.400> gone<00:01:38.579> completely

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
going it's gonna be gone completely

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.340 
going it's gonna be gone completely
that's<00:01:40.920> what<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.100> says<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.990> stopped

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
that's what it says here so it stopped

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.789 
that's what it says here so it stopped
and<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:44.430> stopped<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.560> december<00:01:46.560> twenty<00:01:47.189> second

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
and it stopped on december twenty second

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.550 
and it stopped on december twenty second
then<00:01:49.799> they<00:01:50.040> notice<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.549> for<00:01:50.579> three<00:01:51.119> days

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
then they notice that for three days

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.410 
then they notice that for three days
december<00:01:52.610> 22nd<00:01:53.610> twenty-third<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
december 22nd twenty-third and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.690 
december 22nd twenty-third and
twenty-fourth<00:01:54.899> every<00:01:55.829> morning<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.490> still

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
twenty-fourth every morning it was still

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.609 
twenty-fourth every morning it was still
sitting<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.329> same<00:01:57.600> place<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.259> hadn't

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
sitting in the same place it hadn't

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.850 
sitting in the same place it hadn't
moved<00:01:58.799> any<00:01:59.130> further<00:01:59.490> and<00:02:00.530> hadn't<00:02:01.530> returned

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
moved any further and hadn't returned

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.330 
moved any further and hadn't returned
back<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.280> other<00:02:02.310> way<00:02:02.549> either<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:04.530> they

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
back the other way either so they

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.570 
back the other way either so they
figured<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.850> anything<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.270> didn't<00:02:06.689> move

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
figured that anything that didn't move

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.630 
figured that anything that didn't move
must<00:02:08.580> be<00:02:08.729> dead<00:02:10.069> consequently<00:02:11.069> they<00:02:11.250> assumed

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
must be dead consequently they assumed

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.550 
must be dead consequently they assumed
that<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.940> Sun

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
that the Sun

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.050 
that the Sun
must<00:02:13.400> be<00:02:13.610> dead<00:02:13.819> on<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.860> twenty-fifth<00:02:16.819> of

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
must be dead on the twenty-fifth of

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.089 
must be dead on the twenty-fifth of
December<00:02:17.660> they<00:02:18.050> noticed<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.709> Sun<00:02:18.920> had

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
December they noticed that the Sun had

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.680 
December they noticed that the Sun had
moved<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.489> opposite<00:02:20.030> way<00:02:20.300> one<00:02:20.930> degree<00:02:22.690> so

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
moved the opposite way one degree so

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.540 
moved the opposite way one degree so
again<00:02:24.020> they<00:02:24.200> assumed<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.340> thing
