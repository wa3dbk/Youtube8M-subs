00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
regulated this hand answer as we don't

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.790 
regulated this hand answer as we don't
so<00:00:31.260> we're<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.619> Tundra<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:33.530> land<00:00:34.530> tax

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.560 
them tandra because it's the only blue
and<00:00:40.350> besides<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:42.090> cuts<00:00:42.239> pretty

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and besides this and that cuts pretty

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.889 
and besides this and that cuts pretty
blue<00:00:42.899> heavy<00:00:43.649> requirements<00:00:44.550> if<00:00:45.480> he<00:00:45.629> doesn't

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
blue heavy requirements if he doesn't

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.830 
blue heavy requirements if he doesn't
play<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> land<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:47.969> much<00:00:48.300> feel<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> play

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840

a<00:00:59.550> third<00:00:59.730> atlantic's<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.390> don't<00:01:00.600> know<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
a third atlantic's I don't know what the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.810 
a third atlantic's I don't know what the
optimal<00:01:01.320> theory<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.609> just

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
optimal theory is but I like to just

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.509 
optimal theory is but I like to just
dump<00:01:03.090> hands<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:03.719> deck<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:05.100> dump
