one thing I did have a little bit of

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.980 
one thing I did have a little bit of
issue<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:25.830> was<00:00:26.310> some<00:00:26.670> hot<00:00:27.240> weather<00:00:27.510> plants

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
issue with was some hot weather plants

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.130 
issue with was some hot weather plants
that<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.349> put<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.800> peppers<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.699> eggplants<00:00:30.390> that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that I put in peppers and eggplants that

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.139 
that I put in peppers and eggplants that
for<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> while<00:00:31.890> we're<00:00:32.189> really<00:00:32.399> stunted<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
for a while we're really stunted and

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.090 
for a while we're really stunted and
they<00:00:33.239> did<00:00:33.450> not<00:00:33.600> look<00:00:33.960> happy<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.410> all<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
they did not look happy at all and a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.130 
they did not look happy at all and a
master<00:00:35.700> gardener<00:00:35.969> friends<00:00:36.510> stopped<00:00:36.719> by<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
master gardener friends stopped by and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.740 
master gardener friends stopped by and
said<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:38.340> nitrogen<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.059> was<00:00:39.210> breaking<00:00:39.600> down

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
said the nitrogen that was breaking down

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.200 
said the nitrogen that was breaking down
underneath<00:00:40.110> was<00:00:40.559> taking<00:00:41.309> all<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.579> its<00:00:41.850> energy

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
underneath was taking all of its energy

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.290 
underneath was taking all of its energy
to<00:00:42.239> do<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> leaves<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.879> plants

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
to do that with the leaves the plants

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.110 
to do that with the leaves the plants
needed<00:00:45.510> extra<00:00:46.140> fertilizer<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:47.010> lesson<00:00:47.879> one

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
needed extra fertilizer so lesson one

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.090 
needed extra fertilizer so lesson one
just<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.289> there's<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> lot<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.890> action

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
just because there's a lot of action

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.010 
just because there's a lot of action
going<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:50.610> underneath<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> soil<00:00:51.480> did<00:00:51.840> not

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
going on underneath the soil did not

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.540 
going on underneath the soil did not
mean<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> plants<00:00:52.739> were<00:00:52.829> getting<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> action

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
mean the plants were getting the action

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.340 
mean the plants were getting the action
so<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> had<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.420> throw<00:00:54.629> some<00:00:54.660> organic

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
so I had to throw some organic

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.170 
so I had to throw some organic
fertilizer<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:56.280> them<00:00:56.460> fish<00:00:56.789> fertilizer

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
fertilizer on them fish fertilizer

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.860 
fertilizer on them fish fertilizer
highly<00:00:58.109> recommend<00:00:59.149> and<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> plants<00:01:00.570> took<00:01:00.719> off

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
highly recommend and the plants took off

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.720 
highly recommend and the plants took off
they<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.590> within<00:01:01.770> two<00:01:01.949> days<00:01:02.250> they<00:01:02.550> had<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
they like within two days they had a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.119 
they like within two days they had a
whole<00:01:02.969> new<00:01:03.270> set<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.570> shoots<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.379> flowers<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
whole new set of shoots and flowers and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.320 
whole new set of shoots and flowers and
they<00:01:05.339> were<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.580> happy<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:07.080> issue<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:08.330> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
they were really happy the issue of to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
they were really happy the issue of to

remove the sod or not to remove the sod
what<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:12.030> noticed<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.720> there<00:01:13.350> has<00:01:13.500> not

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
what I have noticed is there has not

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.160 
what I have noticed is there has not
been<00:01:13.740> any<00:01:14.210> difference<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.630> way<00:01:15.659> plants

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
been any difference in the way plants

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
been any difference in the way plants
have<00:01:16.439> grown<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.340> side<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> yard<00:01:17.820> or

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
have grown in one side of the yard or

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.679 
have grown in one side of the yard or
the<00:01:18.330> other

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the other

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.920 
the other
most<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.470> what<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.650> planted<00:01:20.450> came<00:01:21.450> up<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
most of what I planted came up and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.450 
most of what I planted came up and
didn't<00:01:22.170> seem<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.470> matter<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> soil<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.340> was

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
didn't seem to matter the soil it was

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.730 
didn't seem to matter the soil it was
more<00:01:23.640> whether<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.970> watered<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> enough<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.229> you

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
more whether I watered it enough or you

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.440 
more whether I watered it enough or you
know<00:01:25.860> put<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> right<00:01:26.460> kind<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.850> seeds<00:01:27.090> or

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
know put in the right kind of seeds or

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.289 
know put in the right kind of seeds or
those<00:01:27.960> kinds<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.350> things<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.740> did<00:01:29.400> find<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
those kinds of things I did find that

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.890 
those kinds of things I did find that
seeds<00:01:31.250> especially<00:01:32.250> really<00:01:32.400> fine<00:01:32.729> seeds<00:01:33.210> did

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
seeds especially really fine seeds did

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.560 
seeds especially really fine seeds did
not<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.590> growing<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.790> soil<00:01:36.240> as

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
not really like growing in the soil as

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.719 
not really like growing in the soil as
much<00:01:36.900> partly<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:38.250> would<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.579> think

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
much partly because they would I think

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.030 
much partly because they would I think
it<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.240> little<00:01:39.600> ways<00:01:39.720> down<00:01:39.750> they'd<00:01:40.200> run<00:01:40.380> into<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it a little ways down they'd run into a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.889 
it a little ways down they'd run into a
lot<00:01:41.280> least<00:01:41.579> matter<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.210> other<00:01:42.299> things<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.840> was

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
lot least matter and other things it was

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.789 
lot least matter and other things it was
hard<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.350> them<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.680> germinate<00:01:44.640> there<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.799> get

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
hard for them to germinate there and get

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.620 
hard for them to germinate there and get
what<00:01:46.920> they<00:01:47.040> need<00:01:47.220> from<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> soil<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> found

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
what they need from the soil so I found

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.350 
what they need from the soil so I found
I<00:01:48.780> had<00:01:48.930> more<00:01:49.110> luck<00:01:49.350> with<00:01:49.380> seedlings<00:01:50.340> than<00:01:51.149> with

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
I had more luck with seedlings than with

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.920 
I had more luck with seedlings than with
little<00:01:51.600> seeds<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:54.299> was<00:01:54.450> kind<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.750> all

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
little seeds and that was kind of all
