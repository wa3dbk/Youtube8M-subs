00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
point but it's kind of just reconfigured

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.180 
point but it's kind of just reconfigured
like<00:03:07.820> this<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.750> goes<00:03:09.020> over<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.920> make<00:03:10.070> it

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190

my<00:06:33.039> opinion<00:06:33.340> I<00:06:33.520> like<00:06:33.849> the<00:06:34.180> blizzard<00:06:34.509> but<00:06:35.139> this

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
my opinion I like the blizzard but this

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.189 
my opinion I like the blizzard but this
is<00:06:35.620> just<00:06:35.650> so<00:06:35.949> much<00:06:36.069> more<00:06:36.479> compatible<00:06:37.479> i<00:06:37.900> think

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
is just so much more compatible i think

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.680 
is just so much more compatible i think
it's<00:06:38.589> just<00:06:38.860> nicer<00:06:39.219> so<00:06:39.940> i<00:06:39.969> suggest<00:06:40.509> you<00:06:40.569> get
