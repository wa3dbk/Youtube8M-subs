00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.859
 on the partnership well I leave one here 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.099
 very expensive items are against dordrecht 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.780
 you as a pisslink look like yes because me 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.889
 think that should have been very fat 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.300
 to win 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.320
 games vetting we've had with 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.320
 the opportunities we have created 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.779
 and then you give it away that I think 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.119
 that their deed and the up to that I take 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.010
 blame myself my team the blame 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.449
 This is this is not good or now one 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.710
 very good step in the direction 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.900
 direct enforcement 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.010
 that is still possible wherever we do 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.439
 even more difficult 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.600
 made with them do not fall the other half 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.290
 well done 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.670
 setting laziness 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.379
 do you ever win more especially in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.370
 I think especially the front 4 there 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.320
 there were to blame, and the second lot 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.550
 simply finishing the opportunity because too 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.500
 get in the second half and on there 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.680
 dabs of opportunities that let's 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.680
 lie 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.719
 with those two two you direct what your roof 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.949
 that was furious i used to be against it 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.300
 edge of pressure means the key 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.250
 the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.770
 so frustrated but apparently you have to 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.580
 then to very quietly would supervise me too 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.760
 because boiling point things 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.250
 yes if not so smart of has also got 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.710
 no sense 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.970
 Apparently my guard just looks lost 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.100
 things arrive at failure 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.369
 you try with coaching try it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.119
 to resolve and then a dollar falls 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.470
 to cornell 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.470
 I find that completely ridiculous 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.189
 wise men and women, I also look at 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.130
 I think it is not strong and there 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.660
 I was angry about it 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.120
 then not so smart that sometimes it is needed 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.740
 also not very strong plastic 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.380
 you have the nio architects in afterwards 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.830
 the dressing room what I keep for myself that 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.610
 words that I share with players are this 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.320
 is a group that 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.740
 who has done fantastic until now 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.000
 and today not 40 minutes 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.230
 did well 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.020
 nevertheless we all today at dick 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.950
 should we win out here will be 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.620
 again 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.450
 it is a bit of a damper thing 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.100
 dominates well with you is that the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.580
 perhaps even mother's teaching 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.160
 shame for or happened and shame 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.170
 no i have seen a nac today what 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.580
 made some 10 goals 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.860
 I think goofy is not for 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.209
 ashamed and I am angry about what we are 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.620
 how we did it and why it 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.000
 have lost point but good there 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.920
 hurry up his divorce x 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.510
 i need the weather solutions things 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.340
 home team get tomorrow world trip 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.230
 So we went out after Ajax and then at home 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.290
 heracles can still make the difference 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.290
 to make
