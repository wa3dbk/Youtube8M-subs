taken<00:00:48.559> time<00:00:48.920> just<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.640> stop<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.210> reflect<00:00:50.360> many

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
taken time just to stop and reflect many

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.510 
taken time just to stop and reflect many
times<00:00:51.230> when<00:00:51.469> we<00:00:51.500> hear<00:00:51.800> what's<00:00:52.010> happening<00:00:52.100> in

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
times when we hear what's happening in

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.940 
times when we hear what's happening in
the<00:00:52.610> news<00:00:52.790> or<00:00:53.090> read<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.360> newspapers<00:00:53.950> where's

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
the news or read the newspapers where's

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.740 
the news or read the newspapers where's
all<00:00:55.130> this<00:00:55.280> leading<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:56.140> what's<00:00:57.140> going<00:00:57.379> on<00:00:57.620> here

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
all this leading to what's going on here

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.530 
all this leading to what's going on here
and<00:00:59.980> so<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:01.010> think<00:01:01.250> that<00:01:01.700> now<00:01:01.910> more<00:01:02.180> than<00:01:02.360> ever

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
and so I think that now more than ever

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.539 
and so I think that now more than ever
we<00:01:02.899> must<00:01:02.930> begin<00:01:03.410> to<00:01:03.800> look<00:01:03.950> at<00:01:04.159> what<00:01:04.369> are<00:01:04.489> the

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
we must begin to look at what are the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.230 
we must begin to look at what are the
things<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:04.939> we<00:01:05.149> can<00:01:05.420> do<00:01:06.280> that<00:01:07.280> would<00:01:07.520> put<00:01:08.119> us

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
things that we can do that would put us

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.719 
things that we can do that would put us
on<00:01:08.450> some<00:01:08.659> firm<00:01:09.350> footing<00:01:09.799> in<00:01:10.070> life<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.549> will

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
on some firm footing in life that will

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.120 
on some firm footing in life that will
enable<00:01:10.970> us<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.270> do<00:01:11.659> some<00:01:11.900> things<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:12.650> use

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
enable us to do some things and and use

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.070 
enable us to do some things and and use
some<00:01:13.400> powers<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:14.000> we<00:01:14.150> have<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:14.540> many<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:14.960> us

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
some powers that we have that many of us

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.320 
some powers that we have that many of us
go<00:01:15.409> through<00:01:15.440> life<00:01:15.710> never<00:01:16.520> ever<00:01:16.760> discovering

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
go through life never ever discovering

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.149 
go through life never ever discovering
that<00:01:17.510> we<00:01:17.659> have<00:01:17.900> those<00:01:18.140> things<00:01:18.440> going<00:01:18.710> for<00:01:19.010> us

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159
