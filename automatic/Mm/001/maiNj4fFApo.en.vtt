containers and this here is a cereal box
and<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:12.179> could<00:00:12.360> just<00:00:12.480> use<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.719> cereal<00:00:13.290> box<00:00:13.500> as

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
and you could just use the cereal box as

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.369 
and you could just use the cereal box as
a<00:00:13.799> compost<00:00:14.370> bin<00:00:14.580> but<00:00:15.480> what<00:00:15.690> would<00:00:15.809> happen<00:00:15.990> is

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
a compost bin but what would happen is

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.170 
a compost bin but what would happen is
that<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.770> like<00:00:17.279> tips<00:00:17.699> over<00:00:18.029> but<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:20.180> made

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
that it like tips over but this is made

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.290 
that it like tips over but this is made
square<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.529> actually<00:00:23.189> really<00:00:23.519> works<00:00:23.939> well

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
square so it actually really works well

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.529 
square so it actually really works well
as<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:25.140> compost<00:00:25.710> bin<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.090> how<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.330> do

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
as a compost bin so this is how you do

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:27.800 
as a compost bin so this is how you do
it

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810

you want to try to make a square pop so
the<00:00:55.590> idea<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.360> extend<00:00:58.199> these

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the idea is that as you extend these

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.810 
the idea is that as you extend these
creases<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:59.280> you<00:01:00.000> want<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:01.890> want<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.430> length

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
creases up you want you want this length

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:25.130 
creases up you want you want this length
to<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.359> about<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.930> same<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.559> length<00:01:24.140> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
to be about the same as this length you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.380 
to be about the same as this length you
just<00:01:25.350> sculpt<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:27.060> much

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
just sculpt it so that it is a much

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.050 
just sculpt it so that it is a much
wider<00:01:29.030> box<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.930> these<00:01:31.530> extra<00:01:32.159> tabs<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.759> help

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
wider box and these extra tabs here help

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.600 
wider box and these extra tabs here help
the<00:01:33.689> box<00:01:33.930> balance<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.979> then<00:01:35.220> at<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> bottom

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the box balance and then at the bottom

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.719 
the box balance and then at the bottom
of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> box<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:38.450> pinch<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> here

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
of the box you can pinch here and here

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.609 
of the box you can pinch here and here
and<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:44.040> now<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:45.439> have<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.500> new

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and there it is and now I have a new

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.219 
and there it is and now I have a new
compost<00:01:47.100> box<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.570> make<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.930> little<00:01:49.049> bit

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
compost box and to make it a little bit

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.200 
compost box and to make it a little bit
nicer<00:01:49.439> looking<00:01:49.860> at<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> top<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.640> wrap

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
nicer looking at the top you can wrap

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.140 
nicer looking at the top you can wrap
this<00:01:51.479> down<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.079> wrap<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.070> down

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
this down and wrap this down

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.590 
this down and wrap this down
and<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.900> is<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.330> get<00:01:57.480> rid

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
and there it is and now you can get rid

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.920 
and there it is and now you can get rid
of<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.810> one<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.550> is<00:02:02.940> compostable

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
of this one and so this is compostable

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.290 
of this one and so this is compostable
at<00:02:04.260> least<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.650> my<00:02:04.770> state<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:07.770> also<00:02:08.300> just

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
at least in my state and this also just

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.190 
at least in my state and this also just
these<00:02:09.510> ordinary<00:02:10.200> milk<00:02:10.500> containers<00:02:11.010> are

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
these ordinary milk containers are

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.180 
these ordinary milk containers are
compostable<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.470> there's<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.710> little<00:02:13.950> plastic

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
compostable but there's a little plastic

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.190 
compostable but there's a little plastic
thing<00:02:14.970> right<00:02:15.150> here<00:02:15.390> that's<00:02:15.600> not<00:02:15.750> compostable

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
thing right here that's not compostable

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.910 
thing right here that's not compostable
so<00:02:16.740> what<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.430> can<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.270> can<00:02:18.450> open<00:02:19.260> here

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
so what you can do is you can open here

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.810 
so what you can do is you can open here
and<00:02:20.150> open<00:02:21.150> here<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.690> then<00:02:22.530> pull<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:23.100> two

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
and open here and then pull on two

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.510 
and open here and then pull on two
opposite<00:02:24.270> flaps<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.830> pull<00:02:26.220> here

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
opposite flaps like that and pull here

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.560 
opposite flaps like that and pull here
and<00:02:26.960> so<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:28.110> opens<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.680> up<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.040> now<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:30.180> just

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
and so that opens it up and now you just

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.590 
and so that opens it up and now you just
tear<00:02:30.930> right<00:02:31.170> here<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.360> tear<00:02:33.570> out

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
tear right here and you just tear out

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.650 
tear right here and you just tear out
the<00:02:33.900> plastic<00:02:34.110> thing<00:02:36.590> like<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.420> now<00:02:39.420> this

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
the plastic thing like that and now this

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.630 
the plastic thing like that and now this
is<00:02:39.960> compostable<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.520> here<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.780> can<00:02:42.960> have<00:02:43.140> a

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
is compostable so here you can have a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.300 
is compostable so here you can have a
compost<00:02:44.810> box<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.650> then<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.280> just

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
compost box like that and then you just

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.120 
compost box like that and then you just
throw<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:48.480> little<00:02:49.110> plastic<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.860> garbage

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
throw the little plastic in the garbage
