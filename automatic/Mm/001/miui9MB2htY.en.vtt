quick<00:02:38.250> look<00:02:38.549> at<00:02:38.730> some<00:02:38.790> star<00:02:39.389> signs<00:02:39.689> I<00:02:39.840> couldn't

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
quick look at some star signs I couldn't

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.160 
quick look at some star signs I couldn't
find<00:02:40.560> anything<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.489> symbolizes<00:02:42.420> anything

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
to do with this or anything that looks

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.849 
to do with this or anything that looks
similar<00:02:45.000> maybe<00:02:45.689> it's<00:02:45.930> nothing<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:46.409> if<00:02:46.680> you

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
similar maybe it's nothing but if you

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.710 
similar maybe it's nothing but if you
think<00:02:46.889> it<00:02:47.280> could<00:02:47.489> be<00:02:47.639> something<00:02:47.879> let<00:02:48.569> me<00:02:48.599> know

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.800 
then we get a message which says our
greatest<00:05:14.210> barrier<00:05:14.750> is<00:05:15.080> our<00:05:15.229> own<00:05:15.440> fear

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
greatest barrier is our own fear

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.980 
greatest barrier is our own fear
our<00:05:17.560> own<00:05:17.860> doubts<00:05:18.330> now<00:05:19.330> for<00:05:19.540> me<00:05:19.630> this<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:19.960> a

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
our own doubts now for me this is a

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.260 
our own doubts now for me this is a
massive<00:05:20.410> massive<00:05:20.880> indication<00:05:21.880> that

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
massive massive indication that

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.540 
massive massive indication that
something<00:05:22.600> big<00:05:23.050> could<00:05:23.650> be<00:05:23.830> going<00:05:24.160> down<00:05:24.340> when

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
something big could be going down when

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.159 
something big could be going down when
someone<00:05:24.880> says<00:05:25.090> something<00:05:25.120> like<00:05:25.510> that<00:05:25.810> it's

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
someone says something like that it's

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.050 
someone says something like that it's
almost<00:05:26.620> as<00:05:26.830> if<00:05:26.889> they<00:05:27.220> are<00:05:27.250> pointing<00:05:27.790> towards

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
almost as if they are pointing towards

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.610 
almost as if they are pointing towards
creating<00:05:28.300> something<00:05:28.900> that<00:05:28.990> could<00:05:29.169> be<00:05:29.260> really

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
creating something that could be really

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.280 
creating something that could be really
good<00:05:30.070> and<00:05:30.280> effective<00:05:30.550> but<00:05:31.330> with<00:05:31.540> extreme

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
good and effective but with extreme

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.010 
good and effective but with extreme
risks<00:05:33.040> maybe<00:05:33.310> are<00:05:33.490> creating<00:05:34.000> a<00:05:34.150> super<00:05:34.810> soldier

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
risks maybe are creating a super soldier

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.900 
risks maybe are creating a super soldier
and<00:05:35.410> the<00:05:35.440> more<00:05:35.860> powerful<00:05:36.190> they<00:05:36.460> make<00:05:36.669> it

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
and the more powerful they make it

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.820 
and the more powerful they make it
they're<00:05:37.270> less<00:05:37.510> stable<00:05:37.810> it<00:05:38.139> becomes<00:05:38.620> that

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
they're less stable it becomes that

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.580 
they're less stable it becomes that
could<00:05:39.160> turn<00:05:39.400> corrupt<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:40.450> again<00:05:40.990> just

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
could turn corrupt and again just

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.320 
could turn corrupt and again just
massive<00:05:42.070> speculation<00:05:42.700> for<00:05:42.850> you<00:05:42.910> guys<00:05:43.060> let<00:05:43.270> me

information but I refer back to the
super<00:06:05.979> soldier<00:06:06.280> as<00:06:06.430> a<00:06:06.490> possibility<00:06:07.150> of<00:06:07.570> it

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
super soldier as a possibility of it
