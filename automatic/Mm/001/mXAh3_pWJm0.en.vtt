 tools such as screwdrivers 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.310
 cruciform is flat and is manual you

 to a professional third problem 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.900
 which is a bit more complex 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.060
 when your computer does not turn on 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.470
 no more of course you did the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.320
 charger and battery tests at 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.920
 prior and despite all that the computer 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.930
 does not come on in this case it can 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.240
 to be something very simple like 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.030
 a fuse or so it can be a big 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.670
 problem like components 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.840
 electronic that are burned goes on 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.729
 screw up in a chain 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.740
 and there you have to call on a 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.200
 professional whatever happens then 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.030
 your computer turns on but you do not 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.519
 did not know why he beeps you 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.230
 beep beep so two in a row three 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:18.930
 in a row 3 short fast in general 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.360
 it means something that is the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.640
 graphics card is hs either that the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.470
 processor to a problem be that your 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.050
 RAM and badly put or that it is 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.540
 hs so the first thing to do is 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.730
 to remove the battery to remove your 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.830
 RAM to do the test with a 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.910
 single memory 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.459
 then you take off those ones 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.959
 put the other one back if it does not restart and 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.340
 you even try to put back both 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.239
 maybe dead your computer 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.530
 will leave 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.819
