00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
said also if if he had altitude you'd

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.290 
said also if if he had altitude you'd
like<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.860> try<00:00:40.980> another<00:00:41.129> spiral<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:41.879> he<00:00:42.030> didn't

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
like to try another spiral if he didn't

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.319 
like to try another spiral if he didn't
want<00:00:42.420> him<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.750> another<00:00:43.079> full<00:00:43.440> stall<00:00:44.329> okay

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
want him to do another full stall okay

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.590 
want him to do another full stall okay
so<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.140> was<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> little<00:00:46.530> interesting<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
so that was a little interesting on the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.799 
so that was a little interesting on the
on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.660> release<00:00:50.149> it's<00:00:51.149> kind<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.390> hard<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.600> tell

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
on the release it's kind of hard to tell

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.080 
on the release it's kind of hard to tell
all<00:00:51.930> i<00:00:52.050> could<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.590> silhouette<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.940> looks

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
all i could do this silhouette it looks

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.400 
all i could do this silhouette it looks
like<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.360> didn't<00:00:54.690> catch<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.899> surge

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
like you just didn't catch that surge

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.700 
like you just didn't catch that surge
when<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.160> surged<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.440> took<00:00:58.649> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
when it surged and so you took that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.740 
when it surged and so you took that
collapsed<00:00:59.340> there<00:00:59.489> almost<00:00:59.699> stuck<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:00.660> it

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
collapsed there almost stuck in but it

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.060 
collapsed there almost stuck in but it
didn't<00:01:01.079> that's<00:01:01.320> why<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.620> important<00:01:02.010> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
didn't that's why it's important to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.860 
didn't that's why it's important to
catch<00:01:02.250> those<00:01:02.520> surges<00:01:03.000> when<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.329> goes<00:01:03.449> past<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
catch those surges when it goes past the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.789 
catch those surges when it goes past the
horizon<00:01:04.820> okay<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.150> I'm<00:01:06.840> kind<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.380> not<00:01:07.560> too

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
horizon okay and I'm kind of not too

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.859 
horizon okay and I'm kind of not too
into<00:01:08.040> these<00:01:08.130> conditions<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.630> let's

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
into these conditions right now so let's

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.370 
into these conditions right now so let's
go<00:01:10.020> ahead<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> try<00:01:10.619> some<00:01:10.920> Paralympic<00:01:11.460> lying

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
go ahead and try some Paralympic lying

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.080 
go ahead and try some Paralympic lying
and<00:01:13.380> I'd<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.460> able<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> see<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> little

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and I'd like to be able to see a little

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.510 
and I'd like to be able to see a little
better<00:01:15.270> when<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.990> stall<00:01:16.409> next<00:01:17.130> time

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
better when we do that stall next time

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.539 
better when we do that stall next time
and<00:01:18.409> it<00:01:19.409> looks<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.860> opened<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
and it looks like you opened it up a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.249 
and it looks like you opened it up a
little<00:01:20.790> too<00:01:21.030> much<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.450> that's<00:01:21.509> why<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> surge

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
little too much and that's why the surge

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.380 
little too much and that's why the surge
was<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:22.920> strong

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
was so strong

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.090 
was so strong
you<00:01:24.659> shouldn't<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.050> opened<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> wind<00:01:25.890> so

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you shouldn't have opened up the wind so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.130 
you shouldn't have opened up the wind so
much<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.520> release<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.810> ahead<00:01:27.870> and<00:01:28.050> try

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
much on that release so go ahead and try

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.820 
much on that release so go ahead and try
a<00:01:28.200> spiral<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:28.830> you<00:01:28.950> want<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:30.530> yeah<00:01:31.530> nice<00:01:33.770> good<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
a spiral if you want to yeah nice good a

here<00:02:09.179> from<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> north<00:02:10.410> get<00:02:10.649> over<00:02:10.830> here<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.070> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
here from the north get over here to the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.040 
here from the north get over here to the
ground<00:02:11.400> let's<00:02:11.820> call<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.330> good<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
ground let's call that good for the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.140 
ground let's call that good for the
maneuvers<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:14.070> go<00:02:14.220> for<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.459> good<00:02:14.640> landing

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
maneuvers just go for a good landing

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.520 
maneuvers just go for a good landing
because<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.540> really<00:02:15.900> picked<00:02:16.170> up<00:02:16.320> down<00:02:16.530> here<00:02:18.530> so

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
because it really picked up down here so

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.920 
because it really picked up down here so
don't<00:02:19.800> get<00:02:19.980> downwind<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.700> LZ<00:02:21.150> anything

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
don't get downwind of the LZ anything

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.459 
don't get downwind of the LZ anything
like<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.440> can<00:02:22.590> see<00:02:22.739> what<00:02:22.860> direction<00:02:23.010> it
