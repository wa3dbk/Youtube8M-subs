field and then we'll never have a bit of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.760 
field and then we'll never have a bit of
applause<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.719> think<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:37.110> need<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> clean<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.530> off

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770

my<00:00:37.950> game<00:00:38.160> we're<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.000> another

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
my game we're going on to another

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.299 
my game we're going on to another
seen<00:00:40.820> prophecies<00:00:42.010> varieties<00:00:43.010> could<00:00:43.190> be

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
seen prophecies varieties could be

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.500 
seen prophecies varieties could be
tetris<00:00:43.789> which<00:00:44.629> is<00:00:44.750> a<00:00:44.780> new<00:00:45.019> variety<00:00:45.460> for<00:00:46.460> us<00:00:46.609> so

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
tetris which is a new variety for us so

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.149 
tetris which is a new variety for us so
we'll<00:00:47.629> see<00:00:47.839> how<00:00:47.870> that<00:00:48.050> turns<00:00:48.199> out<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.010> if<00:00:49.100> you

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
we'll see how that turns out so if you

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.920 
we'll see how that turns out so if you
have<00:00:49.309> a<00:00:49.339> bit<00:00:49.489> of<00:00:49.519> a<00:00:49.640> pause<00:00:49.820> later<00:00:50.120> on<00:00:50.300> moisture

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
have a bit of a pause later on moisture

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.700 
have a bit of a pause later on moisture
is<00:00:52.030> we<00:00:53.030> have<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.180> look<00:00:53.300> at<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.480> grain<00:00:53.719> monitor

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
is we have a look at the grain monitor

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.630 
is we have a look at the grain monitor
yield<00:00:55.129> here<00:00:56.469> so<00:00:57.469> moisture<00:00:57.949> is<00:00:58.010> about<00:00:58.159> 15.7<00:00:59.030> and

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
yield here so moisture is about 15.7 and

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.649 
yield here so moisture is about 15.7 and
we're<00:01:01.640> just<00:01:01.789> running<00:01:01.969> it<00:01:02.149> through<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.420> dryer

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
we're just running it through the dryer

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.060 
we're just running it through the dryer
just<00:01:02.869> to<00:01:02.989> really<00:01:03.140> just<00:01:03.379> to<00:01:03.469> clean<00:01:03.710> it<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:03.890> little

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
just to really just to clean it a little

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.820 
just to really just to clean it a little
bit<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.430> be<00:01:04.549> honest<00:01:05.110> there's

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
bit to be honest there's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.370 
bit to be honest there's
