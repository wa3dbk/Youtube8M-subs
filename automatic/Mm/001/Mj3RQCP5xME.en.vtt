00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.829
 welcome 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.200
 2900 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.000
 offers value for money 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.160
 quite competitive and good so let's go 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.160
 to open the talk in via 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.850
 above 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.850
 it is totally sealed 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.380
 and that's why when you open it 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.470
 but now 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.610
 6 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:04.149
 not so is the limbo of the box this 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:07.080
 It is the guarantee of user manual as well 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.080
 They gave all 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.710
 and this is the most important thing of all 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.560
 the right thing quite well 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.980
 with trying to give light 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.550
 other projects the truth 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.930
 - a strap so that they do not escape 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.940
 running 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.290
 in charger we are understanding what 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.290
 pass support boys 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.800
 and good until 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.680
 and that we can not take two again 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.110

 and thanks to someone thank you for hunting in 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.909
 the precise moment 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.149
 it's already good first because the front is 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:57.730
 pretty pretty and it's pretty manageable 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:00.280
 so you feel comfortable at 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.550
 To contact 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.310
 resenting 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.900
 you are eating too much and you can not 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.810
 take pictures 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.560
 after the button to record to change 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.450
 scenes see the pictures they already have for 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.740
 change the exposure this company 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:25.660
 barrick the scenes menu delete by the 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.130
 part of the front hand up has a 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.040
 nose says the name the button 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.060
 understand in the off and this is the 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.060
 fast for 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.290
 6 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:49.700
 I do not know I think the number 3 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.700
 it's okay 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.790
 we do not need your selection of scenes 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.450
 we can see then that it has several types 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.400
 has mode portrait landscape sports network 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.880
 landscape tell us that this camera has 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.980
 pretty good that at night if it's 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.650
 indoor 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.519
 and also the soft grants them 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:29.230
 nostalgic to black and white like 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.230
 selective this is pretty good 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.800
 and to record popcorn is about 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.959
 smart that is for when in 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.740
 Smile protection and mode 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.150
 automatic 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.689
 perceive the portrait soft mode 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.689
 all right 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.080
 that's if we go to the melon we can see 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.480
 which then has 20 resolutions of 220 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.040
 means for absolution you can choose 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.620
 several days of four etc. and so on 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.940
 but hey the best one that handles you and is 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.590
 with 20 megabytes is quite the truth 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.210
 and the state is controlled through the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.520
 little arrows of his ancestor and diego 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.320
 in the options of the video you can change 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.450
 the resolution right now like not having 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.870
 mariana we can activate the 720 we believe 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.250
 which records 330 frames 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.970
 in focus mode 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.710
 the remnant we can put 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.650
 and I love this this was what I 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.300
 loved this camera that has a 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.560
 filter for wind noise that is 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.560
 very very useful for recording outdoors 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.300
 special we have here to configure the 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.610
 time zone the screen if you have date 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.379
 77 digital action 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.110
 configurations with our life in the 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:54.389
 video mode memory 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.319
 can be loaded with the computer and 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:01.110
 restore everything and by this version of 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:02.920
 this camera is a really cool one 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.840
 lie down 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:12.520
 when it cost 2 thousand 900 pesos in walmart 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.930
 in samborns in 2000 with card but it's 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.110
 a camera that you can find in many 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:21.700
 sides in its purple version is pretty 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.680
 male but good 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.630
 and if you are looking for a cheap camera 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.800
 that serves him well to do things 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:33.620
 good and it 's not you can not count on him 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.129
 they do not have a semi-professional camera 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.080
 this is a very good option and it is 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.280
 totally recommended, I also think that 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.550
 has several awards 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.260
 from this camera 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.750
 We will already be testing you for 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.850
 following videos of the channel 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.009
 and well let's hope it works a lot 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.469
 all right 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:57.979
 if you have and stop new comment 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:06:01.099
 your opinion is a trick or things to leave 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:03.199
 how can you improve it and then if I 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.509
 whole of something so I'll have them in 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.039
 another video then when I tell a lot 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.169
 always indexes are always announced 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:12.099
 as tests in the hours and see you 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.099
 until the next
