00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
when Little Women and good rides was

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.310 
when Little Women and good rides was
still<00:01:28.860> being<00:01:29.040> published<00:01:29.670> separately<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:31.170> she

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
still being published separately so she

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.219 
still being published separately so she
had<00:01:31.619> never<00:01:31.799> actually<00:01:31.979> read<00:01:32.400> good<00:01:32.670> wives<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.720> I

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
had never actually read good wives so I

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.870 
had never actually read good wives so I

haven't spoken to her recently but

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.219 
haven't spoken to her recently but
hopefully<00:01:36.180> has<00:01:36.329> she<00:01:36.509> has<00:01:36.689> got<00:01:36.840> around<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229

only 200 pages so much happens and so

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.379 
only 200 pages so much happens and so
much<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.970> just<00:03:45.239> really<00:03:45.660> quickly<00:03:46.230> glossed<00:03:46.889> over

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
much is just really quickly glossed over

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.319 
much is just really quickly glossed over
um<00:03:48.389> I've<00:03:48.930> just<00:03:49.410> for<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.579> amount<00:03:50.849> of<00:03:51.030> things

that happen in this book I feel like it

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.970 
that happen in this book I feel like it
should<00:03:53.040> be<00:03:53.419> considerably<00:03:54.419> heavier<00:03:54.739> but<00:03:55.739> he

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
should be considerably heavier but he

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.339 
should be considerably heavier but he
gets<00:03:56.160> his<00:03:56.310> point<00:03:56.549> across<00:03:56.699> and<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:58.049> really

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349

I think that same sort of freedom and
excitement<00:05:28.419> is<00:05:28.889> universal<00:05:29.889> and<00:05:30.099> this<00:05:30.520> was

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
excitement is universal and this was

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
and I think it's definitely the kind of

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.070 
and I think it's definitely the kind of
