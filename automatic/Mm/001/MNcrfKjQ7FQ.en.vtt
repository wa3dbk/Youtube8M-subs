 Welcome people are welcome to 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.330
 one more video on the channel and today it speaks 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.299
 about them are save this game you 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.029
 they'll see you there spinning it on the thin bottom 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.730
 of the video this game is being made and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.140
 is being inspired in pt that's it 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.119
 that game that was released to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.090
 playstation 4 no longer on psn 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.250
 that it was canceled what would heaven be in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.890
 three rivers, because a lot of people got pissed 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.030
 with that, why not cancel a game case 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.880
 of that many people had a 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.879
 very big expectation and then they went 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.649
 and canceled and then this guy there that is 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.210
 making game want chrysler if not me 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.960
 I mistake his name. 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.719
 He is making a game inspired by that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.760
 in that tease still creates a problem that 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.250
 I'm not cold playstation 4 that left 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.399
 quite excited because I read the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.800
 make stuff for pc and playstation 4 and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.309
 xbox one and probably for glasses 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.000
 rift too and left law here has a 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.100
 very cool thing that I read here I go 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.990
 leave the tap links only of the materials that 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.790
 of their channel also has some 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.530
 other things there pretty cool about the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.659
 environment but it's an interesting thing 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:22.229
 that the ric not in the site that if that 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.270
 kessler he does if he speaks the following 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.009
 he still said that the main 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.909
 inspiration for the game came from the very 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.310
 pt 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.740
 and so began to think how to do 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.500
 a new experience based on tease 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.490
 interactive game released for Playstation 4 on 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.049
 last year 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.329
 he even said that his own house 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.170
 served as the basis for the setting of the 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.720
 game and that the mt case goes in 1934 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.149
 served as the basis for things 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.270
 strange things that happened during the 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.220
 solitary journey of the protagonists and 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.200
 and such using as base the history of mt 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.329
 It goes to those who have watched the pimentel 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.510
 terror and we go as far as the film 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.010
 from each other 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.530
 this theme also about this story 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.330
 You know what it's about. 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.760
 so I'm very expectation 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.399
 great about this game there more 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.320
 information about this game I 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.590
 I'll bring it here for the channel. 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.110
 I was very upset too with a 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.760
 congestion of saints rio chico 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.190
 our fucking bastard 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.850
 but thankfully it has a staff and fans 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.230
 people who know what they're doing there 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.080
 When I saw it I was very excited. 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.020
 I hope it works out at 7:00. 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.640
 and let's hope we will wait until the year 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.030
 who comes who knows who has something and in the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.770
 e3 do not even talk about this game anymore 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.130
 Let's wait and see what's going to happen. 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.470
 sure, she's just a real news. 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.780
 long time talk about this about more 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.330
 on this topic because there are few things 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.970
 still about this game there I looked at the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.770
 internet does not have much information but 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.570
 information is that it really exists and 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.800
 what is being done 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.540
 so this is what I hope you liked 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.000

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.000
