00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello everyone book my name is 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.540
 further and i like to read video and this 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.330
 I wanted to take off the book already enough 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.230
 long ago because I read it already for 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.849
 for a long time but somehow stronger in him 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.949
 will the mindset somehow somehow not 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.260
 I just wanted them in this book 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.080
 take off but it seems to me that this one came 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.970
 an hour and i can tell you about the book already 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.210
 famous contemporary writer 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.930
 genre here he died and threw it before 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.599
 than i fall 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.540
 when I started to read this book at all 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.540
 I didn’t even know that 10 alarms from this 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.910
 division and so on I didn’t even know what 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.760
 this is to write venice absolutely by accident 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.739
 I found this book in the catalog of books and 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.910
 for some reason I liked the name 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.230
 description 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.890
 I do not even seem to read just the cover 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.140
 title 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.660
 It seems to me the main criterion for 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.079
 which I always put away books like this 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.989
 here I am always on the goshka about books well yes 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.090
 ok i started reading here to be honest 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.020
 the very first lines not this book not 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.510
 I like, I don't know why, but already 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.450
 thoughtful for some reason began to like 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 already somewhere probably after several chapters 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.689
 and even probably by the middle but initially 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.540
 I didn't like it so much because 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.830
 probably a typical American story about 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.470
 adolescents who drink there smoke 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.340
 have lead such not the best life 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.770
 but 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.400
 or rather told from the girl 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.030
 samantha kingston who can be said 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.110
 so the coolest in school yes yes they have 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.119
 there is some company of girls and they like 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.340
 would be the coolest school by the way 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.610
 I remember everything, despite the fact that I 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.740
 read maybe be scared back 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.800
 probably somewhere and still good 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.980
 remembers 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.590
 well remembered and and this is not very 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.410
 good girl herself up to kingston together 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.840
 with the same girls and your company 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.320
 12th of February 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.810
 went to the party and after it and when 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.910
 they were driving home they unfortunately got into 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.340
 car crash right after that to us 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.270
 described only to Samantha woke up 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.000
 and decided that all this is a dream we sweat people 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.970
 tired hurt too much like that day from on 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.540
 and she looked at the calendars 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.240
 and it's all the same February 12 mas wine 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.780
 this terrible day and had 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.320
 relive a few times more precisely a whole 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.070
 week I think depended spoiler and her 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.010
 had to 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.890
 she had to get better 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.170
 and had to be kinder to be honest 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.280
 opinion not so much like this 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.530
 book because i don't really like it but 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.170
 would when one event constantly 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.660
 described it was a whole seven times and 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.970
 just that I was not so pleasant and not 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.730
 I know why then I started to bother 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.830
 because seven times almost the same 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.410
 but she corrects her behavior a little 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.110
 but the actual events are the same 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.170
 From this novel I did not expect completely 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.620
 nothing and I think I even got 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.410
 probably more than expected 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.570
 somewhere 4 I put an analogue of lego then he did not 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.610
 the province to lay me some 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.370
 straight agreement impression but to me 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.420
 it seems you don’t have much to learn from me 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.550
 there type 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.500
 be better not to be such a hall 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.959
 Samantha is something like this and in this 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.110
 the book is still present for the sake of 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.500
 somewhere on the internet I read that 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.450
 this book is very similar to the movie I go 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.180
 groundhog day that's groundhog day 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.410
 if I'm not mistaken and say that as if 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.050
 lauren oliver just rewrote it 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.060
 from the movie that this is the same I do not 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.880
 watched the movie groundhog day and how did you even 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.340
 I do not want to be honest but write to me in 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.650
 comments does it really look like 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.540
 or is it all all lies can be people 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.700
 they lie this fashion but if you are too lazy to read 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.910
 book watching the movie Groundhog Day 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.130
 I hope you enjoy this book to me 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.830
 all this is probably all I wanted 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.959
 talk about this book is not so 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.880
 a lot but it seems to me more strongly 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.310
 tell anything because every 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.040
 spoiler step spoiler spoilers your 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.920
 I told the opinion 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:33.050
 book so on fours fours too 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.050
 good reading will be now bye
