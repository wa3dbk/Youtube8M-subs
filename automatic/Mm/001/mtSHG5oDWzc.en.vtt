00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.930 
hello everybody today we're going to
look<00:00:03.600> at<00:00:03.750> two<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.020> my<00:00:04.230> photo<00:00:04.470> cells<00:00:04.830> that<00:00:05.730> have

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
look at two of my photo cells that have

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.059 
look at two of my photo cells that have
been<00:00:06.120> broken<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:06.810> you<00:00:06.870> can<00:00:07.140> take<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.560> top<00:00:07.799> off

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
been broken so you can take the top off

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.749 
been broken so you can take the top off
and<00:00:08.460> then<00:00:08.820> we<00:00:09.000> will<00:00:09.030> look<00:00:09.450> at<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.750> inside<00:00:10.759> now

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
and then we will look at the inside now

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.950 
and then we will look at the inside now
this<00:00:12.059> one<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:13.139> fissure<00:00:13.710> Pierce<00:00:14.540> flow<00:00:15.540> cell

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.209 
luma trawl sorry mark 3 and it is 230
volts<00:00:36.950> we'll<00:00:37.950> start<00:00:38.250> with<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:40.070> take<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
volts we'll start with this one take the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.830 
volts we'll start with this one take the
cover<00:00:41.460> off<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.300> see<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> cover

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
cover off and as you can see the cover

here<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.699> there<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.300> adjust<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.989> for

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
here is there so you can adjust it for

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.759 
here is there so you can adjust it for
whatever<00:01:02.129> time<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.329> want<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.080> turn<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.470> or

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
whatever time you want it to turn on or

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.020 
cell is round as you can see and there
is<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:16.400> capacitor<00:01:17.400> right<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:19.670> we'll<00:01:20.670> turn<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
is a capacitor right here we'll turn it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.060 
is a capacitor right here we'll turn it
around<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.350> some<00:01:25.920> other

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.990 

we<00:03:31.870> will<00:03:31.990> push<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.410> back<00:03:32.620> down<00:03:32.860> in<00:03:33.010> there<00:03:33.190> and

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
we will push that back down in there and

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.360 
we will push that back down in there and
as<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.330> can<00:03:34.480> see<00:03:34.890> you're<00:03:35.890> going<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.070> hold<00:03:36.220> it

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
as you can see you're going to hold it

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.840 
as you can see you're going to hold it
up<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.670> light<00:03:36.910> here<00:03:37.210> you<00:03:37.450> can<00:03:38.080> see<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:39.430> kind<00:03:39.730> of

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
up to light here you can see it kind of

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.880 
up to light here you can see it kind of
you<00:03:39.970> can<00:03:40.180> see<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.570> pattern<00:03:41.020> of<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.290> photocell

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
you can see the pattern of the photocell

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.820 
you can see the pattern of the photocell
there<00:03:42.070> it<00:03:42.190> goes<00:03:42.370> through<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.760> back<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.650> now

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
there it goes through the back and now

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.410 
there it goes through the back and now
you<00:03:47.830> can<00:03:47.950> see<00:03:48.070> there's<00:03:48.250> some<00:03:48.430> type<00:03:48.610> of<00:03:48.640> ballast

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
you can see there's some type of ballast

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.810 
you can see there's some type of ballast
or<00:03:49.800> transformer<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:53.590> must<00:03:53.890> be<00:03:54.100> some<00:03:54.370> type<00:03:54.610> of

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
or transformer that must be some type of

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.810 
or transformer that must be some type of
switch<00:03:55.240> right<00:03:55.600> there<00:03:55.930> now<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.770> this<00:03:57.460> right

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
switch right there now that this right

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.620 
switch right there now that this right
here<00:03:57.850> was<00:03:58.360> where<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.750> burnt<00:03:59.020> spot<00:03:59.470> was<00:03:59.830> on

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
here was where the burnt spot was on

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.070 
here was where the burnt spot was on
here<00:04:02.190> so<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.370> must<00:04:03.640> have<00:04:03.790> smoked<00:04:04.780> or

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
here so that must have smoked or

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.140 
here so that must have smoked or
something<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:07.890> don't<00:04:08.890> see<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:09.130> bi-metal<00:04:09.640> switch

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
something I don't see a bi-metal switch

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.930 
something I don't see a bi-metal switch
it's<00:04:10.420> probably<00:04:10.959> hidden<00:04:11.470> on<00:04:11.800> this<00:04:12.700> one

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
it's probably hidden on this one

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.190 
it's probably hidden on this one
somewhere<00:04:14.940> nope<00:04:15.940> there<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.390> is<00:04:16.540> right<00:04:16.870> there

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
somewhere nope there it is right there

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.960 
somewhere nope there it is right there
that's<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.340> bi-metal<00:04:18.580> switch<00:04:22.410> there's<00:04:23.410> not<00:04:23.620> a

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
that's the bi-metal switch there's not a

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.950 
that's the bi-metal switch there's not a
capacitor<00:04:24.970> in<00:04:25.090> this<00:04:25.240> one<00:04:25.480> and<00:04:26.220> that<00:04:27.220> one<00:04:27.460> is

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
capacitor in this one and that one is

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.720 
capacitor in this one and that one is
