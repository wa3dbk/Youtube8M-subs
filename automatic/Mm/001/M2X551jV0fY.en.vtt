00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.320 
on them you don't throw them away
because<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.310> reality<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.150> when

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
because the reality is is when

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.400 
because the reality is is when
somebody's<00:00:18.630> put<00:00:18.779> their<00:00:18.900> house<00:00:19.020> on<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.289> market

at one point the chances of them selling

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.750 
at one point the chances of them selling
at<00:00:22.140> some<00:00:22.380> point<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.740> future<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.670> next

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
at some point in the future in the next

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.300 
at some point in the future in the next
24<00:00:24.510> months<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:25.050> 12<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.380> 24<00:00:25.710> months<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:26.039> pretty

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
24 months in 12 to 24 months is pretty

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.640 
24 months in 12 to 24 months is pretty
high<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.420> when<00:00:27.779> they<00:00:27.900> don't<00:00:28.050> want<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.349> sell

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
high and so when they don't want to sell

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.009 
high and so when they don't want to sell
right<00:00:28.890> now<00:00:29.099> they're<00:00:29.429> not<00:00:29.460> really<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.970> lead<00:00:30.359> so

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
right now they're not really a lead so

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.880 
right now they're not really a lead so
you<00:00:31.109> don't<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> keep<00:00:31.470> them<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.650> your<00:00:31.679> lead

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
you don't to keep them in your lead

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.530

you add them to your personal vortex or

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.709 
you add them to your personal vortex or
your<00:00:40.260> vortex<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.610> relationships<00:00:42.510> that

real estate vortex on my youtube channel

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.430 
real estate vortex on my youtube channel
and<00:01:00.149> you'll<00:01:00.660> find<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.109> because<00:01:01.230> it's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and you'll find it because it's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.650 
and you'll find it because it's
extremely<00:01:02.010> important<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.850> breakthrough

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
extremely important it is a breakthrough

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
extremely important it is a breakthrough
I<00:01:04.409> think<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.799> real<00:01:04.949> estate<00:01:05.010> industry<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
I think in the real estate industry and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.890 
I think in the real estate industry and
the<00:01:05.700> strategy<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> way<00:01:06.840> of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the strategy and just the way of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.690 
the strategy and just the way of
thinking<00:01:07.439> about<00:01:07.560> building<00:01:07.950> your<00:01:08.549> business

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
thinking about building your business

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.940 
thinking about building your business
well<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.689> simple<00:01:10.080> answer<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.710> when<00:01:10.860> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
well the simple answer is is when you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
well the simple answer is is when you
talk<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.340> an<00:01:11.430> expired<00:01:11.880> an<00:01:12.150> old<00:01:12.330> expired

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
talk to an expired an old expired

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.539 
talk to an expired an old expired
somebody<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:13.860> people<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.280> real<00:01:14.520> estate

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
somebody your people in your real estate

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.249 
somebody your people in your real estate
vortex<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> they<00:01:15.479> understand<00:01:15.810> how<00:01:15.869> vortex

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
vortex and they understand how vortex

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.560 
vortex and they understand how vortex
was<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> whirlpool<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
was like a whirlpool it's like a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.359 
was like a whirlpool it's like a
spinning<00:01:18.570> most<00:01:18.840> fluid<00:01:19.350> motion<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.040> has<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
spinning most fluid motion that has a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.730 
spinning most fluid motion that has a
pull<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.420> basically<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.380> way<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
pull to it and basically the way the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
pull to it and basically the way the
vortex<00:01:23.100> works<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.659> are<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
vortex works is you are here you are the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.539 
vortex works is you are here you are the
core<00:01:25.290> you're<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.680> energy<00:01:26.100> core<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
core you're the energy core of the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.420 
core you're the energy core of the

totally<00:05:44.150> different<00:05:44.419> way<00:05:44.569> of<00:05:44.599> thinking<00:05:45.050> about

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
totally different way of thinking about

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.350 
totally different way of thinking about
it<00:05:45.349> cuz<00:05:45.560> it's<00:05:45.680> a<00:05:45.770> different<00:05:46.129> activity<00:05:47.000> now

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
it cuz it's a different activity now

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.209 
it cuz it's a different activity now
I've<00:05:47.659> got<00:05:47.839> to<00:05:47.960> stay<00:05:48.139> in<00:05:48.259> touch<00:05:48.529> with<00:05:48.830> these

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
I've got to stay in touch with these

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.040 
I've got to stay in touch with these
people<00:05:49.550> and<00:05:49.819> the<00:05:49.909> strategy<00:05:50.419> that<00:05:50.539> I<00:05:50.629> teach<00:05:50.839> is

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050

through<00:06:55.010> your<00:06:55.130> vortex<00:06:55.370> both<00:06:56.270> credit

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
through your vortex both credit

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.360 
through your vortex both credit
likability<00:06:57.500> and<00:06:57.620> credibility<00:06:57.950> because<00:06:58.190> they

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
likability and credibility because they

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.580 
likability and credibility because they
know<00:06:58.670> you<00:06:58.730> they<00:06:59.270> like<00:06:59.450> they<00:06:59.960> like<00:07:00.170> you<00:07:00.200> and

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
they trust you so what happened the

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.440 
they trust you so what happened the

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
vortex does is it bridges the trust gap

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.330 
vortex does is it bridges the trust gap
it<00:07:05.450> bridges<00:07:05.930> that<00:07:06.080> they<00:07:06.320> don't<00:07:06.680> trust<00:07:06.920> you

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
it bridges that they don't trust you

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.760 
it bridges that they don't trust you
that<00:07:07.520> credibility<00:07:08.030> it<00:07:08.660> helps<00:07:09.110> you<00:07:09.230> to<00:07:09.320> connect
