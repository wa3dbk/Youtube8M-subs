 The Nokia N8 is Nokia's first ever smartphone of the new generation 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.099
 other operating systems 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.240
 and the current top model from Nokia 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.779
 Computer world finally has the time to test laboratories 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.539
 The former is definitely 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.910
 It is the best camera phone tested so far and that can from a 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.410
 Picture quality and so were but we come normal compact cameras 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.229
 digital cameras 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:34.570
 keep track of what is obvious at first glance that the percent Nokia n8 

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:37.859
 Percent more much faster and more fluid than 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.400
 Present Beale 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.690

 Percent, the nominal 12 megapixel resolution, he has managed a real 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.920
 7 Kormann Mega Pixel in the computer picture test that is Europe a very good one 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.890
 So the forecasts are very detailed 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.320
 and the shutter delay it with newcomer 6 seconds who short so 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.990
 it is also suitable for one or the other snapshot somehow 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.750
 Get rid of a HD format, so to speak 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.220
 recorded so that more possible even in passable size 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.920
 TV year flat screen TV can look at one 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.680
 and you can even - on the device itself cutting leads short 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.750
 youtube-film Branko to collapse you may lead directly from the phone 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.260
 via w-lan or UMTS its awkward resources to the point 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.920
 which is very nice you can with a supplied adapter s.einem 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.700
 normal flat screens 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.120
 TV and you can even use usb-sticks or Oh Busby 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.270
 hard drives 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.670
 at least if they are not too big connect and for example movies the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.640
 you buy 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.120
 on the hard drive has to play directly on the TV or even an HD 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.160
 The test results are not yet complete but already 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.540
 is fixed percent the n8 is the best so far 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.580
 If the computer image has ever been tested it really offers one 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.260
 Lot of functions for multimedia Suez um 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.750
 Percent Alber film itself make photos as well as to watch the synonymous 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.040
 music player scn-trainer really would have class and camped for a pot 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.979
 keep up 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:17.789
 I think Internet features percent, but Nokia is not quite on the 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:21.479
 Top position but overall is in any case because of the Red what 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.739
 and the windows climbed were buy recommendation
