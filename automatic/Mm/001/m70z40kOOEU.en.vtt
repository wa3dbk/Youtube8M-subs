00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.580 
the 300 subscribers and that's mostly
because<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.759> kind<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.030> hard<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:04.380> get<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
because it's kind of hard to to get a

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.749 
because it's kind of hard to to get a
lot<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.799> use<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> at<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.320> point

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
lot of use so at this point

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.780 
lot of use so at this point
I<00:02:08.819> got<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:09.659> lodestar<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.590> i<00:02:11.189> will<00:02:11.370> call<00:02:11.549> it<00:02:11.700> in

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
I got my lodestar and i will call it in

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.729 
I got my lodestar and i will call it in
i<00:02:12.000> will<00:02:12.150> skip<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.599> part<00:02:12.659> of<00:02:13.079> course<00:02:13.319> because

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
i will skip that part of course because

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.369 
i will skip that part of course because
if<00:02:14.040> i<00:02:14.220> would<00:02:14.400> record<00:02:14.730> everything<00:02:15.379> the

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
if i would record everything the

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.890 
if i would record everything the
gameplay<00:02:16.650> would<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:17.129> like<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.879> think<00:02:18.569> 11

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
gameplay would be like I think 11

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.309 
gameplay would be like I think 11
minutes<00:02:19.409> and<00:02:20.030> look<00:02:21.030> at<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.360> I'm<00:02:21.750> actually

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
minutes and look at that I'm actually

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.119 
minutes and look at that I'm actually
pretty<00:02:22.709> close<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:24.180> low<00:02:24.510> sir<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.230> I

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
pretty close to a not a low sir and I

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.729 
pretty close to a not a low sir and I
guess<00:02:26.519> if<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.849> would<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.090> had<00:02:27.150> my<00:02:27.569> lodestar<00:02:28.200> at

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
guess if I would have had my lodestar at

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.530 
guess if I would have had my lodestar at
this<00:02:29.010> point<00:02:29.340> look<00:02:29.640> at<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.909> I<00:02:29.940> need<00:02:30.180> two<00:02:30.390> more

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
this point look at that I need two more

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.259 
this point look at that I need two more
kills<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.989> think<00:02:31.230> for<00:02:31.379> my<00:02:31.470> load<00:02:31.590> sir<00:02:31.860> then<00:02:32.549> maybe

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
kills I think for my load sir then maybe

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.440 
kills I think for my load sir then maybe
I<00:02:33.390> would<00:02:33.599> have<00:02:33.629> had<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.879> 120<00:02:35.879> score<00:02:36.239> I

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
I would have had in the 120 score I

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.530 
I would have had in the 120 score I
don't<00:02:36.750> know<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.790> well<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:40.280> will<00:02:41.280> get<00:02:41.459> my<00:02:41.540> auto

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
setup because as you can see I'm using

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.449 
setup because as you can see I'm using
the<00:03:08.489> MSMC<00:03:08.970> with<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.840> silencer<00:03:10.379> and<00:03:10.560> fast<00:03:11.099> mags
