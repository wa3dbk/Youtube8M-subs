00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
Xbox and I've been playing xbox for a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.820 
Xbox and I've been playing xbox for a
long<00:01:03.210> time<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:03.930> owned<00:01:04.199> by<00:01:04.470> microsoft

right deal and I'd really don't think

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.520 
right deal and I'd really don't think
this<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.120> the<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.390> way<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.840> Minecraft<00:01:10.350> I'm

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
