00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.985
 Kael'thas overview 

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:20.069
 Welcome. 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.272
 Kael'thas Sunstrider from the World of Warcraft 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.675
 left a high post on the council of the Kirin Tor, 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.169
 to protect your people after the massacre, 

00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:36.214
 perpetrated by prince arthas - and revenge. 

00:00:36.607 --> 00:00:38.833
 Armed with three crystals of power, 

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:40.897
 left after the Scourge invasion, 

00:00:41.098 --> 00:00:44.149
 Kael'thas headed for the Nexus. 

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:49.699
 Kael'thas - assassin attacking in long-range combat. 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:51.909
 He is able to increase the power of his spells. 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.159
 and inflict huge damage on the area. 

00:00:55.504 --> 00:00:57.004
 Let's start the same. 

00:00:58.132 --> 00:01:00.425
 Kehl's tactical decisions are largely dependent 

00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:02.675
 from the skill called "Green Spheres". 

00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:06.318
 When activated, spheres appear around Kehl, 

00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:08.568
 enhancing his next ability. 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.619
 The recovery time of the skill is only 6 seconds, 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.890
 which allows the magician to reveal his potential. 

00:01:16.797 --> 00:01:19.686
 Kehl can use the "pillar of fire" - 

00:01:19.896 --> 00:01:21.936
 long-range spell after 

00:01:22.257 --> 00:01:24.143
 short delay creating 

00:01:24.393 --> 00:01:26.393
 at the indicated point a column of flame. 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.436
 Strengthening the ability to "green areas", 

00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:33.244
 it will increase its range by 50% 

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:35.894
 and deal more damage. 

00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:38.987
 The Living Bomb ability has the effect of 

00:01:39.196 --> 00:01:41.837
 inflicting damage to the target for three seconds. 

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:43.859
 After this an explosion occurs, 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.109
 striking nearby enemies. 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.420
 Strengthened by "Greening Spheres" 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.670
 "Living Bomb" does not require application costs 

00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:53.325
 and has no recovery time. 

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:55.575
 If Kael'thas reapplies the ability 

00:01:55.802 --> 00:01:57.717
 after applying the effect, 

00:01:57.896 --> 00:01:59.870
 then the explosion happens instantly 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.617
 not after three seconds. 

00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:06.440
 “Gravity distortion” is a reference. 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.690
 to ability from the raid "Fortress of Storms". 

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:10.893
 When used, it will hit the first target, 

00:02:11.143 --> 00:02:12.643
 met her on the way 

00:02:12.893 --> 00:02:14.506
 raise her into the air and stun her. 

00:02:14.707 --> 00:02:16.982
 Strengthened by "Greening Spheres" 

00:02:17.232 --> 00:02:19.632
 the ability will hit the first three targets. 

00:02:21.162 --> 00:02:22.909
 Kehl's first heroic ability 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.659
 called "Phoenix". 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.409
 Kael'thas summons the phoenix to that place, 

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:30.227
 causing damage to all targets in its path. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.773
 For a short time 

00:02:33.023 --> 00:02:34.881
 the phoenix will remain in the indicated place 

00:02:35.062 --> 00:02:37.457
 inflicting damage to surrounding enemies 

00:02:37.707 --> 00:02:39.707
 and grazing the rest. 

00:02:40.843 --> 00:02:43.333
 Firebloom - Classic Fireball 

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:45.444
 in the interpretation of Kael'thas. 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.341
 After casting the spell 

00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:49.591
 the prince of the elves fires a ball 

00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:52.208
 tremendous damage 

00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:55.758
 and offending nearby opponents. 

00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:02.571
 The “fiery block” pursues its victim; 

00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:05.821
 avoid damage almost impossible! 

00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:11.837
 Kel can cause serious damage to enemies 

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:14.117
 but at the same time it is a very fragile goal. 

00:03:14.384 --> 00:03:16.337
 A skilled player will need to know 

00:03:16.564 --> 00:03:18.287
 where to sit right 

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:20.187
 and what set of abilities to choose 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.087
 for each particular fight. 

00:03:22.495 --> 00:03:24.687
 When you are going to apply the ability, make sure 

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:26.764
 did not appear nearby dangerous enemy. 

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:28.465
 Kael'thas has two powers, 

00:03:28.484 --> 00:03:29.984
 causing damage to the area: 

00:03:30.034 --> 00:03:31.725
 "Live Bomb" and "Pillar of Fire". 

00:03:31.726 --> 00:03:33.393
 Their reasonable combination will allow 

00:03:33.643 --> 00:03:35.337
 put your enemies on your knees 

00:03:35.338 --> 00:03:37.079
 or make them run, 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.329
 after which the allies can easily deal with them. 

00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:42.796
 "Gravity distortion" is also suitable for protection, 

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:44.846
 and for attack. 

00:03:45.203 --> 00:03:46.744
 Little patience 

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:48.994
 and winning your team in your pocket. 

00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:52.133
 Having access to heroic abilities, 

00:03:52.183 --> 00:03:54.583
 Begin the battle with "Fiery Lump". 

00:03:54.992 --> 00:03:56.769
 This spell is pronounced long enough 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.615
 and it is quite capable of breaking the enemy line 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.021
 providing an advantage to your allies. 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.724
 "Phoenix" is useful for capturing areas 

00:04:05.974 --> 00:04:07.474
 siege and 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.092
 of course, combined blows - 

00:04:10.342 --> 00:04:13.342
 thanks to the radius of action and permanent damage. 

00:04:14.468 --> 00:04:16.304
 Do not forget that the true star Kehl 

00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:18.353
 able to shine only in the case 

00:04:18.354 --> 00:04:20.725
 if the allies smoothly protect him 

00:04:20.975 --> 00:04:22.975
 or prepare victims for his spells. 

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.058
 Too easy! 

00:04:30.712 --> 00:04:32.241
 In the comments you can 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.750
 tell others how effective 

00:04:33.956 --> 00:04:35.292
 apply the ability of Kehl. 

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:36.792
 We can't wait to see 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.930
 how the players use their skills 

00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:40.557
