00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
this switch plays a little bit of tricks

early<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.680> first<00:00:07.890> session<00:00:08.130> but<00:00:08.460> we

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
early in the first session but we

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.709 
early in the first session but we
thought<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.630> have<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.840> just<00:00:10.830> play<00:00:11.790> safely<00:00:12.570> the

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
thought we have to just play safely the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.020 
thought we have to just play safely the
first<00:00:12.929> session<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.469> capitalize<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.849> in

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
first session and capitalize on that in

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.720

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
the second one and the third one but

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.820 
the second one and the third one but
unfortunately<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:18.660> lost<00:00:18.840> two<00:00:19.050> wickets<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
unfortunately we lost two wickets in the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.830 
unfortunately we lost two wickets in the
first<00:00:20.010> session<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.550> then<00:00:21.029> early<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
first session and then early on in the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.929 
first session and then early on in the
second<00:00:22.199> one<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.130> didn't<00:00:23.460> help<00:00:23.580> at<00:00:23.760> all

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
second one so that didn't help at all

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.220 
second one so that didn't help at all
and<00:00:24.859> but<00:00:25.859> still<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.400> would<00:00:26.730> say<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.230> Misbah

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
and but still I would say that Misbah

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.669 
and but still I would say that Misbah
has<00:00:28.470> played<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> tremendous<00:00:28.980> inning<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.760> far

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
well but the pity is that we were hoping

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.330 
well but the pity is that we were hoping
to<00:00:35.670> get<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.210> round<00:00:36.390> about<00:00:36.690> 300<00:00:37.260> today<00:00:37.440> with

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
about just three or four down but your

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090

wanted players to get on with it get a
big<00:00:46.079> score<00:00:46.590> why<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.160> batsmen<00:00:47.640> keep<00:00:47.850> getting<00:00:48.180> in

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
big score why do batsmen keep getting in

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.420 
big score why do batsmen keep getting in
and<00:00:48.450> getting<00:00:48.480> out<00:00:48.860> that's<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.980> very<00:00:50.219> good

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and getting out that's a very good

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.970 
and getting out that's a very good
question<00:00:50.579> nasara<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:52.079> I've<00:00:52.379> been<00:00:52.649> pretty

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
question nasara we I've been pretty

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.650 
question nasara we I've been pretty
worried<00:00:53.370> about<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.270> solved

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
worried about that and we have solved

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.750 
worried about that and we have solved
this<00:00:54.750> problem<00:00:54.989> out<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> certain<00:00:56.250> extent<00:00:56.640> but

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
this problem out to a certain extent but

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.000 
this problem out to a certain extent but
I<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.360> work<00:00:57.539> very<00:00:58.199> much<00:00:58.260> hard<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.859> this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
I have to work very much hard on this

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.459 
I have to work very much hard on this
way<00:00:59.280> because<00:00:59.760> that's<00:01:00.600> some<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> batsmen

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
way because that's some of the batsmen

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.349 
way because that's some of the batsmen
are<00:01:01.590> getting<00:01:01.829> very<00:01:02.070> good<00:01:02.129> 40s<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.820> 50s<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
then getting out like for example

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130 
then getting out like for example
essentially<00:01:05.939> today<00:01:06.240> he<00:01:06.600> was<00:01:06.869> playing

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
essentially today he was playing

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.690 
essentially today he was playing
marvelously<00:01:07.650> well<00:01:07.890> he<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.310> doing<00:01:08.580> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
marvelously well he was doing it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
but then suddenly lost his wicked and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.929 
but then suddenly lost his wicked and
all<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> pressure<00:01:13.590> came<00:01:13.920> back<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.310> us<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
all the pressure came back on us and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.960 
all the pressure came back on us and
just<00:01:15.210> imagine<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.750> Misbah<00:01:16.140> 70<00:01:17.009> or<00:01:17.159> 80<00:01:17.400> or<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
just imagine if Misbah 70 or 80 or and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.450 
just imagine if Misbah 70 or 80 or and
Assoc<00:01:18.570> feet<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.860> same<00:01:20.040> number<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
Assoc feet not out on the same number of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.399 
Assoc feet not out on the same number of
runs<00:01:20.729> things<00:01:21.060> would<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.390> been<00:01:21.420> different<00:01:21.720> so

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
runs things would have been different so

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.740 
runs things would have been different so
this<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:23.159> problem<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.150> sort<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> out

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
this is a problem we have to sort it out

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.719 
this is a problem we have to sort it out
as<00:01:25.080> soon<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.439> possible<00:01:25.890> what<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.610> with
