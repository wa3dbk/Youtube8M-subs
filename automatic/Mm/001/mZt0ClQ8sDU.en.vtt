00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.580
 2 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.550
 hello everyone gets upset of case and 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.130
 we are today with the map 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.410
 the wall and even more precisely this 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.059
 walk biome you will understand that all 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.399
 immediately after then the map the wall 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:34.460
 for those who do not know it's 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.739
 a kind of little fallen kingdom in 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.559
 makes a little jogging kingdom accelerated 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.629
 where you are going to have to face 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.750
 then either by team of 2 or by 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.960
 team of reims all alone on 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.579
 different 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.659
 listen we'll see them right away 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.190
 map how it presents for you 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.329
 show a little how it goes this 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.829
 will be much simpler to explain 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.219
 as you can see there are four 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.230
 kinds of organic but different separate 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.750
 by sand walls and so each of the 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.100
 participants so if you are 4 or even 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.690
 a little joy of too but we will say 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.360
 starting on four or eight 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.759
 so both teams are going to be 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.270
 So each by two on a 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.860
 biomes and 1 of one of the parties and go 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.470
 duty is going to prepare for the clash 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.929
 final that will take place after 15 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.000
 minutes after 15 minutes of preparation 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.040
 the sand walls will collapse and there 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.360
 you may simply need to 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.950
 kill the other team 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.939
 so it's pretty simple as 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.220
 functioning it's kind of like a 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.790
 Film small kingdom they admit cei 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.950
 steps every time 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.510
 every time to respect before 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.280
 to be able to have pvp ben there is a little 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.960
 same except that at one stage it 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.310
 really the sand wall then you 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.680
 must do everything you can to 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.760
 your side of the wall to prepare you for 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.260
 better to make you an equipment at 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.020
 better then there is always a safe 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.220
 also hide in the organic part 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.630
 you are going to be what will allow 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.160
 to balance the parts a bit because 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.229
 that you can take for example the 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.000
 bio but the sand biome does it all 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.650
 simply no tree so to have 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.060
 wood is a little complicated but 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.380
 here you are going to have causes that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.710
 are going to balance the parties it's rather 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.410
 not bad 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.170
 what we are going to do we will return to the 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.130
 spawn area and we will read the rules 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.930
 already simply 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.340
 so if you did not understand because 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.320
 that it is possible that it is difficult to explain 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.730
 also it does not kill the opposite look 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.470
 a little bit on the internet of the maps of 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.720
 parts flying high one sees everywhere 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.070
 a little it's really parties it's 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.330
 really short in any case on minecraft 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.130
 do not hesitate to go see others 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.660
 videos on the internet to be able to a little 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.100
 what because it gives everything 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.209
 simply 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.110
 so so the creator of the drool ca 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.880
 dextro and so his youtube channel that's 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.020
 bullet proof shock so go visit it 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.019
 because he made us a great map 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.540
 so the rules 2 euros do not break the 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.160
 sand wall in the middle so that you do not 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.760
 do not break me left on your side of the 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.739
 wall gamer tag of clean to see where are 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.049
 and what do your opponents play in 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.459
 easy there are hidden chests of 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.040
 everywhere so that's what I tell you 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.220
 said just this same team same time 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.500
 skins do not sleep 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.209
 do not break the blocks 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.230
 options 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.310
 the game starts in fifteen minutes 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.320
 so I'm going to show you there is a small 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.540
 button press to start counting 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.299
 so that the wall of sandbag forgiveness 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.960
 crumbles fire spread on off 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.880
 the tnt on own 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.860
 and take what you need 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.840
 I just think that's what you tell me 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.890
 will not contradict those who have 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.200
 helped make the map so it's god 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.270
 x-force meo so his youtube channel 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.430
 Cedric King Meo and Azzan and his chain 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:27.170
 youtube is drop the tempo so there 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.730
 you will start here so map the 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.470
 bull did parry dextro we already had it 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.950
 said so I started here you go 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.750
 duty 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.070
 there are no little readers so 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.870
 that's a little pity but ben 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.280
 listen you are going to make your teams 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.690
 you choose yourself in which 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.190
 what purpose did you have for that 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.660
 will be up to you to decide between you 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.580
 so I had a desert biome like we 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.850
 could see a bios I like it I think that 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.000
 it's his meadow he called it 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.290
 we have what here a swap so I think 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.620
 it must be swampy marsh 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.580
 swamps and snow of course so there 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.900
 you will see these four different 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.820
 biome there then just I show you everything 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.800
 right away you have this little trick 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.250
 viewers so once you'll be 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.040
 death forgiveness you can always go 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.350
 admire the rest of the game vigilante 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.330
 by just standing there and you can 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.190
 like that follow a little or incense your 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.440
 opponents and then see who will be the 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.940
 great winner of this wall so 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.160
 so to start the part of which 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.300
 Claude must put himself in 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.770
 actually steal just to 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.810
 to be able to operate this button which 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.360
 is the way there and who will launch the 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.370
 counting the sand wall so there I 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.350
 the games the throws before launching the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.430
 video but now I think I have 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.390
 started recording too early 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.560
 today wait a little bit for 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.110
 to be able to show you in the face of mans 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.670
 it collapses and listen to me and you 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.250
 find out for yourself 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.050
 way that's not a big deal and so 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.420
 so that's going to be a big place at 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.650
 glen days that's it or meadows or well 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.870
 you will be able to start harvesting 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.890
 wood started looking also had the 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.840
 victory a hidden chest somewhere 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.560
 so I think he's here see a 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.360
 little light 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.160
 so here I show you a little bit or 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.350
 are you going to have one like 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.760
 you see with balloon we have a room 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.290
 of enchantment there is also a chest 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.510
 hidden somewhere to you to dig to 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.710
 you to find it I already showed where 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.910
 was the enchanting table for 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.920
 power will enchant your armor 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.590
 precisely because of course you 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.030
 play in survival mode after or 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.110
 normal or easy it depends on what 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.550
 you want to put but to have 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.550
 bad to be able to have a little bit 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.440
 a little bit of experience 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.150
 here we have our little chest which is 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.680
 just there since we are in the 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.840
 example see we have arrows of the red 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.190
 stone of the slopes we have a little bit of everything 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.290
 could also do to set up 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.510
 traps in your side of the wall 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.740
 for ba trapped to the opponents when they 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.860
 will try to come and attack you and 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.270
 Ben gets trapped by I do not know 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.520
 by an explosion of tnt for example 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.720
 I said that I say nothing so here you are 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.820
 have to redo some of the feet of a 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.990
 little everywhere will you equip and then the goal 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.310
 it is to put on the face like 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.990
 often in minecraft 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.520
 so here I hope in any case that I 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.290
 did you explain the map I'm trying to 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.220
 to do at best as would say what you 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.450
 think about it in the comments but I 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.710
 find it pretty good with its bubbles 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.780
 difference is rather interesting to 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.430
 play and I had already presented a 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.580
 on the fashion chain the wall so 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.720
 do not hesitate to come back in the videos 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.370
 and videos of the month you will find 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.740
 in the wings of the cd of the month you the 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.080
 will find and so that's okay listen I 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.150
 I'll leave you there I hope 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.820
 the video you liked and I tell you to 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.090
 soon for next hi videos 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.090
 everybody
