Adam I can't review on these
to<00:02:10.360> actually<00:02:10.750> test<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:11.680> I'm<00:02:12.070> not<00:02:12.190> gonna

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
to actually test that so I'm not gonna

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.890 
to actually test that so I'm not gonna
break<00:02:12.550> them<00:02:12.700> but<00:02:12.880> I'll<00:02:13.240> use<00:02:13.420> them<00:02:13.510> free<00:02:13.690> games

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
break them but I'll use them free games

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.720 
break them but I'll use them free games
and<00:02:14.140> uh<00:02:14.230> see<00:02:14.860> if<00:02:14.890> they<00:02:15.040> rip<00:02:15.220> there's<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.490> lot<00:02:15.610> of

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
and uh see if they rip there's a lot of

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.910 
and uh see if they rip there's a lot of
noises<00:02:16.090> ripped<00:02:16.480> but<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:16.960> bet<00:02:17.440> these<00:02:17.560> are<00:02:17.620> really
