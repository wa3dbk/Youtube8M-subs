use<00:01:36.900> things<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.189> would<00:01:38.369> be

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
use things like that then that would be

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.620

to 400 degrees because one of the key
things<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.899> need<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.860> pre<00:01:50.430> bake

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
things that you need to do is pre bake

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.800 
things that you need to do is pre bake
your<00:01:51.600> pizza<00:01:52.110> crust<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.159> 10<00:01:53.490> minutes<00:01:54.060> so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
your pizza crust just for 10 minutes so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.410 
your pizza crust just for 10 minutes so
I<00:01:54.840> divided<00:01:55.409> my<00:01:55.530> dough<00:01:55.680> into<00:01:56.280> four<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.149> I

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
I divided my dough into four and I

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.569 
I divided my dough into four and I
greased<00:01:57.750> my<00:01:58.049> cake<00:01:58.320> pans<00:01:58.619> really<00:01:59.070> well<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
greased my cake pans really well and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.389 
greased my cake pans really well and
then<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.880> spread<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.960> dough<00:02:01.229> out<00:02:01.259> now<00:02:02.189> I'm

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
then I spread the dough out now I'm

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.609 
then I spread the dough out now I'm
going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.820> only<00:02:03.000> bake<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.509> for<00:02:03.689> 10<00:02:04.079> minutes

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
going to only bake it for 10 minutes

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.170 
going to only bake it for 10 minutes
I<00:02:04.680> don't<00:02:05.100> want<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.399> cooked<00:02:05.640> all<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.149> way

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
I don't want it cooked all the way

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.260 
I don't want it cooked all the way
through<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.229> pre-baked<00:02:07.849> so<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.090> is

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
through it's just a pre-baked so this is

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.089 
through it's just a pre-baked so this is
what<00:02:09.450> your<00:02:09.629> pizza<00:02:10.050> crust<00:02:10.259> will<00:02:10.800> look<00:02:10.950> like

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
what your pizza crust will look like

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.150 
what your pizza crust will look like
after<00:02:11.340> ten<00:02:11.790> minutes

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
after ten minutes

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.220 
after ten minutes
so<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.550> will<00:02:12.760> start<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.300> get<00:02:13.450> firm<00:02:13.870> but<00:02:14.110> it

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
so it will start to get firm but it

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.630 
so it will start to get firm but it
isn't<00:02:14.560> going<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:14.770> be<00:02:14.860> cooked<00:02:15.190> all<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.610> way

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
isn't going to be cooked all the way

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.420 
isn't going to be cooked all the way
through<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:17.290> you'll<00:02:17.470> just<00:02:17.500> go<00:02:17.860> ahead<00:02:17.950> and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
through so you'll just go ahead and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.760 
through so you'll just go ahead and
stack<00:02:18.880> your<00:02:19.090> pizza<00:02:19.510> crusts<00:02:19.930> on<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.110> plate<00:02:20.470> and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
stack your pizza crusts on a plate and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.140 
stack your pizza crusts on a plate and
then<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.010> can<00:02:21.160> have<00:02:21.370> sort<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.790> like<00:02:21.970> an

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
then you can have sort of like an

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.780 
then you can have sort of like an
assembly<00:02:22.270> line<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:23.230> then<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.100> can<00:02:24.130> just

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
assembly line and then you can just

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.960 
assembly line and then you can just
spread<00:02:25.600> your<00:02:25.920> pizza<00:02:26.920> sauce<00:02:27.130> on<00:02:27.190> top<00:02:27.640> sprinkle

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
spread your pizza sauce on top sprinkle

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.270 
spread your pizza sauce on top sprinkle
down<00:02:28.450> with<00:02:28.690> your<00:02:28.900> cheese<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.590> your<00:02:29.890> pepperoni

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
down with your cheese and your pepperoni

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.750 
down with your cheese and your pepperoni
just<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:31.120> would<00:02:31.390> make<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.930> normal<00:02:32.320> pizza

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
just like you would make a normal pizza

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.760 
just like you would make a normal pizza
so<00:02:33.760> this<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.300> what<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.870> pizza<00:02:35.230> will<00:02:35.410> look<00:02:35.560> like

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
so this is what the pizza will look like

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.920 
so this is what the pizza will look like
when<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.160> done<00:02:36.370> now<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.090> forgot<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.780> mention

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
when it's done now I forgot to mention

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.350

month if you are making a large pizza

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.890 
month if you are making a large pizza
and<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:14.230> want<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.710> just<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.130> know<00:03:15.160> use<00:03:15.580> your

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
and you want to just you know use your

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.660 
and you want to just you know use your
thing<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:17.080> dough<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.320> make<00:03:17.620> two<00:03:17.950> large<00:03:18.160> pizzas

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
thing of dough to make two large pizzas

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.080 
thing of dough to make two large pizzas
what<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.600> can<00:03:19.900> do<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.620> make<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.730> exact

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
what you can do is make it the exact

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.199 
what you can do is make it the exact
same<00:03:22.120> way<00:03:22.630> where<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.110> would<00:03:23.290> pre<00:03:24.160> bake<00:03:24.790> the

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
same way where you would pre bake the

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.410 
same way where you would pre bake the
crust<00:03:25.390> for<00:03:25.780> ten<00:03:26.110> minutes<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:28.060> know<00:03:28.150> top

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
crust for ten minutes and you know top

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.270 
crust for ten minutes and you know top
it<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.720> same<00:03:28.930> way<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.140> everything<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.800> I

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
it the same way and everything and I

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.880 
it the same way and everything and I
would<00:03:30.760> wrap<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.330> very<00:03:31.690> tightly<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.560> plastic

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
would wrap it very tightly in plastic

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.420 
would wrap it very tightly in plastic
wrap<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.790> then<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.510> would<00:03:34.780> probably<00:03:35.140> also<00:03:35.890> wrap

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
wrap and then I would probably also wrap

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.370 
wrap and then I would probably also wrap
it<00:03:36.640> in<00:03:36.850> either<00:03:37.060> freezer<00:03:37.510> paper

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
it in either freezer paper
