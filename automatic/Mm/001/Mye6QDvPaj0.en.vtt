00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.600
 eurozone unemployment has recently reached 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.690
 a record rate of 12 percent a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.170
 among young people under 25 in such countries 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.780
 like spain and greece as much as 50 and hope 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.000
 there is almost no way out of the crisis now 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.960
 many Europeans are trying to find work 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.029
 not only at home but not abroad 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.949
 callary gaze graduated from university in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.080
 Italy specialty biology 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.439
 and now forced to trade chocolate 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.540
 Brussels the situation in Italy was 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.550
 monstrous I could only count on 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.950
 short term contracts of three to six 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.320
 months and with absolutely no 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.600
 growth and development most vacancies 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.300
 also epic volunteer basis to build 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.399
 plans for the future simply impossible for 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.300
 According to the Belgian nikolov, he also had to 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.309
 not sweet 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.250
 many companies required good 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.110
 possession of french and flemish and this 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.660
 not every candidate can handle 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.160
 but sometimes it's better to make an effort than 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.220
 go home with nothing I read that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.530
 in 2012, she left 30-40 from Italy 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.960
 percent more youth don't know what 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.869
 we are waiting for 2013 because we are doing 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.909
 every day is getting worse and worse 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.400
 All these problems are not covered with the head 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.560
 Europeans alone many foreigners 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.080
 who came to Europe to open 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.060
 your business and start a new life now 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.430
 seems to have changed their minds Adrian decided to leave 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.040
 from greece back to native ecuador 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.710
 because she missed the star much 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.890
 and found now she does not regret at all 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.630
 about this many migrants moved from 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.240
 Greece to Germany and Switzerland 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.520
 but those who stayed say that the situation 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.070
 disastrous for example to masters 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.759
 who used to receive 1,500 euros now 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.540
 pay only 900 we opened only two 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.460
 years ago 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.340
 but now I believe that prospects 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.640
 we are good 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.509
 arsik there is dirt and the film itself is unlikely 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.490
 would have achieved the same success in europe 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.110
 there is a tendency here 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.819
 look at the numbers some people 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.640
 They say that in Ireland for example 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.709
 emigrated a whole generation and maybe 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.980
 they will not come back ie you are not 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.299
 going back to Italy don't think 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.900
 better i will stay here you sarsel i rt 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.900
