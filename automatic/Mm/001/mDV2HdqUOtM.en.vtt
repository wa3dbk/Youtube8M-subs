00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello I have nautas today we are going to talk about 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.130
 galaxy tab 38.0 and with it we are going to 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.809
 start commenting a bit on the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.860
 tablets that we had enough 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.860
 forgotten we begin 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.250
 we started talking about the aspects 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.500
 externally of the tablet as always and 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.289
 we will find here two sides of a 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.550
 same coin since on the one hand the side 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.289
 front we find a 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.179
 glass surface that is very well 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.580
 achieved and that gives a feeling of 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:37.629
 very good quality if we compare it with 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.980
 the galaxy note 8.0 that is his brother his 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.589
 brother in this range 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.930
 we see a lot more quality and less 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.940
 frames that is very important this but 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.860
 from behind we find the same 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.079
 recurring problem of samsung 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.090
 lately that is the casing of 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.879
 plastic that good at the beginning I do not 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.579
 they bothered too much but really they 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.609
 you notice you notice that the quality is not 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.170
 the best in this aspect could improve 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.360
 in fact they have already achieved it with the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.429
 new naut models that come yes 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.830
 the case is also made of plastic 

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:10.020
 rear 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.200
 it looks like a simile skin that looks very 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.560
 beautiful and of more quality later by the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.190
 sides we found buttons 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.550
 on and volume and also a 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.280
 infrared sensor that we will discuss 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.050
 later as regards these buttons are 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.080
 very nice but the problem there 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.670
 they are very close and they are difficult 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.530
 to find many times if you want 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.810
 to give one we end up giving to another 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.870
 ahead we find the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.880
 classic samsung buttons that is the 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.590
 home button the back and the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.990
 options that is a bit outdated already 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.510
 that android usually comes with the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.910
 multitasking button on this other side 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.720
 we find two ports very 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.310
 important one of them is the micro sd 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.920
 that gives us the possibility to expand the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.380
 memory and it's always important and 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.619
 also sim card what turns to 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.810
 this tablet on a portable phone the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.000
 already there is that other thing but 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.070
 it works as a phone we keep talking 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.900
 of the screen and it's here when what 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.670
 we turn on for the first time 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.939
 that we find a true 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.829
 colorful tsunami its screen makes 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:23.189
 good that the colors look a little 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:26.129
 saturated according to my taste beyond that 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:29.689
 has 8 inches the screen in 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:35.159
 very stretched panoramic format the 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:38.599
 resolution is hd of 280 280 x 800 what 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:41.340
 gives a number of dots per inch of 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.890
 189 one of the things that interests me 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.230
 highlight is that the proportion of the 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.310
 screen as I had already commented that of 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.409
 this is the panoramic format makes 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.359
 that at certain times if by 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.909
 example we compare it with the ipad mini 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.370
 that has a more square format you see 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.470
 much less information when we navigate 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.599
 for example on the internet this is 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.549
 really very important according to my point 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.970
 of sight since the amount of 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.409
 information that you see in one and in another 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.480
 it has a lot of difference in this case 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.489
 I prefer the iPad mini we went to talk 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.470
 of hardware now what is it that has 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.360
 this tablet within the same good 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.870
 has a xxi processor 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:26.310
 double-core 1.5 gigahertz 1.5 gb 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.660
 of ram but here what he calls the 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.270
 Attention is that good is usually 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.140
 1 2 or 3 but never stays in the middle 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.900
 1.5 flame is quite notorious 16 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.960
 gigabytes of storage memory 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.210
 plus a micro sd of 32 gigabytes extra 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.459
 Well, we've already commented on the 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.940
 power of this tablet is enough 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.490
 like to run games of not last 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.470
 generation but if the last of the 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.870
 last you do not have to take into account that 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.610
 the double core makes it not 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.780
 too much power 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:04.230
 1.3 megapixel front camera camera 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.209
 5 megapixel rear here what there 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.610
 What to say is that good tablets 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.330
 they do not generally have the same quality of 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.500
 photography that the mobiles but good 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.570
 we went on to talk about the battery one of 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.299
 the strengths of this phone 4 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.530
 thousand 450 milliamps but what more 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.419
 It draws attention is that if 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.670
 We compare with other samsung tablets 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.130
 the autonomy is much bigger 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.040
 as far as the sound has speakers 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.710
 on the bottom part and we have tested 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.390
 that good do not sound bad but maybe a 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.340
 advice for when we watch movies or what 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.730
 we use so it is convenient to close a 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.440
 little hand to make an effect 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.920
 subwoofer not to give a little more than 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.130
 serious 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.570
 to the sound and that sounds a lot better 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:51.330
 we went on to talk about the software here 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:54.960
 we found with android 4.2 with touchwiz 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.669
 well beyond that what we have to 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.699
 comment here is that it has all 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:03.599
 the functions of s 4 for example chat 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:06.389
 on is voice or what's on watch on that was 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.770
 basically the power to use in this case 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.090
 the tablet as a remote control 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.449
 universal through the infrared sensor 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.460
 there is an application where we can 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.219
 pass the channels and even schedule 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.219
 all channels within the tablet 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:25.800
 to be able to sort what we want to see 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:27.840
 even put together a small guide of 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.659
 television shows that we do not 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.340
 they like more in the end we are in front of a tablet 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.740
 mid-range that could quietly 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.150
 pass as one of high-end so what 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.490
 what we are going to do is a short summary 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.069
 so you have the full picture of 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.590
 the positive and negative aspects 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:45.300
 Negative aspects back shell be 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.539
 that plastic back shell 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.840
 we add the interface very overloaded with 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.879
 colors too exaggerated and with 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.889
 very large elements gives the feeling of 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:57.270
 that is a toy tablet more than 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.640
 old people 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.470
 On the other hand, the proportion of screens 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.650
 which is something that really not only 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.389
 of the tablets 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.060
 of state in particular but of 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.100
 all android tablets not that the 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.380
 panoramic format does not help much to the 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.220
 Internet browsing as commented 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:18.620
 previously positive aspects better 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.630
 quality feeling the front of 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.150
 glass makes it the opposite of the 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.060
 back gives feeling that 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.580
 this is a product that exceeds 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.400
 the expectations in this case a 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.440
 complete hardware also helps that 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.289
 be a positive aspect that is why 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.169
 example have phone have micro sd 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.910
 the infrared sensor and everything one 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.789
 I could come to love in general 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:46.400
 is in this tablet another aspect 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:48.650
 also more positive is the battery the 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.720
 autonomy is really very good and more 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.720
 compared to previous tablets of 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.970
 samsung so I just hope that this 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.190
 information has served you if we do not 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.050
 knew was to subscribe to our channel and 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.949
 If you liked I like to give us 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.949
 we see in the next video
