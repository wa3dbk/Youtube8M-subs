00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.609
 self 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.349
 lol 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.540
 after eviction no 3d printer 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.070
 no one in the tent showed himself apart from the solidarity of his friends 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.950
 I'm 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.950
 I made the decision to go inside 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.950
 I've been in a couple of weeks 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.260
 after a week I entered the mayor and gian carlo piras 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.360
 they spoke that they seemed more helpful 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.770
 because we found a solution anyway as I don't trust - already 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.050
 screwed twice 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.410
 now 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.910
 let's wait 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.310
 they promised that they would fix the house in Rome 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.310
 here I am very well greased 5t 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.750
 visits to friends are constant 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.050
 the solidarity is fantastic I can complain 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.110
 and so I look forward to the indecision praise of the film still not there 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.050
 nothing however 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.540
 and then another thing is massacring us in the other inhabitants with 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.790
 these jobs that don't even stop lunch 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.890
 and the police even though they were called several times there was also 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.550
 a complaint 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.670
 they don't respect the hours they are 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.440
 normal of civil cohabitation 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.590
 Indian teletumail 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.500
 they must stop because we too must eat without breathing oil 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.910
 I walk in and out 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.860
 and if you also have to do so in the evictions
