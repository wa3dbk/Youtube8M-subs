ultimate attack tank the t-72 was

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.170 
ultimate attack tank the t-72 was
definitely<00:00:44.250> something<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.760> worried<00:00:45.090> about

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
definitely something to be worried about

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.290 
definitely something to be worried about
it<00:00:45.719> had<00:00:45.930> thick<00:00:46.320> armor<00:00:46.710> good<00:00:47.039> mobility<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.760> big

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it had thick armor good mobility a big

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.139 
it had thick armor good mobility a big
gun<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:49.440> very<00:00:49.620> low<00:00:49.800> profile<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.820> about<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
gun and a very low profile it's about a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.569 
gun and a very low profile it's about a
foot<00:00:51.480> lower<00:00:51.750> than<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.320> British<00:00:52.770> tank<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.309> about

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
foot lower than a British tank and about

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.580 
foot lower than a British tank and about
18<00:00:54.000> inches<00:00:54.120> lower<00:00:54.570> than<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.960> contemporary

18 inches lower than the contemporary

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.310 
18 inches lower than the contemporary
American<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.270> difficult<00:00:57.510> target<00:00:58.020> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
American so it's a difficult target to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.619 
American so it's a difficult target to
hit<00:00:58.350> especially<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.760> it's<00:00:59.910> coming<00:01:00.210> at<00:01:00.420> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

fast in great numbers fully tracks up
with<00:01:03.750> infantry<00:01:04.170> behind<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.710> oh<00:01:04.860> well<00:01:05.369> that

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
it's fun to drive the biggest surprise

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.550 
it's fun to drive the biggest surprise
that<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> t-72<00:01:21.380> actually<00:01:22.380> was

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
that we have with the t-72 actually was

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.240 
that we have with the t-72 actually was
its<00:01:22.740> gun<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.430> was<00:01:23.689> 125<00:01:24.689> millimeter<00:01:25.259> caliber

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
its gun which was 125 millimeter caliber

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.870 
its gun which was 125 millimeter caliber
gun<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:28.680> would<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.220> caused<00:01:29.460> his<00:01:29.670> big

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
gun and that would have caused his big

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.350 
gun and that would have caused his big
problems<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.770> Soviet<00:01:32.280> barrel<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:33.090> five

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
problems the Soviet barrel was five

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.660 
problems the Soviet barrel was five
millimeters<00:01:34.020> wider<00:01:34.320> than<00:01:34.799> Western<00:01:35.280> barrels

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
millimeters wider than Western barrels

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.999 
millimeters wider than Western barrels
and<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.329> meant<00:01:36.570> bigger<00:01:36.930> shells<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.650> more

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and that meant bigger shells and more

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.760 
and that meant bigger shells and more
armor<00:01:38.579> penetration<00:01:38.810> but<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> revolutionary

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
armor penetration but the revolutionary

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
armor penetration but the revolutionary
bit<00:01:40.950> was<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> gun<00:01:41.850> was<00:01:41.880> fed<00:01:42.390> shells<00:01:42.720> by

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
bit was that the gun was fed shells by

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.920 
bit was that the gun was fed shells by
an<00:01:43.290> automatic<00:01:43.829> loading<00:01:44.610> system<00:01:45.060> big<00:01:45.720> green
