00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
for years is something that'll really

that that doesn't really do any better a
job<00:00:34.890> than<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.570> simple<00:00:36.930> tool<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.200> you

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
job than a really simple tool that you

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.490 
job than a really simple tool that you
can<00:00:37.620> make<00:00:37.860> using<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.000> smudge<00:00:39.329> tool<00:00:39.360> which<00:00:40.320> is

of Photoshop the smudge tool the way
that<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.629> comes<00:00:45.840> out<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.289> factory<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.800> its

that it comes out of the factory in its

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.330 
that it comes out of the factory in its
default<00:00:47.430> setting<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.829> generally<00:00:49.829> agreed<00:00:50.219> upon

default setting is generally agreed upon
to<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.879> useless<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:53.309> discovered<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
to be useless but I have discovered that

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.660 
to be useless but I have discovered that
it's<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.980> difficult<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.399> turn

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it's really not that difficult to turn

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.910 
it's really not that difficult to turn
it<00:00:56.879> into<00:00:57.030> something<00:00:57.449> pretty<00:00:57.600> useful<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it into something pretty useful and I

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.410 
it into something pretty useful and I
can't<00:00:59.160> really<00:00:59.309> take<00:00:59.579> credit<00:00:59.730> for<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
can't really take credit for that I

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.799 
can't really take credit for that I
learned<00:01:00.690> about<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.989> through<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.190> wonderful

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
learned about that through the wonderful

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.700 
learned about that through the wonderful
natural<00:01:03.809> media<00:01:04.320> plug-in<00:01:05.030> that<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:07.530> show

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
use this much tool you use a very very

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.010 
use this much tool you use a very very
simple<00:01:43.829> round<00:01:44.340> airbrush<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.720> soft

it's<00:01:49.320> zero<00:01:49.950> percent<00:01:50.430> hardness<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.899> but

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
it's zero percent hardness the but

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.410 
it's zero percent hardness the but
here's<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.619> key<00:01:52.829> part<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.759> want<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.060> turn<00:01:54.240> on

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
here's the key part you want to turn on

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.350 
here's the key part you want to turn on
scattering<00:01:54.950> because<00:01:55.950> what<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.610> will<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:57.000> is

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
scattering because what that will do is

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.620 
scattering because what that will do is
avoid<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.320> kind<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.710> smearing<00:01:59.189> look<00:01:59.640> that<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
avoid the kind of smearing look that the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.050 
avoid the kind of smearing look that the
smudge<00:02:00.899> tool<00:02:00.930> usually<00:02:01.680> brings<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.909> have

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
smudge tool usually brings if you have

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.789 
smudge tool usually brings if you have
scattering<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.259> looks<00:02:04.469> sort<00:02:04.680> of

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
scattering on and it looks sort of

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.910 
scattering on and it looks sort of
pebble<00:02:05.219> II<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.850> then<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.170> will<00:02:07.560> show<00:02:07.829> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
pebble II like this then I will show you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.469 
pebble II like this then I will show you
what<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.220> looks<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.520> normally<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.360> that

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
what this looks like normally so that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.490 
what this looks like normally so that
you'll<00:02:09.569> get<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.720> sense<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.080> what<00:02:10.229> it's<00:02:10.379> really

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you'll get a sense of what it's really

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.910 
you'll get a sense of what it's really
doing<00:02:12.200> because

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
doing because

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.620 
doing because
this<00:02:14.310> blender<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.090> going<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.390> be<00:02:15.480> very

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
this blender is going to be very

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.750 
this blender is going to be very
important<00:02:16.140> for<00:02:16.340> doing<00:02:17.340> some<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
important for doing some of the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.530 
important for doing some of the
wet-in-wet<00:02:18.830> looks<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.220> we<00:02:20.340> want<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.670> see<00:02:20.880> in

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
wet-in-wet looks that we want to see in

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.309 
wet-in-wet looks that we want to see in
watercolor<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:23.220> I'm<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.489> going<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.700> take<00:02:23.940> a

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
watercolor so I'm just going to take a

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.780 
watercolor so I'm just going to take a
couple<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.470> colors<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:26.190> I'm<00:02:26.430> going<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.640> put

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
couple of colors and I'm going to put

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.510 
couple of colors and I'm going to put
them<00:02:26.910> side-by-side<00:02:27.709> so<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.010> can<00:02:29.220> see

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
them side-by-side so that you can see

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.930 
them side-by-side so that you can see
the<00:02:30.480> efficacy<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.709> blender<00:02:32.190> I'm<00:02:32.790> gonna

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
the efficacy of this blender I'm gonna

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.830 
the efficacy of this blender I'm gonna
zoom<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.860> little<00:02:34.860> bit<00:02:35.100> more<00:02:35.720> we<00:02:36.720> have<00:02:36.810> our

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
zoom in a little bit more we have our

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.920 
zoom in a little bit more we have our
blender<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:40.739> can<00:02:40.920> see<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:42.180> works<00:02:42.600> very

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
blender and you can see it works very

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.009 
blender and you can see it works very
quickly<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:45.360> blends<00:02:46.730> for<00:02:47.730> most<00:02:48.510> purposes

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
quickly it it blends for most purposes

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.360 
quickly it it blends for most purposes
very<00:02:49.860> well<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:51.660> not<00:02:51.900> ideal<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:53.100> isn't

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
very well it's not ideal it isn't

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.729 
very well it's not ideal it isn't
perfectly<00:02:53.730> smooth<00:02:54.180> but<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.049> works<00:02:55.260> very<00:02:55.620> very

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
perfectly smooth but it works very very

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:56.180 
perfectly smooth but it works very very
well

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
well

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.400 
well
pretty<00:02:57.000> much<00:02:57.180> well<00:02:57.810> enough<00:02:58.049> for<00:02:58.200> anything

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
pretty much well enough for anything

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.590 
pretty much well enough for anything
that<00:02:58.620> we<00:02:58.709> want<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:58.950> do<00:02:59.100> here<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.549> frankly<00:03:00.480> the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
that we want to do here and frankly the

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.900 
that we want to do here and frankly the
roughness<00:03:01.049> that<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:02.160> lends<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
roughness that that it lends to the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.390 
roughness that that it lends to the
blending<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.600> going<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.049> be<00:03:04.140> an<00:03:04.230> asset<00:03:04.410> when<00:03:05.280> we

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
blending is going to be an asset when we

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.640 
blending is going to be an asset when we
get<00:03:05.549> into<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.970> kind<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:06.690> course<00:03:07.170> look<00:03:07.500> of

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
get into the kind of course look of

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.509 
get into the kind of course look of
watercolor<00:03:08.299> so<00:03:09.500> create<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> blender<00:03:10.920> create<00:03:11.489> a

an<00:03:14.730> ks3<00:03:15.390> Club<00:03:15.600> blend<00:03:15.870> fast<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.700> you're<00:03:17.700> going

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
an ks3 Club blend fast and you're going

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.610 
an ks3 Club blend fast and you're going
to<00:03:17.910> be<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.299> business<00:03:21.109> all<00:03:22.109> right<00:03:22.170> now<00:03:22.380> let's

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
to be in business all right now let's

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.750 
to be in business all right now let's
start<00:03:22.920> with<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:24.000> technique<00:03:24.450> proper<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:26.609> can

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
start with the technique proper you can

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.060 
start with the technique proper you can
open<00:03:27.000> up<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.269> new<00:03:27.540> Photoshop<00:03:27.989> document<00:03:28.530> it

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
open up a new Photoshop document it

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.599 
open up a new Photoshop document it
doesn't<00:03:29.370> matter<00:03:29.519> what<00:03:29.730> size<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:31.459> what<00:03:32.459> you're

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
doesn't matter what size and what you're

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.360 
doesn't matter what size and what you're
going<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:32.880> do<00:03:33.090> is<00:03:33.859> make<00:03:34.859> sure<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.220> have<00:03:35.340> a

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
going to do is make sure that you have a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.490 
going to do is make sure that you have a
white<00:03:35.609> background<00:03:35.930> because<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:37.380> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
white background because if the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.229 
white background because if the
background<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.220> transparent<00:03:38.489> than<00:03:39.090> the

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
background is transparent than the

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.270 
background is transparent than the
watercolors<00:03:39.870> won't<00:03:40.140> have<00:03:40.590> anything<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:41.010> be<00:03:41.190> up

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
watercolors won't have anything to be up

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.330 
watercolors won't have anything to be up
against<00:03:42.230> then<00:03:43.230> create<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.100> new<00:03:44.310> group<00:03:46.250> it'll<00:03:47.250> be

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
against then create a new group it'll be

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.030 
against then create a new group it'll be
color<00:03:47.519> group<00:03:47.790> one<00:03:48.380> then<00:03:49.380> what<00:03:49.739> you're<00:03:49.859> going

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
color group one then what you're going

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.030 
color group one then what you're going
to<00:03:50.070> do<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:51.000> create<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.480> mask<00:03:51.810> for<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.739> entire

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
to do is create a mask for the entire

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.330 
to do is create a mask for the entire
group<00:03:54.230> you're<00:03:55.230> going<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.470> create<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.709> mask<00:03:55.980> and

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
group you're going to create a mask and

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.770 
group you're going to create a mask and
it's<00:03:56.489> not<00:03:56.670> going<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:56.940> be<00:03:57.030> just<00:03:57.239> for<00:03:57.390> one<00:03:57.569> layer

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
it's not going to be just for one layer

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.270 
it's not going to be just for one layer
but<00:03:57.989> it's<00:03:58.170> going<00:03:58.319> to<00:03:58.410> be<00:03:58.530> just<00:03:58.799> for<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.040> group

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
but it's going to be just for the group

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.949 
but it's going to be just for the group
right<00:03:59.880> now<00:04:00.030> this<00:04:00.299> group<00:04:00.569> doesn't<00:04:00.810> have

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
right now this group doesn't have

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.979 
right now this group doesn't have
anything<00:04:01.319> in<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.709> it's<00:04:01.890> an<00:04:02.010> empty<00:04:02.250> group<00:04:02.519> I

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
anything in it it's an empty group I

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.620 
anything in it it's an empty group I
have<00:04:03.989> selected<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.530> mask<00:04:04.769> itself<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:06.209> now

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
have selected the mask itself and now

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.530 
have selected the mask itself and now
what<00:04:06.780> I'm<00:04:06.870> going<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.140> do<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.530> fill<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.220> mask

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
what I'm going to do is fill the mask

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.140 
what I'm going to do is fill the mask
with<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.750> watercolor<00:04:10.440> paper<00:04:11.370> texture<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.090> I

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
with a watercolor paper texture that I

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.599 
with a watercolor paper texture that I
really<00:04:12.450> like<00:04:12.660> this<00:04:13.530> comes<00:04:13.920> right<00:04:14.069> out<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.489> the

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
really like this comes right out of the

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.440 
really like this comes right out of the
default<00:04:15.120> paper<00:04:16.019> presets<00:04:17.010> there<00:04:17.340> it's<00:04:18.120> just<00:04:18.329> a

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
default paper presets there it's just a

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.420 
default paper presets there it's just a
default<00:04:18.870> Photoshop<00:04:19.200> pattern<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:20.310> it's

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
default Photoshop pattern and it's

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.029 
default Photoshop pattern and it's
called<00:04:20.609> gouache<00:04:21.000> light<00:04:21.419> on<00:04:21.660> watercolor<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.890> me

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
called gouache light on watercolor to me

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.550 
called gouache light on watercolor to me
this<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.580> just<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.940> best<00:04:24.120> thing<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.750> I'm

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
this is just the best thing and I'm

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.800 
this is just the best thing and I'm
going<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.740> hit<00:04:25.830> OK

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
going to hit OK

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.179 
going to hit OK
now<00:04:27.810> Photoshop<00:04:28.379> patterns<00:04:28.860> are<00:04:29.840> grayscale<00:04:30.840> and

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:31.189 
now Photoshop patterns are grayscale and

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:38.659 
now Photoshop patterns are grayscale and
in<00:04:33.110> masking<00:04:34.159> white<00:04:35.449> means<00:04:36.449> that<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:37.669> layer

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
in masking white means that the layer

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.850 
in masking white means that the layer
shows<00:04:39.060> through<00:04:39.449> and<00:04:39.689> black<00:04:40.110> means<00:04:40.409> that<00:04:40.770> the

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
shows through and black means that the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.800 
shows through and black means that the
layer<00:04:41.039> is<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.759> black<00:04:41.969> parts<00:04:42.360> are<00:04:42.509> the<00:04:42.569> parts

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
layer is the black parts are the parts

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.089 
layer is the black parts are the parts
that<00:04:42.870> are<00:04:43.050> obscured<00:04:43.590> so<00:04:44.310> if<00:04:44.580> we<00:04:44.729> look<00:04:44.969> at

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
that are obscured so if we look at

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.760 
that are obscured so if we look at
channels<00:04:47.750> this<00:04:48.750> is<00:04:48.900> just<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.199> show<00:04:49.229> you<00:04:49.409> what's

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
channels this is just to show you what's

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.439 
channels this is just to show you what's
going<00:04:49.860> on<00:04:50.189> underneath<00:04:50.520> when<00:04:50.849> you<00:04:50.939> have<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.090> mask

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
going on underneath when you have a mask

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.119 
going on underneath when you have a mask
on<00:04:51.719> you<00:04:52.289> can't<00:04:52.560> see<00:04:52.979> what's<00:04:53.849> happening<00:04:54.919> so<00:04:55.919> if

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
on you can't see what's happening so if

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.580 
on you can't see what's happening so if
you<00:04:56.250> look<00:04:56.460> when<00:04:56.879> I<00:04:56.969> turn<00:04:57.180> this<00:04:57.360> on<00:04:57.539> and<00:04:57.719> off<00:04:57.810> you

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
you look when I turn this on and off you

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.850 
you look when I turn this on and off you
can<00:04:58.830> see<00:04:59.069> a<00:04:59.310> very<00:05:00.029> subtle<00:05:00.449> kind<00:05:01.289> of<00:05:01.379> pebbly

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
can see a very subtle kind of pebbly

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.019 
can see a very subtle kind of pebbly
texture<00:05:03.110> coming<00:05:04.110> through<00:05:04.610> if<00:05:05.610> I<00:05:05.759> were<00:05:05.939> to

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:06.029 
texture coming through if I were to

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.670 
texture coming through if I were to
create<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.330> layer<00:05:06.599> and<00:05:06.810> fill<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.199> with<00:05:07.229> this

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
create a layer and fill it with this

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.399 
create a layer and fill it with this
texture<00:05:08.520> all<00:05:08.849> by<00:05:09.090> itself<00:05:09.449> it'll<00:05:10.110> give<00:05:10.289> you<00:05:10.379> a

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
texture all by itself it'll give you a

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.610 
texture all by itself it'll give you a
better<00:05:10.469> idea<00:05:10.740> of<00:05:10.919> what<00:05:11.009> it<00:05:11.159> looks<00:05:11.370> like<00:05:12.620> this

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
better idea of what it looks like this

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.450 
better idea of what it looks like this
is<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.949> texture<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:14.550> exists<00:05:15.300> on<00:05:15.449> that<00:05:15.629> mask

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
is the texture that exists on that mask

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.439 
is the texture that exists on that mask
you<00:05:17.460> can<00:05:17.610> see<00:05:17.789> it<00:05:17.879> looks<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.150> lot<00:05:18.300> like

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
you can see it looks a lot like

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.659 
you can see it looks a lot like
watercolor<00:05:18.960> paper<00:05:19.259> it<00:05:20.039> has<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:20.279> kind<00:05:20.669> of<00:05:21.379> fiber

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
watercolor paper it has a kind of fiber

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:32.059 
watercolor paper it has a kind of fiber
texture<00:05:23.669> it<00:05:24.659> isn't<00:05:24.990> too<00:05:25.110> gnarly<00:05:28.909> but<00:05:29.909> I<00:05:31.069> think

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
texture it isn't too gnarly but I think

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:33.920 
texture it isn't too gnarly but I think
that<00:05:32.279> this<00:05:32.759> is<00:05:32.940> almost<00:05:33.120> a<00:05:33.479> little<00:05:33.509> bit<00:05:33.810> too

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
that this is almost a little bit too

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.850 
that this is almost a little bit too
dark<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:35.210> because<00:05:36.210> dark<00:05:36.569> in<00:05:36.900> masking<00:05:37.589> is

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
dark and because dark in masking is

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.029 
dark and because dark in masking is
going<00:05:38.159> to<00:05:38.250> obscure<00:05:38.759> things<00:05:39.300> I'd<00:05:39.629> like<00:05:39.870> to<00:05:40.169> use

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
going to obscure things I'd like to use

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.540 
going to obscure things I'd like to use
levels<00:05:41.759> to<00:05:42.479> lighten<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.960> up<00:05:43.110> I<00:05:43.319> want<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.740> I<00:05:43.949> want

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
levels to lighten it up I want to I want

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.170 
levels to lighten it up I want to I want
to<00:05:44.699> bring<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.770> brightness<00:05:46.770> of<00:05:46.979> this<00:05:47.310> mask<00:05:47.639> up

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
to bring the brightness of this mask up

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.499 
to bring the brightness of this mask up
because<00:05:49.169> that<00:05:49.379> will<00:05:49.589> help<00:05:49.800> what<00:05:50.639> is<00:05:50.909> within

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
because that will help what is within

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.329 
because that will help what is within
the<00:05:51.750> contents<00:05:52.349> to<00:05:52.409> show<00:05:52.740> through<00:05:53.039> a<00:05:53.069> little

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:53.339 
the contents to show through a little

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.659 
the contents to show through a little
bit<00:05:53.460> better<00:05:53.610> so<00:05:54.330> I'm<00:05:54.719> going<00:05:55.020> to<00:05:55.229> select<00:05:56.069> the

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
bit better so I'm going to select the

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.399 
bit better so I'm going to select the
mask<00:05:56.909> I<00:05:57.300> can<00:05:57.539> get<00:05:57.900> rid<00:05:58.020> of<00:05:58.080> this<00:05:58.169> layer<00:05:58.379> now

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
mask I can get rid of this layer now

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:59.839 
mask I can get rid of this layer now
because<00:05:58.860> it<00:05:58.979> was<00:05:59.069> just<00:05:59.279> to<00:05:59.370> show<00:05:59.520> you<00:05:59.580> what<00:05:59.759> it

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
because it was just to show you what it

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.450 
because it was just to show you what it
looks<00:06:00.000> like<00:06:00.529> select<00:06:01.529> the<00:06:01.650> layer<00:06:01.830> mask<00:06:01.860> here

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
looks like select the layer mask here

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.550 
looks like select the layer mask here
and<00:06:03.469> open<00:06:04.469> levels<00:06:05.000> you<00:06:06.000> can<00:06:06.120> hit<00:06:06.210> control<00:06:06.449> L<00:06:06.900> if

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
and open levels you can hit control L if

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.860 
and open levels you can hit control L if
you<00:06:07.710> like<00:06:07.889> keyboard<00:06:08.219> shortcuts<00:06:08.810> bringing<00:06:09.810> the

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
you like keyboard shortcuts bringing the

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.240 
you like keyboard shortcuts bringing the
white<00:06:10.129> down<00:06:11.509> so<00:06:12.509> that<00:06:12.719> it<00:06:13.680> doesn't<00:06:13.979> take<00:06:14.069> as

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
white down so that it doesn't take as

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.390 
white down so that it doesn't take as
much<00:06:14.870> for<00:06:15.870> what's<00:06:16.469> underneath<00:06:16.830> to<00:06:17.189> come

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
much for what's underneath to come

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.079 
much for what's underneath to come
through<00:06:17.550> as<00:06:17.669> white<00:06:17.879> and<00:06:19.310> if<00:06:20.310> you<00:06:20.550> look<00:06:20.759> very

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:21.089 
through as white and if you look very

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.899 
through as white and if you look very
very<00:06:21.330> carefully<00:06:21.689> you<00:06:22.080> can<00:06:22.199> see<00:06:22.259> that<00:06:22.909> the

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
very carefully you can see that the

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:27.290 
very carefully you can see that the
layer<00:06:24.180> mask<00:06:24.449> is<00:06:24.779> getting<00:06:24.930> brighter<00:06:26.060> than<00:06:27.060> when

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
layer mask is getting brighter than when

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.070 
layer mask is getting brighter than when
I<00:06:27.330> started<00:06:27.479> so<00:06:28.080> if<00:06:28.199> you<00:06:28.289> look<00:06:28.439> at<00:06:28.529> it<00:06:28.650> now<00:06:28.680> and

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
I started so if you look at it now and

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.890 
I started so if you look at it now and
now<00:06:31.080> when<00:06:31.349> I<00:06:31.379> bring<00:06:31.680> the<00:06:32.580> right-most<00:06:33.029> white

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
now when I bring the right-most white

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.620 
now when I bring the right-most white
arrow<00:06:34.379> closer<00:06:35.279> to<00:06:35.490> the<00:06:35.580> middle<00:06:35.729> watch

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
arrow closer to the middle watch

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.309 
arrow closer to the middle watch
carefully

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 
carefully

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.399 
carefully
when<00:06:37.500> I<00:06:37.529> let<00:06:37.740> go<00:06:37.770> it<00:06:38.389> becomes<00:06:39.389> whiter

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
when I let go it becomes whiter

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:44.269 
when I let go it becomes whiter
it<00:06:41.309> really<00:06:41.929> does<00:06:42.929> not<00:06:43.139> take<00:06:43.529> too<00:06:43.769> much

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:44.279 
it really does not take too much

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.579 
it really does not take too much
careful<00:06:44.999> flexing<00:06:45.479> just<00:06:46.050> bring<00:06:46.289> the<00:06:46.409> white<00:06:46.559> a

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:46.589 
careful flexing just bring the white a

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:48.079 
careful flexing just bring the white a
little<00:06:46.889> bit<00:06:47.099> closer<00:06:47.309> to<00:06:47.489> the<00:06:47.580> middle<00:06:47.759> and<00:06:48.029> you

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:48.089 
little bit closer to the middle and you

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:53.119 
little bit closer to the middle and you
should<00:06:48.269> be<00:06:48.389> fine<00:06:48.709> good<00:06:49.709> okay<00:06:50.009> and<00:06:50.539> now<00:06:52.129> create

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:53.129 
should be fine good okay and now create

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:55.040 
should be fine good okay and now create
a<00:06:53.189> layer<00:06:53.399> that's<00:06:54.149> going<00:06:54.360> to<00:06:54.419> be<00:06:54.509> inside<00:06:54.839> this

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
a layer that's going to be inside this

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.359 
a layer that's going to be inside this
group<00:06:55.289> you<00:06:56.159> can<00:06:56.339> call<00:06:56.519> this<00:06:56.669> watercolor<00:06:58.369> call

00:06:59.359 --> 00:06:59.369 
group you can call this watercolor call

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:04.639 
group you can call this watercolor call
it<00:06:59.459> watercolor<00:06:59.849> one<00:07:01.039> hit<00:07:02.039> okay<00:07:02.309> and<00:07:02.550> now<00:07:03.649> you

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:04.649 
it watercolor one hit okay and now you

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:07.159 
it watercolor one hit okay and now you
want<00:07:05.039> to<00:07:05.099> set<00:07:05.369> the<00:07:06.029> blending<00:07:06.539> mode<00:07:06.599> for<00:07:07.050> your

want to set the blending mode for your
new<00:07:07.319> layer<00:07:07.529> to<00:07:07.800> multiply<00:07:07.919> because<00:07:08.610> this<00:07:08.999> is

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:09.149 
new layer to multiply because this is

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:11.449 
new layer to multiply because this is
going<00:07:09.360> to<00:07:09.419> be<00:07:09.539> a<00:07:09.569> transparent<00:07:10.229> layer<00:07:10.349> and<00:07:10.649> you

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:11.459 
going to be a transparent layer and you

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:13.309 
going to be a transparent layer and you
don't<00:07:11.699> want<00:07:11.909> anything<00:07:12.569> that<00:07:12.749> is<00:07:12.899> on<00:07:13.050> this
