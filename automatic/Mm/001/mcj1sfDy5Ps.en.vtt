00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.130
 welcome from our traditional 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.429
 Mexican cuisine presented today 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.909
 saucers with pumpkin flower we have 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.890
 indian barefoot Indian women dressed indian 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:18.820
 barefoot with tomato sauce 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:22.480
 we remove the chalice from the flower and it is 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.310
 important to open it to see if it does not have 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.800
 insects 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.779
 remove the fibrous part of the stem 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.779
 starting at the base of it 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.650
 with the help of scissors we are going to 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.170
 match the stems 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.840
 Once our flowers lists the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.960
 We take a thin stream of water to 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.350
 rinse the we place them on a 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.390
 rag it is important to effect this 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.180
 operation as quickly to avoid that 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.930
 the flower withers we are going to dry them 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.860
 We cut pieces of Manchego cheese 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:06.390
 Approximate size of the flower chop 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.940
 finely the epazote we cover a piece 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.300
 of cheese with the epazote and we're going to 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.460
 introduce to the center of the flower 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.880
 we will cover this with the petals of the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.880
 same 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.840
 separately let's grate cheese 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.290
 manchego and we will mix it with epazote 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.890
 finely chopped we make a kind of 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.470
 molote and let's fill in with this the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.530
 flower 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.230
 remember that it is important to cover the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.230
 cheese with flower petals 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:51.010
 for our dressed Indians we chop 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.720
 surimi we mix it with chile serrano 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.380
 chopped 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.920
 cream cheese 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.610
 to form a paste 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.670
 with which we will form mountains that 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.060
 will serve us to fill the center of 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.060
 the flower 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:24.120
 ready the flowers we beat whole egg 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.120
 pepper and salt 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.190
 with a fork or balloon whisk 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.930
 we beat vigorously to mix the 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:40.000
 ingredients we pass the stuffed flower by 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.610
 the egg and ground bread is important 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.850
 squeeze the flower so that the bread 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.420
 adhere 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.500
 you have to repeat this operation twice 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.500
 with each flower 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.040
 for the conca we removed the part of the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.260
 Tomato birth we make a cut 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.359
 in the form of a cross at the base and we put it 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.640
 in boiling water for two or three 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:10.420
 minutes so that it starts to come off 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:14.739
 the skin this is called poach we remove 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:19.209
 the skin of the tomato we split it in 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.890
 rooms and we are going to remove the part of the 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.620
 seed 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.620
 the pulp we are going to finely chop 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.380
 in a pan we put a little bit of 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.130
 Butter 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.910
 the onion and we let a 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.000
 moment we incorporate the garlic and so 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:47.660
 we try one more moment 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.319
 we incorporate the chopped tomato salt and 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.650
 seasoning the rest of the tomato we had it 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.830
 for a colander and the juice that we get 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.100
 we are going to incorporate it to what we are 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.430
 green peas 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:07.420
 you have to mix from time to time fry 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.990
 pumpkin flowers we put them in 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.190
 a dish 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:16.100
 in a skillet without fat we are going to roast 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:20.120
 our flowers stuffed with cheese and 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.670
 epazote on both sides and we put them 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.890
 likewise on the plate 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.940
 we repeat the same operation with the 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.940
 rest of the flowers 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.950
 on a plate we serve the coffee with 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:40.560
 tomato and we are arranging the flowers 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:44.300
 roasted decorating with a jalapeÃ±o pepper 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.669
 as you will see it is a very easy way 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.699
 taking advantage of that I have pumpkin flower 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.759
 let's cook the for quesadillas or 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:56.479
 tacos we put the oil in a pan 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:05:00.900
 hot onion and so we thundered about 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:04.169
 moments we incorporate the garlic 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.930
 and so we thundered a moment more trying 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.389
 that is not going to burn we add the 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.830
 chopped serrano chile and the flower of 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.390
 pumpkin 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:19.060
 we move 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:21.129
 and the flower will release its liquid 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.659
 we season 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:27.729
 and we mix lightly we incorporate the 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:31.990
 epazote 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:35.219
 we let use a minute we cover and 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.469
 we remove from the fire for the cuitlacoche 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:41.750
 we put in a pan oil so thunders 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:44.470
 garlic onion 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.270
 thus thundering a few more seconds 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.650
 we incorporated the cuitlacoche which 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:56.100
 we have chosen and rinsed 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:06:00.240
 we add the seasoned chile and move 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:03.300
 covered we let it cook for 34 minutes 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.090
 we incorporate the epazote we mix 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.300
 we put out the fire and cover our 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.199
 huitlacoche is ready 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.199
 until next time
