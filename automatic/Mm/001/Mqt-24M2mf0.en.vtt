00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 Is 

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:09.500
 It is such a great king or wall 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:12.790
 I'm taking a leg like this This is not to move to strong opponents 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:17.260
 Care about the taste that say do not move Odaiba 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:20.690
 Well, on the other hand, I pulled my foot a bit back 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.110
 With the floor on the floor 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.090
 I will know the knee slowly before 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.110
 And the heel matter how much 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:37.870
 Good to say before 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:41.020
 Then you stretch the deep muscles of the good needle so-called inner muscle 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.140
 Though I stretch a muscle called flatfish muscle 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.480
 It means that you bend your knees 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.079
 like this 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.100
 Take a breath 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.820
 Yes day 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.000
 Press once, Lou 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.200
 It is not good 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.540
 Hey class Sutoru 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.530
 There is a pond 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:08.220
 Next time I changed my feet in the same way 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.720
 Then make sure that the toe has been fixed in this state it is the state that is facing up 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.340
 Slowly 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:18.810
 I will give priority to the knee and will know before 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.260
 This will stretch the calf muscle 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.440
 Take a breath 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.300
 Don't do it 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.640
 One more teapot 2 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.840
 Dont do it 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.030
 Another table swimmer 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.409
 Dont do this 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.400
 2nd class 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.080
 Please write your breath 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.700
 I think that I was single 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.940
 Like this 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:49.330
 Foot 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.250
 Knees slightly forward with the body on and the heel on the floor 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.110
 Store 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.460
 I think that You're Then calf muscles say 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:06.110
 This type as a guide 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:09.830
 Might be good if I am here from here I this is is is get to be on the floor and vertical 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.569
 It's good to be vertical 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:18.200
 I think it will just grow up 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:20.610
 Kedomo I know Well Oh day stretch feeling is the coffin after 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.110

 Do you want to back 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:35.319
 Though I'm doing do in some very basic Well behind it has little changed at or slightly before 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:41.069
 Change the position of this leg 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:44.909
 I'm looking for a pleasant place myself, I think it is another way 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:49.939
 Natural luxury for 20 seconds 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.939
