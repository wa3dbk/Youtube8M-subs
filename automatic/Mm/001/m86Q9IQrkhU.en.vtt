clines<00:00:19.140> builders<00:00:19.680> build<00:00:20.520> up<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.109> put<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.199> there

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
clines builders build up I put it there

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.929 
clines builders build up I put it there
I<00:00:22.910> think<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.029> called<00:00:24.269> terminal<00:00:25.170> seven

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
I think it's called terminal seven

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.220 
I think it's called terminal seven
diamond<00:00:26.939> trophy<00:00:27.330> pace<00:00:29.330> so<00:00:30.330> if<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.990> want<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
diamond trophy pace so if you want to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.860 
diamond trophy pace so if you want to
use<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.949> phase<00:00:32.219> obviously<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.210> because

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
use this phase obviously you can because

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.180 
use this phase obviously you can because
everybody<00:00:34.200> wouldn't<00:00:34.410> make<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> video<00:00:34.710> about<00:00:34.890> it

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
everybody wouldn't make a video about it

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.030 
everybody wouldn't make a video about it
and<00:00:35.540> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.690> either<00:00:36.780> take<00:00:37.230> screenshot<00:00:37.800> over

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and you can either take screenshot over

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.700 
and you can either take screenshot over
here<00:00:38.370> or<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.120> go<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.710> builder

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
here or you can go on the builder

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.549 
here or you can go on the builder
because<00:00:41.090> Joshi<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> new<00:00:42.809> town<00:00:43.020> or<00:00:43.170> seven<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
because Joshi is a new town or seven so

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.200 
because Joshi is a new town or seven so
he<00:00:43.649> doesn't<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.040> king<00:00:44.399> which<00:00:44.640> would<00:00:44.850> go

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
he doesn't have the king which would go

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.139 
he doesn't have the king which would go
there<00:00:45.920> does<00:00:46.920> another<00:00:47.190> dart<00:00:47.520> bar<00:00:47.670> suppose

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
there does another dart bar suppose

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.610 
there does another dart bar suppose
somewhere<00:00:48.450> around<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.690> doesn't<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.440> one

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
somewhere around here doesn't have one

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.869 
somewhere around here doesn't have one
of<00:00:49.710> these<00:00:49.770> Tesla's<00:00:50.219> which<00:00:50.399> go<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.820> there<00:00:52.879> but

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
of these Tesla's which go in there but

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.720 
of these Tesla's which go in there but
anyway<00:00:54.199> these<00:00:55.199> face<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.190> clan<00:00:56.550> castle

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
anyway these face here as a clan castle

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.250 
anyway these face here as a clan castle
fairly<00:00:57.239> well<00:00:57.360> centralized<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.109> isn't

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
fairly well centralized it isn't

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.200 
fairly well centralized it isn't
completely<00:00:58.590> centralized<00:00:59.129> Cambage<00:00:59.730> one<00:00:59.969> over

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
completely centralized Cambage one over

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720 
completely centralized Cambage one over
here<00:01:00.620> but<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.739> pretty<00:01:01.890> much<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> centralized

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
here but it's pretty much a centralized

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.340 
here but it's pretty much a centralized
you<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.390> bay<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:04.140> this

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you can get it with the bay with this

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.120 
you can get it with the bay with this
base<00:01:04.589> design<00:01:05.060> so<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> isn't<00:01:06.330> too<00:01:06.479> bad<00:01:07.130> let's

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
base design so I isn't too bad let's

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.039 
base design so I isn't too bad let's
you'll<00:01:08.340> see<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.380> triangle<00:01:10.380> eyes<00:01:10.470> mortars

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
you'll see we have triangle eyes mortars

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.270 
you'll see we have triangle eyes mortars
so<00:01:13.049> they're<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> cover<00:01:13.650> pretty<00:01:14.130> much

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
so they're going to cover pretty much

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.520 
so they're going to cover pretty much
all<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> base<00:01:15.240> if<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.659> all<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:16.470> do

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
all of the base if not all of it they do

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.490 
all of the base if not all of it they do
basically<00:01:16.950> call<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> cover<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.570> base

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.289 

we<00:01:22.500> also<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.799> our<00:01:23.040> Bob<00:01:23.369> King<00:01:23.700> which<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:24.119> go

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
we also have our Bob King which will go

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.010 
we also have our Bob King which will go
here<00:01:25.490> inside<00:01:26.490> walls<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.869> doesn't

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
here inside walls but that doesn't

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.100 
here inside walls but that doesn't
matter<00:01:28.259> too<00:01:28.619> much<00:01:29.210> now<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.420> our<00:01:30.540> air<00:01:30.780> defense

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
matter too much now with our air defense

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
matter too much now with our air defense
you'll<00:01:31.650> see<00:01:31.920> we've<00:01:32.100> got<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.430> over<00:01:32.579> here<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you'll see we've got one over here and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.789 
you'll see we've got one over here and
one<00:01:33.150> over<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.960> basically<00:01:34.350> because

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
one over here that is basically because

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.069 
one over here that is basically because
you<00:01:35.759> only<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> defense<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.780> town<00:01:36.930> or

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
you only have to a defense of town or

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.020 
you only have to a defense of town or
seven<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.740> I'm<00:01:37.860> trying<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.220> separate<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
seven so I'm trying to separate it so I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.399 
seven so I'm trying to separate it so I
can<00:01:39.180> cover<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.570> much<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.049> base<00:01:40.200> as

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
can cover as much as the base as

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.950 
can cover as much as the base as
possible<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:40.979> its<00:01:41.310> diagonal<00:01:41.880> e-course<00:01:42.810> this

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
possible but its diagonal e-course this

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.139 
possible but its diagonal e-course this
one's<00:01:43.170> new<00:01:43.409> air<00:01:43.590> defense<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.729> only<00:01:44.850> level

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
one's new air defense so it's only level

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:53.480 
one's new air defense so it's only level
one<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:48.659> got<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.680> visit<00:01:49.829> hours<00:01:50.360> they're<00:01:52.490> here

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
one you got to visit hours they're here

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.160 
one you got to visit hours they're here
and<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:53.850> they<00:01:54.270> are<00:01:54.299> going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.570> protect<00:01:54.960> some

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and here they are going to protect some

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.959 
and here they are going to protect some
of<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> resources<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.280> sound<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:56.759> pretty

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
of the resources and sound all pretty

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.380 
of the resources and sound all pretty
well<00:01:57.829> now<00:01:58.829> with<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.219> splash<00:01:59.640> damage<00:01:59.880> also<00:02:00.210> I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
well now with this splash damage also I

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.200 
well now with this splash damage also I
didn't<00:02:00.840> want<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.049> put<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.610> let<00:02:03.180> me

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
didn't want to put it so I like let me

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.119 
didn't want to put it so I like let me
Smoove<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.110> does<00:02:04.469> look<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.880> this<00:02:05.880> I

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
Smoove this it does look like this I

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.260 
Smoove this it does look like this I
might<00:02:08.129> keep<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.640> more<00:02:08.759> bunched<00:02:09.119> together

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
might keep it more bunched together

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.270 
might keep it more bunched together
because<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:11.660> it's<00:02:12.660> possible

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
because if I do that it's possible

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.309 
because if I do that it's possible
two<00:02:13.670> or<00:02:13.760> three<00:02:13.790> lions<00:02:14.360> bells<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.690> take<00:02:14.840> up<00:02:15.020> to

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
two or three lions bells to take up to

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.640 
two or three lions bells to take up to
the<00:02:16.160> most<00:02:16.370> important<00:02:16.819> defenses<00:02:17.240> so<00:02:17.650> that's

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
the most important defenses so that's

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.530 
the most important defenses so that's
not<00:02:18.740> something<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.160> keep<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.550> mind<00:02:19.610> try<00:02:20.209> not<00:02:20.390> to

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
not something to keep in mind try not to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.610 
not something to keep in mind try not to
keep<00:02:20.690> your<00:02:20.990> splash<00:02:22.569> defenses<00:02:23.569> too<00:02:23.990> close<00:02:24.380> to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
keep your splash defenses too close to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.180 
keep your splash defenses too close to
each<00:02:24.709> other<00:02:27.190> also<00:02:28.190> we<00:02:28.640> base<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.950> defenses<00:02:30.950> are

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
each other also we base the defenses are

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.979 
each other also we base the defenses are
spread<00:02:31.430> pretty<00:02:31.640> evenly<00:02:32.000> around<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.480> base<00:02:32.660> so

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
spread pretty evenly around the base so

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.870 
spread pretty evenly around the base so
there's<00:02:33.319> not<00:02:33.500> really<00:02:33.650> too<00:02:34.430> much<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.730> weak

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
there's not really too much of a weak

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.660 
there's not really too much of a weak
point<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.600> think<00:02:36.440> that's<00:02:36.560> pretty<00:02:37.430> much<00:02:37.610> it

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
point and I think that's pretty much it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.150 
point and I think that's pretty much it
apart<00:02:38.120> from<00:02:38.410> obviously<00:02:39.410> it's<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.620> choice<00:02:39.800> based

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
apart from obviously it's a choice based

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.490 
apart from obviously it's a choice based
so<00:02:40.430> resources<00:02:41.090> aren't<00:02:41.510> more<00:02:41.780> protected<00:02:42.290> you

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
so resources aren't more protected you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.240 
so resources aren't more protected you
could<00:02:42.770> probably<00:02:43.390> move<00:02:44.390> them<00:02:44.800> swap<00:02:45.800> them<00:02:46.040> with

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
could probably move them swap them with

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.330 
could probably move them swap them with
maybe<00:02:46.459> wizard<00:02:46.910> towers<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:48.380> defense<00:02:48.769> but<00:02:49.310> I

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
maybe wizard towers and a defense but I

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.580 
maybe wizard towers and a defense but I
wouldn't<00:02:49.730> recommend<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:51.410> that's

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
wouldn't recommend that and that's

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.620 
wouldn't recommend that and that's
really<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:51.890> for<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.100> video<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.640> ya<00:02:53.000> Yin<00:02:53.209> thanks
