okay so I've done one side of my hair
and<00:03:32.430> we're<00:03:32.610> just<00:03:32.760> going<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:32.970> leave<00:03:33.120> like<00:03:33.270> that

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
and we're just going to leave like that

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.330 
and we're just going to leave like that
I'm<00:03:33.690> not<00:03:33.780> going<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.020> separate<00:03:34.349> it<00:03:34.530> yet<00:03:34.709> but

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
I'm not going to separate it yet but

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.520 
I'm not going to separate it yet but
usually<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.209> left<00:03:36.390> side<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.900> your<00:03:36.930> hair<00:03:37.260> is

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
usually the left side of your hair is

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.080 
usually the left side of your hair is
different<00:03:37.980> whether<00:03:38.250> your<00:03:38.550> left<00:03:38.880> or

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
different whether your left or

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.390 
different whether your left or
right-handed<00:03:39.630> I'm<00:03:39.810> right-handed<00:03:40.160> so<00:03:41.160> it's<00:03:41.340> a

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
right-handed I'm right-handed so it's a

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.490 
right-handed I'm right-handed so it's a
lot<00:03:41.550> easier<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:42.300> me<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.480> curl<00:03:42.810> my<00:03:42.900> hair<00:03:43.020> onto

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
lot easier for me to curl my hair onto

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.080 
lot easier for me to curl my hair onto
my<00:03:43.830> right<00:03:44.010> side<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.430> used<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.730> have<00:03:44.940> trouble

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
my right side I used to have trouble

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.360 
my right side I used to have trouble
curling<00:03:45.780> my<00:03:45.900> hair<00:03:45.930> on<00:03:46.349> the<00:03:46.470> left<00:03:46.680> side<00:03:46.860> because
