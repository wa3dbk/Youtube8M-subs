with<00:01:26.400> production<00:01:26.790> schedules<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
with production schedules and you know I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.539 
with production schedules and you know I
still<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.799> events<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.250> stuff<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.460> that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
still go to events and stuff like that

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.460 
still go to events and stuff like that
so<00:01:29.970> there's<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.810> some<00:01:31.049> times<00:01:31.259> when

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
so there's going to be some times when

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.499 
so there's going to be some times when
it's<00:01:31.619> not<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.880> know<00:01:32.970> that's<00:01:33.270> that's

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
it's not but you know that's that's

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.120 
it's not but you know that's that's
something<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.930> want<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> aim<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.619> doing<00:01:34.979> is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
something I want to aim at doing is

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.219 
something I want to aim at doing is
doing<00:01:35.970> videos<00:01:36.360> weekly<00:01:36.540> obviously<00:01:37.079> they're

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
doing videos weekly obviously they're

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.539 
doing videos weekly obviously they're
not<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.920> super<00:01:38.340> great

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
not all going to be like super great

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.310 
not all going to be like super great
quality<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.630> some<00:01:39.960> things<00:01:39.990> take<00:01:40.259> longer

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
quality because some things take longer

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.950 
quality because some things take longer
producing<00:01:41.040> others<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.299> idea<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.750> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
producing others but the idea is that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.050 
producing others but the idea is that
you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> video<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.909> produce

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
you know a video like this I can produce

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.810 
you know a video like this I can produce
within<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.600> day<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.079> keep<00:01:46.770> gaming<00:01:46.979> content<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
within a day and keep gaming content you

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.190 
within a day and keep gaming content you
know<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> challenge<00:01:48.360> series<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> almost<00:01:49.049> like

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
know the challenge series is almost like

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.870 
know the challenge series is almost like
a<00:01:49.259> live<00:01:49.500> stream<00:01:49.799> depending<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.490> what<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
a live stream depending on what the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.550 
a live stream depending on what the
challenges<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.659> game<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.290> of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
challenges and what game on and of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.319 
challenges and what game on and of
course<00:01:52.590> but<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.520> would<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.670> similar<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.060> my

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
course but it would be similar to my

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.569 
course but it would be similar to my
live<00:01:54.570> comes<00:01:54.869> unless<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.860> decide<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.189> do<00:01:56.369> post

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
live comes unless I decide to do post

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.520 
live comes unless I decide to do post
commentary<00:01:57.060> maybe<00:01:57.630> I'll<00:01:57.810> do<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> live<00:01:58.170> comment

that the miniscule damage isn't really

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.390 
that the miniscule damage isn't really
getting<00:03:42.959> through<00:03:43.139> so<00:03:43.319> I<00:03:43.349> had<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.530> use<00:03:44.370> my

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
getting through so I had to use my

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.179 
getting through so I had to use my
original<00:03:45.090> fire<00:03:45.509> which<00:03:45.689> I<00:03:45.810> am<00:03:45.930> doing<00:03:46.199> now<00:03:46.349> each

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:47.189 
original fire which I am doing now each

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.580 
original fire which I am doing now each
gun<00:03:47.459> has<00:03:47.699> an<00:03:47.939> alternate<00:03:48.389> fire<00:03:48.540> for<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> separate

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
gun has an alternate fire for a separate

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.409 
gun has an alternate fire for a separate
effect<00:03:49.889> so<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.489> one<00:03:50.639> shoots<00:03:50.879> faster<00:03:51.269> does

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
effect so this one shoots faster does

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.629 
effect so this one shoots faster does
less<00:03:51.569> damage<00:03:51.599> its<00:03:52.500> alternative<00:03:52.979> fire<00:03:53.159> will

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
less damage its alternative fire will

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.550 
less damage its alternative fire will

and I've put my you know best and most

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.500 
and I've put my you know best and most
upgraded<00:05:09.530> towers<00:05:10.220> towards<00:05:10.820> that<00:05:11.000> location

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
upgraded towers towards that location

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.010 
upgraded towers towards that location
and<00:05:11.740> I<00:05:12.740> let<00:05:13.160> them<00:05:13.280> all<00:05:13.460> funnel<00:05:13.910> in<00:05:14.060> slowly<00:05:14.630> and

turrets kind of pack add-on from a

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.080 
turrets kind of pack add-on from a
distance<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:20.810> that's<00:05:21.680> just<00:05:22.070> one<00:05:22.490> play<00:05:22.790> style

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
distance and that's just one play style

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.580 
distance and that's just one play style
to<00:05:23.240> what<00:05:23.300> I<00:05:23.360> prefer<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:23.780> do<00:05:24.020> at<00:05:24.140> least<00:05:24.290> and

that's that's really all there is to

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.260 
that's that's really all there is to
this<00:05:26.900> game<00:05:27.140> like<00:05:27.500> it's<00:05:27.530> it's<00:05:28.010> just<00:05:28.460> solid

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
this game like it's it's just solid

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.960 
this game like it's it's just solid
gameplay<00:05:29.930> and<00:05:30.440> I'm<00:05:31.220> approaching<00:05:31.730> the<00:05:31.790> last

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
gameplay and I'm approaching the last

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.820 
gameplay and I'm approaching the last
wave<00:05:32.210> here<00:05:32.480> and<00:05:32.660> it's<00:05:33.260> something<00:05:33.530> I<00:05:33.590> kinda

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
wave here and it's something I kinda

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.400 
wave here and it's something I kinda
wanna<00:05:34.010> show<00:05:34.160> it<00:05:34.220> off<00:05:34.340> to<00:05:34.370> you<00:05:34.610> I<00:05:35.600> have

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.920 
wanna show it off to you I have
resources<00:05:36.890> rather<00:05:37.400> than<00:05:37.640> more<00:05:38.300> towards<00:05:38.690> I'm

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
resources rather than more towards I'm

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.950 
resources rather than more towards I'm
upgrading<00:05:39.230> turrets<00:05:39.830> I've<00:05:40.730> placed<00:05:41.480> on<00:05:41.630> all<00:05:41.780> my

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
upgrading turrets I've placed on all my

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.900 
upgrading turrets I've placed on all my
bricks<00:05:42.230> I<00:05:42.500> you<00:05:43.400> know<00:05:43.460> I<00:05:43.520> couldn't<00:05:43.760> quite

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
bricks I you know I couldn't quite

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.040 
bricks I you know I couldn't quite
finish<00:05:44.300> up<00:05:44.570> right<00:05:44.720> in<00:05:44.750> that<00:05:44.900> one

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
finish up right in that one

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.110 
finish up right in that one
unfortunately<00:05:45.590> but<00:05:45.890> it's<00:05:46.430> it's<00:05:46.760> time<00:05:46.970> to

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
unfortunately but it's it's time to

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.000 
unfortunately but it's it's time to
start<00:05:47.330> and<00:05:47.600> once<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:47.900> realized<00:05:48.110> this<00:05:48.500> this<00:05:48.890> is

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
start and once I realized this this is

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.420 
start and once I realized this this is
obviously<00:05:49.190> a<00:05:49.430> post<00:05:49.610> game<00:05:49.730> commentary<00:05:50.150> so<00:05:51.430> well

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
obviously a post game commentary so well

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.220 
obviously a post game commentary so well
we'll<00:05:52.670> start<00:05:52.880> the<00:05:53.000> wave<00:05:53.150> and<00:05:53.420> you'll<00:05:53.870> you'll

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
we'll start the wave and you'll you'll

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.470 
we'll start the wave and you'll you'll
see<00:05:54.440> what<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:55.250> final<00:05:55.490> wave<00:05:55.670> has<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:56.090> bring<00:05:56.270> it

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
see what the final wave has to bring it

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.430 
see what the final wave has to bring it
it's<00:05:56.990> a<00:05:57.020> lot<00:05:57.170> of<00:05:57.290> fun<00:05:57.440> uh<00:05:58.810> yeah<00:05:59.810> so<00:06:00.020> I<00:06:00.050> don't

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
think I've ever had the core destroyed

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.490 
think I've ever had the core destroyed
in<00:06:02.420> any<00:06:02.870> one<00:06:03.020> of<00:06:03.080> my<00:06:03.170> place<00:06:03.440> ruse<00:06:03.680> and<00:06:03.920> up<00:06:04.850> until

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
in any one of my place ruse and up until

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.310 
in any one of my place ruse and up until

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
know it's not like game over anything

now<00:06:16.790> my<00:06:17.050> defenses<00:06:18.050> are<00:06:18.380> still

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
now my defenses are still

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.620 
now my defenses are still
self-sustaining<00:06:19.850> they<00:06:20.090> have<00:06:20.390> to<00:06:20.480> route

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
self-sustaining they have to route

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.630 
self-sustaining they have to route
through<00:06:20.840> all<00:06:20.930> my<00:06:21.080> stuff<00:06:21.140> and<00:06:21.590> slowly<00:06:22.160> make<00:06:22.460> it

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
through all my stuff and slowly make it

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.970 
through all my stuff and slowly make it
towards<00:06:22.880> the<00:06:22.970> center<00:06:23.270> and<00:06:23.450> eventually<00:06:24.440> I<00:06:24.860> do

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
towards the center and eventually I do

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.880 
towards the center and eventually I do
respond<00:06:25.550> and<00:06:25.790> nobody's<00:06:26.660> even<00:06:26.900> close<00:06:27.380> and<00:06:27.680> I

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890
