00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
it as more beautiful I do realize the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.469 
it as more beautiful I do realize the

as<00:02:09.599> well<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.560> don't<00:02:10.649> think<00:02:10.979> we<00:02:11.580> should

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
as well but I don't think we should

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.160 
as well but I don't think we should
judge<00:02:11.970> other<00:02:12.150> people<00:02:12.420> for<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.780> will<00:02:13.019> not

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
make anyone feel bad about it I will not

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.580 
make anyone feel bad about it I will not
look<00:02:15.120> at<00:02:15.299> them<00:02:15.450> really<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.930> will<00:02:16.230> not<00:02:16.379> treat

them<00:02:16.799> differently<00:02:17.280> or<00:02:17.519> whatever<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:18.180> think

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
them differently or whatever I think

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.759 
them differently or whatever I think
it's<00:02:19.019> very<00:02:19.140> normal

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
it's very normal

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.830 
it's very normal
and<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.250> think<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:20.610> brave<00:02:20.819> for<00:02:21.000> women<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.450> do

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
and I think it's brave for women to do

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.720 
and I think it's brave for women to do
these<00:02:22.049> things<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.890> noticed<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.370> culture

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
these things and I noticed the culture

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.970 
these things and I noticed the culture

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
an aspect of this like years ago decades

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.490 
an aspect of this like years ago decades
ago<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.790> was<00:02:26.970> not<00:02:27.150> willing<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.959> grow<00:02:28.140> their<00:02:28.319> leg
