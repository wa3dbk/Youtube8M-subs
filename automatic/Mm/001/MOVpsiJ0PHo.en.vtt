but<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> think<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.810> consumers<00:02:10.520> what<00:02:11.520> this

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
but I think for consumers what this

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.540 
but I think for consumers what this
means

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
means

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.980 
means

to lower its price point it doesn't need

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.640 
to lower its price point it doesn't need

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
to it really doesn't it's leading the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.320 
to it really doesn't it's leading the
market<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.520> don't<00:03:09.700> think<00:03:09.910> any<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.180> its

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
market and I don't think any of its

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.610 
market and I don't think any of its
market<00:03:10.630> share<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:10.900> going<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.170> be<00:03:11.260> eaten<00:03:11.530> away
