00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.060
 we feel that the ship has 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.060
 taken from the mind 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.150
 from the same audience that one day 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:27.430
 the biggest of him 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.430
 it is important 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.449
 every year 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.870
 I 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.750
 because we play it something play wants 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.120
 ask you we want to hide and how 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.010
 you play that there's always a person who 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.010
 is going to count the numbers 7 5 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.079
 moments 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.270
 keep in mind the numbers on teeth 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.250
 also while I 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.049
 and when they hide he's going to go out 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.850
 look for it has is going to appropriate a

 points 3 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.469
 let's count 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.390
 do not 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.680
 while all these days that I've 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.269
 but will be present written 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.269
 you have to put to count 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.450
 do not 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.620
 what he did was remove the center of mass 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.799
 the potato sent him to the ground 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.120
 of wildlife the passives lean to 23 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.680
 degrees that make big estimates of 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.349
 the earth taking into account the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.299
 prevention and annotation that is the sun 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.490
 the moon and some of the stars in the 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.940
 head 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.140
 in the change we have and thanks to that

 what is trying to locate the events if 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.750
 we were in the hemisphere are I think 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.750
 that the right 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.960
 and thanks to the positions 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.129
 and it began to complicate 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.440
 physics 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.630
 and he started to complicate us all up 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.630
 that in the end he needed 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.780
 are you thinking 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.799
 he stood there waiting for me to see him and 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:14.609
 when he saw him barely saw it out 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.609
 running to love 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:25.740
 a person when you ask

 Jesus is contact and when you are 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:35.639
 counting sharing sharing and 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.280
 when they raise those two that you are 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.169
 looking for you listen to that low voice and 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.090
 tell him 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.539
 three points per piece more votes 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.539

 but no 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.520
 the worst that can happen to one 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.380
 point 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.919
