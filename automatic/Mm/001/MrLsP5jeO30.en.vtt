00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello today i will tell you about 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.920
 small generator with e which here 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.170
 assembled on a chip tl494 shooting very 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.020
 simple enough nothing at all here 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.850
 need to do at an hour thirty wadded 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.730
 flashlight here is such a but you can LED 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.949
 can be used incandescent bulb 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.930
 bam case here is very everything is just nothing 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.849
 no complicated wound core in general 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.460
 This is the scheme of the shark that I found in 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.200
 the internet 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.670
 everything is done very simply quite simple 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.420
 the scheme honestly did not believe yet 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.070
 colleague did not collect on a dangerous craft but 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.930
 nevertheless i want to demonstrate 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.489
 how it burns I used on 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.460
 this moment is this one 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.410
 spotlight the usual spotlight 10 watts on and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.600
 yes, that is, I took it down right away 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.100
 here are just two wires sticking from 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.449
 led matrix for had 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.449
 choose from here this 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.119
 here was his driver just carelessly 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.640
 cut off and figs with him yes that is here 10 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.090
 watt spotlight yes i mean i think that 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.220
 all know very well use for 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.030
 running a normal battery battery on 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.939
 12 volts just touching means from 12 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.820
 volt yes that is, here it is, I just 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.150
 touching now to this diode igniting 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.340
 searchlight and he already tweaked here here 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.290
 there is a frequency resistor 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.729
 adjustment resistor as i understand it in this 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.710
 this scheme itself 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.040
 output voltage and so i'm touching 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.020
 look so i'm here he is 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.649
 turned on means and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.200
 but look at everything I clean completely 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.950
 battery in general, that is, I appreciate it 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.780
 I generally remove him from the table and 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.360
 the spotlight continues to burn calmly yes 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.240
 that is, no wires 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.450
 except now I will clean it specially 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.140
 see here are no power wires 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.120
 no more that's just the bare pay 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.489
 lies and eats searchlight 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.970
 look yes here's a spotlight 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.250
 a spotlight is connected to this board 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.310
 here is nothing here no batteries 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.760
 no batteries here she is just naked 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.049
 pay 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.650
 here are two capacitors of 2200 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:36.970
 microfarad transistor all that means 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.200
 the scheme is fully working and the usual 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.150
 transformer from a pulse unit 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.819
 power tv from soviet by the way 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.940
 my core has already collapsed here 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.950
 several times by itself it stuck it together but 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.260
 I do not know how this one is just on the ball 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.730
 here is please reeled lantern which 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.859
 will serve to burn and never 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.540
 extinguished well maybe sometime extinguished 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.549
 will show it can be wear something 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.540
 don't necessarily want to say it 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.390
 perpetual motion machine 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.659
 well, the spotlight is on so frankly 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.060
 even the video is difficult to shoot everything I launched 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.970
 I donâ€™t know how to stop the system 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.670
 just have to close something yes then 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:19.150
 there is well here is such a scheme is enough 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.030
 simple nothing complex that is here 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.090
 a flashlight that can be hung on the street 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.889
 yes that is 30 watt lantern 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.769
 it just starts up usually with a battery 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:32.590
 turns on here there is a stop button yes 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.510
 that is, you will see on the diagram I and the court do not 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.859
 provided therefore it will burn 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.959
 now I have to leave here even 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.889
 as you can see I have a mess yes it 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.530
 Due to the fact that I started looking 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:50.139
 free energy and honestly i am her 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.930
 I found a battery here and here it is 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.829
 battery here I hold it in my hands 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.060
 just launched 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.430
 and everything 's on fire 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.260
 there are people of course 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.049
 bullshit flogged on the forums everywhere they write 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.799
 everybody likes to write this 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:11.590
 write on, I will only say one thing 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:15.290
 what if you are commentators 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:20.090
 except how to scratch your tongue when 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:24.139
 did not do something then sorry that is well 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.419
 flag you hands us in the hands of a soldering iron yes 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.039
 so here with the help of such here 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.680
 things we all collect and solder important 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.199
 to 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.310
 the main thing that was well 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:43.850
 getting eaten this desire that's when 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.710
 understand how the system works when 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.860
 understand what an electromagnetic field is 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.720
 then you can collect such things and 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.970
 they will work for you and here's how 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.699
 see the spotlight is burning just bright so 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.590
 that it is impossible to look at this system 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.710
 here is the LED is lit some yes then 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.099
 there I am here soldered to the scheme he was 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.930
 his zasandalil is indicated here it is if 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.240
 look at the scheme of this LED here 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.349
 he yes that is, it burns here stabilizer 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.020
 It should be honest in that there is a colleague 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:18.259
 who collected also does not understand yet 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.090
 how it can work but obviously 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.389
 works yes that is, I say again that 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.979
 there is a magnetic electromagnetic field here 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.650
 if you deal with the system 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.659
 electromagnetic field plus resonance we 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.949
 will always know how it works 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.949
 Thanks for attention
