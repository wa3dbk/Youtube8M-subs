00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.649
 while in germany the wages of the cup 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.780
 drivers have stagnated for 20 years 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.699
 or continue to sink 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.050
 are denmark because of the broken 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:43.930
 Already around 8,000 jobs have disappeared 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.449
 sometimes in school learning is economy 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.500
 a cycle 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:52.960
 who is consumed earned enough 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.120
 This circulation cycle or weeks 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.220
 He quickly becomes a gyroscope 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.110
 the son of everything in the deep rips in 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.409
 germany needs more and more people 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.080
 increase your salary with hartz iv 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.479
 to be able to live and their families too 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.159
 feed 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.610
 what is it supposed to be funding for? 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.130
 become 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.909
 if the state does not have that money anymore 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.100
 occupies 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:22.119
 because even within germany there 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:29.110
 wage differences of up to 1600 euros 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:31.780
 for the same also in some areas 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.730
 in Germany will be completely official 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.380
 wages are paid in hessen and 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.090
 Baden wÃ¼rttemberg immoral why 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.520
 you pull the emergency brake at this 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.030
 rapid descent into the two classes 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.610
 society in germany it is time 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.010
 socially just minimum standards 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.640
 to create legal regulations so 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.840
 as for example in the Rhine 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.400
 there the trade unions act 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.200
 wages from under legislated monitors 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.930
 Compliance has been in place since 1996 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.590
 a directive on posting 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.869
 of employees 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.400
 She has been an industry since 1999 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.930
 mandatory 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.420
 This directive was adopted by the EU 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.030
 parliament arranged that worker 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.340
 the for 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.890
 company are transnationally active 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.740
 basically after in the respective 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.130
 country applicable tariff agreement or 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.920
 minimum wages are to be paid 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.110
 and now this only applies to the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.340
 business 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.530
 why the transport sector 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.510
 works on a grip over so 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.200
 right here should this directive for 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.200
 come into force 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.790
 nobody wants a bible free 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:13.430
 goods traffic in the way 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:16.219
 but he has to stay fair for everyone and 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.200
 That's why we ask for the suspension 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:22.189
 and neufahrn and kabotage after 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.319
 Article 10 of the eu regulation 72 2009 for 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.430
 six months 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.650
 because in Germany we can the 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.329
 trend towards cheap labor for 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.510
 example in the transport for the 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.010
 Car industry watching flagged 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.930
 companies pressed together with the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.470
 industry transport prices since 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.310
 We are actively involved at the beginning of the year 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.970
 Organizations from different 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.220
 Western European countries together and in 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.889
 This time grew because of close 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.180
 collaboration 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:56.079
 a real friendship between 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.079
 our organizations 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:04.519
 we support each other since our first 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.530
 Meet each other in antwerp 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.329
 colleagues and functionaries from ours 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.409
 European neighbors by far 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:14.599
 earlier than others have realized how 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.209
 important it is all human and not 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:20.419
 only the motorists in europe 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.659
 wake up and on states 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:29.479
 to notify them anymore 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:31.220
 can be accepted if we are today 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.320
 not to be thanked side with all 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.599
 concerned and our power 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.099
 Then it will be tomorrow 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:42.080
 have antwerp late at the mietingen 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.820
 the organizations among others 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.360
 equal pay for equal work 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.360
 required 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.400
 that should be especially for the 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.240
 Eastern European colleagues apply the 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.620
 Currently in Western Europe for 400 to 600 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.539
 drive euro a month 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.270
 They are partly three to four weeks 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.640
 traveling in europe need to be here 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.770
 cater and should then still money for 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.340
 bring the family home as it should 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.340
 that go 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.090
 The EU officials then something like that 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:28.370
 So our problems are just so 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:30.140
 a market disruption that is when it is 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.180
 Do not change anything soon and everyone 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.880
 Rethink the responsible together 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.430
 Cathar Europe will do its duty 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.630
 meet and the responsible for 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:45.680
 We have to rethink things and that is where we go 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:48.560
 example a production worker of 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:54.670
 car industry explaining its 2013 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.670
 bring success of about 4600 euro net 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:06.920
 probably change because it is in the 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:09.040
 do not store material anymore 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.450
 further eu regulation prohibits 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.810
 mailbox companies transe transport sector 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:18.980
 you lack the lawful 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:21.730
 implementation of the regulation in luxembourg 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.250
 you have all ten years ago 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.990
 mailbox companies disposed of 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:30.200
 there is, for example less with the 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.300
 mailboxes in schleswig holstein die 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.010
 Although the trucks in Germany about it 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:40.930
 offered but has anyone ever 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.930
 Asked who called this help 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.870
 Often these workers are too 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.210
 poor or not at all 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.220
 Social funds reported in a case 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.840
 became lithuanian driver in half 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.540
 a german wage on these trucks 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.070
 set 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.110
 So we realize that it is eu 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.180
 Decisions and regulations give us 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.280
 However, apparently nobody except 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.590
 us all renault percent more 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.620
 through settlements 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.630
 Everyone is not interested in either 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.440
 responsible politician and first 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.150
 quite not gold and logistics it will 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.750
 our duty requires us 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:24.340
 to comply it says sanctions 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:26.890
 alibi as a buyer but who sanctioned 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.470
 actually the eu parliament and the 

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.210
 respective government if it is theirs 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.620
 in the implementation of your self 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.360
 created guidelines and 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:44.350
 regulations obviously to competence 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:46.870
 lacking we try to be realistic 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:49.410
 we do the impossible and all 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.410
 together
