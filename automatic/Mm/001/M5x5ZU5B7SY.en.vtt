00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
 cook 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.900
 Hello and welcome we are again two facts about the film and 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.700
 today you can here 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.710
 Hecht learn something because we go on the high seas together with a bunch 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.709
 strange pitfalls 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.679
 therefore had to be told 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.679
 from their wild times like this 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.609
 now had to 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:29.989
 then one will 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.179
 who wins 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.170
 Semi-finals 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.970
 I think so holding on 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.769
 and I have not been this year 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.839
 Unfortunately we have no Deut Age man that is not fast 11 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.660
 You here 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.750
 Did you know that Showrooms most famous writer prefers so and 100? 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.859
 Christ about pirates said that they 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.920
 to be the enemies of humanity and not to promise a shaman to them 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.890
 to hold 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.130
 So honestly, that we've known that for so long, we remember each other 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.580
 but quite a long time with the problem to find or 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.920
 winter cold it is empty 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.960
 Baradar 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.820
 some representatives FC Valencia or Sevilla from the chair or vomit 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.590
 Degree 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.610
 or see some as they are afraid to have distressed me 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.910
 the Freiburger 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.660
 makes the fire so sad that she is not directly sued 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.960
 we have a little private problem because he knows that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.750
 this young sympathetic boy is also in real life 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.729
 By the way, in this Betty 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.450
 first 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.340
 She was also often referred to as the virgin queen 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.610
 Well no wonder the women spray them was the injured 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.240
 Member of the CEO Doors 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.920
 no miracle again because we all know well that virginity 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.080
 and junior kickers go hard together 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.400
 from the one and minarets example 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.140
 wins during the ride 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.600
 important I think I did not wake up 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.740
 Dr 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.740
 obviously it does not work 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.509
 van der Heyden 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.510
 unfortunately, only way is alone 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.710
 I think they were lucky enough to be decoration 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.219
 we had 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.849
 find a bunch of strange what do you want the two facts about the movie 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.359
 They can be on the market or they sent the first one 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.290
 in March on the big screen 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.870
 I do not want to return to the next facts about the next movie until then 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.849
 thank you for watching 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.849
