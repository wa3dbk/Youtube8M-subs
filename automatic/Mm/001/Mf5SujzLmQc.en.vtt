00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.440 

the<00:00:05.250> question<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:05.609> hate<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.879> answer<00:00:06.089> most<00:00:06.210> about

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
the question I hate to answer most about

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.330 
the question I hate to answer most about
tarantulas<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.230> jungle<00:00:07.560> Bob<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.040> male

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
tarantulas is jungle Bob is that a male

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.970 
tarantulas is jungle Bob is that a male
or<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.550> female<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:09.320> could<00:00:10.320> throw<00:00:10.469> an<00:00:10.590> answer<00:00:10.800> out

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
or a female I could throw an answer out

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.410 
or a female I could throw an answer out
but<00:00:11.130> they're<00:00:11.219> probably<00:00:11.370> 50/50<00:00:12.150> just<00:00:12.330> by

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
but they're probably 50/50 just by

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.030 
but they're probably 50/50 just by
looking<00:00:12.719> at<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.139> extremely<00:00:13.799> difficult

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
looking at it it's extremely difficult

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.700 
looking at it it's extremely difficult
to<00:00:14.429> tell<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.820> difference<00:00:15.210> between

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
to tell the difference between

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.470 
to tell the difference between
tarantulas<00:00:16.710> genders<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:17.880> by<00:00:18.000> looking<00:00:18.359> at

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
tarantulas genders just by looking at

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.599 
tarantulas genders just by looking at
the<00:00:18.570> animal<00:00:18.960> certainly<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> length<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the animal certainly the length of the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.929 
the animal certainly the length of the
pedipalps<00:00:20.910> which<00:00:21.449> are<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.260> two<00:00:23.070> extensions

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
pedipalps which are the two extensions

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.179 
pedipalps which are the two extensions
in<00:00:24.090> between<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> legs<00:00:24.810> sometimes<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:26.010> certain

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
in between the legs sometimes in certain

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.670 
in between the legs sometimes in certain
species<00:00:26.609> might<00:00:27.210> be<00:00:27.420> an<00:00:27.510> indicator<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.380> really

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
species might be an indicator but really

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.040 
species might be an indicator but really
isn't<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.609> could<00:00:29.820> look<00:00:30.029> at<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.599> end<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.929> those

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
isn't you could look at the end of those

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.260 
isn't you could look at the end of those
pedipalps<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.520> mating<00:00:32.850> season<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
pedipalps and in the mating season the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.410 
pedipalps and in the mating season the
males<00:00:33.600> will<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.590> little<00:00:34.980> bulbous<00:00:35.489> nature

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
males will have a little bulbous nature

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420 
males will have a little bulbous nature
to<00:00:36.600> them<00:00:36.780> they<00:00:37.110> use<00:00:37.350> those<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.770> grab<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
to them they use those to grab on to the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.010 
to them they use those to grab on to the
female<00:00:38.610> during<00:00:38.969> mating<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.600> during<00:00:39.870> mating

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
female during mating so during mating

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.869 
female during mating so during mating
season<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.890> might<00:00:41.160> see<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:41.610> bit<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
season you might see a little bit of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.940 
season you might see a little bit of
extension<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.540> those<00:00:42.690> pedipalps<00:00:43.020> that's<00:00:43.800> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
extension on those pedipalps that's a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.830 
extension on those pedipalps that's a
good<00:00:44.070> indicator<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.239> two<00:00:45.450> next<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
good indicator if you have two next to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.029 
good indicator if you have two next to
each<00:00:45.870> other<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.379> might<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.620> been<00:00:46.680> born<00:00:46.890> at

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
each other that might have been born at

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.190 
each other that might have been born at
the<00:00:47.100> same<00:00:47.309> time<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:48.510> might<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.809> larger<00:00:49.140> than

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the same time one might be larger than

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.080 
the same time one might be larger than
the<00:00:49.350> other<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.770> could<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.100> an<00:00:50.190> indicator<00:00:50.610> but

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the other that could be an indicator but

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.819 
the other that could be an indicator but
none<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.300> them<00:00:51.449> really<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:51.840> 100%<00:00:52.289> when<00:00:52.710> you're

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
none of them really are 100% when you're

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.290 
none of them really are 100% when you're
first<00:00:52.980> looking<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> animal<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.239> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
first looking at the animal so it's a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.479 
first looking at the animal so it's a
very<00:00:54.510> difficult<00:00:54.780> thing<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.860> novice<00:00:56.309> or

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
very difficult thing for the novice or

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.849 
very difficult thing for the novice or
even<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.059> intermediary<00:00:57.660> keeper<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.500> pet

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
even the intermediary keeper or pet

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.099 
even the intermediary keeper or pet
store<00:00:59.129> owner<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.520> sure<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.270> understand<00:01:00.809> which

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
store owner for sure to understand which

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.529 
store owner for sure to understand which
gender<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.859> tarantula<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.180> only<00:01:03.390> way<00:01:03.480> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
gender that tarantula is the only way to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.240 
gender that tarantula is the only way to
really<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.559> someone<00:01:04.830> who's<00:01:05.040> in

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
really do it is to have someone who's in

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.359 
really do it is to have someone who's in
the<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.519> who<00:01:06.240> has<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.780> molt<00:01:07.280> tarantulas<00:01:08.280> have

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the know who has a molt tarantulas have

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.920 
the know who has a molt tarantulas have
an<00:01:08.520> exoskeleton<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.540> get<00:01:09.659> bigger

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
an exoskeleton and when they get bigger

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.380 
an exoskeleton and when they get bigger
they<00:01:10.470> molt<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.070> skin<00:01:11.400> comes<00:01:11.670> off<00:01:11.909> it's<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
they molt that skin comes off it's a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.270 
they molt that skin comes off it's a
perfect<00:01:12.780> replica<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> animal<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.920> it's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
perfect replica of the animal and it's

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.980 
perfect replica of the animal and it's
actually<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> better<00:01:14.939> indicator<00:01:15.390> from<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> sex

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
actually a better indicator from the sex

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.719 
actually a better indicator from the sex
point<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.350> view<00:01:16.470> because<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
point of view because you can see the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.420 
point of view because you can see the
female<00:01:18.090> sex<00:01:18.390> organs<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.500> molt<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.220> have

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
female sex organs in the molt you have

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.100 
female sex organs in the molt you have
to<00:01:20.549> wet<00:01:20.790> them<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.509> stretch<00:01:21.750> them<00:01:21.990> out

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
to wet them you have to stretch them out

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.780 
to wet them you have to stretch them out
a<00:01:22.140> little<00:01:22.259> bit<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.710> sometimes<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.640> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
a little bit and sometimes you have to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.070 
a little bit and sometimes you have to
actually<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.360> microscope<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.020> look

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
actually get a microscope and look

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.679 
actually get a microscope and look
really<00:01:25.380> close<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:26.189> try<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> see<00:01:26.970> where<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
really close to try to see where the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.440 
really close to try to see where the
female<00:01:28.140> parts<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> animal<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
female parts of the animal is so for the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.120 
female parts of the animal is so for the
untrained<00:01:30.720> eye<00:01:31.020> you're<00:01:31.560> not<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.920> guess

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
untrained eye you're not going to guess

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.219 
untrained eye you're not going to guess
it's<00:01:32.430> 50/50<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> trained<00:01:33.840> eye<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.049> can

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it's 50/50 but the trained eye you can

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.350 
it's 50/50 but the trained eye you can
be<00:01:34.290> 100%<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> molt<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.180> your

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
be 100% if you have a molt in your
