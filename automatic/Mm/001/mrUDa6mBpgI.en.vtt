PEGI 18 what I'm really excited about in
in<00:00:16.990> this<00:00:17.110> Killzone<00:00:17.560> game<00:00:17.740> and<00:00:18.070> killzone

in this Killzone game and killzone
shadow<00:00:18.640> fall<00:00:18.760> and<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.710> fact<00:00:20.950> that<00:00:21.100> we

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
shadow fall and it's the fact that we

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.240 
shadow fall and it's the fact that we
have<00:00:21.940> all<00:00:22.390> these<00:00:22.720> new<00:00:23.050> locations<00:00:23.860> and

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
have all these new locations and

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.640 
have all these new locations and
environments<00:00:25.090> and<00:00:25.360> that<00:00:26.110> we<00:00:26.200> were<00:00:26.320> able<00:00:26.470> to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
environments and that we were able to

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.270 
environments and that we were able to
build<00:00:26.980> in<00:00:27.310> a<00:00:27.670> scale<00:00:28.090> and<00:00:28.510> a<00:00:28.960> fidelity<00:00:29.830> level

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.280 
build in a scale and a fidelity level

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.329 
build in a scale and a fidelity level
that<00:00:30.580> playstation<00:00:31.360> 4<00:00:31.570> allows<00:00:31.870> us<00:00:32.079> to<00:00:32.230> do<00:00:32.379> stuff

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:33.339 
that playstation 4 allows us to do stuff

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:35.279 
that playstation 4 allows us to do stuff
they<00:00:33.460> were<00:00:33.519> able<00:00:33.640> to<00:00:33.820> do<00:00:33.940> this<00:00:34.719> time<00:00:35.079> around

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:35.289 
they were able to do this time around

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.819 
they were able to do this time around
it's<00:00:35.920> it's<00:00:36.160> not<00:00:36.339> a<00:00:36.750> nice<00:00:37.750> single<00:00:38.109> feature<00:00:38.559> that

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
it's it's not a nice single feature that

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.069 
it's it's not a nice single feature that
we've<00:00:38.980> never<00:00:39.190> been<00:00:39.370> able<00:00:39.489> to<00:00:39.670> do<00:00:39.879> list<00:00:40.600> against

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
we've never been able to do list against

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.660 
we've never been able to do list against
the<00:00:41.230> powers<00:00:41.559> and<00:00:41.679> the<00:00:41.769> combination<00:00:42.370> of<00:00:42.519> all<00:00:42.609> of

the powers and the combination of all of
these<00:00:42.910> features<00:00:43.149> so<00:00:44.079> previously<00:00:44.620> you<00:00:45.100> may

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:45.249 
these features so previously you may

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:47.340 
these features so previously you may
have<00:00:45.370> seen<00:00:45.579> high<00:00:46.030> dynamic<00:00:46.210> range<00:00:46.449> lighting<00:00:47.050> or

have seen high dynamic range lighting or

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.410 
have seen high dynamic range lighting or
you<00:00:47.499> may<00:00:47.649> have<00:00:47.890> seen<00:00:48.159> really<00:00:48.760> exquisite

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
you may have seen really exquisite

you may have seen really exquisite
particle<00:00:49.989> effects<00:00:50.440> or<00:00:50.679> all<00:00:50.949> of<00:00:50.980> that<00:00:51.280> now<00:00:52.179> we

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
particle effects or all of that now we

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.910 
particle effects or all of that now we
can<00:00:52.420> combine<00:00:52.690> all<00:00:53.170> of<00:00:53.199> those<00:00:53.440> we<00:00:53.620> don't<00:00:53.739> have

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
can combine all of those we don't have

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.619 
can combine all of those we don't have
to<00:00:54.010> pick<00:00:54.190> and<00:00:54.309> choose<00:00:54.399> we<00:00:54.850> can<00:00:54.879> just<00:00:55.149> have<00:00:55.390> all

scene playstation 4 has proven to us to
be<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.710> easiest<00:01:12.130> platform<00:01:12.970> so<00:01:13.300> far<00:01:13.660> to

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
be the easiest platform so far to

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.040 
be the easiest platform so far to
develop<00:01:14.980> for<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.460> just<00:01:15.610> from<00:01:16.270> day<00:01:16.450> one<00:01:16.840> the

and running from day one which as a
developer<00:01:25.450> is<00:01:25.630> very<00:01:26.050> critical<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:26.620> you

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
developer is very critical that you

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.280 
developer is very critical that you
don't<00:01:27.130> lose<00:01:27.400> that<00:01:27.460> that<00:01:28.060> time<00:01:28.360> early<00:01:28.840> on<00:01:28.870> in

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
don't lose that that time early on in

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.190 
don't lose that that time early on in
the<00:01:29.710> process<00:01:29.980> and<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:31.600> want<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.840> work<00:01:31.960> on<00:01:32.080> the

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
the process and you want to work on the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.060 
the process and you want to work on the
game<00:01:32.410> not<00:01:33.010> on<00:01:33.160> your<00:01:33.820> development<00:01:34.330> environment

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
game not on your development environment

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.990 
game not on your development environment
because<00:01:36.070> there's<00:01:36.220> not<00:01:36.340> like<00:01:36.490> obvious

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
because there's not like obvious

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.580 
because there's not like obvious
bottlenecks<00:01:37.720> in<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.960> system<00:01:38.320> makes<00:01:38.500> it

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
bottlenecks in the system makes it

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.290 
bottlenecks in the system makes it
really<00:01:38.710> easy<00:01:38.950> for<00:01:39.160> developers<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.850> just<00:01:40.210> you

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
really easy for developers to just you

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.110 
really easy for developers to just you
know<00:01:40.440> get<00:01:41.440> your<00:01:41.590> stuff<00:01:41.740> running<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.340> use<00:01:42.880> all

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
know get your stuff running and use all

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.760 
know get your stuff running and use all
of<00:01:43.300> it<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.660> use<00:01:43.930> it<00:01:43.960> wisely<00:01:44.230> and<00:01:44.650> then

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
of it and use it wisely and then

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.410 
of it and use it wisely and then
immediately<00:01:45.310> start<00:01:45.550> on<00:01:45.640> making<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.300> game

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
immediately start on making the game

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.400 
immediately start on making the game
faster<00:01:47.110> more<00:01:47.380> fun<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:49.570> means<00:01:49.780> like<00:01:49.930> we

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
faster more fun and that means like we

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.810 
faster more fun and that means like we
get<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.710> spend<00:01:50.800> much<00:01:51.130> more<00:01:51.310> time<00:01:51.370> on<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
get to spend much more time on the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.370 
get to spend much more time on the
actual<00:01:52.060> game<00:01:52.090> instead<00:01:52.570> of<00:01:52.660> working<00:01:52.930> around

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
actual game instead of working around

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.250 
actual game instead of working around
you<00:01:54.040> know

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
you know

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.560 
you know
obvious<00:01:54.830> automation<00:01:55.580> system<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.030> then<00:01:56.120> add

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
obvious automation system and then add

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.740 
obvious automation system and then add
it<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.930> that<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.500> was<00:01:57.680> made<00:01:58.550> easy<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:59.030> make<00:01:59.600> the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
it to that it was made easy to make the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.660 
it to that it was made easy to make the
game<00:01:59.870> so<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.110> can<00:02:00.230> play<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.590> while<00:02:01.340> it's

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
game so you can play it while it's

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.520

that's really beautiful to me as an

to you don't need to take them into
account<00:02:21.230> anymore<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.700> can<00:02:22.940> just<00:02:23.090> start

dreaming<00:02:23.570> on<00:02:23.990> anything<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:25.040> excitement<00:02:25.610> that

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
dreaming on anything the excitement that

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.880 
dreaming on anything the excitement that
you<00:02:26.150> feel<00:02:26.510> when<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.080> can<00:02:27.260> actually<00:02:27.380> do<00:02:27.680> that

you feel when you can actually do that

you feel when you can actually do that
that's<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.490> think<00:02:28.790> it's<00:02:28.910> hard<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.180> describe<00:02:29.390> and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
that's I think it's hard to describe and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.070 
that's I think it's hard to describe and
but<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.270> think<00:02:32.390> what<00:02:32.540> makes<00:02:32.750> being<00:02:32.930> a

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
but it is I think what makes being a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.010 
but it is I think what makes being a
launch<00:02:33.260> title<00:02:33.350> so<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.310> super<00:02:34.730> special<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.390> think

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
launch title so so super special I think

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.720 
launch title so so super special I think
the<00:02:36.080> challenge<00:02:36.410> for<00:02:36.440> us<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:36.830> generation<00:02:37.400> is

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
the challenge for us this generation is

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.840 
the challenge for us this generation is
trying<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.870> really<00:02:39.170> make<00:02:40.100> people<00:02:40.280> forgets

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
trying to really make people forgets

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.900 
trying to really make people forgets
maybe<00:02:41.360> more<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:42.260> than<00:02:42.500> ever<00:02:42.650> before<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.880> are

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
maybe more so than ever before that are

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:53.260 
maybe more so than ever before that are
playing<00:02:44.210> a<00:02:44.360> game

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.330
