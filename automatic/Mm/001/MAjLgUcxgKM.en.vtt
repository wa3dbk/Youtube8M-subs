00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
of them your first one should be ready

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:58.940 
of them your first one should be ready
just<00:00:49.870> about<00:00:50.870> turn<00:00:51.200> not<00:00:51.830> quite<00:00:52.160> yet

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.980 

there<00:00:59.610> we<00:00:59.700> go<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.060> one's<00:01:00.300> ready<00:01:00.540> to<00:01:00.600> start

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
there we go this one's ready to start

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.510 
there we go this one's ready to start
training<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.100> want<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.340> remember

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
training and then you want to remember

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:24.230 
training and then you want to remember
to<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> order<00:01:06.300> that<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:09.360> poured

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.140 

and<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> process<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
and then it's just the process of

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.440 
and then it's just the process of
continuing<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:28.170> lift<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.920> turn<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.700> use<00:01:33.060> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
continuing to lift and turn and I use a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.719 
continuing to lift and turn and I use a
knitting<00:01:34.080> needle<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.590> traditionally<00:01:35.580> you

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
knitting needle and traditionally you

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.480 
knitting needle and traditionally you
use<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> knitting<00:01:36.390> needle<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:37.920> use<00:01:38.250> a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
use a knitting needle you can use a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.280 
use a knitting needle you can use a
wooden<00:01:38.729> skewer<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.900> don't<00:01:40.080> have<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
wooden skewer if you don't have a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.609 
wooden skewer if you don't have a
knitting<00:01:40.500> needle<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:41.100> use<00:01:41.300> but<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:43.380> knitting

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
knitting needle to use but the knitting

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
knitting needle to use but the knitting
needle<00:01:43.860> works<00:01:44.040> better<00:01:44.369> because<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.149> dough

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
needle works better because the dough

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.350 
needle works better because the dough
doesn't<00:01:45.810> stick<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.909> much<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> does

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
doesn't stick to it as much as it does

00:01:48.360 --> 00:02:02.320 
doesn't stick to it as much as it does
to<00:01:48.659> ask<00:01:48.780> yer

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.400 

we<00:02:02.900> just<00:02:03.110> continue<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.770> turn<00:02:05.110> until<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:06.230> make

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
we just continue to turn until you make

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:56.220 
we just continue to turn until you make
this<00:02:06.880> complete<00:02:07.880> ball

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.710 

when<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:56.800> get<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:57.250> point<00:02:57.520> you<00:02:58.000> can<00:02:58.209> poke<00:02:58.540> it

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
when I get to this point you can poke it

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.949 
when I get to this point you can poke it
and<00:02:58.840> turn<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.709> put<00:02:59.830> it<00:02:59.920> face<00:03:00.160> down<00:03:00.430> or<00:03:00.959> open

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
and turn and put it face down or open

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.910 
and turn and put it face down or open
side<00:03:02.410> down<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.890> should<00:03:03.370> say<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:08.620> let<00:03:08.770> the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
side down I should say to let the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:17.550 
side down I should say to let the
remaining<00:03:09.340> batter<00:03:09.520> come<00:03:09.849> out

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:35.790 

then<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.400> let<00:03:18.550> it<00:03:18.580> sit<00:03:18.670> there<00:03:19.000> for<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.239> minute

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.050 

you<00:03:36.800> let<00:03:36.950> them<00:03:37.040> continue<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.580> cook<00:03:37.730> for<00:03:38.030> a

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
you let them continue to cook for a

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.750 
you let them continue to cook for a
couple<00:03:38.360> minutes<00:03:38.510> then<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:43.370> turn<00:03:43.520> them<00:03:43.670> you

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
couple minutes then to turn them you

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.540 
couple minutes then to turn them you
just<00:03:43.940> want<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.150> poke<00:03:44.330> them
