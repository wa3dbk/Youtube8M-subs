 naughty the most famous of the universe of 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.480

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.750
 the story coming back most often is 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.940
 this one the joker at the time called jack 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.409

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.239
 career 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.580
 alas for jack his project to be 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.379

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.299
 pregnant he was forced to ask 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.250
 help to one of the godfathers of the underworld 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.030

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.220
 financial 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.990
 he chooses the path of crime more by 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.290
 obligation only by choice and became 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.790

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.110
 robbing and what calms me down and fit 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.610
 wear jack the red hood the red hood 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.380
 is the scapegoat in a crime 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.969
 organized a bait that serves to make 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.060
 diversion to prepare the escape of 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.950
 henchmen shortly before burglaries 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.159
 each learns that his wife is dead and 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.600
 that the baby has not escaped 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.039
 Jack wants everything to stop going home 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.289
 to mourn the death of these families 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.479
 but maroni does not let go and the 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.039
 force to wear the red bull when the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.390
 police take the thugs to the fact 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.700
 in factories the shots 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.289
 burst and jack to wear the mask 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.759
 and avoid the shots loses 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.249
 balanced and falls into a tank of 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.380
 chemical products 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:57.880
 when it comes out jack exchange also 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.409
 physically good by his white complexion 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.539
 her green hair and her red lips 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.490
 that mentally by the manifestation 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.240
 a laugh when he realizes 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.819
 that he has lost everything 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.380
 thus jack single employee 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.670
 sinn became one of the biggest criminals 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.560
 who never existed 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.819
 this is the only true story of the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.819
 joker known to date 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:32.690
 isbergues and 4.6 me 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.680
 let's move on now to the personality of the 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.739
 joker and everything that made him the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.500
 most crazy criminal ever created a 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.359
 crazy man certainly but how is 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.760
 well to the point of destroying killed and stolen 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.780
 Just for fun 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.159
 do you realize the madness of 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.900
 this man he did not become a 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.689
 criminal for money or for the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.689
 power but just to have fun joker 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:00.389
 does not obey any rule or person 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:03.180
 even if there is one thing that motivates 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:05.200
 challenge again and again batman 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.150
 when flying joker we obviously think 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.909
 a clown and for that he has everything 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.620
 lafleur paraphernalia that sprinkle acid 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.680
 the electric handshake hammer 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.840
 shuriken cards the explosive box 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.500
 and especially its laughing gas leaving to 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.659
 his victims 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.250
 a frozen smile most of the time the 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.010
 joker is alone to accomplish his 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.349
 misdeeds but in 1992 in the series 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.879
 animated batman we saw harley appear 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.019
 quinn as well as yann who 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.500
 accompany him from time to time during 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.810
 of a crime 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.099
 the best way to describe the joker 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.109
 would be to talk about him as a man 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.669
 who has nothing to lose and that's it 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.229
 who made him the greatest criminal 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.229
 from the comics universe
