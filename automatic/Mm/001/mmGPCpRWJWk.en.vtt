00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.040
 the onion a vegetable forgotten the variety of 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.230
 lÃ©zignan was presented by 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.110
 xavier mathias at the plant festival of 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.059
 saint jean de beauregard 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.670
 for me she wants the onion and the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.800
 many varieties that make up his 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.240
 are really forgotten vegetables in 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.970
 the sense where now we will find on 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.949
 the displays a very small choice of a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.410
 varietal point of view this choice very 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.419
 reduced it has an impact and an impact on 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.410
 tastes and uses sire that the 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.219
 onions in the end there are 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.289
 a lot of different flavor and it's going 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.829
 to measure oneself often in degree of degree 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.870
 of strength 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.309
 and then there is a lot of use 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.199
 different there really are varieties 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.270
 which is going to be very suitable for 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.000
 raw consumption of others to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.920
 consumptions with to cook briefly 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.840
 and other islands that will support very 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.399
 easily very long cooking times 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.440
 and there really had to be a complaint 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.739
 different varieties to find 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.510
 one who is his characteristics 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.670
 really special organoleptic 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.670
 to be very sweet raw you can 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.130
 consume as its nature in salad and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.409
 which especially is adapted to a climate 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.270
 and insolent like ours so this one 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.650
 when I 'm going to discover I really 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.390
 really happy it's the one we're going 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.400
 produce in greater quantity all 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.079
 years because he has much more 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.829
 so this really really 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.020
 very present 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.820
 there is also that for this type of nyon and 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.860
 a relatively long conservation 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.119
 it's a bunion that wants to keep 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.590
 any case under the conditions in which 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.630
 you keep three or four months without 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.720
 difficulty which is fine for a 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.000
 very sweet onion and then that filled with 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.000
 it's an onion that has a nice caliber 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.890
 i.e. that there had there is 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.509
 Dance weight just so 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.549
 as are very very long cultures 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.409
 it's also interesting with a 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.319
 long land use 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.460
 to have a harvest weight in relation 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.289
 with the time we spent 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.969
 then there is only one 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.159
 difficulty trying to reckon with 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.409
 onions it's the smi it's a smic is 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.119
 a little bit delicate we end February 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.729
 so at a time when it's cold or that 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.959
 take off gently 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.369
 so I do not recommend doing it 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.319
 directly in the ground is 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.090
 that it's quite difficult and to do it 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.340
 simply enterin edged large 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.410
 polystyrene terrine of fish trays 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.910
 that we recover on the market that we wash 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.860
 well for not they stay from that 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.030
 in front of course and then we make a smi 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.510
 in terrine like that we arrive at the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.280
 control 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.560
 m allowed to seed all 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.150
 centimeters and when he lifted up 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.920
 that he reaches twenty or so 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.769
 centimeters high there we will be able 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.450
 prick them directly into place and 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.879
 after he'll have to be patient because 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.299
 that bulbs formation and very very 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.000
 long 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:39.540
 are we going to transplant more or less 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.060
 Easter will only be harvested when summer 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.040
 is already very much started then 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.910
 wait is not very difficult 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.560
 which is a little bit more difficult 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.750
 is that while one patient and well 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.120
 the grass grows in the onions so that 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.200
 request a lot of weeding but the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.200
 result is well worth it
