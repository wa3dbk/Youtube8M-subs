car subs and amplifier in your room with
just<00:00:11.880> an<00:00:12.090> Xbox<00:00:12.540> power<00:00:12.809> cord<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> drew<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.490> to

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
just an Xbox power cord so I drew it to

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.310 
just an Xbox power cord so I drew it to
scale<00:00:14.880> here<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.690> kind<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.960> put<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.199> in

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
scale here just to kind of put it in

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.349 
scale here just to kind of put it in
perspective<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.490> lot<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.880> guys<00:00:18.000> to

perspective and a lot of you guys to
actually<00:00:18.900> visually<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.529> how<00:00:20.180> everything

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
actually visually see how everything

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.830 
actually visually see how everything
works

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
works

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.840

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
really going to go into depth and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.710 
really going to go into depth and
freaking<00:00:25.859> stuff<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.310> don't<00:00:26.369> know<00:00:26.550> about<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.029> just

know that you took one where together
and<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.640> has<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> reaction<00:00:30.679> so<00:00:32.149> anyway<00:00:33.149> with

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
and that has a reaction so anyway with

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.790 
and that has a reaction so anyway with
the<00:00:33.390> Xbox<00:00:33.780> power<00:00:33.960> cords<00:00:34.380> we're<00:00:34.620> going<00:00:34.739> to

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the Xbox power cords we're going to

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.560

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
start off you're going to cut the end of

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.139 
start off you're going to cut the end of
it<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.690> plugs<00:00:37.020> into<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.440> Xbox<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.160> when<00:00:39.059> you

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
it that plugs into the Xbox and when you

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.459 
it that plugs into the Xbox and when you
cut<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.510> you're<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.870> see<00:00:40.050> all<00:00:40.230> these

crazy workers and now you're going to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.100 
crazy workers and now you're going to
want<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.989> split<00:00:43.320> them<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:44.280> look<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:45.110> now

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
want to split them to look like this now

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.869 
want to split them to look like this now
you're<00:00:46.620> going<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> red<00:00:47.309> blue<00:00:47.610> yellow

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
you're going to have a red blue yellow

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.600 
you're going to have a red blue yellow
and<00:00:48.539> black<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.739> you're<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.190> more

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and black now you're going to have more

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490 
and black now you're going to have more
black<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:50.969> more<00:00:51.390> yellow<00:00:51.750> than<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> red<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
black and more yellow than a red and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.889 
black and more yellow than a red and
blue<00:00:52.670> because<00:00:53.670> these<00:00:53.789> are<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.120> positive<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
blue because these are your positive and

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.639 
blue because these are your positive and
negative<00:00:55.559> wires<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:57.780> doesn't<00:00:58.140> matter

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
negative wires and it doesn't matter

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.349 
negative wires and it doesn't matter
about<00:00:58.829> quantity<00:00:59.489> as<00:00:59.699> long<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.090> they're<00:01:00.210> all

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
about quantity as long as they're all

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.630 
about quantity as long as they're all
the<00:01:00.539> same<00:01:00.570> color<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.980> I'll<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.250> cut<00:01:02.520> them

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the same color so I'll just cut them

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.119 
the same color so I'll just cut them
split<00:01:03.239> them<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.539> then<00:01:04.320> tie<00:01:04.799> them<00:01:04.949> together

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
split them and then tie them together

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.140 
split them and then tie them together
like<00:01:06.000> as<00:01:06.270> color<00:01:06.869> quantity<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.580> then<00:01:08.850> from

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
like as color quantity and then from

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.859 
like as color quantity and then from
there<00:01:09.740> your<00:01:10.740> black<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.420> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.630> your

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
there your black is going to be your

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.070 
there your black is going to be your
ground<00:01:13.189> your<00:01:14.189> yellow<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.790> going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.810> your

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
ground your yellow is going to be your

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.149 
ground your yellow is going to be your
positive<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.990> now<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> ground<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
positive and now for the ground or a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.130 
positive and now for the ground or a
remote<00:01:20.640> wire<00:01:20.850> you're<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.960> take<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
remote wire you're just going to take a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.140 
remote wire you're just going to take a
little<00:01:22.500> piece<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.920> wire<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.549> put<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.939> from<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
little piece of wire and put it from the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.020 
little piece of wire and put it from the
positive<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> remote<00:01:25.170> layer<00:01:25.520> now<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
positive to the remote layer now this is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.580 
positive to the remote layer now this is
not<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> blow<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.140> amp<00:01:28.470> or

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
not going to blow up your amp or

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.010 
not going to blow up your amp or
anything<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.159> because<00:01:29.880> your<00:01:30.840> remote

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
anything like that because your remote

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.060 
anything like that because your remote
wire<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:33.049> electricity<00:01:34.049> pulse<00:01:34.560> like

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
wire is just in electricity pulse like

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.580 
wire is just in electricity pulse like
it's<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> hand<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.290> turn<00:01:37.470> on

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
it's for the hand so when you turn on

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
it's for the hand so when you turn on
the<00:01:37.680> radio<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.280> sends<00:01:38.520> current<00:01:39.360> electricity

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the radio it sends current electricity

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.590 
the radio it sends current electricity
to<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:40.890> hand<00:01:41.250> telling<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.420> go

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
to your hand telling it you know it's go

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.580 
to your hand telling it you know it's go
time<00:01:42.630> let's<00:01:43.200> bump<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:44.750> if<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.110> hook<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
time let's bump so if you just hook the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.270 
time let's bump so if you just hook the
positive<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.970> radio<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:49.040> down<00:01:50.040> it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
positive and to the radio on down it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.450 
positive and to the radio on down it
will<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.610> when<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> limb<00:01:51.360> turns<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:52.460> and/or

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
will just when the limb turns on and/or

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.120 
will just when the limb turns on and/or
gets<00:01:53.729> power<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.450> radio<00:01:54.840> will<00:01:55.200> activate<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
gets power the radio will activate the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
red and blue you're going to hook it up

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.020 
red and blue you're going to hook it up
to<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.479> light<00:02:06.719> switch<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:08.879> know

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
to a light switch like that I don't know

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.880 
to a light switch like that I don't know
if<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.390> matters<00:02:09.539> which<00:02:09.959> side<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:10.530> plug

it in and then

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.610 
it in and then
you<00:02:12.170> just<00:02:12.380> flick<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.680> switch<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:14.560> here's<00:02:15.560> kind

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
you just flick the switch so here's kind

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.680 
you just flick the switch so here's kind
of<00:02:15.770> like<00:02:15.920> what<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.070> mean<00:02:16.280> now<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.330> kind<00:02:17.600> of

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
of like what I mean now this is kind of

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.630 
of like what I mean now this is kind of
something<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:18.080> was<00:02:18.170> going<00:02:18.380> into<00:02:18.500> depth<00:02:18.800> now

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
something I was going into depth now

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.010 
something I was going into depth now
these<00:02:19.790> aren't<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.120> right<00:02:20.270> wires<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.840> actually

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
these aren't the right wires I actually

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.650 
these aren't the right wires I actually
just<00:02:21.590> made<00:02:21.890> them<00:02:22.040> longer<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:23.030> then<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.450> can

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
just made them longer and then I can

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.980 
just made them longer and then I can
just<00:02:23.810> have<00:02:23.960> it<00:02:23.990> here<00:02:24.380> bing-bang<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.810> we're

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
just have it here bing-bang so we're

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.940 
just have it here bing-bang so we're
just<00:02:27.020> going<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.320> do<00:02:27.500> that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950
