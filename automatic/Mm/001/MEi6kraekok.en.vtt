00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.340
 hello to all of you guys 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.939
 brand new minecraft pocket video 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.730
 edition in this fifth episode of the 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.119
 rush to the net in the last episode 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.249
 we had built this little refuge 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.169
 really tiny help to pass the 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.419
 night even if we don't have a bed 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.099
 however details direct schedule of 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.399
 remove the difficulty because precisely 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.620
 it was a bit difficult with these mobs without 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.050
 nothing on that we have one 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.140
 beautiful nature but we have no food 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.149
 so here is a bit difficult we have 2 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.359
 carrots in these routes we will use them 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.280
 to do a little do as soon as you do 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.429
 day I wanted sheep for fra 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.800
 forklift but I think we will not use the 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.410
 sheep but the ranks because if not it 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.620
 you know the spiders killing and precisely 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.620
 will guide what to see in the end what 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.000
 I see that in the end malaga does not fall soon 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.100
 I swear it is a case they do n't spend it 2 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.180
 craft not turned to 15 rivals of 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.910
 stationary 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.830
 we didn't find a sheep one 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.260
 sheep but boys to be picked up immediately 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.970
 liters because I absolutely want it 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.090
 I hope to have some iron because otherwise 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.100
 of the smashed iron world of iron not 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.250
 they had one of iron 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.600
 kat hurricane that had opportunities 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.520
 shit you will touch will kill hand 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.170
 oh well let's be satisfied with this is then the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.240
 I 'll do it with spiders like I do 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.370
 said before in many I am sorry because 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.030
 we had all the ink between the bottom does 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.640
 to see 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.710
 we took it again it is another 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.350
 sheep is another sheep raga is another 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.060
 prepare the wolf the asshole a god 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.030
 boys found the sheep to god 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.640
 I am delighted with more more stronza than 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.590
 perfect shit we already have two pieces 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.750
 I thought I couldn't find it but here they are 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.820
 here with the last sheep at least the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.350
 The next night we we 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.530
 move on 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.830
 in bed, sleeping obviously dies 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.590
 money please me here we have perfect 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.270
 bed was a case I really was 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.310
 totally happy because at least 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.030
 we can sleep in a bed in the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.459
 next night 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.670
 then this episode but races there 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.470
 we can take some glass but or 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.300
 start making a farm even if there 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.900
 I see difficult in the bio but of the snow 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.569
 but we will make it perfect then me 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.489
 kraft just a shovel but in the end i'm 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.569
 more and more to build 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.670
 obviously apple write in the comments 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.680
 because I'm always here to build 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.569
 build build that read the way 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.730
 tart we put down a black we can 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.130
 sleeping a I do on the glass from 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.400
 the less we have a home we can blankets 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.650
 see out if they are monsters there 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.090
 they break I do it only for this reason 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.090
 for it was really hard 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.030
 ok had collected enough I think 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.830
 then we put it to cook with the 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.780
 our coal that I had found in the 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.390
 first episodes then we put here the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.730
 our beautiful sand the cross must 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.180
 everything is a piece of coal because 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:19.510
 is worth 2 Greek of si cuoce we remove 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.510
 deferment we create cool balls 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.820
 think society so much 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.220
 superficially this house I left 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.540
 to that original floor on earth 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.120
 under at least tonight when Milan 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.100
 we could also set the scoop that is 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.640
 a right thing because maybe one of you 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.430
 might think this of hardcore 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.170
 shit or for on the door but because I was 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.320
 saying it's not a hard core if I don't die 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.209
 It does nothing but precisely in a rush towards 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.790
 perfect heather with we also have 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.459
 put the bed there is the floor below 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.560
 better you can't tell me anything 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.880
 really beautiful our home 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.269
 then to the turn that always turns you around 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.819
 here build i'm fine we put hand to 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.250
 save 20 because they are already few there 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.319
 we do marveaux so we save or 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.650
 at least I want the glass from then 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.150
 no less here do a little thought 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.780
 as it is turning to the incipit hate said 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.030
 that I see it difficult to make a farm 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.650
 of the biome of the 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.609
 snow because in fact if not 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.380
 you know 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.110
 water in this ice and biomass 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.600
 therefore a little difficult to create 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.660
 plantations that front as you have seen 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.710
 we have this pond that we find yes 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.479
 creates water for each time it freezes 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.180
 therefore we will provide to put some 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.990
 twists everything around what this does not 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.430
 will happen again 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.620
 creates an impromptu cramped hunger for 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.960
 to make ours put our 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.580
 carrots will happen because we will find in 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.539
 around moving to recover ours 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.680
 hearts 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.160
 ok let's type the dna map 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.810
 little girl for now also tells us three 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.560
 jacko yes there is a place but create one 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.300
 hoe just to do for you to do 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.889
 obviously all our carrots 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.340
 other stuff we will find around for 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.169
 world also defined at 1 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:14.539
 so many that we know reigns 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:17.050
 around, however, we put a water in 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.979
 a water and that seed we will admit 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.760
 we put all our things 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.590
 around 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.360
 we will see now that they will grow there adult 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.320
 will put quite a bit though I think that 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.360
 in the next titles we will go to 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.919
 collect bones to take a 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.340
 dog because I want all the costs 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.110
 so I hope for this episode 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.430
 reached this video of belen us there 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.430
 we see a passion says
