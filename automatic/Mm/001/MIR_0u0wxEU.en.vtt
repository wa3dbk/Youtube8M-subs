here<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.860> was<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.219> awesome<00:00:53.430> chapter

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
here it was a really awesome chapter

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.540 
here it was a really awesome chapter
some<00:00:54.600> other<00:00:54.960> theories<00:00:55.559> about<00:00:55.949> who<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> person

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
some other theories about who the person

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
some other theories about who the person
is<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.449> through<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> note<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.170> chopper<00:00:58.620> I

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
is that through the note at chopper I

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.400 
is that through the note at chopper I
said<00:00:59.190> Monet<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.940> still<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.079> could<00:01:01.289> be

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
said Monet I still think that could be

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.900 
said Monet I still think that could be
true<00:01:01.680> some<00:01:02.160> people<00:01:02.399> said<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> could<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.850> been

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
true some people said it could have been

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.810 
true some people said it could have been
law<00:01:03.180> using<00:01:03.629> his<00:01:03.899> powers<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.710> don't<00:01:05.369> think<00:01:05.460> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
law using his powers I don't think so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.700 
law using his powers I don't think so
that'd<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.630> kind<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.869> weird<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.439> people

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that'd be kind of weird and some people

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.310 
that'd be kind of weird and some people
said<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.950> could<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.189> Kenan<00:01:08.369> mon-sun<00:01:09.090> which<00:01:10.049> is

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
said it could be Kenan mon-sun which is

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.719 
said it could be Kenan mon-sun which is
possible<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.890> don't<00:01:11.040> know<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.250> he's<00:01:11.430> with<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
possible we don't know if he's with the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.520 
possible we don't know if he's with the
other<00:01:11.760> kids<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.900> some<00:01:13.080> people<00:01:13.290> said<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
other kids or not or some people said it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.140 
other kids or not or some people said it
could<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.740> lost<00:01:14.070> crew<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> heart<00:01:14.790> pirates

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
could be lost crew the heart pirates

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.670 
could be lost crew the heart pirates
they<00:01:15.299> could<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.600> somewhere<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.259> don't<00:01:16.590> really

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
they could be somewhere I don't really

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.590 
they could be somewhere I don't really
think<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.340> still<00:01:17.850> am<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.509> with

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
think so I still am going to go with

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.870 
think so I still am going to go with
Monet<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.799> some<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> broker<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:20.729> we

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
Monet so we see some of the broker as we

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.210 
Monet so we see some of the broker as we
see<00:01:21.150> Peckham's<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.840> Tom<00:01:22.020> ago<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.590> full<00:01:22.920> it's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
see Peckham's and Tom ago in full it's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.429 
see Peckham's and Tom ago in full it's
confirmed<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.689> lucci<00:01:25.140> again

there's<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.520> no<00:01:26.790> doubt<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.299> him

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
there's really no doubt that it's him

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.440 
there's really no doubt that it's him
now<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.930> mean<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:29.009> definitely<00:01:29.220> Lucci<00:01:30.000> he's

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.340 
under the mask it looks kind of weird
I'm<00:01:36.299> pretty<00:01:36.570> sure<00:01:36.720> he<00:01:36.810> didn't<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.170> that

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
I'm pretty sure he didn't have that

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.380 
I'm pretty sure he didn't have that
before<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.729> don't<00:01:38.729> remember<00:01:38.880> all<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> details

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
before I don't remember all the details

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.030 
before I don't remember all the details
and<00:01:39.720> he<00:01:39.840> has<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.110> these<00:01:40.200> metal<00:01:40.619> things<00:01:40.650> on

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and he has like these metal things on

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.109 
and he has like these metal things on
his<00:01:41.130> wrists<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:41.850> he<00:01:41.909> had<00:01:42.000> those

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
his wrists I don't think he had those

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.149 
his wrists I don't think he had those
before<00:01:42.299> either<00:01:42.619> don't<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.649> what<00:01:44.009> that's

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
before either don't know what that's

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.630 
before either don't know what that's
about<00:01:44.399> maybe<00:01:45.439> he<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.619> hurt<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.159> don't<00:01:47.340> know<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
about maybe he got hurt I don't know and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.910 
about maybe he got hurt I don't know and
we<00:01:47.970> finally<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.509> good<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.930> kid<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.380> full

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
we finally get a good like a kid in full

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.499 
we finally get a good like a kid in full
it<00:01:50.399> looks<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> picture<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.329> was

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
it looks just like the picture that was

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.350 
it looks just like the picture that was
released<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> year<00:01:52.770> ago<00:01:52.920> he's<00:01:53.850> got<00:01:54.030> scars

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
released like a year ago he's got scars

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.670 
released like a year ago he's got scars
all<00:01:54.540> over<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.810> left<00:01:54.960> side<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.229> his<00:01:55.290> face<00:01:55.380> his

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
all over the left side of his face his

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.990 
all over the left side of his face his
hairs<00:01:55.890> long<00:01:56.040> he's<00:01:56.250> got<00:01:56.369> some<00:01:56.490> scars<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.880> his

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
hairs long he's got some scars on his

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.719 
hairs long he's got some scars on his
right<00:01:57.180> arm<00:01:57.360> too<00:01:57.649> he's<00:01:58.649> left<00:01:58.890> arms<00:01:59.219> entirely

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
right arm too he's left arms entirely

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.850 
right arm too he's left arms entirely
mechanical<00:01:59.880> he<00:02:00.810> could<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.320> covering<00:02:01.770> it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
mechanical he could just be covering it

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.260 
mechanical he could just be covering it
with<00:02:01.890> metal<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.490> don't<00:02:02.700> think<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.090> i<00:02:03.119> think

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
with metal but I don't think so i think

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.539 
with metal but I don't think so i think
he<00:02:03.600> lost<00:02:03.810> his<00:02:04.140> left<00:02:04.320> arm<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.399> now

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
he lost his left arm and is now

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.059 
he lost his left arm and is now
replacing<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.329> metal<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.890> what's

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
replacing it with metal and what's

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.219 
replacing it with metal and what's
interesting<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:09.690> think<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.020> would<00:02:10.140> be

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
interesting is you think that would be

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.470 
interesting is you think that would be
distracting<00:02:10.950> during<00:02:11.400> battle<00:02:11.879> because<00:02:12.360> like

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
distracting during battle because like

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.910 
distracting during battle because like
he'd<00:02:12.599> be<00:02:12.750> fighting<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:13.680> to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
he'd be fighting and have to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.100 
he'd be fighting and have to
you<00:02:13.980> know<00:02:14.069> use<00:02:14.280> his<00:02:14.430> magnetism<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.120> stuff<00:02:15.360> but

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
you know use his magnetism and stuff but

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.839 
you know use his magnetism and stuff but
at<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.380> same<00:02:16.620> time<00:02:16.890> he<00:02:17.190> would<00:02:17.340> also<00:02:17.520> have<00:02:17.790> to

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
at the same time he would also have to

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.720 
at the same time he would also have to
be<00:02:18.120> constantly<00:02:18.569> using<00:02:19.349> his<00:02:19.560> power<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:20.160> keep

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
be constantly using his power to keep

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.940 
be constantly using his power to keep
that<00:02:20.970> stuff<00:02:21.300> connected<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.930> his<00:02:22.080> arm<00:02:22.290> you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
that stuff connected to his arm you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.320 
that stuff connected to his arm you
think<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.220> would<00:02:23.310> get<00:02:23.459> distracting<00:02:24.000> during

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
think that would get distracting during

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.630 
think that would get distracting during
battle<00:02:24.709> that's<00:02:25.709> kind<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.010> interesting<00:02:26.250> I

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
battle that's kind of interesting I

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.050 
battle that's kind of interesting I
don't<00:02:27.390> know<00:02:27.739> but<00:02:28.739> we<00:02:29.160> find<00:02:29.370> out<00:02:29.489> some<00:02:29.700> bounties

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060

don't know but we find out some bounties
kids<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:31.190> 470<00:02:32.190> million<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.989> imagine<00:02:34.410> it's

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
kids it's 470 million so I imagine it's

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.650 
kids it's 470 million so I imagine it's
harder<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.190> raise<00:02:35.700> your<00:02:35.940> bounty<00:02:36.300> in<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> new

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
harder to raise your bounty in the new

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.630 
harder to raise your bounty in the new
world<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.230> harder<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.890> get<00:02:38.100> through<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.489> you

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
world it's harder to get through it you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.100 
world it's harder to get through it you
have<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.910> do<00:02:39.000> much<00:02:39.209> bigger<00:02:39.450> thing<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.080> I

have to do much bigger thing so I

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.229 
have to do much bigger thing so I
understand<00:02:40.709> but<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.519> think<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.819> luffy

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
understand but to think that luffy

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.800 
understand but to think that luffy
hasn't<00:02:42.630> done<00:02:42.720> anything<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.440> his<00:02:43.980> wind-up<00:02:44.810> you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.330 
but i think it's always looked like that
I<00:03:09.930> think<00:03:10.049> he<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:10.290> always<00:03:10.620> had<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> weird<00:03:11.130> nose

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
I think he just always had a weird nose

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.690 
I think he just always had a weird nose
so<00:03:11.940> yeah<00:03:12.350> 320<00:03:13.350> million<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:13.860> Luffy's<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.459> still

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
so yeah 320 million so Luffy's is still

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.390 
so yeah 320 million so Luffy's is still
higher<00:03:15.480> than<00:03:15.510> most<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.620> them<00:03:16.709> apparently<00:03:16.980> even

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
higher than most of them apparently even

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.470 
higher than most of them apparently even
though<00:03:17.519> he<00:03:17.610> hasn't<00:03:17.760> been<00:03:17.910> doing<00:03:17.970> anything<00:03:18.120> and

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
though he hasn't been doing anything and

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.390 
though he hasn't been doing anything and
they<00:03:18.630> were<00:03:18.720> going<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.930> form<00:03:19.109> an<00:03:19.200> alliance

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
they were going to form an alliance

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.009 
they were going to form an alliance
another<00:03:20.400> supernova<00:03:21.030> alliance<00:03:21.480> those<00:03:21.720> three

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
another supernova alliance those three

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.509 
another supernova alliance those three
maybe<00:03:22.260> those<00:03:22.470> three<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.130> two<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.400> we

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
maybe those three and the two that we

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.670 
maybe those three and the two that we
have<00:03:23.760> could<00:03:24.299> make<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> bigger<00:03:24.750> one<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.200> they're

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
have could make a bigger one but they're

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.160 
have could make a bigger one but they're
not<00:03:25.799> really<00:03:25.950> getting<00:03:26.160> along<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:27.150> who<00:03:27.959> knows

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
not really getting along but who knows

let's<00:03:51.840> do<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.609> that<00:03:53.609> was<00:03:53.700> actually<00:03:53.820> really

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
let's do it that was actually really

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.370 
let's do it that was actually really
good<00:03:54.269> touch<00:03:54.450> than<00:03:54.660> my<00:03:54.780> knuckles<00:03:55.079> cracked<00:03:55.290> I

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
good touch than my knuckles cracked I

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.599 
good touch than my knuckles cracked I
wasn't<00:03:55.620> sure<00:03:55.709> if<00:03:55.799> they<00:03:55.920> would<00:03:56.040> but<00:03:56.310> yeah<00:03:56.430> that

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
wasn't sure if they would but yeah that

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.030 
wasn't sure if they would but yeah that
was<00:03:56.700> nice<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.450> yeah<00:03:58.079> he's<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.500> had<00:03:58.739> some

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
was nice and yeah he's like I had some

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.520 
was nice and yeah he's like I had some
chains<00:03:59.519> some<00:04:00.359> regular<00:04:00.750> chains<00:04:01.049> hidden<00:04:01.440> all

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
chains some regular chains hidden all

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.740 
chains some regular chains hidden all
around<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.980> lab<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.850> switch<00:04:03.090> them<00:04:03.299> in<00:04:03.420> case<00:04:03.600> I

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
around the lab to switch them in case I

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.170 
around the lab to switch them in case I
needed<00:04:03.959> to<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.410> then<00:04:04.680> he<00:04:04.769> just<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.370> guess<00:04:06.000> he'd

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
needed to and then he just I guess he'd

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.300 
needed to and then he just I guess he'd
like<00:04:06.390> picks<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.019> locks<00:04:07.260> on<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.829> other<00:04:07.980> chains

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
like picks the locks on the other chains

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.120 
like picks the locks on the other chains
because<00:04:08.579> you<00:04:09.450> can't<00:04:09.660> really<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:10.230> cut<00:04:10.620> Cairo

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
because you can't really just cut Cairo

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.849 
because you can't really just cut Cairo
second<00:04:11.519> ormally<00:04:12.000> can't<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.690> so<00:04:13.350> I<00:04:13.380> don't<00:04:13.650> know

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
second ormally can't you so I don't know

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.920 
second ormally can't you so I don't know
I<00:04:14.100> guess<00:04:14.400> he<00:04:14.670> just<00:04:14.700> figures<00:04:15.420> out<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.569> way<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.780> get

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
I guess he just figures out a way to get

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.240 
I guess he just figures out a way to get
them<00:04:16.079> off<00:04:16.229> of<00:04:16.289> them<00:04:16.470> but<00:04:16.560> he<00:04:16.650> gets<00:04:16.950> them<00:04:17.100> off<00:04:17.220> of

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
them off of them but he gets them off of

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.800 
them off of them but he gets them off of
them<00:04:17.489> which<00:04:17.639> is<00:04:17.760> good<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:19.820> luffy<00:04:20.820> he<00:04:21.479> leaves

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
them which is good and luffy he leaves

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.380 
them which is good and luffy he leaves
the<00:04:22.109> cage<00:04:22.409> at<00:04:22.770> him<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.099> Robin<00:04:23.550> leave<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:24.120> cage

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
the cage at him and Robin leave the cage

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.839 
the cage at him and Robin leave the cage
that<00:04:24.810> was<00:04:24.960> weird<00:04:25.409> I<00:04:25.680> don't<00:04:26.550> know<00:04:26.640> what<00:04:26.820> that

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
that was weird I don't know what that

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:27.590 
that was weird I don't know what that
was<00:04:27.180> about

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
was about

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.870 
was about
like<00:04:28.260> why<00:04:28.680> did<00:04:28.920> you<00:04:29.040> leave<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.370> cage<00:04:29.580> stop

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
like why did you leave the cage stop

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.760 
like why did you leave the cage stop
acting<00:04:30.360> on<00:04:30.510> your<00:04:30.690> own<00:04:30.870> maybe<00:04:31.530> that's

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
acting on your own maybe that's

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.170 
acting on your own maybe that's
foreshadowing<00:04:32.040> that<00:04:32.550> luffy<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:32.970> going<00:04:33.120> to

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
foreshadowing that luffy is going to

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.120 
foreshadowing that luffy is going to
keep<00:04:33.360> messing<00:04:33.810> up<00:04:33.960> over<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.440> over<00:04:34.500> again<00:04:34.770> I

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
keep messing up over and over again I

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.360 
keep messing up over and over again I
don't<00:04:35.760> know<00:04:36.170> and<00:04:37.170> it<00:04:37.590> just<00:04:37.620> shows<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:38.010> law

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
don't know and it just shows that law

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.830 
don't know and it just shows that law
really<00:04:38.820> has<00:04:39.090> had<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:39.390> planned<00:04:39.660> all<00:04:39.780> along

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
really has had this planned all along

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.870 
really has had this planned all along
because<00:04:40.230> even<00:04:40.560> kid<00:04:41.010> who<00:04:41.220> was<00:04:41.370> watching<00:04:41.580> he's

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
because even kid who was watching he's

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.490 
because even kid who was watching he's
like<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.090> thought<00:04:42.360> law<00:04:42.570> just<00:04:42.810> became<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.080> dog<00:04:43.320> at

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
like I thought law just became a dog at
