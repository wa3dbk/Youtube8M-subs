00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
to start with I think on a wedding it's

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.770 
to start with I think on a wedding it's
nice<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:58.950> photographer

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.060 
nice just to have one photographer
because<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.289> think<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.859> little

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
because I think it's a little

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.410 
because I think it's a little
overwhelming<00:02:02.579> otherwise<00:02:02.909> with<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.240> guests

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
overwhelming otherwise with the guests

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.020 
overwhelming otherwise with the guests
of<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.170> know<00:02:04.289> people<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> stepping
