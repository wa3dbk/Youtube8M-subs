00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.040
 welcome to 2014 mobiliar the lenovo 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.959
 Mix 2 got in the 11 inch 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.460
 version there are also in 10 inches 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:11.849
 you can also do that in our channel 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.740
 we can see we have a look 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.210
 notebook similar to his but then all 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.740
 especially here, of course, the level 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.880
 that you can just do the tablet for her 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.040
 may look similar to what we for 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.880
 service actually know but I show 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.940
 Just a few more 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.260
 Uses here for the device 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.400
 which of course is wonderful here 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.940
 Keyboard then operated accordingly 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.890
 can be 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.900
 in windows 8 a full-fledged windows 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.700
 8 and 1 system and we have too 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.920
 premium car here with it and one 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.060
 big space supposedly look 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.980
 us equal time to pointing to the 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.590
 access desktop and then we see 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.900
 here actually only 50 gb legal 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.770
 are displayed 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.900
 So we just agreed 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:54.780
 flash memory in it connection moderately but 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:58.079
 once in the hdmi with high tension 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.840
 and a sim card and micro sd card 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.390
 slide-and a small flap a 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.390
 speakers and on and off switch 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.560
 let's see where we percent to page 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.570
 meet once a 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.640
 find speakers and a small logo 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.620
 it's because of the audi and louder 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.980
 warriors up here have the air here 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.290
 inside and very special here too 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.910
 powerful hardware like me same 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.990
 can show if I'm here 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.420
 call up settings 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.700
 because we have an intel core i5 in it 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.100
 the 42 02 y series with 1 gbyte ram and 16 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.930
 heartily adjusted the keyboard nicely 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.220
 very minimalist nice big 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.900
 trackpad with sometime right 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.300
 maustaste no shift one 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.190
 We can work out the whole time 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.930
 and down and you can do that 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.160
 take a notebook with you because everyone 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.620
 very nice my work is done constantly 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.720
 that we can see so too with 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.940
 the logo a slightly cool device that 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.410
 me two a webcam is out with it 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.030
 as well as inside the same time, we still 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.010
 even the museums are still a 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.810
 usb connection according to here at the 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.460
 Doctor on where we have an external to 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.580
 example can connect and on the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.990
 side still a power connection where then 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.700
 but the whole thing can be charged 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.160
 I think may once said power connection 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.420
 also directly on the usb too 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.730
 So it's going to be used 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.500
 the device loaded by usb but then synonymous 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.850
 accordingly, as an influx that can 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.590
 actually used a very 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.050
 nice gimmick I think this here 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.990
 is a small one 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:28.230
 fan or holes for the fan 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.330
 on the side we do not see me talking 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.990
 think a bottom should be here 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.460
 also had to be from the mix 2 and 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.300
 the interesting becomes at the same time that 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.300
 open all here 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.260
 like a notebook, it's always that 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.540
 Not even that way 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.790
 incidentally also use a lift is 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.650
 no problem we can here the tablet 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.450
 also put it in the opposite direction and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.159
 accordingly in the plane to 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.230
 Example use to watch movies so 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.349
 actually something like the flex just with 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.239
 a display what you can do as 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.620
 actually a very cool design here 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.109
 from the logo at the bottom here 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.290
 By the way, of course, only the dock 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.290
 connection 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.160
 stems in and try again 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:16.280
 the camera briefly from rheda the quality 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:18.170
 I'm calling the light too 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.300
 short out then she sees it that way too 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.180
 nice fast is the quality has around 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.130
 We definitely also have four films 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.820
 can or can turn 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.820
 we look at both 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.110
 there we find too 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.300
 back again 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.090
 There also find a very nice 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.890
 quality speed fits that too 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.290
 far but the focus could be something 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.000
 be faster that many you can see 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.670
 now in the video that i see in 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.709
 my eye not and yes that's it 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.860
 already with the very short hands on 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.390
 display where me two on the ces 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.010
 was presented 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.110
 financially watched my name is 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.930
 alaska and from february it becomes one 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.170
 start price of 599 us dollars 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.170
