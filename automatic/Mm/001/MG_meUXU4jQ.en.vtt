00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
shots and zoomed in a lot just sort of

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.679 
shots and zoomed in a lot just sort of
the<00:01:10.710> focus<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.250> image<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.330> perma

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
the focus of the image is on this perma

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.149 
the focus of the image is on this perma
scene<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.110> still<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> little<00:01:13.409> bit<00:01:13.770> blurry

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
scene so it's still a little bit blurry

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.980 
scene so it's still a little bit blurry
we<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> good<00:01:15.299> look<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.689> though<00:01:15.840> from

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
we can get a good look at it though from

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.050 
we can get a good look at it though from
several<00:01:16.380> angles<00:01:16.640> unfortunately<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> actual

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
several angles unfortunately the actual

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.210 
several angles unfortunately the actual
logo<00:01:18.330> which<00:01:19.049> tends<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.560> show<00:01:19.740> off<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.070> give<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
logo which tends to show off and give a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.890 
logo which tends to show off and give a
big<00:01:20.460> hint<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> what<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> perk<00:01:21.509> actually

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
big hint as to what the perk actually

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.690 
big hint as to what the perk actually
does<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> very<00:01:22.320> very<00:01:22.830> blurry<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:23.340> it's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
does is very very blurry because it's

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.390 
does is very very blurry because it's
such<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> small<00:01:24.390> portion<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.710> actual

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
such a small portion of the actual

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.460 
such a small portion of the actual
screen<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.330> if<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.540> guys<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.720> any<00:01:27.990> ideas

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
very first black ops 2 map pack it's a

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.200 
very first black ops 2 map pack it's a
fun<00:04:40.320> map<00:04:40.620> it's<00:04:40.950> gonna<00:04:41.130> be<00:04:41.310> a<00:04:41.340> small<00:04:41.580> compact

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
fun map it's gonna be a small compact

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.480 
fun map it's gonna be a small compact
map<00:04:42.570> it's<00:04:43.080> gonna<00:04:43.200> be<00:04:43.320> really<00:04:43.560> fast-paced<00:04:44.040> I

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
map it's gonna be really fast-paced I

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.790 
map it's gonna be really fast-paced I
really<00:04:45.090> really<00:04:45.330> liked<00:04:45.630> grind<00:04:46.139> from<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.590> very

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
first black ops 2 map packs I'm hoping

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.180 
first black ops 2 map packs I'm hoping
this<00:04:49.020> one<00:04:49.200> is<00:04:49.320> going<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.650> be<00:04:49.710> just<00:04:50.040> as

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
this one is going to be just as

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
saw the paper bags in the center of the

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.110 
saw the paper bags in the center of the
map<00:04:55.590> there<00:04:55.800> they<00:04:55.980> can't<00:04:56.280> be<00:04:56.400> burst<00:04:56.669> they<00:04:56.910> can't

map there they can't be burst they can't

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.340 
map there they can't be burst they can't
be<00:04:57.240> destroyed<00:04:57.570> they're<00:04:57.870> just<00:04:58.020> there<00:04:58.169> for

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
be destroyed they're just there for

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.620 
be destroyed they're just there for
aesthetic<00:04:58.800> reasons<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.250> to<00:04:59.610> act<00:04:59.790> as<00:04:59.970> cover

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
aesthetic reasons and to act as cover

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.350 
aesthetic reasons and to act as cover
the<00:05:00.990> third<00:05:01.230> map<00:05:01.470> is<00:05:01.800> Cove<00:05:02.280> and<00:05:02.580> this<00:05:02.820> is<00:05:03.120> an

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
the third map is Cove and this is an

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.840 
the third map is Cove and this is an
island<00:05:03.930> map<00:05:04.230> it's<00:05:04.530> got<00:05:04.680> a<00:05:04.710> crashed<00:05:05.130> plane<00:05:05.400> on

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
island map it's got a crashed plane on

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.850 
island map it's got a crashed plane on
it<00:05:05.970> sort<00:05:06.450> of<00:05:06.480> a<00:05:06.570> plane<00:05:06.840> part<00:05:07.169> scattered<00:05:07.740> across

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
it sort of a plane part scattered across

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.070 
it sort of a plane part scattered across
the<00:05:08.070> map<00:05:08.430> there<00:05:08.880> are<00:05:09.000> lots<00:05:09.180> of<00:05:09.330> corners<00:05:09.900> I

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
the map there are lots of corners I

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.970 
the map there are lots of corners I
think<00:05:10.230> running<00:05:10.380> around<00:05:10.530> with<00:05:10.710> a<00:05:10.740> submachine

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
think running around with a submachine

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.470 
think running around with a submachine
gun<00:05:11.340> will<00:05:11.430> be<00:05:11.520> good<00:05:11.640> but<00:05:11.940> there's<00:05:12.150> also<00:05:12.330> lots

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
gun will be good but there's also lots

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.780 
gun will be good but there's also lots
of<00:05:12.660> places<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:13.169> hide<00:05:13.380> up<00:05:13.710> high<00:05:14.250> with<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.490> sniper

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
of places to hide up high with a sniper

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.220 
of places to hide up high with a sniper
it's<00:05:15.120> gonna<00:05:15.210> be<00:05:15.330> interesting<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:15.840> see<00:05:16.020> how

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
it's gonna be interesting to see how

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.830 
it's gonna be interesting to see how
this<00:05:16.410> map<00:05:16.620> plays<00:05:17.190> out<00:05:17.400> this<00:05:17.640> isn't<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.270> remade

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
this map plays out this isn't a remade

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.110 
this map plays out this isn't a remade
map<00:05:19.140> but<00:05:19.710> it<00:05:19.979> did<00:05:20.190> remind<00:05:20.400> me<00:05:20.700> very<00:05:20.729> much<00:05:20.970> of

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
map but it did remind me very much of

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.900 
map but it did remind me very much of
the<00:05:21.360> look<00:05:21.600> and<00:05:21.840> feel<00:05:22.140> of<00:05:22.200> a<00:05:22.470> coastal<00:05:23.010> area<00:05:23.160> from

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
the look and feel of a coastal area from

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.510 
the look and feel of a coastal area from
the<00:05:24.060> black<00:05:24.270> ops<00:05:24.479> 1<00:05:24.810> map<00:05:25.110> crisis<00:05:25.950> if<00:05:26.160> you<00:05:26.310> guys

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
the black ops 1 map crisis if you guys

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.159 
the black ops 1 map crisis if you guys
remember<00:05:26.820> that<00:05:27.000> maybe<00:05:27.330> you<00:05:27.570> guys<00:05:27.720> thought<00:05:27.990> of

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
remember that maybe you guys thought of

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.810 
remember that maybe you guys thought of
the<00:05:28.260> same<00:05:28.470> thing<00:05:28.710> as<00:05:28.830> well<00:05:29.040> I<00:05:29.220> think<00:05:29.460> this<00:05:29.669> can

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
the same thing as well I think this can

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.700 
the same thing as well I think this can
be<00:05:29.850> a<00:05:29.910> really<00:05:30.090> interesting<00:05:30.240> map<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:31.050> play<00:05:31.260> you

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
be a really interesting map to play you

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.070 
be a really interesting map to play you
can<00:05:31.919> climb<00:05:32.190> up<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.790> plane<00:05:33.150> parts<00:05:33.630> and<00:05:33.870> use

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
can climb up the plane parts and use

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.409 
can climb up the plane parts and use
that<00:05:34.290> as<00:05:34.500> a<00:05:34.530> sort<00:05:35.130> of<00:05:35.160> high<00:05:35.430> line-of-sight<00:05:36.120> to

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
that as a sort of high line-of-sight to

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.000 
that as a sort of high line-of-sight to
shoot<00:05:36.720> people<00:05:37.110> that<00:05:37.260> may<00:05:37.440> be<00:05:37.500> running<00:05:37.800> around

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
shoot people that may be running around

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.680 
shoot people that may be running around
it's<00:05:38.580> gonna<00:05:38.700> be<00:05:38.820> interesting<00:05:39.090> I<00:05:39.330> can't<00:05:39.570> wait

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
it's gonna be interesting I can't wait

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.090 
it's gonna be interesting I can't wait
to<00:05:39.780> see<00:05:39.930> how<00:05:40.110> this<00:05:40.290> map<00:05:40.500> plays<00:05:40.770> I'm<00:05:41.010> gonna

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
to see how this map plays I'm gonna

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.650 
to see how this map plays I'm gonna
probably<00:05:41.430> jump<00:05:41.789> into<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.090> submachine<00:05:42.479> gun

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
probably jump into the submachine gun

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.600 
probably jump into the submachine gun
first<00:05:42.960> and<00:05:43.200> then<00:05:43.620> see<00:05:43.890> how<00:05:44.100> it<00:05:44.220> goes<00:05:44.400> from

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
first and then see how it goes from

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.060 
first and then see how it goes from
there<00:05:44.850> and<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.360> final<00:05:45.780> map<00:05:45.930> is<00:05:46.110> detour<00:05:46.770> I'm

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
there and the final map is detour I'm

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.070 
there and the final map is detour I'm
not<00:05:47.340> too<00:05:47.669> excited<00:05:47.850> about<00:05:48.390> this<00:05:48.600> one<00:05:48.840> it<00:05:49.050> looks

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
not too excited about this one it looks

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.560 
not too excited about this one it looks
a<00:05:49.470> bit<00:05:49.500> weird<00:05:49.680> it's<00:05:50.190> got<00:05:50.310> a<00:05:50.340> huge<00:05:50.640> bridge<00:05:51.090> you

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
a bit weird it's got a huge bridge you

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.840 
a bit weird it's got a huge bridge you
can<00:05:51.720> go<00:05:51.930> both<00:05:52.200> under<00:05:52.680> the<00:05:52.770> bridge<00:05:52.979> and<00:05:53.190> over

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
can go both under the bridge and over

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.240 
can go both under the bridge and over
the<00:05:53.940> bridge<00:05:54.060> it<00:05:54.360> looks<00:05:54.600> like<00:05:54.870> very<00:05:55.320> sort<00:05:56.220> of

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
the bridge it looks like very sort of

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.550 
the bridge it looks like very sort of
compared<00:05:56.880> to<00:05:57.180> linear<00:05:57.450> fighting<00:05:58.229> I<00:05:58.320> think<00:05:58.470> it's

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
compared to linear fighting I think it's
