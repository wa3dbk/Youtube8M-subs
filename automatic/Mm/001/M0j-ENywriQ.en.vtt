the<00:00:02.310> actual<00:00:02.929> fertilization<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.230> embryo

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
the actual fertilization of the embryo

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.710 
the actual fertilization of the embryo
takes<00:00:05.190> place<00:00:05.549> in<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.940> fallopian<00:00:06.240> tube

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
takes place in the fallopian tube

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.870 
takes place in the fallopian tube
usually<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:08.090> then<00:00:09.090> after<00:00:09.960> several<00:00:10.920> cell

divisions the blastocyst then implants
within<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.609> uterus<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:20.210> you<00:00:21.210> could<00:00:21.420> probably

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
within the uterus and you could probably

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.380 
within the uterus and you could probably
instantly<00:00:22.529> recognize<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.519> tissue<00:00:23.789> here<00:00:24.180> as

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
I would like to tell you something else

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.770 
I would like to tell you something else
as<00:02:57.700> well<00:02:57.730> if<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:59.380> actually<00:02:59.650> look<00:03:00.220> at<00:03:00.780> the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
as well if you actually look at the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.930 
as well if you actually look at the
nuclei<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:03.069> decidua<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:05.620> can<00:03:05.830> be<00:03:06.010> very<00:03:06.370> very

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
nuclei of decidua you can be very very

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.240 
nuclei of decidua you can be very very
scared<00:03:07.540> because<00:03:08.290> even<00:03:08.620> though<00:03:08.769> there's<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.040> lot

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
scared because even though there's a lot

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.680 
scared because even though there's a lot
of<00:03:09.400> cytoplasm<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:11.170> nuclei<00:03:11.650> can<00:03:12.430> become<00:03:12.880> very

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
of cytoplasm the nuclei can become very

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.520 
of cytoplasm the nuclei can become very
very<00:03:13.870> big<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.830> dark<00:03:15.760> looking<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:17.230> quite

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
very big and dark looking and quite

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.949 
very big and dark looking and quite
frankly<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.880> know<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.090> don't<00:03:19.359> have<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.720> feel

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
frankly you know you don't have to feel

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.539 
frankly you know you don't have to feel
embarrassed<00:03:20.560> if<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:20.829> don't<00:03:21.040> have<00:03:21.280> much

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
embarrassed if you don't have much

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.150 
embarrassed if you don't have much
experience<00:03:22.120> in<00:03:22.540> all<00:03:23.350> of<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.500> sudden<00:03:23.920> you're

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
experience in all of a sudden you're

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.310 
experience in all of a sudden you're
looking<00:03:24.280> at<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.579> high-power<00:03:25.090> view<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.720> decidua

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
looking at a high-power view of decidua

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.920 
looking at a high-power view of decidua
and<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:27.130> say<00:03:27.400> something<00:03:27.760> incredibly<00:03:28.600> stupid

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
and you say something incredibly stupid

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.140 
and you say something incredibly stupid
like<00:03:29.470> gee<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.370> wonder<00:03:30.700> what<00:03:30.880> kind<00:03:31.090> of

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
like gee I wonder what kind of

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.789 
like gee I wonder what kind of
malignancy<00:03:31.870> this<00:03:32.140> is<00:03:32.790> remember<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.799> placenta

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
malignancy this is remember the placenta

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.830 
malignancy this is remember the placenta
and<00:03:35.980> decidua<00:03:37.739> are<00:03:38.739> in<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.489> way<00:03:39.730> kind<00:03:40.569> of<00:03:40.720> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
and decidua are in a way kind of the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.900 
and decidua are in a way kind of the
most<00:03:41.049> malignant<00:03:41.530> type<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.220> tissue<00:03:42.489> there

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
most malignant type of tissue there

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.440 
most malignant type of tissue there
could<00:03:43.090> be<00:03:43.120> because<00:03:44.079> it<00:03:44.560> is<00:03:44.620> one<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.220> most

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
could be because it is one of the most

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.559 
could be because it is one of the most
normally<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:46.690> nicely<00:03:47.620> invasive<00:03:48.269> type<00:03:49.269> of

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
normally and nicely invasive type of

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.620 
normally and nicely invasive type of
tissue<00:03:50.200> there<00:03:50.590> could<00:03:50.799> be<00:03:50.829> it's<00:03:51.819> necessary<00:03:52.510> for

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
tissue there could be it's necessary for

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.309 
tissue there could be it's necessary for
these<00:03:53.019> things<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.590> be<00:03:53.970> abundantly<00:03:55.319> invasive

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
these things to be abundantly invasive

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.129 
these things to be abundantly invasive
otherwise<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.340> baby<00:03:57.549> would<00:03:58.030> never<00:03:58.299> grow

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
otherwise the baby would never grow

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.720 
otherwise the baby would never grow
would<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.620> so<00:04:00.519> this<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:00.819> all<00:04:01.120> normal<00:04:01.480> decidua

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
would it so this is all normal decidua

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.520 
would it so this is all normal decidua
this<00:04:03.730> is<00:04:03.910> all<00:04:04.350> normal

this is all normal
