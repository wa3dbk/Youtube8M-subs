00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.910 

but<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.569> vapor<00:03:29.810> had<00:03:30.050> ignited<00:03:30.319> then<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.830> then

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
but the vapor had ignited then and then

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.009 
but the vapor had ignited then and then
we<00:03:31.040> were<00:03:31.129> actually<00:03:31.459> on<00:03:31.640> fire<00:03:31.970> it's<00:03:32.660> now<00:03:32.780> like<00:03:32.989> a

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
we were actually on fire it's now like a

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.780 
we were actually on fire it's now like a
mad<00:03:33.260> rush<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.560> go<00:03:33.830> out<00:03:33.890> as<00:03:34.069> quick<00:03:34.220> as<00:03:34.310> we<00:03:34.430> can

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
mad rush to go out as quick as we can

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.670 
mad rush to go out as quick as we can
I've<00:03:35.090> hopped<00:03:35.720> out<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.930> top<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.290> he's<00:03:36.379> crawled

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
I've hopped out the top and he's crawled

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.650 
I've hopped out the top and he's crawled
underneath<00:03:37.129> the<00:03:37.340> car

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.330 

I'm<00:03:40.050> not<00:03:40.230> sure<00:03:40.440> having<00:03:40.740> you<00:03:41.010> know<00:03:41.130> how<00:03:41.280> we

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
I'm not sure having you know how we

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.470 
I'm not sure having you know how we
managed<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.610> get<00:03:41.760> through<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:42.090> hole<00:03:42.270> it<00:03:42.420> was

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
managed to get through that hole it was

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.690 
managed to get through that hole it was
very<00:03:43.050> small<00:03:43.290> but<00:03:43.740> think<00:03:44.580> about

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.490 

from<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.270> moment<00:03:49.420> we<00:03:49.630> actually<00:03:50.140> ran<00:03:50.349> away

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
from the moment we actually ran away

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.520 
from the moment we actually ran away
from<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.890> car<00:03:51.099> the<00:03:52.060> seat<00:03:52.300> was<00:03:52.450> already<00:03:53.410> on

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
from the car the seat was already on

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.970 
from the car the seat was already on
fire

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
fire

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.440 
fire
I<00:03:54.010> think<00:03:54.190> Reina<00:03:54.400> just<00:03:54.640> had<00:03:54.760> some<00:03:54.940> light<00:03:55.180> burns

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
I think Reina just had some light burns

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.850 
I think Reina just had some light burns
around<00:03:55.599> his<00:03:55.780> neck<00:03:55.959> but<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.290> moment<00:03:56.680> we<00:03:56.739> were

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
around his neck but the moment we were

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.740 
around his neck but the moment we were
out<00:03:56.980> that<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.370> was<00:03:57.520> on<00:03:57.640> fire<00:03:57.880> at<00:03:58.209> that<00:03:58.510> moment

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
out that it was on fire at that moment

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.210 
out that it was on fire at that moment
it<00:03:58.959> was<00:03:59.080> that<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.349> was<00:03:59.470> as<00:03:59.590> close<00:03:59.800> as<00:03:59.950> you<00:04:00.010> get

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
it was that it was as close as you get

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.000 
it was that it was as close as you get
one<00:04:00.400> more<00:04:00.520> second<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.750> had<00:04:01.989> more<00:04:02.140> burns<00:04:02.380> ten

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
one more second you had more burns ten

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.010 
one more second you had more burns ten
more<00:04:03.099> seconds<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.580> would've<00:04:03.819> been<00:04:04.020> pretty

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
more seconds it would've been pretty

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.630 
more seconds it would've been pretty
horrific
