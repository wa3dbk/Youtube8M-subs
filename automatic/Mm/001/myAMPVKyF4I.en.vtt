feedback<00:06:03.650> that<00:06:04.100> she<00:06:04.250> had<00:06:04.430> was<00:06:04.940> that<00:06:04.970> it<00:06:05.330> could

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
feedback that she had was that it could

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.560 
feedback that she had was that it could
probably<00:06:05.660> do<00:06:06.080> with<00:06:06.320> more<00:06:06.560> teeth<00:06:07.430> in<00:06:08.000> the<00:06:08.330> sides

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570
