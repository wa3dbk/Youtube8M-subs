00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello everyone with you as usual maxim and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.529
 channel palma collistar and today i have 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.440
 on the review will be a pink card Seydou 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.139
 dumbia and gave me this player again 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.070
 Dmitry Gorin, for which I say to him simply 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.070
 thank 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.560
 his Aryan striker is relatively 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.050
 recently left the ranks of the army club and 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.510
 moved to the Italian rum where for now 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.910
 can not be fixed in the basis of course 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.700
 most of the way 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.610
 competition frequent injuries nonetheless 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.890
 fifa 15 this player is drawn simply 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.559
 Ideally essentially if you create a chart 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.470
 with its performance, you can be sure 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.989
 that almost all of its stats will be 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.450
 at a high enough level for example 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.449
 to clarify my point I can bring 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.550
 precisely aguero have serkhio speed the main thing 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.070
 advantage but in this case he has 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.620
 weakly frankly so here at the thumbs and 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.230
 just everything is at a good level there is always 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.409
 and the corpus has an excellent completion of the attack 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.540
 4 stars special tricks good blow with 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.210
 weak legs in short i'm already 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.430
 used to say he has absolutely everything 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.860
 so what's his minus of course you 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.990
 say that I find fault there but me 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.420
 it seems that it is too expensive for 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.550
 cards which are practically nothing 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.560
 different from the usual yes yes you are not 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.869
 you are mistaken his card is felt 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.659
 absolutely the same as the usual no 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.119
 sense to buy its pink counterpart i don't 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.640
 see because normal friends so 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.649
 very good in short no wonder people 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.020
 so write about him knowingly bombing a bunch 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.090
 from him almost all manage 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.860
 dam it is very simple you can not even 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.259
 do some tricks just 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.600
 clamp acceleration button and destroy 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.909
 rival's nerves true this is not the way to 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.670
 I 'm still on the side of the majority in 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.670
 this situation just fuck pays 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.350
 in general, my verdict is six 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.869
 out of ten the main reason for such an assessment 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.510
 as you yourself understand it its price is not 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.550
 it is worth buying it expensive of course if 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.220
 its price will decrease with time 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.110
 You can buy it naturally, but I think that 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.880
 no one wants to put it on 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.100
 transfer well at least here at the moment 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.860
 recording a video of such a card is simple 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.960
 quite not on the market and taking advantage of food 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.060
 By chance I want to say that people do not use 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.160
 But because of him, this is complete bullshit. 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.650
 saying so playing dick is not interesting I 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.600
 I think of course this opinion is populist 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.150
 probably society but still worth it 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.970
 think if you use only 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.700
 pe-100 you apparently downs you just a couple 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.640
