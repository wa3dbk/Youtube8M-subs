hello everyone I'm doing a review today

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.550 
hello everyone I'm doing a review today
on<00:00:03.259> the<00:00:04.259> Rokinon<00:00:04.890> T<00:00:05.700> 1.5<00:00:06.480> 35<00:00:07.049> millimeter

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
on the Rokinon T 1.5 35 millimeter

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.890 
on the Rokinon T 1.5 35 millimeter
cinema<00:00:08.519> lens<00:00:08.730> which<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:10.019> pretty<00:00:10.710> new<00:00:10.950> lens

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
cinema lens which is a pretty new lens

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.140 
cinema lens which is a pretty new lens
and<00:00:12.900> it's<00:00:13.139> built<00:00:13.380> for<00:00:13.559> cinema<00:00:14.009> you'll<00:00:14.880> see

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
and it's built for cinema you'll see

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.529 
and it's built for cinema you'll see
right<00:00:15.450> here<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:15.990> got<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.440> little<00:00:17.539> gear

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
right here that it's got the little gear

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.800 
right here that it's got the little gear
thingies<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.210> attach<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.600> follow

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
thingies so that you can attach a follow

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.920 
thingies so that you can attach a follow
focus<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.580> got<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:24.300> manual

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
focus to it and it's got a manual

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.200 
focus to it and it's got a manual
aperture<00:00:25.260> ring<00:00:25.769> which<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.189> really<00:00:26.580> helpful<00:00:26.820> if

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
aperture ring which is really helpful if

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.019 
aperture ring which is really helpful if
you're<00:00:27.769> filming<00:00:28.769> from<00:00:29.099> indoors<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.910> then

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
you're filming from indoors and then

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.120 
you're filming from indoors and then
you're<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.330> go<00:00:30.480> walk<00:00:30.720> outside<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.560> you

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
you're going to go walk outside on you

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.200 
you're going to go walk outside on you
can<00:00:32.279> adjust<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.420> aperture<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:34.230> whatever

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
can adjust the aperture to whatever

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.020 
can adjust the aperture to whatever
setting<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.300> need<00:00:37.040> to<00:00:38.040> expose<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.460> outside

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
setting you need to expose for outside

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.779 
setting you need to expose for outside
so<00:00:39.930> that's<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.010> huge<00:00:41.399> filmmaking<00:00:42.410> plus

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
so that's this is a huge filmmaking plus

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.290 
so that's this is a huge filmmaking plus
because<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.379> some<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> other<00:00:46.739> lenses<00:00:47.300> it's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
because of some of the other lenses it's

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.799 
because of some of the other lenses it's
really<00:00:48.570> hard<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.899> attach<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.350> follow<00:00:49.590> focus<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
really hard to attach a follow focus and

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.990 
really hard to attach a follow focus and
obviously<00:00:52.280> photography<00:00:53.280> lenses<00:00:53.610> don't<00:00:53.789> have

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
obviously photography lenses don't have

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.170 
obviously photography lenses don't have
a<00:00:54.030> manual<00:00:54.300> aperture<00:00:54.629> ring<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.940> lens

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
a manual aperture ring so this this lens

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.310 
a manual aperture ring so this this lens
doesn't<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.780> autofocus<00:00:58.879> which<00:01:00.170> for<00:01:01.170> me<00:01:01.289> I

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
doesn't have autofocus which for me I

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.080 
doesn't have autofocus which for me I
never<00:01:01.530> use<00:01:01.890> autofocus<00:01:02.520> anyway<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:02.940> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
never use autofocus anyway because I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.929 
never use autofocus anyway because I
mostly<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.750> movie<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.650> when<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.519> do<00:01:05.640> do

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
mostly do movie and when I do do

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.649 
mostly do movie and when I do do
photography<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.990> always<00:01:07.439> use<00:01:07.920> manual

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
photography I I always use manual

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.690 
photography I I always use manual
focusing<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> do<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> couple

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
focusing so I'm going to do a couple

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.600 
focusing so I'm going to do a couple
tests<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.630> lens<00:01:15.350> some<00:01:16.350> low-light<00:01:16.799> I'm

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
tests on the lens some low-light I'm

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.109 
tests on the lens some low-light I'm
going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> compare<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:19.700> Canon<00:01:20.700> 50

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
going to compare it with the Canon 50

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.530 
going to compare it with the Canon 50
millimeter<00:01:21.830> which<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.040> has<00:01:23.189> an<00:01:23.340> f-stop<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.909> 1.8

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
millimeter which it has an f-stop of 1.8

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.070 
millimeter which it has an f-stop of 1.8
so<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.990> little<00:01:25.200> bit<00:01:26.509> this<00:01:27.509> lens<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
so it's a little bit this lens is a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.160 
so it's a little bit this lens is a
little<00:01:28.350> bit<00:01:28.500> more<00:01:28.860> low-light<00:01:29.780> capable<00:01:30.780> than

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
little bit more low-light capable than

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.010 
little bit more low-light capable than
the<00:01:31.590> Canon<00:01:31.920> 1.8<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> tried<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.540> match<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.930> up

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the Canon 1.8 but I tried to match it up

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.560 
the Canon 1.8 but I tried to match it up
as<00:01:34.229> close<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.710> could<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.189> make<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> fair

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
as close as I could to make it a fair

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.340 
as close as I could to make it a fair
comparison<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:38.009> used<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:39.170> fifty<00:01:40.170> millimeter

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
comparison and I used a fifty millimeter

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.020 
comparison and I used a fifty millimeter
on<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> Canon<00:01:41.130> t2i<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.909> some<00:01:42.090> shots<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.750> I

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
on the Canon t2i for some shots and I

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.940 
on the Canon t2i for some shots and I
did<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> comparison<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.689> 5d<00:01:46.200> mark<00:01:46.470> ii<00:01:46.530> as

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
did a comparison on the 5d mark ii as

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.580 
did a comparison on the 5d mark ii as
well<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.540> you'll<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
well so and you'll see all that in the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.510 
well so and you'll see all that in the
test<00:01:50.570> okay<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.200> shot<00:01:52.439> you'll<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:53.340> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
test okay in this shot you'll see that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.639 
test okay in this shot you'll see that
the<00:01:53.640> Rokinon<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.479> Canon<00:01:54.990> look<00:01:55.229> pretty

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
the Rokinon and the Canon look pretty

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.490 
the Rokinon and the Canon look pretty
similar<00:01:55.950> there's<00:01:56.939> not<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.210> much<00:01:57.360> difference

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
similar there's not that much difference

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.260 
similar there's not that much difference
I<00:01:58.530> think<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> Rokinon<00:01:59.579> looks<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.880> little<00:02:00.030> bit

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
I think the Rokinon looks a little bit

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.260 
I think the Rokinon looks a little bit
better<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.750> slightly<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.700> this<00:02:02.700> shot<00:02:02.939> I

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
better just slightly on this shot I

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.179 
better just slightly on this shot I
think<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.079> looks<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.320> lot<00:02:04.439> better<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> lot

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
think it looks a lot better it's a lot

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.880 
think it looks a lot better it's a lot
sharper<00:02:05.509> but<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> Canon<00:02:06.960> 50<00:02:07.229> millimeter<00:02:07.619> was

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
sharper but the Canon 50 millimeter was

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.999 
sharper but the Canon 50 millimeter was
closer<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.479> subject

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
closer to the subject

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.009 
closer to the subject
but<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.640> try<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.879> compensate<00:02:12.150> for<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.689> as<00:02:12.900> much

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
but I try to compensate for that as much

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:19.640 
but I try to compensate for that as much
as<00:02:13.049> possible<00:02:15.409> all<00:02:16.409> right<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:17.159> 5d<00:02:18.650> compared

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
as possible all right so the 5d compared

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.039 
as possible all right so the 5d compared
to<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.829> t2i<00:02:20.220> with<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.610> Rokinon<00:02:20.970> lens<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.720> 5d

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
to the t2i with the Rokinon lens the 5d

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.509 
to the t2i with the Rokinon lens the 5d
looks<00:02:22.260> better<00:02:22.439> but<00:02:22.739> they<00:02:22.890> look<00:02:23.159> pretty<00:02:23.400> good

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
looks better but they look pretty good

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.449 
looks better but they look pretty good
both<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.239> them<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:25.769> Rokinon<00:02:26.129> really

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
both of them on the Rokinon really

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.130 
both of them on the Rokinon really
really<00:02:27.360> makes<00:02:27.540> things<00:02:27.720> look<00:02:27.989> really

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
really makes things look really

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.899 
really makes things look really
cinematic<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.010> really<00:02:29.549> like<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.730> about

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
cinematic and I really like that about

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.259 
cinematic and I really like that about
that<00:02:30.299> lens<00:02:31.489> right<00:02:32.489> here<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.909> Rokinon

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
that lens right here the Rokinon

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.000 
that lens right here the Rokinon
obviously<00:02:33.840> won<00:02:34.019> over<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.290> Canon<00:02:34.709> 50

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
obviously won over the Canon 50

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.309 
obviously won over the Canon 50
millimeter<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.610> think<00:02:35.879> the<00:02:36.060> Canon<00:02:37.019> looks<00:02:37.200> like

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
millimeter I think the Canon looks like

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.309 
millimeter I think the Canon looks like
crap<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:39.180> Rokinon<00:02:39.569> was<00:02:39.720> actually<00:02:40.019> stopped

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
crap the Rokinon was actually stopped

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.170 
crap the Rokinon was actually stopped
down<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> little<00:02:40.980> bit<00:02:41.129> so<00:02:41.340> it's<00:02:41.489> not<00:02:41.519> as<00:02:41.970> shallow

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
down a little bit so it's not as shallow

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.940 
down a little bit so it's not as shallow
depth-of-field<00:02:42.629> but<00:02:43.140> it's<00:02:43.260> still<00:02:43.470> pretty

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
depth-of-field but it's still pretty

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.789 
depth-of-field but it's still pretty
shallow<00:02:45.019> alright<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:46.170> for<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.409> low-light

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
shallow alright so for the low-light

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.430 
shallow alright so for the low-light
test<00:02:47.069> I<00:02:47.220> did<00:02:47.370> ISO<00:02:47.849> 800<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.049> used<00:02:49.260> only

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
test I did ISO 800 and I used only

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.339 
test I did ISO 800 and I used only
natural<00:02:50.010> light<00:02:50.659> also<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.750> shutter<00:02:51.959> speed<00:02:52.109> was

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
natural light also the shutter speed was

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.170 
natural light also the shutter speed was
at<00:02:52.470> 50<00:02:52.889> all<00:02:53.639> right<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.269> on<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.200> Rokinon<00:02:55.590> and

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
at 50 all right so on the Rokinon and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.750 
at 50 all right so on the Rokinon and
Canon<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.690> see<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:59.250> there<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.519> some

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
Canon you can see that there is some

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.210 
Canon you can see that there is some
grain<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.450> think<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.409> Rokinon<00:03:01.829> looks<00:03:02.040> better

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
grain I think the Rokinon looks better

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.729 
grain I think the Rokinon looks better
with<00:03:02.549> lighting<00:03:03.269> looks<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.290> lot<00:03:04.440> better<00:03:04.590> with

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
with lighting looks a lot better with

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.770 
with lighting looks a lot better with
the<00:03:04.950> lighting<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.849> see<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.180> by<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
the lighting you can see that by the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.860 
the lighting you can see that by the
light<00:03:07.139> by<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.739> lamp<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.690> 50<00:03:09.690> millimeter

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
light by the lamp the 50 millimeter

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.569 
light by the lamp the 50 millimeter
looks<00:03:10.379> kind<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:10.799> crappy<00:03:11.370> looks<00:03:12.030> blowing<00:03:12.389> out

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
looks kind of crappy looks blowing out

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.849 
looks kind of crappy looks blowing out
okay<00:03:14.579> you'll<00:03:14.909> see<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.329> with<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.410> Rokinon

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
okay you'll see you with the the Rokinon

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.300 
okay you'll see you with the the Rokinon
lens<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.430> looks<00:03:17.669> way<00:03:18.060> better<00:03:18.269> in<00:03:18.629> my<00:03:18.900> opinion

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
lens it looks way better in my opinion

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.920 
lens it looks way better in my opinion
compared<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.489> canon<00:03:20.849> lens<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.389> you'll

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
compared to the canon lens and you'll

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.720 
compared to the canon lens and you'll
also<00:03:22.109> see<00:03:22.319> that<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.769> focusing<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.489> lot

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
also see that the focusing is a lot

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.990 
also see that the focusing is a lot
smoother<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:26.010> candidate<00:03:26.370> 50<00:03:26.609> millimeter

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
smoother and the candidate 50 millimeter

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.569 
smoother and the candidate 50 millimeter
obviously<00:03:27.629> wasn't<00:03:27.900> built<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.169> Rack<00:03:28.799> focus<00:03:29.310> but

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
obviously wasn't built to Rack focus but

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.759 
obviously wasn't built to Rack focus but
the<00:03:29.750> Rokinon<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.870> really<00:03:31.139> smooth<00:03:31.410> with<00:03:31.590> that

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
the Rokinon is really smooth with that

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.099 
the Rokinon is really smooth with that
and<00:03:32.069> I<00:03:32.190> think<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.489> overall<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.750> colours

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
and I think the overall the the colours

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.750 
and I think the overall the the colours
and<00:03:34.410> things<00:03:34.620> just<00:03:34.709> look<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.129> lot<00:03:35.310> better<00:03:35.459> than

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
and things just look a lot better than

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.089 
and things just look a lot better than
what<00:03:36.449> the<00:03:36.599> Canon<00:03:36.900> 50<00:03:37.199> millimeter<00:03:37.650> looks<00:03:37.889> like

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.979 

all<00:03:41.099> right<00:03:41.160> for<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.459> sharpness<00:03:41.819> test<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.569> tried

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
all right for the sharpness test I tried

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.159 
all right for the sharpness test I tried
to<00:03:43.819> make<00:03:44.819> it<00:03:44.940> as<00:03:45.030> fair<00:03:45.239> as<00:03:45.359> possible<00:03:45.389> since<00:03:46.049> the

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
to make it as fair as possible since the

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.039 
to make it as fair as possible since the
50<00:03:46.470> millimeter<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:47.129> a<00:03:47.790> closer<00:03:48.120> focal<00:03:48.629> length<00:03:48.840> I

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
50 millimeter is a closer focal length I

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.289 
50 millimeter is a closer focal length I
had<00:03:49.169> to<00:03:49.290> adjust<00:03:49.410> for<00:03:49.859> that

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
had to adjust for that

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.670 
had to adjust for that
obviously<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.419> Rokinon<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.079> lot<00:03:52.379> sharper

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
obviously the Rokinon is a lot sharper

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.780 
obviously the Rokinon is a lot sharper
than<00:03:53.669> the<00:03:53.849> Canon<00:03:55.220> overall<00:03:56.220> looks<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.639> lot

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
than the Canon overall looks a lot

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.330 
than the Canon overall looks a lot
better<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.389> I<00:03:58.379> think<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:58.919> where<00:03:59.099> you<00:03:59.190> can

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
better and I think this is where you can

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.360 
better and I think this is where you can
see<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.669> huge<00:04:00.209> difference<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:01.739> after<00:04:02.159> all<00:04:02.190> the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
see the huge difference so after all the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.059 
see the huge difference so after all the
tests<00:04:02.819> that<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.209> did<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.510> found<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.260> Canon

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
tests that I did I found that the Canon

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.149 
tests that I did I found that the Canon
15<00:04:05.340> millimeter<00:04:05.730> 1.8<00:04:06.590> actually<00:04:07.590> stacks<00:04:07.919> up

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
15 millimeter 1.8 actually stacks up

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.699 
15 millimeter 1.8 actually stacks up
pretty<00:04:08.489> good<00:04:08.609> to<00:04:08.970> this<00:04:09.150> obviously<00:04:10.019> this<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:10.680> a

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
pretty good to this obviously this is a

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.390 
pretty good to this obviously this is a
lot<00:04:10.919> better<00:04:11.099> but<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.879> is<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.090> $600<00:04:12.720> lens<00:04:13.019> and

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
lot better but this is a $600 lens and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.699 
lot better but this is a $600 lens and
the<00:04:14.400> 50<00:04:14.729> millimeter<00:04:14.909> is<00:04:15.269> only<00:04:15.419> like<00:04:15.690> 125<00:04:16.440> bucks

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
the 50 millimeter is only like 125 bucks

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.259 
the 50 millimeter is only like 125 bucks
so<00:04:17.639> depending<00:04:18.090> on<00:04:18.150> your<00:04:18.269> budget<00:04:19.039> obviously

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
so depending on your budget obviously

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.459 
so depending on your budget obviously
you<00:04:21.269> want<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.510> go<00:04:21.630> with<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> cheaper<00:04:22.229> one<00:04:22.349> if

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
you want to go with the cheaper one if

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:23.900 
you want to go with the cheaper one if
you<00:04:22.530> don't<00:04:22.650> have<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:22.860> much<00:04:23.010> money

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
you don't have that much money

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.600 
you don't have that much money
but<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.330> would<00:04:25.050> say<00:04:25.260> save<00:04:25.620> up<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.040> get<00:04:26.220> this<00:04:26.430> one

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
but I would say save up and get this one

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.550 
but I would say save up and get this one
especially<00:04:26.940> if<00:04:27.240> you're<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.420> filmmaker<00:04:27.840> because

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
especially if you're a filmmaker because

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.760 
especially if you're a filmmaker because
this<00:04:28.920> is<00:04:29.840> really<00:04:30.840> really<00:04:31.170> useful<00:04:31.380> you<00:04:31.590> can

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
this is really really useful you can

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.350 
this is really really useful you can
attach<00:04:32.010> a<00:04:32.160> follow<00:04:32.370> focus<00:04:32.640> like<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.150> said

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
attach a follow focus like I said

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.510 
attach a follow focus like I said
earlier<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:34.080> that's<00:04:34.650> something<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.010> it's

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
earlier and that's something that it's

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.060 
earlier and that's something that it's
harder<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:35.940> do<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.900> am<00:04:37.020> I'm<00:04:37.320> positive

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
harder to do and and I am I'm positive

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.270 
harder to do and and I am I'm positive
that<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.310> can't<00:04:39.110> attach<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.350> follow<00:04:40.590> focus<00:04:40.830> to

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
that you can't attach a follow focus to

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.090 
that you can't attach a follow focus to
the<00:04:41.490> Canon<00:04:41.820> fifty<00:04:42.060> millimeter<00:04:42.420> lens<00:04:43.100> I've

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
the Canon fifty millimeter lens I've

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.580 
the Canon fifty millimeter lens I've
never<00:04:44.280> tried<00:04:44.580> but<00:04:45.000> it's<00:04:45.870> got<00:04:46.140> a<00:04:46.170> really<00:04:46.380> really

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
never tried but it's got a really really

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.470 
never tried but it's got a really really
small<00:04:46.920> focus<00:04:47.310> ring<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:47.730> I'm<00:04:47.790> pretty<00:04:48.060> sure<00:04:48.300> that

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
small focus ring so I'm pretty sure that

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.620 
small focus ring so I'm pretty sure that
it<00:04:48.600> would<00:04:48.690> be<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:49.340> difficult<00:04:50.340> task<00:04:50.550> to<00:04:50.970> attach

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
it would be a difficult task to attach

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.080 
it would be a difficult task to attach
follow<00:04:51.960> focus<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.470> that<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:53.460> overall<00:04:53.700> this

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
follow focus to that so overall this

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.580 
follow focus to that so overall this
this<00:04:54.450> lens<00:04:54.720> is<00:04:55.040> a<00:04:56.040> lot<00:04:56.610> better<00:04:56.870> but<00:04:57.870> as<00:04:58.170> you<00:04:58.440> saw

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
this lens is a lot better but as you saw

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.880 
this lens is a lot better but as you saw
in<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.740> comparison<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.310> actually<00:05:00.680> stacked<00:05:01.680> up

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
in the comparison it actually stacked up

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.150 
in the comparison it actually stacked up
pretty<00:05:02.160> close<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.810> candidate<00:05:04.140> 50mm<00:05:04.560> 50

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
pretty close to the candidate 50mm 50

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.540 
pretty close to the candidate 50mm 50
millimeter<00:05:05.610> 1.8
