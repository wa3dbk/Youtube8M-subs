00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:18.840
 the attitude in the way between melody 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:22.680
 and that be tuned to the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.480
 respective text on the content of 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.060
 single word on the emotional 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.790
 Held a phase of the entire piece 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.739
 that's definitely what everybody's gonna do after all 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.239
 great composers united together 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.870
 and now you have to say that belongs to the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.030
 Kindertotenlieder to what a great deal 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.180
 extraordinary so firstly due 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.530
 the topic is almost what 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.620
 incomparable I do not know any 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.350
 The actual cycle is so concrete 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.340
 with the one with the death 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.739
 with the experiences made that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:06.000
 children have died and move that yes 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:10.950
 even so for some it also 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.770
 has broken it off donation there is 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.420
 over 400 poets painter has gone from it 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.490
 you have to say the five 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.049
 so not the most interesting ones 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.340
 not all of the 400 are 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.740
 really 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.450
 at this level like the ones selected 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.990
 then the children's songs of mama 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.979
 have become the form of this great 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.850
 castrated orchestra song existed 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.610
 not yet 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.179
 and only very few try it there 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.289
 still ostrich of course a relative 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.280
 great tension written by songs 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:51.610
 has for orchestra but i would say 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.599
 almost all not with the salary due 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.670
 the choice of texts 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:02:02.890
 there are a handful maybe ten 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:05.079
 Songs of relatively many the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.519
 interesting and of course the 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:12.640
 to sound attractive and sexy 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:15.250
 sophisticated down to the smallest detail though 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:20.860
 with the originality with the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.860
 direct access to the heart and to 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.650
 pretended and to understand as at 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:31.209
 Mom is relatively unique in that 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.829
 the interesting one on harmony that time 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.859
 to perform these pieces when in 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.180
 Comparison to all other painter cycles 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.519
 back the francs join the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.819
 wound on lido then the individual parts 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.010
 the symphonies are performing very well 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.920
 strange are the audience that the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.720
 but mathematics is one gets involved 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.319
 through the first song and do not know yet 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.200
 exactly 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.569
 specifically where this is going and at the latest 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.060
 with the second piece where completely 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.910
 in concrete terms, what will happen in the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.709
 run this relatively short cycle there 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.900
 It is also a reaction that people 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.359
 protect in the sense that the one 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.200
 bit on distance go you can feel the 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.970
 even during the concert that's what 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.120
 which is still a taboo in the 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.970
 presentation of one would have represented because 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.700
 the conflicts by 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.700
 Hard and hard to handle 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.569
 and, strangely enough, that does of course 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.360
 the pieces for someone as an interpreter 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:39.140
 very interesting so not with the 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.870
 but so close to one 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.440
 to be in touch with you 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.110
 are 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:51.680
 but last but not least also at the 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:54.680
 listener that that's always what 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.920
 stay what I do not wear 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:02.000
 In the end it is a question of 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:05.510
 exact samples understanding the 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.250
 make it clear where the direction is 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.629
 the direction is the transfer 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.819
 the music is not just that 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.950
 transmit that and always be together 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.380
 should you expect a lot of exams? 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.400
 I need a little bit of time 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.340
 In the end it has to be a kind of 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.210
 familiarity in the musical 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.949
 taste that the orchestra 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:33.470
 ultimately also of the dirigent 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:35.270
 read thoughts that can no longer 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.900
 in the way you look 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.699
 simply imagines that you just 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.349
 with the singer closely together by 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.970
 to listen very carefully that means 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.250
 actually in this music that one that 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.669
 the sound always produces that a bit 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.220
 behind it soloists that's what what 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.470
 not working well for me so one 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.979
 always somehow on the on the 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:03.740
 tip of the wave be together and and 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.659
 I'm going in the right direction 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.520
 I'm glad that he and I'm curious how 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.960
 the orchestra in water is one of the one 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.240
 but also repeatedly hear there are 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.970
 very good orchestra is so it stands 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.840
 I think that nothing in the way that that 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.099
 a good and successful one 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.099
 cooperation will be
