through bar system that one does require

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.640 
through bar system that one does require
a<00:03:18.819> fitting<00:03:19.819> kit<00:03:20.090> called<00:03:20.329> a<00:03:20.420> K<00:03:20.660> hook<00:03:20.930> that's

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
a fitting kit called a K hook that's

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.080 
a fitting kit called a K hook that's
going<00:03:21.829> to<00:03:21.889> grab<00:03:22.040> onto<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.430> rail<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:22.579> bar

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
going to grab onto the rail that bar

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.569 
going to grab onto the rail that bar
system<00:03:23.389> will<00:03:23.690> right<00:03:23.930> above<00:03:24.349> the<00:03:24.620> rail<00:03:24.829> so<00:03:25.489> it

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
system will right above the rail so it

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.110 
system will right above the rail so it
won't<00:03:25.730> be<00:03:25.849> quite<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:26.180> low<00:03:26.650> profile<00:03:28.030> but<00:03:29.030> it

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
won't be quite so low profile but it

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.270 
won't be quite so low profile but it
allows<00:03:29.359> you<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:29.630> have<00:03:29.810> bars<00:03:30.109> that<00:03:30.260> expand<00:03:31.069> out

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
allows you to have bars that expand out

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.680 
allows you to have bars that expand out
a<00:03:31.609> little<00:03:31.880> bit<00:03:32.090> from<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.450> edge<00:03:32.540> of<00:03:32.630> the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
a little bit from the edge of the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.659 
a little bit from the edge of the
vehicle<00:03:33.169> again<00:03:33.769> gives<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.069> more<00:03:34.190> bar<00:03:34.400> spread

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
vehicle again gives you more bar spread

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
bar you would just watch the through bar

00:03:48.280 --> 00:04:00.050 
bar you would just watch the through bar
video<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.989> see<00:03:50.230> that<00:03:51.040> system

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.110 

well<00:04:00.600> that's<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.870> quick<00:04:01.020> easy<00:04:01.260> install
