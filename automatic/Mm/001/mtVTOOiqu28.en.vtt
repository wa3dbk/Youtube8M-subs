00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.680
 one of Latin America in this video les 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.860
 I will try to introduce concepts 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.190
 basic genetic and useful to understand 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.240
 then any other topic that is spoken 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.240
 of genetics 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.330
 in the first video that we talked about 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.780
 a possible definition that would be the 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.460
 genetics we had said is the 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.930
 science that studies the material 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.910
 hereditary eye any level or 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.250
 dimension we had seen that by 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.980
 example there was genetics of organisms 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.559
 Genetics of another genetic organization 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.390
 of the processes and so on 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.170
 I want to present you with a first concept 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.019
 to go 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.929
 to differentiate those of genetics 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.640
 because in general the concept of 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:53.329
 genetics and inheritance are used as 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.809
 synonyms and actually they are not 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:01.600
 heritage is specifically the 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.600
 transmission of characters 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.230
 hereditary 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.280
 of generation 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.960
 in generation 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.370
 that is to say this has to inheritance 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.590
 it has to do with the transmission of those 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.860
 Genetics characters is much more 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.960
 broad because the inheritance is a type or 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.500
 it's a kind of process that happens inside 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.950
 of genetics then I wanted to leave you 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.360
 of course it is well other concepts 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:41.460
 important in genetics is the genome what 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.430
 means the word genome the genome is 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.920
 all the information 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.920
 all genetic information 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.080
 of a 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:02.010
 individual 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.010
 or contained species 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.970
 in the chromosomes 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.570
 chromosomes 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.129
 in later videos you will see better the 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.390
 chromosome definition and structure 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.859
 basic chromosomes and so on but 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.700
 I can tell you right now that a 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.700
 chromosome 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.650
 is instead doing 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:39.130
 of genetic information 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.600
 is where the information sits 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.480
 genetics 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.980
 well another very important concept is the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.980
 concept of g 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.900
 what is a gene or what are the genes 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.220
 genes are fragments 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.220
 or portions 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:03.390
 who from dn 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.390
 which are located 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.480
 where on the chromosomes and obviously 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.970
 these genes code for a 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.720
 certain character and is capable of 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.090
 is transcribed to RNA 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.700
 then we will have genes that 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.560
 code for the color of eyes genes 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.650
 which code for hair color 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.650
 etcetera these fragments imagine that 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.800
 this is the chromosome each gene is 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.319
 locating along the chromosome and of 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.879
 that way they constitute 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:43.840
 well the genes can have variants 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:47.379
 for example the gene that controls or that 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.120
 rules say the eye color can 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.859
 have variants we know that the 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.849
 color of or may be brown may be 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:57.430
 green can be celestial that is to say that there is 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:02.069
 different alternatives for that same 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.069
 gene those different alternatives 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.640
 different alternatives of a gene 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.349
 that code for the same character 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.739
 obviously they are called alleles then 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.019
 an allele is 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.669
 are the different alternatives that it has 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.639
 a gene for coding a 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:28.210
 certain character and obviously 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.210
 what 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.360
 are going to be let's say occupying in the 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.760
 different chromosomes in the in the in the 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.490
 maternal chromosome and my paternal chromosome 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.689
 they will be occupying the same place or the 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.999
 same place 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:49.630
 well another one of the important concepts 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:53.120
 is the concept of genotype and phenotype 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.009
 genotype on the other side we have the 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.460
 breast type 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:02.199
 well that is the genotype is the 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.199
 Constitution 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.199
 genetics 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:09.959
 of the individual 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:18.350
 it is referred to one or several or all 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:25.060
 the differential characters 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:25.060
 whereas the phenotype is the expression 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.610
 external 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.300
 or apparent 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.050
 of the genotype 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:48.940
 it is always said that the phenotype is 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:51.819
 obviously the genotype influenced by 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.810
 the environment this equation is very 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:57.490
 important because always the environment 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.500
 both external and the environment 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.409
 Metabolic conditions in the genotype 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.419
 to be expressed in the phenotype 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.729
 well I think these concepts of 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.259
 genetic are basic there are some more 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.749
 but we're going to see more 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:14.379
 forward in the development of 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:14.379
 different themes 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.090
 educational I recommend the following 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.090
 videos so you can keep learning
