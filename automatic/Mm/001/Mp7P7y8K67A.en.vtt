 bonsai be apple tree because I had one here 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.370
 reserved and I realized that it is already 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.260
 late to transplant you saw that 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.520
 transplant mine does very little that 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.070
 you take them looked like they were too 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.629
 too swollen but here we are in 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.250
 cali make a heat death now 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.710
 same we have more than 20 degrees as a 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.800
 very high degree of humidity 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.800
 hundred-odd percent have 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.750
 we have humidity is exactly 72 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.750
 percent little I think 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.909
 we have a very high degree of humidity 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.790
 we have a lot of heat and that's what 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.470
 It causes spring is a spring that is 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.420
 the trees go crazy have heat 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.979
 the afternoons are longer 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.990
 it gets dark at six o'clock in the afternoon 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.299
 seven seven thirty and already does more 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.940
 clarity there is a stability the photos 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.030
 periods extend a lot of heat 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.030
 humidity 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.930
 with that sound in addition then 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.190
 Even if the flames are not very swollen 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.940
 look what this is doing to me 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.560
 apple tree look here exactly here what 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.680
 what this apple tree is doing to me 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.190
 opening buds is well arrived at this 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.850
 point is late to transplant is late 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.260
 to obviously transplant here you 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.190
 you play a little and if your flight to these 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.720
 worlds apart is a bud of flowers is 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.400
 a bud of flowers is a bud of leaves 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.990
 but it does not matter, we do not have to wait 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.550
 that the tree sprout to transplant what 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.010
 that transplant it immediately before 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.500
 That's why I say I insist on 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.300
 work calendars because we are at 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.090
 January 28 a transplant in a 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.800
 transplant an apple tree usually does not 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.650
 transplant until the second half of 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.290
 February as soon and this one already 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.780
 is beginning to flourish this is 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.030
 beginning to bloom juliÃ¡n friend of mine 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.379
 this is yours so tomorrow I'm going to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.670
 transplant before this is 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.090
 develop more today I have to go 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.709
 running already then that does not wait for 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.299
 that is done too late is better in 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.310
 this case if we are sure that no 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.049
 there's going to be frost transplanting it 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.370
 Whenever a little bit before 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.620
 then if the tree has started to sprout 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.879
 you can not cut the roll and you have 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.670
 that let it sprout quietly and 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.439
 wait to do the transplant in the fall 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.470
 so dear dear friends friends 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:49.210

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.580
