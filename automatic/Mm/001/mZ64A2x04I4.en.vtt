00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.740
 hello welcome to my channel abc today 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.150
 let's make chilaquiles you see a 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.719
 bit dark because it's a little bit 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.730
 early yet but let's do the 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.220
 Chilaquiles 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.730
 we need tomatoes I have a kilo of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.230
 tomato here and praised 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.230
 5 tree chili 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.259
 it's up to you what peaks or you 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.859
 like me I'm just going to put 5 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.040
 a few sprigs of peace or tea also to taste 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:43.060
 Everyone does not like much 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.490
 tortillas I will use half a kilo 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.450
 preferably from a previous day to 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.450
 that hold us more 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.920
 where is it with water we are going to put the 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.210
 Garlic 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.129
 half onion 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.129
 Chilli and tomatoes 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.180
 to leave them until the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.150
 we are going to make tortillas 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.260
 of a large size there is no small 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.260
 because if you do not beat 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.370
 Y 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.690
 and it has to be like that 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.530
 we will continue cutting for 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.930
 start frying 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.979
 this half kilo would be like for three 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.979
 people nothing more 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.960
 good since drying the tomatoes and 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.150
 the chiles let's put in the blender 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.150
 you will not put any water 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.740
 let's put a little oil where 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.740
 let's fry our sauce 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.200
 let's take 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.200
 Y 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.150
 already from here it depends if you like aguadito 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.440
 or thick it is already your decision we are going to 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.440
 put a little salt 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.910
 we are not going to let it boil 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.690
 we are going to add the three tools 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.120
 by step t 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.080
 Y 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.080
 and in a pan with enough oil 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.840
 let's start laughing 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.610
 antilles 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.680
 let them go 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.650
 and so we will have the sauce 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.769
 and here we have them golden 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.110
 when you're going to start preparing them and 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.500
 and when you go to breakfast you're going to 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.720
 grab and you're going to toss them in the sauce and 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.540
 immediately you have to remove them if 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.180
 it's not going to be very watery and you can 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.159
 pour cream and cheese and a little bit of 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.750
 chopped onion I will accompany them 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.750
 with a little egg next to 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.409
 As you can see, we will be left with the 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:45.659
 chilaquiles if you liked comments leave me 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.659
