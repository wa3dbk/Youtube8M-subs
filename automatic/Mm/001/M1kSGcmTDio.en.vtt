00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.880
 or the cec the life of sometimes also 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.379
 we are with the kit of the week how 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.379
 lose weight after 40 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.599
 all right 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.200
 90% of women from 40 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.210
 years they start to gain weight or it costs them 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.830
 very much lose weight even when they have 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.689
 been thin all his life see that to 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.840
 from this 22 kilos start at 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.850
 settle because this happens and it's both 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.949
 in men as in women it is given that 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.660
 From this age stop producing 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.210
 it is muscle and begins begins at 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.309
 produce more fat also 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.920
 our metabolism becomes slower 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.860
 every decade and this makes of course 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.019
 it's much slower from 40 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.879
 years to give you an idea and the 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.010
 a baby's metabolism is twice as 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.530
 quick than that of an adult now well 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.089
 what is the metabolism the metabolism is 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.309
 a chemical process that will be within 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.140
 the cells with which it transforms 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.960
 or through which it transforms into 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.060
 energy all the nutrients that they receive 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.610
 the cells this process is this 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.130
 transformation that can be given 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.189
 different ways and there is a series of 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.780
 hormones that enable and control 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.790
 this process give way to a normal way 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.710
 that's why we usually have a 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.540
 normal metabolism it is said that our 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.190
 metabolism I feel when 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.630
 and this transformation is very 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.040
 slowly 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.350
 that is, it transforms nutrients in 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.150
 energy and that is fast when it is given very 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.040
 quickly and we get the energy very 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.810
 quickly and is distributed to all 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.020
 organism the fact that our 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.619
 metabolism be slow 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.420
 It's not good because all that nutrient 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.189
 that is not transformed into energy is going to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.200
 transform in the long run into sugars in 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.970
 fats and fats that are going to be installed 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.340
 in our body 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.130
 there are many mistakes that we make to 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.140
 from this age that make you still 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.600
 our metabolism is slower 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.270
 come back slower for example when you see that 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.540
 We are gaining kilos we stopped dinner 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.920
 it's typical, there are even statistics 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.170
 that show that the woman after 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.970
 40 years a large percentage stops 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.870
 dine and start to dine a fruit or 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.030
 a salad this you do first you must 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.550
 know that the metabolism is going to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.140
 slow down more with certain processes by 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.570
 example when we are in a 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.820
 state of malnutrition or we stop 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.420
 eat and we greatly lower our intake of 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.700
 food in quantities especially the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.130
 metabolism becomes slow slows down 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.959
 by 25% on the other hand when 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.580
 we do physical exercise or some 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.860
 situations of high stress or 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.830
 anguish the metabolism becomes a lot 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.660
 faster then the stop eating goes 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.000
 to be that the metabolism became slow 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.130
 and if on top we only ate one fruit 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.510
 you know that the fruits to the dukan diet 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.790
 we do not eat them because of the fact that 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.159
 they have sugar 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.599
 the sugars if they do not transform 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.099
 immediately in energy is now 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.810
 transform into fats and this wants 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.430
 say that we fill a fruit of 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.290
 their sugars are transformed into grace 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.000
 we are sleeping because the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.390
 We can not use energy because 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.099
 we are at rest then 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.170
 this is one of the mistakes we make 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.720
 from 40 years old onwards and not 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.120
 have breakfast for our life that maybe 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.250
 our job just have a coffee 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.629
 breakfast is very beneficial for 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.239
 to be able to return faster to our 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.250
 metabolism and very beneficial because at 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.200
 have a good breakfast 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.810
 and we know that the digestion that we are 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.800
 many a lot of information that this is good 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.890
 to lose weight also our life to 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.000
 from this age is no longer so active 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.040
 Normally when we are younger 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.690
 we have in our little children 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.150
 we are running up and down 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.310
 all day taking them to school and 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.650
 taking the arms we rest 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.959
 well at night we sleep less hours all 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.790
 this makes all this extra energy 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.180
 that we spend that now we no longer spend it 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.580
 so of course we have less 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.010
 calories our most sedentary life more 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.650
 quiet then I have to say 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.650
 some secrets that are going to help us 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.010
 increase our metabolism and so 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.260
 both help us lose weight starting 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.750
 of 40 years of course the diet 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.910
 dukan is a very effective diet and if 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.739
 In addition to diet we follow the advice 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.470
 that doctor dukan gives us in his book 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.020
 Even better 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.150
 we must be realistic and maybe it has broken 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.460
 plus 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.919
 what I want to give you is some points to 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.400
 keep in mind to overcome this 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.400
 moment
