00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 Question 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.130
 it's tourism and that's wrong 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.730
 I see that in the super 99 you had a good time 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.530
 the data on the sale of food to 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.300
 Hotels 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.600
 his sunday chile 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.020
 let's talk now about the tax 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.450
 I know that the current expert government 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.650
 raising taxes in fact to my two 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.960
 comrades did it together while 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.469
 they were together in government 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.870
 the document attachment that by the way is 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.829
 still managed by a person who 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.690
 was named by the own 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.340
 vice president varela so I 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.090
 strange that I do not know how to handle 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.090
 those businesses 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.460
 I propose that we leave behind for 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.920
 always shady deals like those in 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.810
 finmeccanica approved by the two 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.520
 people and their government that accompany me 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:02.079
 here today he did not leave the government what 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.620
 they voted 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.830
 with me 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.670
 the country does not need more of the same what 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.229
 What do you need to do? Juan Carlos 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.790
 and agricultural production continues 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.470
 growing to put hotels that 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.780
 way I think the two markets without 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.570
 suppliers and glad and 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.570
 they are breaking what they can not contain 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.780
 with the private sector that I want 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.820
 remember the other candidates form 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.380
 part of the board of directors of the atp and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.740
 handle funds with responsibility 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.340
 that are handled within the atp 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 The first thing we are going to do is designate 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.840
 a tourism minister who uses his 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.360
 creativity to promote panama and 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.680
 not to be doing dirty campaign 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.930
 neglecting the tourism sector and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.090
 neglecting his work 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.530
 listen to the Sunday open the the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.270
 agricultural sector when the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.160
 rice producers could not almost 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.570
 sell your harvest would seem like a 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.980
 joke a chiriquÃ­ hotel in this 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.520
 moment of acquaintances both the 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.250
 rice producers 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.570
 we put airport parking 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.340
 managed today by related sectors 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.850
 to the government very close to the other two 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.170
 presidential campaigns 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.000
 because before it had to be included in a 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.010
 political party to give a 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.230
 children's scholarship 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.189
 I have said it throughout my career 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.980
 policy what is said now and I will say 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:26.230
 God first the first of July I do not 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.360
 I do politics by attacking personally 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.989
 my adversaries and making jokes of 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.989
 serious topics 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.010
 and I'm going to dedicate one more minute 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.500
 from this discussion to political issues 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.280
 let's focus with the question that 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.280
 they did in the forum 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.700
 if you have your hand 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.250
 and you have you 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.930
 forget about that in the nap you return 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.930
 for telephone 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.070
 and if I had to die
