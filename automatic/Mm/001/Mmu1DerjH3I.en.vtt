00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
2 days and this is the graph that you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.510 
2 days and this is the graph that you
can<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:51.899> always<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.949> Wi-Fi

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
can see and it was always on Wi-Fi

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.340 
can see and it was always on Wi-Fi
connection<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.030> would<00:00:54.120> say<00:00:54.270> 95%<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:55.020> time<00:00:55.199> it

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
connection I would say 95% of time it

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.500 
connection I would say 95% of time it
was<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.590> Wi-Fi<00:00:55.890> connection<00:00:56.340> 5%<00:00:57.180> time<00:00:57.300> on

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
was on Wi-Fi connection 5% time on

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.750 
was on Wi-Fi connection 5% time on
mobile<00:00:57.840> connection<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.399> see<00:00:59.460> on

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
mobile connection and as you can see on

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.569 
mobile connection and as you can see on
screen<00:01:00.000> time<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:01.020> 1<00:01:01.350> hour<00:01:01.379> 7<00:01:01.770> minutes<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.219> don't

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
screen time is 1 hour 7 minutes I don't

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.170 
screen time is 1 hour 7 minutes I don't
use<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.000> heavily<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.860> look<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.880> did

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
use it heavily but if you look at I did

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.020 
use it heavily but if you look at I did
play<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> lot<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.689> games<00:01:06.990> etc<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.189> one<00:01:08.400> so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
play a lot of games etc on this one so

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.820 
play a lot of games etc on this one so
regarding<00:01:09.510> battery<00:01:09.869> life<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.170> would<00:01:10.350> say<00:01:10.530> it's

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
regarding battery life I would say it's

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.880 
regarding battery life I would say it's
not<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.490> best<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.150> seen<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.619> can

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
not the best that I have seen but it can

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.429 
not the best that I have seen but it can
last<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.640> working<00:01:15.240> day<00:01:15.450> without<00:01:16.049> any

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
last you one working day without any

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.929 
last you one working day without any
issues<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.040> least<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> single<00:01:17.790> sim

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
issues at least with the single sim

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.609 
issues at least with the single sim
still<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.509> about<00:01:18.720> 32<00:01:19.049> percent<00:01:19.170> battery

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
still we have about 32 percent battery

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.149 
still we have about 32 percent battery
life

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
life

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.530 
life
another<00:01:20.490> good<00:01:20.610> thing<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.119> noticed

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
another good thing is that I noticed

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.600 
another good thing is that I noticed
that<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.960> standby<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.770> does<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:23.189> drain<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
that in standby it does not drain the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.730 
that in standby it does not drain the
black<00:01:23.820> battery<00:01:24.299> too<00:01:24.600> much<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> battery

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
black battery too much so the battery

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.370 
black battery too much so the battery
life<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.189> actually<00:01:26.759> pretty<00:01:27.060> decent<00:01:27.380> because

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
life is actually pretty decent because

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.460 
life is actually pretty decent because
earlier<00:01:28.770> Intel<00:01:29.250> Atom<00:01:29.840> chipsets<00:01:30.840> were<00:01:31.229> not

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
earlier Intel Atom chipsets were not

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.200 
earlier Intel Atom chipsets were not
great<00:01:31.740> at<00:01:31.920> battery<00:01:32.280> life<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:32.579> fortunately

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
great at battery life but fortunately

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.300 
great at battery life but fortunately
the<00:01:33.329> battery<00:01:33.600> life<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.810> sort<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.560> decent<00:01:35.009> at

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the battery life is sort of decent at

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.310 
the battery life is sort of decent at
least<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> single<00:01:36.180> sentence<00:01:36.450> also<00:01:36.780> this

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
least with a single sentence also this

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.499 
least with a single sentence also this
phone<00:01:37.560> does<00:01:37.890> support<00:01:38.220> USB<00:01:38.400> OTG<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.420> the
