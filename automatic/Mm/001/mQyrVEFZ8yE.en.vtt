00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.039 
I'll dye my real hair um sorry I don't
know<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.670> first<00:01:53.909> my<00:01:54.149> dad<00:01:54.329> my<00:01:54.540> real<00:01:54.570> hair<00:01:54.990> and

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
know so first my dad my real hair and

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.109 
know so first my dad my real hair and
then<00:01:55.350> I'm<00:01:55.439> gonna<00:01:55.560> dye<00:01:55.740> my<00:01:55.770> extensions<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:56.939> my

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
then I'm gonna dye my extensions but my

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.819 
then I'm gonna dye my extensions but my
extensions<00:01:57.689> they<00:01:57.810> always<00:01:58.110> pick<00:01:58.290> up<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> color

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
extensions they always pick up the color

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.770 
extensions they always pick up the color
a<00:01:58.920> lot<00:01:59.070> faster<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.969> I'll<00:02:00.090> probably<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.570> real

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
a lot faster so I'll probably do my real

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.480 
a lot faster so I'll probably do my real
hair<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.049> they<00:02:01.290> try<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.530> measure<00:02:02.250> my

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
hair and they try to measure my

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.160 
hair and they try to measure my
sentience<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.090> my<00:02:03.210> real<00:02:03.420> hair<00:02:03.659> instead<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.049> me

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
sentience to my real hair instead of me

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.660 
sentience to my real hair instead of me
trying<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.469> match<00:02:04.649> my<00:02:04.920> real<00:02:05.189> hair<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.579> my

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
trying to match my real hair to my

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
trying to match my real hair to my
extensions<00:02:06.180> which<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.689> much<00:02:06.840> easier<00:02:07.259> you

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
extensions which is so much easier you

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.700 
extensions which is so much easier you
take<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:08.099> only

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
take your only

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.020 
take your only
and<00:02:09.370> then<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:10.050> will<00:02:11.050> come<00:02:11.260> back<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.770> I'll<00:02:12.030> put
