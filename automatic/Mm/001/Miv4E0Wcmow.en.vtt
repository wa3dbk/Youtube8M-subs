00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
back here this is a boa retention system

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.720 
back here this is a boa retention system
and<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.580> cloth<00:03:12.820> around<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.270> in<00:03:13.420> multicam<00:03:14.730> it's

and the cloth around is in multicam it's
really<00:03:16.030> nice<00:03:16.210> because<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.840> adjust<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.350> you

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
really nice because to adjust it you

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.130 
really nice because to adjust it you
just<00:03:17.770> have<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:17.980> twist<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.690> then<00:03:19.690> when<00:03:20.050> you

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
just have to twist and then when you

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.540 
just have to twist and then when you
want<00:03:20.320> to<00:03:20.470> take<00:03:20.710> the<00:03:20.830> helmet<00:03:21.070> off<00:03:21.160> all<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.460> have

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
want to take the helmet off all you have

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.550 
want to take the helmet off all you have
to<00:03:21.640> do<00:03:21.760> is<00:03:21.940> pull<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.600> out<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.140> clicks<00:03:23.470> and

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
to do is pull it out and it clicks and

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.740 
to do is pull it out and it clicks and
it'll<00:03:23.800> automatically<00:03:24.310> go<00:03:25.120> back<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.450> as<00:03:25.570> loose

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
it'll automatically go back to as loose

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.770 
it'll automatically go back to as loose
as<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:26.050> can<00:03:26.170> be<00:03:26.320> I<00:03:27.120> really<00:03:28.120> like<00:03:28.270> that<00:03:28.450> system

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
as it can be I really like that system

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.530 
as it can be I really like that system
that<00:03:28.840> fits<00:03:29.170> really<00:03:29.350> tight<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:31.270> retention

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
that fits really tight the retention

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.320 
that fits really tight the retention
system<00:03:32.050> is<00:03:32.400> really<00:03:33.400> nice<00:03:33.610> I<00:03:33.880> think<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.180> works

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
system is really nice I think it works

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.690 
system is really nice I think it works
really<00:03:34.540> well<00:03:35.350> it's<00:03:35.620> one<00:03:35.740> of<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.890> best<00:03:36.400> things

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
really well it's one of the best things

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.590 
really well it's one of the best things
about<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:37.060> helmet<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.890> chinstrap<00:03:39.480> can<00:03:40.480> be

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
about this helmet the chinstrap can be

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.890 
about this helmet the chinstrap can be
adjusted<00:03:41.200> in<00:03:44.160> four<00:03:45.160> places<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.540> can<00:03:46.690> get<00:03:46.870> a

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
adjusted in four places so you can get a

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:55.290 
adjusted in four places so you can get a
perfect<00:03:47.380> fit<00:03:47.410> on<00:03:47.770> that<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:53.470> liner<00:03:53.740> of<00:03:54.700> this

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
perfect fit on that the liner of this

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.190 
perfect fit on that the liner of this
helmet<00:03:55.510> is<00:03:55.810> probably<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.500> best<00:03:56.709> thing<00:03:58.200> the

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
helmet is probably the best thing the

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.410 
helmet is probably the best thing the
helmet<00:03:59.530> overall<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.280> very<00:04:00.670> very<00:04:01.060> cool

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
helmet overall is very very cool

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.120 
helmet overall is very very cool
temperature<00:04:02.140> wise<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.300> pad<00:04:04.540> now

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
temperature wise so this is the pad now

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.360 
temperature wise so this is the pad now
this<00:04:06.130> is<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.250> only<00:04:06.370> pad<00:04:06.790> in<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.180> helmet<00:04:08.370> and

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
this is the only pad in the helmet and

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.000 
this is the only pad in the helmet and
then<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.670> has<00:04:09.820> it's<00:04:10.240> attached<00:04:10.540> by<00:04:10.720> velcro<00:04:11.020> the

then it has it's attached by velcro the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.710 
then it has it's attached by velcro the
liner<00:04:12.220> is<00:04:12.400> entirely<00:04:12.760> made<00:04:13.209> out<00:04:13.390> of<00:04:13.540> these

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
liner is entirely made out of these

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.660

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
want to put a different liner in which I

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.970 
want to put a different liner in which I
don't<00:04:46.180> think<00:04:46.450> there<00:04:46.600> is<00:04:46.720> but<00:04:46.990> this<00:04:47.500> liner<00:04:47.770> is

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
don't think there is but this liner is

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.490 
don't think there is but this liner is
very<00:04:48.190> cool<00:04:48.490> it's<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:49.330> most<00:04:49.510> high-tech<00:04:50.110> liner

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
very cool it's the most high-tech liner

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.220 
very cool it's the most high-tech liner
on<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:51.070> market

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
on the market

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.510

so<00:04:54.040> overall<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.870> helmet<00:04:56.200> is<00:04:56.320> very<00:04:57.310> high

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
so overall the helmet is very high

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.460 
so overall the helmet is very high
quality<00:04:58.410> for<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.500> price<00:04:59.530> it's<00:05:00.070> it<00:05:00.880> cost<00:05:01.150> about

$450
but<00:05:04.390> I<00:05:05.220> don't<00:05:06.220> see<00:05:06.310> any<00:05:06.460> problem<00:05:06.850> with<00:05:06.880> the
