00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
it's a just a syncopated pattern between

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.750 
it's a just a syncopated pattern between
the<00:00:37.050> cowbell<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> right<00:00:37.950> hand<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the cowbell with the right hand and the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.650 
the cowbell with the right hand and the
left<00:00:38.790> hand<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.210> moving<00:00:39.540> between

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
left hand is just moving between

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.180 
left hand is just moving between
basically<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> floor<00:00:40.590> time<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.980> first

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
basically the floor time and the first

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.740 
basically the floor time and the first
time<00:00:41.430> although<00:00:41.969> there's<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> few<00:00:42.480> different

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
time although there's a few different

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.270 
time although there's a few different
variations<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.710> involving

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
variations that you can do involving

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.400 
variations that you can do involving
either<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.760> middle<00:00:45.300> time<00:00:45.510> or<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> snare<00:00:46.110> drum<00:00:46.170> as

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
either a middle time or a snare drum as

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.080 
either a middle time or a snare drum as
well<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.430> feet<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.760> pretty<00:00:47.850> much<00:00:48.030> just

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
well and the feet are pretty much just

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.930 
well and the feet are pretty much just
playing<00:00:48.480> quarter<00:00:48.809> notes<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.110> all<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> beats

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
playing quarter notes on all the beats

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.310 
playing quarter notes on all the beats
okay<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.000> I'll<00:00:51.360> break<00:00:51.570> down<00:00:51.600> what<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> hands

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
okay so I'll break down what the hands

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.600 
okay so I'll break down what the hands
are<00:00:52.410> doing<00:00:52.590> first<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.370> hands

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
are doing first this is what the hands

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.430 
are doing first this is what the hands
are<00:00:53.699> doing<00:00:53.879> after<00:00:54.120> speed<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.199> I'll<00:00:55.320> just

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
are doing after speed and then I'll just

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.479 
are doing after speed and then I'll just
break<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.770> down<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.039> show<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.370> each

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
break it down and show you what each

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:06.910 
break it down and show you what each
hand<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.789> doing<00:00:57.000> individually

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.830 

okay<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.579> right<00:01:08.759> hand<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.270> playing<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
okay so the right hand is playing the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.420 
okay so the right hand is playing the
following<00:01:10.229> pattern<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:11.070> taught<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
following pattern it can be taught in a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.410 
following pattern it can be taught in a
couple<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.700> different<00:01:11.820> ways<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.360> be

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
couple of different ways it can be

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.060 
couple of different ways it can be
taught<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.869> sixteenth<00:01:13.380> notes<00:01:13.619> which<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.950> what

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
taught in sixteenth notes which is what

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.249 
taught in sixteenth notes which is what
I'm<00:01:14.159> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.430> today<00:01:14.610> or<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.689> lot<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.080> Latin

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
I'm going to do today or a lot of Latin

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.870 
I'm going to do today or a lot of Latin
American<00:01:16.619> rhythms<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.159> written<00:01:17.430> in

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
American rhythms you see written in

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.609 
American rhythms you see written in
quarter<00:01:18.299> notes<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.570> eighth<00:01:18.720> notes<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.350> in

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
quarter notes and eighth notes and in

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.260 
quarter notes and eighth notes and in
this<00:01:19.770> case<00:01:20.039> that<00:01:20.070> would<00:01:20.430> mean<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.789> this

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
this case that would mean that this

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.490 
this case that would mean that this
rhythm<00:01:21.570> would<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.810> written<00:01:21.990> over<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> space

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
rhythm would be written over the space

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.200 
rhythm would be written over the space
of<00:01:22.560> two<00:01:22.860> bars<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.640> I'm<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.789> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.030> teach

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
of two bars but I'm just going to teach

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.580 
of two bars but I'm just going to teach
it<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.509> within<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:25.049> bar<00:01:25.259> within

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
it to you within one bar within

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.550 
it to you within one bar within
sixteenth<00:01:26.100> notes<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> pattern<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.600> one

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
sixteenth notes so the pattern is one

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.240 
sixteenth notes so the pattern is one
and<00:01:28.890> two<00:01:29.520> E<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:29.970> A<00:01:30.420> three<00:01:30.479> E<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.080> four<00:01:31.740> E<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
and two E and A three E and four E and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.590 
and two E and A three E and four E and
AH<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:33.149> okay<00:01:34.080> one<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.039> two<00:01:35.610> E<00:01:35.789> and<00:01:35.850> three<00:01:36.240> E

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
AH one okay one and two E and three E

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:46.190 
AH one okay one and two E and three E
and<00:01:36.780> four<00:01:37.380> E<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:44.840> okay<00:01:45.840> that's<00:01:46.080> what

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and four E and a one okay that's what

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840 
and four E and a one okay that's what
the<00:01:46.289> right<00:01:46.440> hand<00:01:46.679> is<00:01:46.770> doing<00:01:47.039> and<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.700> get

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the right hand is doing and just to get

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.309 
the right hand is doing and just to get
used<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.539> to<00:01:48.600> start<00:01:48.869> out<00:01:49.080> nice

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
starting out with this pattern maybe

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.340 
starting out with this pattern maybe
once<00:02:20.280> again<00:02:20.579> just<00:02:21.359> play<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.750> over<00:02:21.930> quarter

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
with just to get used to what it feels

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.860 
with just to get used to what it feels
like<00:02:26.250> between<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.329> bass<00:02:27.480> drum<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.810> snare

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
the left hand is I like to start it on

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.250 
the left hand is I like to start it on
the<00:02:38.640> floor<00:02:38.819> time<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.239> just<00:02:39.359> go

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.809 

okay<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.560> first<00:02:46.709> time<00:02:47.010> through<00:02:47.250> you're

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
okay so the first time through you're

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.059 
okay so the first time through you're
going<00:02:48.000> floor<00:02:48.329> tom<00:02:48.540> first<00:02:48.959> home<00:02:49.230> floor<00:02:49.470> tom<00:02:49.680> the

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
going floor tom first home floor tom the

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.530 
going floor tom first home floor tom the
second<00:02:50.430> time<00:02:50.549> through<00:02:50.760> you're<00:02:51.090> going<00:02:51.239> first

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
second time through you're going first

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.479 
second time through you're going first
on<00:02:51.840> floor<00:02:52.439> tom<00:02:52.650> first<00:02:52.890> time<00:02:53.099> so<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.459> like

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
on floor tom first time so it's like

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:01.849 
on floor tom first time so it's like
this<00:02:59.659> okay<00:03:00.659> you<00:03:01.140> just<00:03:01.170> put<00:03:01.500> those<00:03:01.650> two

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
this okay you just put those two

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.140 
this okay you just put those two
together<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.310> you've<00:03:02.519> pretty<00:03:02.670> much<00:03:02.790> got<00:03:02.909> it

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
together and you've pretty much got it

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:11.149 
together and you've pretty much got it
you've<00:03:03.329> got<00:03:08.810> put<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:09.930> over<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.200> feet<00:03:10.439> one

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
you've got put that over the feet one

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:26.569 
you've got put that over the feet one
two<00:03:11.819> three<00:03:12.569> four<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:25.129> can<00:03:26.129> do<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.280> faster

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
two three four you can do it faster

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:34.520 
two three four you can do it faster
again<00:03:26.819> I<00:03:32.689> think<00:03:33.689> it's<00:03:33.810> it's<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.200> little<00:03:34.409> bit

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
again I think it's it's a little bit

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.569 
again I think it's it's a little bit
better<00:03:34.650> though<00:03:34.829> at<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.040> roundabout<00:03:40.159> okay<00:03:41.159> so<00:03:41.220> as

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
better though at a roundabout okay so as

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.679 
better though at a roundabout okay so as
I<00:03:41.670> said<00:03:41.819> at<00:03:41.939> the<00:03:41.970> start<00:03:42.209> there's<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.480> few

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
I said at the start there's a few

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:43.670 
I said at the start there's a few
different<00:03:42.930> things<00:03:43.049> that<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.290> can<00:03:43.409> do<00:03:43.560> with

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
different things that you can do with

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.080 
different things that you can do with
this<00:03:43.769> knee<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.069> don't<00:03:44.220> just<00:03:44.489> have<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.819> do<00:03:44.939> that

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
this knee you don't just have to do that

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.990 
this knee you don't just have to do that
sequence<00:03:45.599> of<00:03:45.720> going<00:03:46.019> floor<00:03:46.709> first<00:03:47.159> floor<00:03:47.730> and

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
sequence of going floor first floor and

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.789 
sequence of going floor first floor and
then<00:03:48.209> first<00:03:48.750> floor<00:03:49.049> first<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.410> can<00:03:49.530> move<00:03:49.680> the

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
then first floor first you can move the

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.349 
then first floor first you can move the
left<00:03:50.250> hand<00:03:50.340> around<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.699> snare<00:03:50.940> do<00:03:51.090> something

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
left hand around the snare do something

00:03:51.359 --> 00:04:00.170 
left hand around the snare do something
like<00:03:51.449> this

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.370 

or<00:04:01.180> you<00:04:01.300> can<00:04:01.420> even<00:04:01.510> leave<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.870> first<00:04:02.020> one<00:04:02.200> out

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
or you can even leave the first one out

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.360 
or you can even leave the first one out
if<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:02.560> want<00:04:02.740> just<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:02.980> do<00:04:03.070> something<00:04:03.220> like

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
if you want just to do something like

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:14.580 
if you want just to do something like
this<00:04:05.550> sorry<00:04:13.170> okay<00:04:14.170> so<00:04:14.230> there's<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.560> few

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
this sorry okay so there's a few

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.099 
this sorry okay so there's a few
different<00:04:14.950> options<00:04:15.540> one<00:04:16.540> other<00:04:16.750> thing<00:04:16.930> that<00:04:16.959> I

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
different options one other thing that I

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.380 
different options one other thing that I
want<00:04:17.290> to<00:04:17.350> talk<00:04:17.530> about<00:04:17.850> which<00:04:18.850> is<00:04:19.030> actually

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
want to talk about which is actually

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.080 
want to talk about which is actually
more<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:20.340> technique<00:04:21.340> thing<00:04:21.640> with<00:04:21.790> the<00:04:21.880> right

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
more a technique thing with the right

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.150 
more a technique thing with the right
hand<00:04:22.390> but<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.630> gets<00:04:23.230> this<00:04:23.350> really<00:04:23.650> nice<00:04:23.800> groove

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
hand but it gets this really nice groove

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.560 
hand but it gets this really nice groove
I<00:04:24.310> think<00:04:24.550> or<00:04:24.640> adds<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.120> groove<00:04:25.360> is

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
I think or adds to the groove is

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.750 
I think or adds to the groove is
whenever<00:04:26.470> I'm<00:04:26.770> playing<00:04:27.040> two<00:04:27.430> consecutive

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
whenever I'm playing two consecutive

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.400 
whenever I'm playing two consecutive
sixteenth<00:04:28.390> notes<00:04:28.600> with<00:04:28.780> in<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:28.990> right<00:04:29.170> hand

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
sixteenth notes with in the right hand

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.510 
sixteenth notes with in the right hand
pattern<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:29.950> happens<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.280> few<00:04:30.460> times

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
pattern and it happens a few times

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.330 
pattern and it happens a few times
particularly<00:04:31.120> towards<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.600> end<00:04:31.690> one<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.830> two

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
particularly towards the end one and two

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.540 
particularly towards the end one and two
II<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.600> e<00:04:34.630> is<00:04:35.050> one<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:35.560> then<00:04:35.650> you've<00:04:35.770> got

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.500 

okay<00:04:39.550> you've<00:04:39.670> got<00:04:39.790> three<00:04:40.090> doubles<00:04:40.450> at<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.660> end

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
okay you've got three doubles at the end

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.730 
okay you've got three doubles at the end
well<00:04:43.510> what<00:04:43.720> I'm<00:04:43.840> doing<00:04:44.140> there<00:04:44.320> it's<00:04:44.500> kind<00:04:44.680> of

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
well what I'm doing there it's kind of

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.320 
well what I'm doing there it's kind of
like<00:04:44.890> we<00:04:45.040> talked<00:04:45.220> about<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:45.670> know<00:04:46.090> playing

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
like we talked about you know playing

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.909 
like we talked about you know playing
funk<00:04:46.660> music<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:47.080> whatnot<00:04:47.200> with<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.530> hi-hat

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
funk music and whatnot with the hi-hat

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.010 
funk music and whatnot with the hi-hat
where<00:04:48.130> you<00:04:48.250> play<00:04:48.460> non<00:04:49.060> accents<00:04:49.570> with<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.810> tip

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
where you play non accents with the tip

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.510 
where you play non accents with the tip
of<00:04:50.140> the<00:04:50.200> stick<00:04:50.410> on<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.620> top<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:50.980> hi-hat<00:04:51.340> to

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
of the stick on the top of the hi-hat to

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.420 
of the stick on the top of the hi-hat to
get<00:04:51.640> that<00:04:51.820> softer<00:04:52.270> thinner<00:04:52.480> sound<00:04:52.810> and<00:04:53.430> then

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
get that softer thinner sound and then

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.650 
get that softer thinner sound and then
you<00:04:54.520> play<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.730> shoulder<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.300> stick<00:04:55.390> on

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
you play the shoulder of the stick on

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.000 
you play the shoulder of the stick on
the<00:04:55.780> edge<00:04:55.900> of<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.140> hi-hats<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.680> get<00:04:56.830> that

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
the edge of the hi-hats to get that

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.270 
the edge of the hi-hats to get that
louder<00:04:57.310> thicker<00:04:57.730> sound<00:04:58.770> well<00:04:59.770> I'm<00:04:59.919> kind<00:05:00.190> of

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
louder thicker sound well I'm kind of

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.890 
louder thicker sound well I'm kind of
doing<00:05:00.550> that<00:05:00.640> when<00:05:00.760> I<00:05:00.820> play<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.240> cowbell<00:05:01.750> as

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
doing that when I play the cowbell as

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.050 
doing that when I play the cowbell as
well<00:05:02.080> so<00:05:02.380> whenever<00:05:03.010> I'm<00:05:03.220> doing<00:05:03.400> a<00:05:03.610> double<00:05:03.760> I'm

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
well so whenever I'm doing a double I'm

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.330 
well so whenever I'm doing a double I'm
playing<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:04.390> first<00:05:04.630> of<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:04.960> double<00:05:05.290> as<00:05:06.010> the

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
playing the first of the double as the

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.530 
playing the first of the double as the
tip<00:05:06.550> of<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.760> stick<00:05:06.940> on<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.180> top<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:07.480> the

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
tip of the stick on the top of the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.070 
tip of the stick on the top of the
cowbell<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:09.060> then<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.210> next<00:05:10.600> note<00:05:10.840> I'm

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
cowbell and then the next note I'm

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.450 
cowbell and then the next note I'm
playing<00:05:11.590> with<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:11.950> shoulder<00:05:12.280> of<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.430> stick

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
playing with the shoulder of the stick

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.750 
playing with the shoulder of the stick
on<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:12.850> edge<00:05:13.380> which<00:05:14.380> once<00:05:15.190> again<00:05:15.370> is<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.550> much

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
on the edge which once again is a much

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.550 
on the edge which once again is a much
thicker<00:05:16.060> fuller<00:05:16.390> sound<00:05:16.750> so<00:05:17.350> I'm<00:05:17.470> getting<00:05:17.620> like

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
thicker fuller sound so I'm getting like

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.810 
thicker fuller sound so I'm getting like
rather<00:05:20.560> than<00:05:20.830> just<00:05:21.040> sort<00:05:21.130> of<00:05:21.220> monotone<00:05:21.669> the

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
rather than just sort of monotone the

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.360 
rather than just sort of monotone the
whole<00:05:22.000> way<00:05:22.120> through<00:05:22.150> same<00:05:22.570> dynamic<00:05:23.080> going

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
whole way through same dynamic going

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.890 
whole way through same dynamic going
and<00:05:25.490> there's<00:05:26.090> nothing<00:05:26.360> wrong<00:05:26.480> with<00:05:26.630> that<00:05:26.750> but

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
and there's nothing wrong with that but

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.210 
and there's nothing wrong with that but
I<00:05:26.990> just<00:05:27.020> I<00:05:27.290> just<00:05:27.500> think<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:27.830> gives<00:05:27.860> it<00:05:28.070> a<00:05:28.100> little

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
I just I just think it gives it a little

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.590 
I just I just think it gives it a little
bit<00:05:28.310> more<00:05:28.520> light<00:05:28.700> and<00:05:28.820> shade<00:05:29.000> if<00:05:29.180> you<00:05:29.210> throw<00:05:29.480> in

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
bit more light and shade if you throw in

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.060 
bit more light and shade if you throw in
a<00:05:29.660> few<00:05:29.810> dynamics<00:05:30.260> even<00:05:30.380> just<00:05:30.650> within<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:30.920> one

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
a few dynamics even just within the one

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.830 
a few dynamics even just within the one
hand<00:05:31.340> so<00:05:32.030> you<00:05:32.120> could<00:05:32.240> instead<00:05:32.600> of<00:05:32.720> it<00:05:32.810> being

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
hand so you could instead of it being

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:40.629 
hand so you could instead of it being
like<00:05:33.080> all<00:05:33.500> the<00:05:33.620> same<00:05:33.860> on<00:05:34.070> the<00:05:34.190> edge<00:05:34.340> going<00:05:39.639> or

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
like all the same on the edge going or

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:49.450 
like all the same on the edge going or
all<00:05:41.360> on<00:05:41.540> the<00:05:41.630> top<00:05:41.810> going<00:05:46.600> and<00:05:48.220> once<00:05:49.220> again

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
all on the top going and once again

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.740 
all on the top going and once again
that's<00:05:49.639> okay<00:05:50.000> if<00:05:50.150> you<00:05:50.240> want<00:05:50.389> to<00:05:50.419> do<00:05:50.570> that

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
that's okay if you want to do that

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.480 
that's okay if you want to do that
personally<00:05:51.620> I<00:05:51.680> like<00:05:51.830> to<00:05:51.919> kind<00:05:52.100> of<00:05:52.130> mix<00:05:52.280> it<00:05:52.430> up

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
personally I like to kind of mix it up

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.710 
personally I like to kind of mix it up
and<00:05:52.669> throw<00:05:52.820> a<00:05:52.850> little<00:05:53.090> bit<00:05:53.180> of<00:05:53.240> color<00:05:53.389> in<00:05:53.480> there

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
and throw a little bit of color in there

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:01.600 
and throw a little bit of color in there
so<00:05:53.870> you<00:05:53.930> get<00:05:54.080> like<00:05:59.980> and<00:06:00.980> that'll<00:06:01.130> be<00:06:01.250> like<00:06:01.430> this

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
so you get like and that'll be like this

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.860 
so you get like and that'll be like this
I<00:06:06.580> think<00:06:07.580> it's<00:06:07.850> just<00:06:07.970> got<00:06:08.180> it<00:06:08.419> just<00:06:08.630> feels<00:06:08.810> a

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
I think it's just got it just feels a

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.340 
I think it's just got it just feels a
little<00:06:08.900> bit

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
little bit

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:20.890 
little bit
groovy<00:06:10.220> if<00:06:10.370> you<00:06:10.520> do<00:06:10.669> that<00:06:19.540> the<00:06:20.540> same<00:06:20.690> thing

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
groovy if you do that the same thing

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.120 
groovy if you do that the same thing
would<00:06:21.020> apply<00:06:21.050> if<00:06:21.410> I<00:06:21.500> was<00:06:21.590> to<00:06:21.680> put<00:06:21.830> the<00:06:21.950> right

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
would apply if I was to put the right

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.200 
would apply if I was to put the right
hand<00:06:22.340> pattern<00:06:22.520> on<00:06:22.700> the<00:06:22.790> Bell

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
hand pattern on the Bell

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.600 
hand pattern on the Bell
rather<00:06:24.020> than<00:06:24.260> playing<00:06:24.500> every<00:06:24.919> single<00:06:24.950> note<00:06:25.460> on

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
rather than playing every single note on

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:33.240 
rather than playing every single note on
the<00:06:25.700> Bell<00:06:25.880> I<00:06:31.180> might<00:06:32.180> kind<00:06:32.330> of<00:06:32.450> put<00:06:32.660> those

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
the Bell I might kind of put those

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.110 
the Bell I might kind of put those
whenever<00:06:34.250> there's<00:06:34.400> a<00:06:34.460> double<00:06:34.729> I<00:06:34.790> might<00:06:34.940> put

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
whenever there's a double I might put

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.690 
whenever there's a double I might put
the<00:06:35.210> first<00:06:35.510> sort<00:06:35.840> of<00:06:35.930> more<00:06:36.140> with<00:06:36.290> the<00:06:36.380> tip<00:06:36.700> in

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
the first sort of more with the tip in

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.340 
the first sort of more with the tip in
the<00:06:37.880> bow<00:06:38.240> somewhere<00:06:38.750> on<00:06:38.870> the<00:06:38.930> ride<00:06:39.110> and<00:06:39.140> go

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
the bow somewhere on the ride and go

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.749 
the bow somewhere on the ride and go
more<00:06:39.590> like

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.159 

or<00:06:45.759> maybe<00:06:46.000> a<00:06:46.090> combination<00:06:46.270> of<00:06:46.689> both<00:06:46.750> and<00:06:47.080> that

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
or maybe a combination of both and that

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:59.520 
or maybe a combination of both and that
would<00:06:47.259> be<00:06:47.349> like<00:06:47.500> this<00:06:57.360> okay<00:06:58.360> so<00:06:58.419> that's<00:06:58.960> a<00:06:59.050> few

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
would be like this okay so that's a few

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.140 
would be like this okay so that's a few
little<00:06:59.770> tips<00:07:00.520> on<00:07:00.639> how<00:07:00.789> to<00:07:00.819> play<00:07:01.030> the

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
little tips on how to play the
