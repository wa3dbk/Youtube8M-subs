a normal motorway in every day traffic
conditions<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.900> think<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:27.990> really

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
conditions I think it's really

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.599 
conditions I think it's really
impressive<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.769> think<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:28.980> spent<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.279> last<00:00:29.429> two

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
impressive I think we spent the last two

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.740 
impressive I think we spent the last two
and<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.730> half<00:00:29.880> years<00:00:30.119> developing<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
and a half years developing a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.179 
and a half years developing a
demonstrator<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.740> able<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
demonstrator and to be able to get that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.180 
demonstrator and to be able to get that
out<00:00:32.399> onto<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> public<00:00:33.420> highway<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.680> show<00:00:34.980> L

actually<00:00:35.460> work<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.300> really

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
actually work is really really

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.900 
actually work is really really
impressive<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.440> very<00:00:37.500> pleased<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
impressive and very pleased and the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.229 
impressive and very pleased and the
advantages<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.780> Road<00:00:39.960> train<00:00:39.989> are<00:00:40.500> many

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
advantages of a Road train are many

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.819 
advantages of a Road train are many
convenient<00:00:42.239> since<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.320> something<00:00:43.530> else

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
convenient since I can do something else

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.090 
convenient since I can do something else
that<00:00:44.040> than<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.550> actual<00:00:44.700> driving<00:00:45.649> safe<00:00:46.649> since

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
that than the actual driving safe since

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.619 
that than the actual driving safe since
the<00:00:47.219> system<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:47.789> take<00:00:48.000> care<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.360> driving

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the system will take care of the driving

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.290 
the system will take care of the driving
it<00:00:49.020> will<00:00:49.200> eliminate<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.860> human<00:00:50.160> errors<00:00:50.789> and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
it will eliminate the human errors and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.709 
it will eliminate the human errors and
then<00:00:51.930> fuel-efficient<00:00:52.800> since<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.969> use<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> minor

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
then fuel-efficient since we use a minor

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.959 
then fuel-efficient since we use a minor
gap<00:00:55.110> size<00:00:55.440> between<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.100> vehicles<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.789> will

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
gap size between the vehicles we will

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.849 
gap size between the vehicles we will
reduce<00:00:57.329> air<00:00:57.629> drag<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.170> thereby<00:00:58.440> fuel

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
reduce air drag and thereby fuel

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.240 
reduce air drag and thereby fuel
consumption<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.989> aim<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.620> test<00:01:01.949> just

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
consumption the aim of this test just

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.609 
consumption the aim of this test just
outside<00:01:02.640> Barcelona<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.989> acquire<00:01:04.320> more

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
outside Barcelona is to acquire more

driving the car but reading a magazine

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.600 
driving the car but reading a magazine
they<00:01:37.940> will<00:01:38.140> burn<00:01:39.140> back<00:01:39.470> it's<00:01:39.800> easier<00:01:40.370> actually

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
they will burn back it's easier actually

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.040 
they will burn back it's easier actually

not driving the researchers want to find

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.860 
not driving the researchers want to find
out<00:01:45.230> how<00:01:45.500> both<00:01:45.710> drivers<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.430> passengers

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
out how both drivers and passengers

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.240 
out how both drivers and passengers
experience<00:01:47.870> sitting<00:01:48.140> in<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.440> car<00:01:48.680> at<00:01:48.800> 85

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
controlled by somebody else I think it

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.770 
controlled by somebody else I think it
gets<00:01:55.040> easier<00:01:55.729> as<00:01:55.850> time<00:01:55.880> progresses<00:01:56.479> and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
gets easier as time progresses and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.120 
gets easier as time progresses and
people<00:01:57.080> become<00:01:57.380> more<00:01:57.410> familiar<00:01:57.740> with<00:01:57.979> the

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
people become more familiar with the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.730 
people become more familiar with the
technology<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.910> they<00:01:59.479> accept<00:02:00.050> it<00:02:00.260> more<00:02:00.410> I

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
technology and they accept it more I

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.190 
technology and they accept it more I
think<00:02:01.220> as<00:02:01.540> generations<00:02:02.540> progress<00:02:02.960> they

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
think as generations progress they

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.620 
think as generations progress they
become<00:02:03.530> more<00:02:03.740> familiar<00:02:03.830> with<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.400> more

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
become more familiar with it and more

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.109 
become more familiar with it and more
