00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.149 
level is maximum blow least ki is always
growing<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> he's<00:01:36.990> probably<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.740> strongest

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
growing so he's probably the strongest

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.370 
growing so he's probably the strongest
character<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.790> Dragon<00:01:39.180> Ball<00:01:39.210> Z<00:01:39.360> even<00:01:39.780> after

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
character in Dragon Ball Z even after

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.270 
character in Dragon Ball Z even after
beerus<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:40.950> wheeze<00:01:42.740> beerus<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.890> whis<00:01:43.979> are

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
beerus and wheeze beerus and whis are

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.889 
beerus and wheeze beerus and whis are
just<00:01:44.460> lucky<00:01:44.640> Broly<00:01:45.119> wasn't<00:01:45.600> there<00:01:45.750> because

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
just lucky Broly wasn't there because

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.010 
just lucky Broly wasn't there because
Broly<00:01:46.320> could<00:01:46.649> kick<00:01:46.890> their<00:01:47.100> butt<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:48.020> he's

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
Broly could kick their butt because he's

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.870 
Broly could kick their butt because he's
been<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> big<00:01:49.500> pile<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.799> sludge<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> long

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
been a big pile of sludge for a long

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.410 
been a big pile of sludge for a long
time<00:01:51.180> now<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.479> his<00:01:51.930> ki<00:01:52.170> never<00:01:52.439> stops<00:01:52.799> growing

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
time now and his ki never stops growing

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.030 
time now and his ki never stops growing
so<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.630> probably<00:01:54.990> grown<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.530> more<00:01:55.710> than

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
so it's probably grown to more than

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.870 
so it's probably grown to more than
whatever<00:01:56.369> beerus<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:58.640> Rolly<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.880> God<00:02:00.210> I

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
whatever beerus is is Rolly is God I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.999 
whatever beerus is is Rolly is God I
