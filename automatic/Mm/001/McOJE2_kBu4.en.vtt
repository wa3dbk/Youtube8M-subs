 wednesday kids day so I'm going 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.069
 be brief because it's the day of the center 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.059
 of leisure and I am very expected because 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.709
 I 'm doing a one man show 

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:09.360
 every week so we are the 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.110
 Wednesday, November 6, 2013 and this is the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:23.070
 french news of the day 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:25.019
 it's gone for all those who had the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.460
 chance to receive nexus 5 one of 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.320
 features they should have noticed 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.029
 and his beautiful home screen with his 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.679
 application launcher this one is not 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.720
 not related to android 4.4 but actually to 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.730
 nexus 5 for whom this interface has been 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.590
 specially designed it benefits from the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.270
 power of google search and google 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.490
 now and brings a real added value to 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.900
 last born of google manufactured by lg and 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.610
 which makes it a smartphone that does not 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.710
 looks like no other device on the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.970
 market and according to the verge that has 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.070
 today one of the engineers at 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.690
 google and project manager nexus 5 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.740
 this home screen and this launcher 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.450
 applications should remain a 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.700
 nexus exclusivity 5 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.380
 even if the technical feasibility exists 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.670
 especially for nexus 4 and 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.920
 possibly with a distribution 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.750
 possible wider on the plextor these 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.399
 laws our fact since google should 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.049
 book it to his last baby and 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.729
 since you ask us the question all 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.770
 the days I remind you the state of the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.539
 places if you skip the order the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.070
 version 16 giga is still refugee on 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.079
 the playsport but it is now 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.179
 available immediately at bouygues 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.820
 telecom but at a price of 449 euros 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.439
 it's more expensive but it is available on 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.240
 french manufacturer wilko is in the process of 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.740
 to make a cardboard in our country according to 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 a study published by the gfk institute 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.619
 he's even now in third place 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.819
 smartphone manufacturers sold 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.469
 excluding operator pack 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.090
 and yes we do not risk stopping 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.079
 in so good way after several models 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.729
 entry level products that have made 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.109
 it is today towards the highest of 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.399
 range that the manufacturer Marseille 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.140
 wants to try his luck 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.329
 it is indeed today the exit of the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.189
 dark pools a beautiful smartphone 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.350

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.200
 has a full hd screen 2 5 inches a 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.179
 quad core processor of 1.5 gigahertz 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.590
 it runs under android jelly bean 4.2.1 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.270
 but in stock version 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.429

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.439
 operator or builders and he owns 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.929

 double sim has two gigas of ram and 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.100
 16 go of rom and not extensible the dark 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.200
 pools ultimately only has one 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.840
 true defect it is not 4g and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.030
 stops at h + but its price is canon 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.650
 it is indeed sold 269 euros without 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.849
 subscription it should get noticed 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.430
 in any case we received it yesterday 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.660
 and we will test it for you to follow if 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.890
 your neighbor stops you every day 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.480
 on the landing to ask you for 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.680
 computer consulting if you do not 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.810
 can learn more about doing 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.099
 paper casseroles to children or if 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.450
 you have a real talent for you 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.640
 make up without looking like a car 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.319
 stolen you are ready or ready for it 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.690
 not August and you will probably win 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.220
 money launched yesterday by google but 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.200
 for now on invitation 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.819
 el-ma'out is a service that helps 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.430
 create video conferencing that can 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.200
 be free but also pay and this 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.090
 so that experts can share 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.160
 their skills live and in video 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.530
 thanks to an August guy the solution of 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.450
 videoconference google trainings 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.069
 may be charged per minute or 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.720
 assignment for trainers it is 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.849
 possible to share his perfect screen 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.160
 for a tutorial on a software and 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.170
 each trainer will have his own page which 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.110
 summarize the services they offer 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.030
 and its rates by its simplicity and 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.470
 her interactivity she poses should 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.060
 to create many vocations 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.769
 but again possessing 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.849
 skills is one thing know the 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.650
 transmit is another 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.760
 the question of the day comes from david 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.410
 who asks us when is he from 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.310
 facetime interoperability with 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.230
 other bones 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.430
 in clear facetime can it work 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.440
 on windows or android 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.150
 well dear david the answer is no and 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.489
 yes facetime is a proprietary format 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.900
 that allows you to capture to transfer 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.549
 video data but that is not 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.930
 open to other bones or developers this 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.819
 which also allows apple to ensure 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.290
 cross-promotion of these devices 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.849
 both fixed and mobile by putting 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.430
 especially before the qualities of 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.720
 facetime launched in 2010 facetime was at 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.639
 start compatible with the wifi 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.049
 only it was mainly a 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.370
 willingness of mobile operators who 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.079
 were afraid of a traffic explosion 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.209
 data on their networks but 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.040
 finally facing the competition and because 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.120
 he was soon cracked facetime 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.280
 now works so 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.079
 official on mobile networks its 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.819
 main competitors tsonga tools of 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.709
 google and skype from microsoft who them 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.000
 are available on all platforms 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.799
 freche or at the end for today 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.209
 we'll meet again tomorrow with new 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.930
 still accuses fresh hi to 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.930
 all and have a good day
