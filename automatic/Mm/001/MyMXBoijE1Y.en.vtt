another quick tip that will also help
with<00:00:35.690> more<00:00:36.690> accurate<00:00:37.140> framing<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.219> what<00:00:38.370> I've

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
with more accurate framing so what I've

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.410 
with more accurate framing so what I've
done<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:39.410> I<00:00:40.410> take<00:00:40.559> my<00:00:40.620> bottom<00:00:41.190> plate<00:00:41.460> which<00:00:42.239> is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
done is I take my bottom plate which is

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.389 
done is I take my bottom plate which is
the<00:00:42.629> bottom<00:00:42.829> 2x4<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:45.690> framing<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.620> my<00:00:47.190> top

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
the bottom 2x4 on the framing and my top

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.389 
the bottom 2x4 on the framing and my top
plate<00:00:47.700> which<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.870> top<00:00:49.110> 2<00:00:49.680> by<00:00:49.710> 4<00:00:50.129> on

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
plate which is the the top 2 by 4 on

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.630 
plate which is the the top 2 by 4 on
your<00:00:50.789> framing<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.309> example

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
your framing and here in this example

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.310 
your framing and here in this example
it's<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.239> bit<00:00:54.360> more<00:00:54.510> complicated

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it's a little bit more complicated

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.569 
it's a little bit more complicated
basically<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:57.000> header<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> top

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
basically this header here is the top

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.580 
basically this header here is the top
plate<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.940> these<00:01:00.239> two<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:01.020> at<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> bottom

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
plate and these two here at the bottom

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.690 
plate and these two here at the bottom
plate<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:03.530> what<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.559> did<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.040> lined<00:01:05.430> them<00:01:05.549> up

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
plate and what I did is I lined them up

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.039 
plate and what I did is I lined them up
and<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.590> quickly<00:01:08.220> clamped<00:01:08.939> them<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.390> then

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and I just quickly clamped them and then

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.380 
and I just quickly clamped them and then
I<00:01:10.110> went<00:01:10.260> along<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.400> marked<00:01:11.700> where<00:01:12.000> my<00:01:12.119> studs

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
I went along and I marked where my studs

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.410 
I went along and I marked where my studs
are<00:01:12.510> gonna<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.430> I'm<00:01:14.580> marking<00:01:14.760> my<00:01:15.119> top

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
are gonna be and so I'm marking my top

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.330 
are gonna be and so I'm marking my top
and<00:01:15.689> bottom<00:01:15.780> plate<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> exact<00:01:16.830> same<00:01:17.009> time

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and bottom plate at the exact same time

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.999 
and bottom plate at the exact same time
so<00:01:17.640> they'll<00:01:18.479> land<00:01:18.780> exactly<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.439> same<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.979> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
so they'll land exactly the same so I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.700 
so they'll land exactly the same so I
know<00:01:20.130> they'll<00:01:20.369> be<00:01:20.400> straight<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.990> then<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.560> go

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
know they'll be straight and then I go

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
know they'll be straight and then I go
along<00:01:23.060> there's<00:01:24.060> another<00:01:24.479> stud<00:01:25.909> another<00:01:26.909> stud

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
along there's another stud another stud

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.710 
along there's another stud another stud
and<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.560> get<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.920> wall<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.060> window

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and then I get to a wall for a window

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.600 
and then I get to a wall for a window
framing<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.740> notice<00:01:32.040> here<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:34.070> marked<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
framing you notice here I marked the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.210 
framing you notice here I marked the
bottom<00:01:35.880> plate<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> line<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.920> top

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
bottom plate here with a line the top

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.580 
bottom plate here with a line the top
plate<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> line<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.229> means<00:01:40.409> that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
plate here with the line that means that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.679 
plate here with the line that means that
there's<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.829> study<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.220> from<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.520> bottom<00:01:41.880> to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
there's a study going from the bottom to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.950 
there's a study going from the bottom to
the<00:01:42.750> top<00:01:43.040> but<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.189> next<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.820> stopped<00:01:45.240> at

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the top but then next to it I stopped at

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.620 
the top but then next to it I stopped at
the<00:01:46.140> bottom<00:01:46.409> plate<00:01:46.829> there's<00:01:47.490> no<00:01:47.700> line<00:01:47.909> here<00:01:48.509> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the bottom plate there's no line here I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.889 
the bottom plate there's no line here I
had<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.320> top<00:01:49.500> plate<00:01:49.740> reason<00:01:50.729> being<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.210> what

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
had the top plate reason being and what

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.260 
had the top plate reason being and what
that<00:01:52.049> lets<00:01:52.170> me<00:01:52.530> know<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.700> there's<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.030> stud

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that lets me know is that there's a stud

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.999 
that lets me know is that there's a stud
that<00:01:54.420> starts<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.409> doesn't<00:01:55.560> go<00:01:55.770> all

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
that starts here but it doesn't go all

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.569 
that starts here but it doesn't go all
the<00:01:56.219> way<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> top<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.219> I've

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the way to the top so now that I've

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.520 
the way to the top so now that I've
marked<00:01:59.820> my<00:02:00.030> top<00:02:00.630> plate<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:00.899> bottom<00:02:01.320> plate

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
marked my top plate and bottom plate

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.980 
marked my top plate and bottom plate
what<00:02:01.740> I'm<00:02:01.860> gonna<00:02:02.009> do<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.759> I'm<00:02:03.509> gonna<00:02:03.630> go<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.869> my

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to my

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.749 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to my
plans<00:02:04.409> here<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.329> then<00:02:06.329> I'm<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.550> cut<00:02:08.550> all

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
plans here and then I'm going to cut all

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.030 
plans here and then I'm going to cut all
my<00:02:09.209> studs<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> right<00:02:10.679> length

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
my studs to the right length

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.860 
my studs to the right length
all<00:02:12.310> right<00:02:12.519> so<00:02:12.700> now<00:02:12.849> that<00:02:13.060> now<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.569> I've

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
all right so now that now that I've

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.280 
all right so now that now that I've
marked<00:02:14.049> my<00:02:14.430> top<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.459> bottom<00:02:15.670> plates<00:02:16.150> I've<00:02:16.870> cut

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
marked my top and bottom plates I've cut

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.179 
marked my top and bottom plates I've cut
the<00:02:17.469> outside<00:02:17.620> boards<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:19.019> basically<00:02:20.159> what<00:02:21.159> I

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
the outside boards and basically what I

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.349 
the outside boards and basically what I
found<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.909> makes<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.329> lot<00:02:22.510> easier<00:02:22.930> if<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:24.459> do

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
found is it makes a lot easier if you do

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.660 
found is it makes a lot easier if you do
the<00:02:25.569> top<00:02:25.870> plate<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.319> bottom<00:02:26.590> plate<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
the top plate the bottom plate and the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.970 
the top plate the bottom plate and the
2n<00:02:28.120> sides<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.930> then<00:02:29.079> you<00:02:29.140> check<00:02:29.379> it<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.950> make

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
2n sides and then you check it to make

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.929 
2n sides and then you check it to make
sure<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.340> have<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.489> perfect<00:02:30.939> square<00:02:31.269> or<00:02:31.510> a

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
sure you have a perfect square or a

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.179 
sure you have a perfect square or a
perfect<00:02:33.939> rectangle<00:02:34.709> make<00:02:35.709> sure<00:02:35.859> that<00:02:36.010> all

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
perfect rectangle make sure that all

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:41.220 
perfect rectangle make sure that all
your<00:02:36.400> dimensions<00:02:36.670> are<00:02:39.420> correct<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.750> your

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
your dimensions are correct on your

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.649 
your dimensions are correct on your
outside<00:02:41.680> edges<00:02:41.889> and<00:02:42.370> then<00:02:42.700> fill<00:02:43.120> in<00:02:43.359> the

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
outside edges and then fill in the

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.899 
outside edges and then fill in the
middle<00:02:44.139> there<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:44.560> what<00:02:45.069> I'll<00:02:45.189> do<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.670> I'll

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
middle there and what I'll do is I'll

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.020 
middle there and what I'll do is I'll
use<00:02:46.889> screws<00:02:47.889> to<00:02:48.189> put<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.430> all<00:02:48.609> the<00:02:48.760> other<00:02:48.879> at

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
use screws to put it all the other at

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.229 
use screws to put it all the other at
first<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:50.530> once<00:02:50.709> it's<00:02:50.859> all<00:02:50.980> together<00:02:51.239> then

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
first and once it's all together then

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.640 
first and once it's all together then
I'll<00:02:52.389> check<00:02:52.659> it<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:55.180> know<00:02:55.269> doing<00:02:55.650> height

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
I'll check it and you know doing height

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.050 
I'll check it and you know doing height
width<00:02:57.159> and<00:02:57.489> then<00:02:58.060> cross<00:02:58.989> corner<00:02:59.530> corner<00:02:59.859> and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
width and then cross corner corner and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.940 
width and then cross corner corner and
then<00:03:01.060> if<00:03:01.209> everything<00:03:01.599> is<00:03:01.810> good<00:03:02.109> then<00:03:02.560> I'll

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
then if everything is good then I'll

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.830 
then if everything is good then I'll
actually<00:03:03.159> go<00:03:03.400> through<00:03:03.579> and<00:03:03.730> nail<00:03:03.909> it<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.269> if

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
actually go through and nail it and if

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.649 
actually go through and nail it and if
there's<00:03:05.049> any<00:03:05.260> problems<00:03:06.329> then<00:03:07.329> you<00:03:07.359> can

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
there's any problems then you can

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.990 
there's any problems then you can
quickly<00:03:07.930> take<00:03:08.530> out<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.680> screw<00:03:09.010> adjust<00:03:09.579> it<00:03:09.760> and

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
quickly take out a screw adjust it and

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.699 
quickly take out a screw adjust it and
no<00:03:10.269> problem<00:03:12.120> now<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.150> went<00:03:13.480> ahead<00:03:13.569> and<00:03:13.930> cut<00:03:14.139> all

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
no problem now I went ahead and cut all

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.800 
no problem now I went ahead and cut all
of<00:03:14.769> my<00:03:16.169> middle<00:03:17.169> beams<00:03:17.349> already<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:18.690> what<00:03:19.690> I'm

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
of my middle beams already and what I'm

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.050 
of my middle beams already and what I'm
gonna<00:03:19.959> do<00:03:20.199> next<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:21.040> they're<00:03:21.669> just<00:03:21.699> stacked

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
gonna do next is they're just stacked

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.409 
gonna do next is they're just stacked
here<00:03:22.329> but<00:03:22.540> what<00:03:23.470> I'm<00:03:23.560> gonna<00:03:23.680> go<00:03:23.949> do<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.299> go

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
here but what I'm gonna go do is it go

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.180 
here but what I'm gonna go do is it go
through<00:03:25.659> them<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.199> I'm<00:03:26.650> going<00:03:26.799> to<00:03:26.829> determine

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
through them and I'm going to determine

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.280 
through them and I'm going to determine
which<00:03:28.090> way<00:03:28.389> they<00:03:29.319> crown<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.900> for<00:03:31.900> those<00:03:32.079> of

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
which way they crown and for those of

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.479 
which way they crown and for those of
you<00:03:32.379> don't<00:03:32.500> know<00:03:32.590> what<00:03:32.650> crown<00:03:32.919> is<00:03:33.099> basically

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
you don't know what crown is basically

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.080 
you don't know what crown is basically
it's<00:03:33.669> the<00:03:33.879> bow<00:03:34.090> so<00:03:35.159> boards<00:03:36.159> they're<00:03:36.699> not<00:03:36.879> all

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
it's the bow so boards they're not all

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.629 
it's the bow so boards they're not all
perfectly<00:03:37.569> straight<00:03:37.840> they<00:03:37.959> have<00:03:38.109> a<00:03:38.139> cup<00:03:38.639> to

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
perfectly straight they have a cup to

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.860 
perfectly straight they have a cup to
them<00:03:39.819> like<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.269> usually<00:03:41.169> and<00:03:42.180> sometimes<00:03:43.180> the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
them like this usually and sometimes the

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.939 
them like this usually and sometimes the
board<00:03:44.079> is<00:03:44.139> pretty<00:03:44.319> good<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:44.680> it's<00:03:44.799> difficult

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949 
board is pretty good so it's difficult

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.860 
board is pretty good so it's difficult
to<00:03:45.250> determine<00:03:45.790> which<00:03:45.940> way<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.479> goes<00:03:46.510> but<00:03:48.870> what

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
to determine which way it goes but what

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.469 
to determine which way it goes but what
you<00:03:49.989> want<00:03:50.169> to<00:03:50.260> do<00:03:50.409> is<00:03:50.650> make<00:03:50.889> sure<00:03:50.919> that<00:03:51.220> all<00:03:52.060> of

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:52.479 
you want to do is make sure that all of

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.830 
you want to do is make sure that all of
the<00:03:52.959> bows<00:03:53.290> or<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:54.430> crowns<00:03:54.760> are<00:03:55.180> pointed

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
the bows or the the crowns are pointed

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.059 
the bows or the the crowns are pointed
in<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.989> same<00:03:56.019> direction<00:03:56.199> when<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:56.889> frame

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
in the same direction when you frame

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.610 
in the same direction when you frame
your<00:03:57.220> wall<00:03:58.199> so<00:03:59.340> that<00:04:00.340> when<00:04:00.489> you<00:04:00.609> tilt<00:04:00.849> it<00:04:01.030> up

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
your wall so that when you tilt it up

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.009 
your wall so that when you tilt it up
it's<00:04:02.620> all<00:04:02.979> very<00:04:03.340> straight<00:04:03.760> because<00:04:04.239> it's<00:04:04.510> very

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
it's all very straight because it's very

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.409 
it's all very straight because it's very
consistent<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.769> don't<00:04:05.949> have<00:04:06.159> a<00:04:06.489> crown<00:04:07.030> going

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
consistent you don't have a crown going

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.689 
consistent you don't have a crown going
one<00:04:07.599> direction<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:08.409> a<00:04:08.949> crown<00:04:09.340> going<00:04:09.579> in<00:04:09.639> a

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
one direction and a crown going in a

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.569 
one direction and a crown going in a
different<00:04:09.819> direction<00:04:11.129> all<00:04:12.129> right<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.519> you

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
different direction all right so you

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.670 
different direction all right so you
what<00:04:12.849> you<00:04:12.939> want<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.239> do<00:04:13.419> is<00:04:13.840> go<00:04:14.290> through<00:04:14.319> all<00:04:14.560> of

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
what you want to do is go through all of

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.879 
what you want to do is go through all of
your<00:04:14.919> studs<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:16.180> look<00:04:16.989> for<00:04:17.229> where<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.500> bow<00:04:17.680> is

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
your studs and look for where the bow is

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.420 
your studs and look for where the bow is
and<00:04:18.250> there's<00:04:18.880> actually<00:04:19.389> a<00:04:19.630> bow<00:04:20.340> coming<00:04:21.340> out

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
and there's actually a bow coming out

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.129 
and there's actually a bow coming out
this<00:04:21.549> way<00:04:21.789> it's<00:04:22.479> hard<00:04:22.659> to<00:04:22.750> tell<00:04:22.900> on<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.110> camera

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
this way it's hard to tell on the camera

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.879 
this way it's hard to tell on the camera
this<00:04:24.010> isn't<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.430> very

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
this isn't a very

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.629 
this isn't a very
good<00:04:25.400> lens<00:04:25.639> but<00:04:26.419> basically<00:04:26.810> it's<00:04:27.430> pushing<00:04:28.430> out

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
good lens but basically it's pushing out

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.089 
good lens but basically it's pushing out
that<00:04:28.879> way<00:04:29.030> ever<00:04:29.270> so<00:04:29.629> slightly<00:04:29.870> so<00:04:30.860> what<00:04:31.009> we're

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
that way ever so slightly so what we're

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.110 
that way ever so slightly so what we're
gonna<00:04:31.159> do<00:04:31.370> is<00:04:31.490> we're<00:04:31.610> gonna<00:04:31.669> mark<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:34.120> triangle

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
gonna do is we're gonna mark a triangle

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.770 
gonna do is we're gonna mark a triangle
in<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.360> direction<00:04:35.599> of<00:04:35.719> the<00:04:35.810> bow<00:04:37.090> like<00:04:38.090> so<00:04:38.120> and

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
in the direction of the bow like so and

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.520 
in the direction of the bow like so and
then<00:04:39.259> we<00:04:39.379> know<00:04:39.560> which<00:04:39.800> way<00:04:40.599> to<00:04:41.599> lay<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.229> studs

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
then we know which way to lay the studs

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.860 
then we know which way to lay the studs
so<00:04:42.949> when<00:04:43.099> we<00:04:43.250> start<00:04:43.460> framing<00:04:43.939> so<00:04:44.599> we're<00:04:44.750> going

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
so when we start framing so we're going

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.770 
so when we start framing so we're going
to<00:04:44.930> do<00:04:45.020> this<00:04:45.139> for<00:04:45.409> all<00:04:45.650> of<00:04:46.039> our<00:04:46.490> studs<00:04:46.819> for<00:04:47.629> this

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
to do this for all of our studs for this

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.180 
to do this for all of our studs for this
wall<00:04:48.219> and<00:04:49.219> we'll<00:04:49.759> go<00:04:49.879> from<00:04:50.000> there
