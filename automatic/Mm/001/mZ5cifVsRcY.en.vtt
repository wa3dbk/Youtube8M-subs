it<00:02:10.920> seems<00:02:11.340> like<00:02:11.520> she's<00:02:11.849> alluding<00:02:12.510> where

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
it seems like she's alluding where

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.280 
it seems like she's alluding where
well<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.510> seemed<00:02:13.660> like<00:02:13.780> she's<00:02:13.900> not<00:02:14.020> closing

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
well it seemed like she's not closing

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.020 
well it seemed like she's not closing
the<00:02:14.500> door<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.890> there<00:02:15.010> being<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.250> possibility<00:02:15.940> of

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
the door to there being a possibility of

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.030 
the door to there being a possibility of
new<00:02:16.180> titans<00:02:16.570> but<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:16.990> of<00:02:17.410> right<00:02:17.470> now<00:02:17.620> they

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
new titans but as of right now they

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.100 
new titans but as of right now they
don't<00:02:18.070> really<00:02:18.430> plan<00:02:18.730> on<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.360> mean<00:02:19.750> for<00:02:20.050> all

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
don't really plan on it I mean for all

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.400 
don't really plan on it I mean for all
that<00:02:20.320> we<00:02:20.380> know<00:02:20.650> there<00:02:20.860> could<00:02:21.040> very<00:02:21.250> well<00:02:21.640> be

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
that we know there could very well be

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.630 
that we know there could very well be
some<00:02:23.410> new<00:02:23.500> times<00:02:23.740> plan<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.310> they<00:02:24.370> still<00:02:24.520> want

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
some new times plan and they still want

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.340 
some new times plan and they still want
announced<00:02:24.910> yet<00:02:25.090> but<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.720> was<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> really<00:02:26.050> sort

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
announced yet but it was a really sort

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.000 
announced yet but it was a really sort
of<00:02:26.410> maybe<00:02:27.370> but<00:02:28.030> probably<00:02:28.780> not<00:02:29.050> anytime<00:02:29.800> soon

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
of maybe but probably not anytime soon

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.980 
of maybe but probably not anytime soon
so<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:30.940> pretty<00:02:31.360> sure<00:02:31.510> it's<00:02:31.630> safe<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.900> assume

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
so I pretty sure it's safe to assume

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.720 
so I pretty sure it's safe to assume
that<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> first<00:02:32.770> DLC<00:02:33.160> pack<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.520> will

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
that in the first DLC pack that will

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.760 
that in the first DLC pack that will
beginning<00:02:33.970> sometime<00:02:34.240> in<00:02:34.570> spring<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:35.710> year

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
beginning sometime in spring this year

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.590 
beginning sometime in spring this year
that<00:02:36.520> will<00:02:36.670> definitely<00:02:36.880> not<00:02:37.120> be<00:02:37.180> having<00:02:37.360> any

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
that will definitely not be having any

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.450 
that will definitely not be having any
new<00:02:37.780> Titans<00:02:38.110> but<00:02:38.230> possibly<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.220> dlc

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
new Titans but possibly in the dlc

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.770 
new Titans but possibly in the dlc
that's<00:02:39.700> coming<00:02:39.910> out<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.120> summer<00:02:40.330> or<00:02:40.600> the

that's coming out on the summer or the
fall<00:02:40.960> we<00:02:41.140> could<00:02:41.260> be<00:02:41.380> getting<00:02:41.470> some<00:02:41.680> new<00:02:41.770> Titan

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.830 
fall we could be getting some new Titan
chassis<00:02:42.160> that'd<00:02:42.940> be<00:02:43.060> really<00:02:43.240> cool<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.690> don't

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
chassis that'd be really cool I don't

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.540
