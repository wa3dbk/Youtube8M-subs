00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
so hopefully this demo kind of showed

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.999 
so hopefully this demo kind of showed
you<00:05:50.060> that<00:05:50.960> it<00:05:51.080> has<00:05:51.199> a<00:05:51.229> better<00:05:51.440> tone<00:05:51.710> than<00:05:51.919> my

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
you that it has a better tone than my

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.820 
you that it has a better tone than my
previous<00:05:52.220> demo<00:05:52.639> which<00:05:52.970> I<00:05:53.539> think<00:05:54.259> YouTube<00:05:54.620> is

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
previous demo which I think YouTube is

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.350 
previous demo which I think YouTube is

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360
