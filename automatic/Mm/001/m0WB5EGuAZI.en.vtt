00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
positive all the time especially online

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.460 
positive all the time especially online
and<00:02:57.670> then<00:02:57.880> on<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.510> same<00:02:58.750> line<00:02:59.020> how<00:02:59.290> do<00:02:59.350> you

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
and then on the same line how do you

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.260 
and then on the same line how do you
feel<00:02:59.740> about<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.310> idea<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.640> music<00:03:01.120> and

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
feel about the idea that music and

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.850 
feel about the idea that music and
musicians<00:03:01.420> are<00:03:01.990> really<00:03:02.260> raising<00:03:02.650> today's

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
musicians are really raising today's

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.070 
musicians are really raising today's
generation<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.700> what<00:03:03.910> does<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.090> mean<00:03:04.240> for

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
generation and what does that mean for

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.950 
generation and what does that mean for
the<00:03:05.140> pressure<00:03:05.410> that's<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.890> offer<00:03:06.220> I<00:03:06.870> think<00:03:07.870> it

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
the pressure that's on offer I think it

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.780 
the pressure that's on offer I think it
sucks<00:03:08.290> because<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.920> think<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.130> lot<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.310> bands

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
sucks because I think a lot of bands

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.900 
sucks because I think a lot of bands
have<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:11.620> wrong<00:03:11.800> intentions<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.700> think

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
have the wrong intentions and I think

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.610 
have the wrong intentions and I think
people<00:03:13.210> do<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:13.600> for<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.870> wrong<00:03:13.990> reasons<00:03:14.440> and

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
people do this for the wrong reasons and

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.860 
people do this for the wrong reasons and
I<00:03:15.000> don't<00:03:16.000> know<00:03:16.120> if<00:03:16.270> they<00:03:16.420> really<00:03:16.600> know<00:03:16.840> how

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
I don't know if they really know how

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.390 
I don't know if they really know how
much<00:03:17.200> they<00:03:17.380> influenced<00:03:17.740> cool<00:03:17.920> but<00:03:18.130> like<00:03:18.280> I

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
much they influenced cool but like I

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.830 
much they influenced cool but like I
definitely<00:03:18.460> pay<00:03:18.880> attention<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.330> that<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.510> so

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
definitely pay attention to that and so

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.570 
definitely pay attention to that and so
