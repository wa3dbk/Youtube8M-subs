00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.750
 with the people who are here rice in another 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.099
 video more and let's analyze iceta 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.689
 let's analyze the iceta of today the 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.000
 that we can buy in sting or 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.340
 through an ace that the enjoyment that 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.919
 we will settle today if we 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.679
 we do with the game in the future if 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.720
 takes out more updated game or if what 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.269
 they definitely throw 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.200
 that day, maybe we'll analyze that 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.270
 version 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.690
 instead, the one that concerns us today is that 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.170
 the actual 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.640
 051 I want to remember that it is 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.640
 we started with the analysis 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.600
 good iceta is a game of 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.579
 survival 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.820
 which will put us in the skin of 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.050
 survivor in a zombie apocalypse 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.129
 the first thing we have to do in this 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.920
 game is that we were a character and 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.259
 introduce it in the world of iceta 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.880
 to do this we have an editor where 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.979
 we can choose the gender of the character and 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.170
 his clothes true that the options are 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.610
 quite scarce although I think that a 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.080
 today with enough is more than 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.420
 nothing because the game suffers from 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.920
 other mistakes and the truth that the 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.210
 creation of the character for me because it is 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.820
 something secondary really 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.170
 and a lot of variety but one is enough 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.340
 once the character is already created what 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.190
 next will be to access one of the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.390
 multiple online game servers 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.100
 As you well know, it is a game 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.979
 clearly online which the only 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.830
 goal will be to survive new options 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.420
 new game modes you're simply 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.159
 you against everyone against the zombies 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.710
 against hunger and against thirst against 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.390
 nature and of course against 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.310
 other players which most of 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.200
 Sometimes they will not be quite hostile 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.939
 its unique game mode proposes the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.159
 arduous task of surviving in a world 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.450
 full of adversities for this we can 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.490
 use the resources that we 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.680
 let's find in our journey here 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.110
 everything is worth a simple bowl and you can 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.330
 help a lot future 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.130
 besides iceta has replaced style to the 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.960
 player and any small mistake is 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.289
 can pay dearly, that is, with the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.879
 death 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.469
 we always tend to be attentive to 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.810
 any movement to any noise at 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:15.420
 anything this makes the player 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.680
 always be in constant tension 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.120
 relax in this game simply 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 it can mean death 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.690
 even though it's a very game mode 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.280
 attractive for the player sometimes 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.620
 we can miss more variety in 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.019
 this game we have goals and our 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.819
 only goal is to survive this unique 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.890
 how to play how much iceta the truth that 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.360
 sometimes you stay too scarce and 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.190
 we can even get bored 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.920
 because we do not know what we're going to do that 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.569
 is our next step then say 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.579
 that the most fun in this game at 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.180
 less for me it's like we're starting 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.280
 we feel very inferior to the world and 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.200
 Once we have equipped for the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.450
 only apparent danger are many 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.000
 players and will be at that time to 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.500
 find them with your players where 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.730
 our adrenaline shoots up 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.260
 Unsuspected limits 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.670
 imagined because in this game if we 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.400
 kills we lose all will touch us 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.470
 start over 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.950
 I still have to say that playing with friends 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.410
 It's a lot more fun 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.670
 although I insist the lack of objectives 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.319
 It is always a small handicap and 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.530
 finally the only thing we are going to do is 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.240
 go find moving players contracts 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.440
 I do not think that a game mode similar to 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.170
 of minecraft would have come very well 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.640
 to this game 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.650
 in this game we do not have any 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.420
 possibility of making a map and 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.150
 share it with the community or do 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.190
 adventures and plays alone in this 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.349
 paragraph the minecraft is a game 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.080
 quite similar that exceeds with many 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.840
 you grow 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.550
 graphically the game is very resultÃ³n the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.020
 map is huge and the features are pretty 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.700
 good I'm not going to talk too much about 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.070
 them more than anything because I do not think that 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.630
 are essential to this game the most 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.170
 important to me is the large size that 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.750
 has this map 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.550
 which will also always show us 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.120
 new things locations which do not 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.430
 we could not even imagine 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.460
 from ships stranded to ruins of 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.260
 a castle 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.760
 is a game where a lot of variety in the 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.770
 map although it is true that the 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.290
 Most buildings are repeated 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.910
 constantly is something that seems more or 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.490
 less normal more than anything because there 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.350
 many Indian towns locations 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.030
 What they may have done is 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.280
 have put more variety in the 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.680
 official buildings in police stations in 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.780
 the schools of hospitals more than 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.910
 nothing because they are all the same in all 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.320
 the peoples and the truth that they are also not 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.220
 so many buildings for not having done them 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.560
 in a different way 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.440
 As for the sound aspect, there is no 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.230
 not much more to say simply 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.640
 it's a pretty good section we do not have 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.430
 game music and effects are 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.650
 quite correct an example our 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.480
 steps will always sound 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.790
 different depending on what we are in that 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.260
 Walking is not the same 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.180
 on grass that walk on asphalt and 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.220
 obviously in this game the effect of 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.310
 sound is different and something that gives 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.670
 certain variety and certain quality to this 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.530
 appearance 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.960
 playable this game is a game of 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.560
 action and adventure in third in third 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.810
 person and first person in both if 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.000
 It is true that neither one nor the other 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.590
 They are well implemented in bed 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.170
 third person is perfect for 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.370
 explore instead at the time of 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.980
 action to me it seems pretty 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.540
 deficient and vice versa with the camera in 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.760
 First person is great for 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.310
 shoot but very efficient for 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.690
 exploring is a pity the truth because the 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.310
 third-person camera is quite 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.650
 well and I think that simply 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.080
 implementing a camera on the shoulder 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.540
 shoot more or less similar to that of 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.000
 software guide 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.440
 the game would greatly improve this aspect and 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.100
 it would become a circus person 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.000
 shooter 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.030
 of a very high quality 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.870
 summarizing and already to finish saying that 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.210
 I said it's a very funny game 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.289
 Novelty with a very hard playable system 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.059
 with the player 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.699
 in this game nothing is easy in this 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:56.949
 game lets loose on the field and we 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.899
 we have to go to spain 'not us 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:02.110
 alone without aids or anything like that here 

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:04.509
 there is no no help there are no 9 tutorials 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.510
 there is nothing is a game that is very hard 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.070
 with the play 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.750
 is a game that will keep us many 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.700
 hours stuck to the screen but that 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.020
 It suffers from several errors, such as 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.970
 the lack of clear objectives the 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.860
 boredom that can come to us 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.100
 occasion once we have completed 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.350
 the process of the equipment 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.240
 and it remains for me the biggest problem is the 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.130
 lack of a similar player's mode by 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.540
 example the minecraft where we could 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.040
 create our 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.900
 our maps our adventures and 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.669
 share them with other players 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.270
 I do not know if this is going to put him in a 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:37.270
 future today we do not have it and I 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.240
 I mention it 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.970
 still in spite of these errors and to 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.090
 also weigh the multiple owls 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.889
 because the game is very very ship swim 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.780
 It is a game with many errors with 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:52.180
 many zombie bugs that go through the 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.760
 walls the game is very unstable 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.040
 we can still get hooked on 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.669
 any time the game many 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.100
 jerks underperformance yet it's a 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:04.990
 game that will like those players 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.699
 that they look for an experience a little bit 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.900
 different or who are lovers of 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:09.400
 adventures especially if they are from 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.190
 survival 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.500
 in a game that is recommended 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.560
 in this must have a price of about 23 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.120
 euros I want to remember 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.010
 It's a game that's good to have 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.690
 still a little patience with him 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.330
 because it still has enough for 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.880
 improve and good up to here the video of 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.350
 today I hope you liked it you can 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.790
