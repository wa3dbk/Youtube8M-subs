 how about friends here being so welcome 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.840
 to a new video of gta 5 today I bring you 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.880
 a very father video because it is a 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.189
 secret a reference to niko bellic's 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.840
 gta 4 if you do not know who niko 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.390
 bellic he was the protagonist of the game 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.980
 during lighthouse 4 and good here in a 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.810
 then I will leave them on the map 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.399
 the location of where I come 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.380
 so that if later you want 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.270
 come and see this boat on your own what 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.160
 can do and know where it is good 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.649
 let me tell you that neither cobelli arrived 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.540
 to liberty they would be gta 4 in a boat 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.250
 called platypus came in search of the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.629
 American dream etcetera I'm not going to 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.280
 tell a lot of the story simply 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.920
 the most important thing is that it came in a 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.350
 boat called platypus and here in gta 5 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.210
 we have a ship called octopus and good 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.370
 octopus platypus almost the same 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.530
 obviously in a meaning but 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.929
 science as to how it sounds is almost 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.579
 the same is a great reference apart 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.989
 of this if you tell me good you know 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.670
 that I did not play it I do not know what you 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.470
 you refer here on the screen I'm going to 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.659
 leave some photos so they can 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.670
 remember or you can see how the boat the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.680
 platypus and so they can see the great 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.630
 similarity between the two boats have 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.480
 almost the same dimensions the same 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.770
 structures is very very similar and in itself 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.630
 outside all this 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.969
 and we can see that nothing else says bus 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.409
 but apart says liberty city what 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.689
 what now they leave us more than clear 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.670
