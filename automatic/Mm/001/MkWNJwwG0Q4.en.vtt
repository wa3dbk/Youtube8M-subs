alchemical chest if you don't Rowdies
her<00:02:41.730> serenity<00:02:42.269> condensers<00:02:43.139> and<00:02:43.169> and<00:02:43.680> you're

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
her serenity condensers and and you're

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.949 
her serenity condensers and and you're
gonna<00:02:44.280> like<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.609> one<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:45.000> recipe<00:02:45.629> in<00:02:45.659> the

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
gonna like this one a recipe in the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.470 
gonna like this one a recipe in the
corner<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:47.000> don't<00:02:48.000> know<00:02:48.090> why<00:02:48.299> now<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:50.480> Lassen

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
corner I don't know why now and Lassen

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.610 
corner I don't know why now and Lassen
Angie<00:02:51.810> condenser<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.840> then<00:02:54.840> basically

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
Angie condenser and and then basically

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.849 
Angie condenser and and then basically
all<00:02:56.400> these<00:02:56.939> collectors<00:02:57.659> collects<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.439> energy

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
all these collectors collects the energy

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.339 
all these collectors collects the energy
and<00:02:59.629> they<00:03:00.629> push<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.139> into<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:02.090> air<00:03:03.090> then<00:03:04.079> jus

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
and they push it into the air then jus

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.610 
and they push it into the air then jus
condenser<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.659> so<00:03:06.659> the<00:03:06.870> energy<00:03:06.989> condenser

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
condenser and so the energy condenser

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.720 
condenser and so the energy condenser
recipe<00:03:08.219> should<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.549> in<00:03:08.639> this<00:03:08.819> corner<00:03:09.680> the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
recipe should be in this corner the

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.369 
recipe should be in this corner the
collectorate<00:03:11.730> recipe<00:03:12.180> shop<00:03:12.329> in<00:03:12.450> there<00:03:12.719> that

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
collectorate recipe shop in there that

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.710 
collectorate recipe shop in there that
corner<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:14.010> then<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:15.120> recipe<00:03:15.479> for<00:03:15.659> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
corner and then the recipe for a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.270 
corner and then the recipe for a
relationship<00:03:16.109> in<00:03:16.379> that<00:03:16.560> corner<00:03:16.949> what<00:03:17.159> the

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
relationship in that corner what the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.479 
relationship in that corner what the
relay<00:03:17.729> does<00:03:17.970> is<00:03:18.239> any<00:03:18.989> energy<00:03:19.500> collectors<00:03:20.040> put

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
relay does is any energy collectors put

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.059 
relay does is any energy collectors put
near<00:03:20.729> rate<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.599> sucks<00:03:21.930> all<00:03:22.169> their<00:03:22.409> power<00:03:22.709> in

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
near rate it sucks all their power in

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.270 
near rate it sucks all their power in
and<00:03:23.720> later<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.229> feeds<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:26.189> chest<00:03:26.659> and<00:03:28.280> that

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
and later and feeds the chest and that

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.409 
and later and feeds the chest and that
makes<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.939> power<00:03:30.180> go<00:03:30.810> sky-high<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.189> if<00:03:33.150> you

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
makes the power go sky-high and if you

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.159 
makes the power go sky-high and if you
do<00:03:33.629> this<00:03:33.900> with<00:03:34.139> all<00:03:34.409> MK<00:03:34.709> three<00:03:35.310> items<00:03:35.819> we<00:03:36.750> can't

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
do this with all MK three items we can't

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.050 
do this with all MK three items we can't
make<00:03:37.379> it<00:03:37.530> rhyme<00:03:37.709> k3<00:03:38.370> because<00:03:38.579> we<00:03:38.699> need<00:03:38.849> three

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
make it rhyme k3 because we need three

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.979 
make it rhyme k3 because we need three
more<00:03:39.239> MK<00:03:39.870> 3<00:03:40.259> item<00:03:40.889> and<00:03:41.129> collectors<00:03:41.909> but<00:03:42.689> if<00:03:42.870> you

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
more MK 3 item and collectors but if you

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.679 
more MK 3 item and collectors but if you
do<00:03:43.319> with<00:03:43.500> all<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.889> k3<00:03:44.129> it<00:03:44.639> can<00:03:44.849> generate<00:03:45.060> one

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
do with all in k3 it can generate one

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:50.409 
do with all in k3 it can generate one
dime<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.290> every<00:03:47.159> 10<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.549> 15<00:03:48.150> seconds<00:03:48.750> and

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
dime and every 10 to 15 seconds and

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.939 
dime and every 10 to 15 seconds and
particle<00:03:51.620> yeah<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:53.720> so<00:03:54.720> anyway<00:03:55.379> that's<00:03:55.709> what

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
particle yeah and so anyway that's what

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.939 
particle yeah and so anyway that's what
should<00:03:56.220> they<00:03:56.909> can<00:03:57.419> subscribe<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.259> we'll<00:03:58.889> see

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
should they can subscribe and we'll see

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.629 
should they can subscribe and we'll see
you<00:03:59.099> later<00:03:59.629> bye
