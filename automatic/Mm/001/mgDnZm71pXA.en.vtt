00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.440
 hello with you again i vyacheslav today 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.300
 let's talk about is it worth it 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.090
 use products to save 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.050
 ffh fuels 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.770
 I will remind if you did not watch my 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.890
 the previous video is what it really is 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:36.070
 products of the ff company and a series of them pj 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.170
 aims to improve fuel economy 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.260
 operation of internal combustion engines and 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.739
 saving the ecology of the planet how is he 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.770
 valid 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.190
 I note burning catalyst does not change 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.860
 fuel quality and fuel properties 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.530
 for m &amp; g it's just the carrier of his action 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.330
 starts in the combustion chamber of the engine with 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.150
 using the b &amp; g cylinder is formed 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.940
 Catalytic film thickness of about 1 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.890
 100 microns and and which contributes 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.430
 complete combustion of the fuel mixture at 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.440
 this mixture 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.110
 manages to burn during the working stroke 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.210
 piston and in the exhaust series 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.180
 the collector goes only waste 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.549
 gas also film protects the cylinder and 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.490
 piston entrance formation of soot and 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.770
 respectively, that removes deposition 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.680
 there had time to form before use 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.049
 im pejic power rises as a result 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.570
 engine improves continuity 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.149
 besides all this film improves 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.969
 reduce piston on virgin lands reduce 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:38.530
 losses in the power of death and now 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:40.960
 let's get to it and why should we start 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.630
 math lesson for maximum savings 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.869
 even with minimal results 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.950
 especially for skeptics let's say there is 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.530
 cars and she went to 95 gasoline well, nothing 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.439
 didn't want to save made well 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.399
 now we have occurred to still save 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.649
 and we start using mpg-boost 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.979
 gleefully while giggling and mumbling so u 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.020
 you all come out and did not understand it so that 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.260
 give odometer broken or sensor 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.370
 the level of the tanks hovered like this I used to 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.890
 20 liters 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.630
 200 kilometers traveled and what else is there 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.210
 splashing in the tank 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.720
 like 6 liters what does it mean 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.750
 earlier 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.750
 knit ate 10 liters per hundred and now 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.740
 those dreams and as one of the heroes said 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.980
 the cartoon will not be enough I want more 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.820
 if around to assure that 95 is dp-100 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.740
 gina 92 â€‹â€‹then it may be gulf 92 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.440
 bring up to standard more 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.470
 effective ways 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.740
 Count 10 liters of the 95th idea 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.040
 costs an average of 108 hryvnia 10 liters 92 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.620
 worth an average of 105 green difference 3 hryvnia 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.600
 and for 3 hryvnia per 10 liters of fuel we 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.880
 we can add mpg boost and get 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.430
 fuel on the properties and the quality and 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.180
 more precisely efficiency as premium 95 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.330
 only much better super and so in the end 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.050
 we are moving away from 95 gasoline towards more 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.790
 cleaner and less stained with additives 92 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.850
 and fill the difference with a catalyst 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.830
 burning mpeg2 while we improve 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.090
 engine boosts power 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.130
 reduce toxicity 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.470
 but here only have to come to terms with that 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.330
 what's on the same amount of fuel 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.360
 you will travel a greater distance 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.800
 than on fuel without syria and magic 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.630
 I think this is something you should think about. 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.060
 buy 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.940
 yes by the way considered above said 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.700
 saving it was 26 percent 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.700
