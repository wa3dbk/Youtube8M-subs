00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.039 

so<00:00:01.319> now<00:00:01.800> we<00:00:01.860> know<00:00:01.979> enough<00:00:02.820> about<00:00:02.939> lightwave<00:00:03.689> to

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
so now we know enough about lightwave to

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.940 
so now we know enough about lightwave to
get<00:00:04.230> on<00:00:04.350> with<00:00:04.500> things<00:00:05.000> let's<00:00:06.000> have<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.210> look<00:00:06.450> at

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
get on with things let's have a look at

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.980 
get on with things let's have a look at
kinematics<00:00:07.950> first<00:00:08.820> forward<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.540> then<00:00:09.690> in

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
kinematics first forward and then in

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.410 
kinematics first forward and then in
verse<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:11.340> first<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.910> all<00:00:11.940> we're<00:00:12.090> going<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.269> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
verse so first of all we're going to the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.270 
verse so first of all we're going to the
modeler<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.900> we'll<00:00:13.200> load<00:00:13.410> an<00:00:13.710> object<00:00:14.130> that

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
modeler and we'll load an object that

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.120 
modeler and we'll load an object that
we've<00:00:14.460> made<00:00:15.830> it's<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.220> robot<00:00:17.550> arm<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.949> you<00:00:19.949> can

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
we've made it's a robot arm and you can

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.099 
we've made it's a robot arm and you can
see<00:00:20.750> how<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.380> animate<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.250> arm<00:00:23.840> so<00:00:24.840> you

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
see how we can animate the arm so you

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.320 
see how we can animate the arm so you
can<00:00:25.320> see<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.369> arm<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.820> made<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.150> from

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
can see that the arm is made up from

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.700 
can see that the arm is made up from
many<00:00:27.930> different

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
many different

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.069 
many different
layers<00:00:30.640> and<00:00:31.029> you<00:00:31.269> can<00:00:31.419> see<00:00:31.599> that<00:00:31.630> there<00:00:32.050> are

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
layers and you can see that there are

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.819 
layers and you can see that there are
several<00:00:32.800> layers<00:00:33.129> for<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.550> arm<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.620> there's

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
several layers for the arm so there's

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.810 
several layers for the arm so there's
the<00:00:35.920> base<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:38.910> there's<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.210> base<00:00:40.480> of<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.809> arm

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the base and there's the base of the arm

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.229 
the base and there's the base of the arm
and<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:44.620> that<00:00:44.860> we<00:00:45.040> articulated<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:45.940> then

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
and then that we articulated and then

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.450 
and then that we articulated and then
there's<00:00:46.659> the<00:00:46.930> first<00:00:47.379> part<00:00:47.589> of<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.829> arm<00:00:48.659> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
there's the first part of the arm and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.630 
there's the first part of the arm and
which<00:00:51.460> is<00:00:51.930> parented<00:00:52.930> to<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.290> facespace<00:00:54.070> and

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
which is parented to the facespace and

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.819 
which is parented to the facespace and
then<00:00:54.940> we've<00:00:55.540> got<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.780> forearm<00:00:56.379> if<00:00:56.559> you<00:00:56.649> like

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
then we've got the forearm if you like

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.669 
then we've got the forearm if you like
and<00:00:57.010> then<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.820> head<00:01:00.540> also<00:01:01.540> we've<00:01:02.050> got<00:01:02.260> two

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
and then the head also we've got two

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.910 
and then the head also we've got two
separate<00:01:03.370> parts<00:01:03.660> which<00:01:04.660> are<00:01:04.960> going<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:05.710> make<00:01:05.860> a

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
separate parts which are going to make a

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.040 
separate parts which are going to make a
piston<00:01:08.759> what's<00:01:09.759> very<00:01:10.030> important<00:01:10.509> to<00:01:10.600> note<00:01:10.810> is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
piston what's very important to note is

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.100 
piston what's very important to note is
that<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.460> Holy<00:01:12.700> subject<00:01:13.270> has<00:01:13.420> been<00:01:13.570> made<00:01:13.840> in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
that the Holy subject has been made in

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.070 
that the Holy subject has been made in
the<00:01:14.470> plus<00:01:14.830> Z<00:01:15.340> direction<00:01:16.090> okay<00:01:16.570> it's<00:01:16.720> animated

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
the plus Z direction okay it's animated

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.590 
the plus Z direction okay it's animated
in<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.470> plus<00:01:17.710> Z<00:01:17.920> direction<00:01:18.399> if<00:01:19.330> you're<00:01:19.479> going

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
in the plus Z direction if you're going

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.210 
in the plus Z direction if you're going
to<00:01:19.660> make<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:19.840> car<00:01:20.170> it's<00:01:20.770> going<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:20.979> point

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
to make a car it's going to point

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.630 
to make a car it's going to point
towards<00:01:21.550> +<00:01:21.789> Z<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.440> animate<00:01:23.440> it<00:01:23.560> correctly

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.010 

that's<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.850> direction<00:01:28.030> we<00:01:28.270> drive<00:01:28.479> in<00:01:28.659> towards

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
that's the direction we drive in towards

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:42.350 
that's the direction we drive in towards
the<00:01:29.080> horizon<00:01:29.229> depth<00:01:34.350> ok<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:38.970> last<00:01:39.970> thing

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.870 

about<00:01:43.360> pivots<00:01:43.810> so<00:01:44.799> we've<00:01:45.189> actually<00:01:45.310> defined

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
about pivots so we've actually defined

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.289 
about pivots so we've actually defined
position<00:01:46.840> for<00:01:47.079> pivots<00:01:47.799> so<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.579> base<00:01:48.759> has<00:01:49.030> the

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
position for pivots so the base has the

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.910 
position for pivots so the base has the
pivot<00:01:49.540> where<00:01:49.719> you<00:01:49.840> would<00:01:49.930> expect<00:01:50.369> 000<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.439> now

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
pivot where you would expect 000 and now

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.399 
pivot where you would expect 000 and now
for<00:01:54.729> its<00:01:55.030> first<00:01:55.360> child<00:01:55.630> we're<00:01:56.020> going<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.200> have

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
for its first child we're going to have

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.179 
for its first child we're going to have
the<00:01:56.920> pivot<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.579> middle<00:01:57.790> of<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.119> wheel<00:01:59.189> to

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
the pivot in the middle of the wheel to

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.649 
the pivot in the middle of the wheel to
parent<00:02:00.670> another<00:02:01.240> object<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.530> arm<00:02:03.659> so

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
parent another object to so the arm so

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.080 
parent another object to so the arm so
you<00:02:04.689> can<00:02:04.899> see<00:02:05.049> it's<00:02:05.170> centered<00:02:05.439> on<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:06.000> axis<00:02:07.000> of

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
you can see it's centered on the axis of

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.859 
you can see it's centered on the axis of
rotation<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:08.610> then<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.850> same<00:02:10.030> applies<00:02:10.390> to

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
rotation and then the same applies to

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.560 
rotation and then the same applies to
that<00:02:11.019> arm<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:12.130> next<00:02:12.340> time<00:02:13.049> where<00:02:14.049> that

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
that arm and the next time where that

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.990 
that arm and the next time where that
arm<00:02:16.570> is<00:02:16.660> going<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.930> balance<00:02:17.440> around<00:02:17.829> the<00:02:18.250> pivot

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
arm is going to balance around the pivot

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.449 
arm is going to balance around the pivot
of<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.359> first<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.890> some<00:02:20.890> goes<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.280> head

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
of the first and some goes to the head

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.650 
of the first and some goes to the head
and<00:02:22.470> at<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.590> end<00:02:23.709> of<00:02:23.799> the<00:02:23.890> arm<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:25.209> rotate

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
and at the end of the arm and so rotate

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.520 
and at the end of the arm and so rotate
about<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:26.140> axis<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.690> there<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:28.989> go<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.380> can

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
about that axis so there you go you can

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.010 
about that axis so there you go you can
see<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.799> moon<00:02:29.920> L<00:02:32.070> we<00:02:33.070> can<00:02:33.220> see<00:02:33.459> how<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.760> works

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.770 

if<00:02:37.200> we<00:02:37.410> take<00:02:37.590> piston<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.670> one<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.120> two<00:02:39.300> they're

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
if we take piston to one and two they're

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.360 
if we take piston to one and two they're
both<00:02:39.980> 000<00:02:41.600> okay<00:02:42.600> let's<00:02:42.960> send<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.260> object<00:02:43.710> to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
both 000 okay let's send this object to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.760 
both 000 okay let's send this object to
lay<00:02:44.550> out<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:46.580> we<00:02:47.580> can<00:02:47.730> see<00:02:48.500> there's<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
lay out and we can see there's the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.070 
lay out and we can see there's the
object<00:02:50.130> will<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.730> moving<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.330> bit<00:02:51.420> closer<00:02:51.720> in

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
object will just moving a bit closer in

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.630 
object will just moving a bit closer in
the<00:02:52.200> perspective<00:02:52.620> window<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.100> here<00:02:53.460> in<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
the perspective window and here in the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.810 
the perspective window and here in the
schematic<00:02:54.120> view<00:02:54.980> I'm<00:02:55.980> going<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.250> start<00:02:56.610> with

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
schematic view I'm going to start with

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.880 
schematic view I'm going to start with
reassigning<00:02:57.750> my<00:02:57.960> workspace<00:02:58.320> because<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.710> don't

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
reassigning my workspace because I don't

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.160 
reassigning my workspace because I don't
really<00:02:59.040> need<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.400> many<00:02:59.580> windows<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.810> let's

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
really need this many windows so let's

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.040 
really need this many windows so let's
hit<00:03:01.650> D<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.280> then<00:03:02.670> change<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.720> double

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
hit D and then change to a double

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.510 
hit D and then change to a double
vertical<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:05.270> then<00:03:06.890> resize<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.100> schematic

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
vertical and then resize the schematic

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
vertical and then resize the schematic
window<00:03:08.610> because<00:03:08.880> we<00:03:08.970> don't<00:03:09.120> really<00:03:09.210> need<00:03:09.330> as

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
window because we don't really need as

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.650 
window because we don't really need as
bigger<00:03:09.750> than<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.020> so<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.160> we'll<00:03:12.120> move<00:03:12.330> all

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
bigger than is so and we'll move all

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.020 
bigger than is so and we'll move all
these<00:03:12.900> bits<00:03:13.260> down<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.190> we<00:03:14.430> can<00:03:14.580> tidy<00:03:14.850> up

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
these bits down so that we can tidy up

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.830 
these bits down so that we can tidy up
the<00:03:15.180> schematic<00:03:15.630> view<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.910> there<00:03:18.360> we<00:03:18.450> go<00:03:18.480> and

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
the schematic view so there we go and

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.580 
the schematic view so there we go and
last<00:03:19.380> bit<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.220> head<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:21.330> now<00:03:21.900> let's<00:03:22.140> move<00:03:22.320> the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
last bit the head and now let's move the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.540 
last bit the head and now let's move the
the<00:03:23.130> two<00:03:23.340> Pistons<00:03:23.730> over<00:03:23.940> as<00:03:24.090> well<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:25.550> one

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
the two Pistons over as well and one

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.520 
the two Pistons over as well and one
above<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.790> other<00:03:28.220> ok<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:30.050> now<00:03:31.050> we've<00:03:31.350> got<00:03:31.500> a

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
above the other ok and now we've got a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.590 
above the other ok and now we've got a
bit<00:03:31.740> of<00:03:31.890> space<00:03:32.280> for<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.820> perspective<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:33.570> a

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
bit of space for the perspective and a

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.630 
bit of space for the perspective and a
bit<00:03:34.380> of<00:03:34.440> space<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.920> schematic<00:03:35.340> now<00:03:35.550> we're

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
bit of space for the schematic now we're

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.300 
bit of space for the schematic now we're
going<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.790> save<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.180> scene<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:37.560> we're<00:03:38.190> going

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
going to save this scene and we're going

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.690 
going to save this scene and we're going
to<00:03:38.340> save<00:03:38.550> it<00:03:38.580> rubber<00:03:39.300> arm<00:03:39.570> in<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.710> for<00:03:41.310> initial

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
to save it rubber arm in it for initial

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.430 
to save it rubber arm in it for initial
state<00:03:43.580> that<00:03:44.580> way<00:03:44.760> if<00:03:45.000> we<00:03:45.510> need<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.780> go<00:03:45.900> back<00:03:45.930> to

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
state that way if we need to go back to

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.730 
state that way if we need to go back to
the<00:03:46.709> basic<00:03:47.100> object<00:03:47.520> as<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.730> was<00:03:48.150> made<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:49.530> means

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
the basic object as it was made it means

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.900 
the basic object as it was made it means
that<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.310> can<00:03:50.490> do<00:03:50.700> say

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.780 

okay<00:03:59.890> so<00:04:00.890> now<00:04:01.400> we're<00:04:02.270> going<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:03.610> see<00:04:04.610> the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
okay so now we're going to see the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.570 
okay so now we're going to see the
pivots<00:04:05.360> where<00:04:05.569> they're<00:04:05.750> placed<00:04:05.990> to<00:04:06.830> enable

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
pivots where they're placed to enable

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.250 
pivots where they're placed to enable
the<00:04:07.730> rotation<00:04:08.209> around<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.660> correct<00:04:08.990> places

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
the rotation around the correct places

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.800 
the rotation around the correct places
and<00:04:10.900> for<00:04:11.900> this<00:04:11.990> one<00:04:12.700> we<00:04:13.700> can<00:04:13.850> just<00:04:14.150> adjust<00:04:14.450> the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
and for this one we can just adjust the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.640 
and for this one we can just adjust the
time<00:04:15.050> and<00:04:15.319> then<00:04:16.209> adjust<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.329> base<00:04:17.480> soon<00:04:18.380> that

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
time and then adjust the base soon that

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.849 
time and then adjust the base soon that
works<00:04:18.889> well<00:04:19.900> with<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.019> parented<00:04:21.440> objects

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
works well with the parented objects

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.270 
works well with the parented objects
following<00:04:22.310> along<00:04:22.490> with<00:04:22.639> it<00:04:23.919> it's<00:04:24.919> working

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
following along with it it's working

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.960 
following along with it it's working
well<00:04:26.200> and<00:04:27.200> it's<00:04:27.560> only<00:04:27.770> heading<00:04:28.130> not<00:04:28.550> pitch<00:04:28.850> so

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
well and it's only heading not pitch so

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.340 
well and it's only heading not pitch so
what<00:04:31.970> we<00:04:32.090> can<00:04:32.210> do<00:04:32.419> is<00:04:32.570> actually<00:04:32.750> limit

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
what we can do is actually limit

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.840 
what we can do is actually limit
rotations<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:34.100> only<00:04:34.400> heading<00:04:34.940> by<00:04:35.410> unclick<00:04:36.410> the

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
rotations to only heading by unclick the

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.030 
rotations to only heading by unclick the
channels<00:04:37.850> so<00:04:38.480> now<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:39.470> doesn't<00:04:39.710> matter<00:04:39.770> where

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
channels so now it doesn't matter where

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.470 
channels so now it doesn't matter where
you<00:04:40.070> place<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.520> mouse<00:04:40.669> it's<00:04:40.970> only<00:04:41.300> going<00:04:41.419> to

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
you place the mouse it's only going to

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.600 
you place the mouse it's only going to
rotate<00:04:41.630> in<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:41.990> heading<00:04:42.260> not<00:04:42.740> in<00:04:43.010> pitch<00:04:43.370> or

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
rotate in the heading not in pitch or

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.800 
rotate in the heading not in pitch or
bank<00:04:45.070> next<00:04:46.070> object<00:04:46.340> so<00:04:47.060> there<00:04:47.450> there<00:04:47.780> are

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
bank next object so there there are

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.850 
bank next object so there there are
keyboard<00:04:48.169> shortcuts<00:04:48.500> you<00:04:48.620> can<00:04:48.680> either

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
keyboard shortcuts you can either

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.530 
keyboard shortcuts you can either
they're<00:04:49.340> shortcuts<00:04:50.030> you<00:04:50.090> can<00:04:50.150> either<00:04:50.300> go<00:04:50.510> into

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
they're shortcuts you can either go into

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.290 
they're shortcuts you can either go into
this<00:04:50.900> list<00:04:51.229> or<00:04:51.470> you<00:04:52.250> can<00:04:52.370> choose<00:04:52.400> from<00:04:52.880> the

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
this list or you can choose from the

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.400 
this list or you can choose from the
schematic<00:04:53.900> or<00:04:54.400> you<00:04:55.400> can<00:04:55.550> even<00:04:55.669> press<00:04:56.660> up<00:04:57.020> and

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
schematic or you can even press up and

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.760 
schematic or you can even press up and
down<00:04:57.680> on<00:04:57.919> the<00:04:57.950> cursor<00:04:58.550> keys<00:04:58.790> and<00:04:59.470> you'll<00:05:00.470> move

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
down on the cursor keys and you'll move

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.620 
down on the cursor keys and you'll move
from<00:05:00.950> one<00:05:01.040> object<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.400> the<00:05:01.520> next<00:05:01.820> so<00:05:02.180> there<00:05:02.540> we

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
from one object to the next so there we

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.210 
from one object to the next so there we
go<00:05:02.660> we're<00:05:02.960> on<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.620> first<00:05:03.890> part<00:05:04.070> of<00:05:04.130> the

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
go we're on the the first part of the

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.120 
go we're on the the first part of the
arm<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.870> it's<00:05:05.870> only<00:05:06.020> going<00:05:06.200> to<00:05:06.260> work<00:05:06.410> in<00:05:06.740> the

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
arm and it's only going to work in the

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.630 
arm and it's only going to work in the
pitch<00:05:07.490> bank<00:05:07.910> at<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:09.020> pitch<00:05:09.169> axis<00:05:11.260> so<00:05:12.640> we

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
pitch bank at the pitch axis so we

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.219 
pitch bank at the pitch axis so we
should<00:05:13.940> turn<00:05:14.180> off<00:05:14.330> heading<00:05:15.080> and<00:05:15.260> bank<00:05:17.229> now

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
should turn off heading and bank now

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.390 
should turn off heading and bank now
forearm<00:05:20.080> same<00:05:21.080> thing<00:05:21.380> applies<00:05:21.680> it's<00:05:22.100> still

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
forearm same thing applies it's still

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.510 
forearm same thing applies it's still
pitch<00:05:23.440> so<00:05:24.440> we'll<00:05:24.770> do<00:05:24.919> the<00:05:25.039> same<00:05:25.220> thing<00:05:25.370> again

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
pitch so we'll do the same thing again

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.159 
pitch so we'll do the same thing again
will<00:05:25.789> turn<00:05:26.150> off<00:05:26.270> heading<00:05:26.750> a<00:05:26.810> bank<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.610> then

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
will turn off heading a bank and then

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:36.510 
will turn off heading a bank and then
the<00:05:30.169> head<00:05:34.090> will<00:05:35.090> do<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.360> same

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
the head will do the same

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.290 
the head will do the same
again<00:05:36.789> I<00:05:36.970> think<00:05:38.190> okay<00:05:39.190> so<00:05:39.610> Taff<00:05:39.819> heading<00:05:40.180> and

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
again I think okay so Taff heading and

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.300 
again I think okay so Taff heading and
bank<00:05:40.479> so<00:05:41.169> now<00:05:41.319> we've<00:05:41.470> started<00:05:41.680> to<00:05:41.949> animate<00:05:42.220> the

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
bank so now we've started to animate the

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.580 
bank so now we've started to animate the
subject<00:05:42.729> and<00:05:42.849> you<00:05:42.970> can<00:05:43.120> see<00:05:43.360> how<00:05:44.169> it's<00:05:44.349> moving

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
subject and you can see how it's moving

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.210 
subject and you can see how it's moving
with<00:05:45.159> forward<00:05:45.520> kinematics<00:05:46.590> so<00:05:47.590> starting<00:05:48.190> from

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
with forward kinematics so starting from

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.550 
with forward kinematics so starting from
the<00:05:48.430> base<00:05:48.580> of<00:05:48.879> the<00:05:49.000> object<00:05:49.330> we<00:05:50.229> move<00:05:50.680> that<00:05:50.919> and

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
the base of the object we move that and

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.670 
the base of the object we move that and
then<00:05:53.560> we<00:05:54.129> move<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:55.020> child<00:05:56.020> of<00:05:56.199> that<00:05:56.319> and<00:05:56.560> then

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
then we move the child of that and then

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.529 
then we move the child of that and then
the<00:05:56.800> child<00:05:56.979> of<00:05:57.190> that<00:05:57.370> and<00:05:57.639> then<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.210> child<00:05:58.360> of

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
the child of that and then the child of

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.460 
the child of that and then the child of
that<00:05:58.690> to<00:05:59.199> get<00:05:59.319> our<00:05:59.440> animation<00:06:00.599> but<00:06:01.599> as<00:06:01.720> you<00:06:02.379> can

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
that to get our animation but as you can

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.450 
that to get our animation but as you can
see<00:06:02.710> it's<00:06:03.310> quite<00:06:03.729> a<00:06:03.819> slow<00:06:04.150> process<00:06:04.449> and<00:06:05.460> not

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
see it's quite a slow process and not

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.469 
see it's quite a slow process and not
very<00:06:06.610> easy<00:06:06.729> to<00:06:07.300> to<00:06:08.080> animate<00:06:08.440> using<00:06:09.069> this

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
very easy to to animate using this

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.050 
very easy to to animate using this
forward<00:06:10.479> kinematics<00:06:11.340> but<00:06:12.340> that's<00:06:12.759> why<00:06:12.909> we're

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
forward kinematics but that's why we're

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.520 
forward kinematics but that's why we're
going<00:06:13.150> to<00:06:13.240> have<00:06:13.330> a<00:06:13.360> look<00:06:13.449> at<00:06:13.630> inverse

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
going to have a look at inverse

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.330 
going to have a look at inverse
kinematics<00:06:15.330> next
