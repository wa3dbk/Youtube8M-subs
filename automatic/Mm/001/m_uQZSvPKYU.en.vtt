00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.650
 it's the whole world it's dark alex 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.600
 so today we will end up 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.980
 for a new tutorial today I'm going 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.560
 show you how to download 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.570
 manually updates for your 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.790
 applications so apps that's 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.529
 all that is I on the ps4 is 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.040
 also everything that can be netflix 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.550
 game one music unlimited that's all 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.680
 Types 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.110
 in fact it's every square that you have 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.050
 on the menu here so in fact there is 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.980
 four methods in all of which one 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.690
 only requires a subscription 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.920
 playstation more so that's why I 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.890
 will explain all the methods 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.460
 a word so the first one is done 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.500
 automatically 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.750
 it's by putting a new game by 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.080
 example we will put subway redux so 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.010
 never in the console here and so there 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.570
 the console what is she going to do 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.449
 she's already been looking to install it in 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.890
 totality 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.960
 so there yes we wait a little bit 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.330
 detected the cd so here it is 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.770
 redux subway is automatically you 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
 have the notification that what the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.600
 console looking for updates 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.460
 also and that she put it in the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.350
 download notifications so in 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.240
 did to go to see the progression of 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.119
 this update is enough for the caregiver 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 in the top menu all left you 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.689
 have notification you go down in 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.880
 download and there you have metro 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.929
 redux update file that makes 24 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.880
 media 45 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.060
 so it's going to go pretty fast 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.859
 so download it so it's 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.469
 do it alone so we'll delete it 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.789
 so if ever the only now 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.979
 you have a lot of people 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.170
 installed and you want to control 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.119
 manually the presence of the updates to 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.560
 day for a particular game the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.439
 hands you have to go on and you 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.749
 make options and check if any bets 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.049
 are available is the same 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.299
 thing 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.590
 he added ben alike in the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.610
 notifications that can go 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.710
 directly 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.650
 add to download what is 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.410
 very practical and the third option 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.759
 it's done simply by lighting 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.740
 the console good I do not make you a 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.150
 drawing when you turn on the ps4 for 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.500
 the latest games installed the pesca of 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.740
 check the d1 the latest updates 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.050
 day 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.340
 so it's all alone but the 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.960
 second motion as I told you the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.210
 search with option the option key 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.830
 just in case it does not happen 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.140
 not for reasons x or y if you have 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.459
 plenty of games here and the fourth 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.320
 option there must be members 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.709
 playstation anymore but then I'm going to you 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.660
 show 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.250
 so we have to go already set in 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.530
 first console because it 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.650
 will happen during the rest mode there 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.410
 have to go in settings you 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.930
 go down here management settings 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.510
 power supply define the functions in 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.980
 rest mode is there must be tick 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.150
 stay connected to the internet otherwise it 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.510
 will not walk and then we come back in 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.750
 system and there you have download and 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.700
 automatic uploading 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.470
 so here again is what goes what he goes 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.670
 have to check if these three things so 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.430
 download update files 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.470
 day installations and files from 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.250
 update applications 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.280
 so here is once all that is 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.590
 checked you can go back to milk in 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.060
 the power is passed the console in 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.440
 rest mode and so she's going to look 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.299
 automatically the latest updates to 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.860
 day for your games she will install them 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.900
 automatically and she'll do the same 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.549
 for 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.590
 for system updates if there are any 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.849
 it's not often duck but time 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.099
 in time she will install them 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.239
 automatic it's super simple 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.349
 so in any case on ps4 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.989
 and then I make another video 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.230
 to show you on ps3 to go to everything 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.230
 immediately 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.090
 yeah 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.790
