00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
the season I think he's taking a step

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.930 
the season I think he's taking a step
forward<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:40.750> last<00:04:40.930> two<00:04:41.110> weeks<00:04:41.400> as<00:04:42.400> his<00:04:42.729> health

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
forward the last two weeks as his health

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.350 
forward the last two weeks as his health
comes<00:04:43.210> back<00:04:43.449> well<00:04:43.919> scary<00:04:44.919> where<00:04:45.130> he<00:04:45.220> is<00:04:45.360> there

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
comes back well scary where he is there

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.400 
comes back well scary where he is there
at<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:46.539> end<00:04:46.630> of<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.750> game<00:04:46.900> when<00:04:47.080> he<00:04:47.110> when<00:04:47.320> he

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
at the end of the game when he when he

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.670 
at the end of the game when he when he
came<00:04:47.560> up<00:04:47.740> limping<00:04:48.240> how<00:04:49.240> about<00:04:49.389> a<00:04:49.419> kid

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
came up limping how about a kid

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.290

completing<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.710> pass<00:04:50.919> like<00:04:51.160> he<00:04:51.280> did<00:04:51.550> when<00:04:52.270> he

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
completing a pass like he did when he

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.700 
completing a pass like he did when he

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.920 
field but in a situation we got no time
to<00:04:55.810> replace<00:04:56.440> him<00:04:56.620> with<00:04:56.710> a<00:04:56.770> quarterback<00:04:57.099> who's

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
the length of the field we go over to

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.300

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
out there to go play defense that was

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.230 
out there to go play defense that was
the<00:06:25.410> risk<00:06:25.590> I<00:06:25.770> wanted<00:06:26.070> to<00:06:26.160> take<00:06:26.370> rather<00:06:26.910> than<00:06:27.120> go

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
the risk I wanted to take rather than go

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:38.870 
the risk I wanted to take rather than go
for<00:06:27.540> it
