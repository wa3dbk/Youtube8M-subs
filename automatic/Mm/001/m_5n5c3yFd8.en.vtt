sugar to make the body and sugar glass

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.070 
sugar to make the body and sugar glass
to<00:02:00.980> make<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.250> lenses<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:02.300> idea<00:02:02.660> is<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:02.870> you

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
to make the lenses the idea is that you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.040 
to make the lenses the idea is that you
can<00:02:03.290> custom<00:02:03.680> cook<00:02:03.950> your<00:02:04.220> own<00:02:04.250> effects<00:02:05.050> through

can custom cook your own effects through

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.050 
can custom cook your own effects through
the<00:02:06.200> lenses<00:02:06.560> by<00:02:06.740> adding<00:02:07.220> different<00:02:07.400> colors

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
the lenses by adding different colors

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.840 
the lenses by adding different colors
and<00:02:08.270> shapes<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.500> get<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:10.550> can<00:02:10.700> get<00:02:10.820> a

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
and shapes so you get a you can get a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.460 
and shapes so you get a you can get a
fisheye<00:02:11.180> effect<00:02:11.210> or<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:11.810> can<00:02:11.930> get<00:02:12.080> regular

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
fisheye effect or you can get regular

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.040 
fisheye effect or you can get regular
effect<00:02:13.390> then<00:02:14.390> once<00:02:14.600> you're<00:02:14.750> done<00:02:14.840> with<00:02:14.990> your

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
effect then once you're done with your

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.350 
effect then once you're done with your
camera<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:16.100> take<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.430> film<00:02:16.670> out<00:02:16.880> which<00:02:17.300> is

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
camera you take the film out which is

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.330 
camera you take the film out which is
just<00:02:17.780> off<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.080> shelf<00:02:18.290> film<00:02:18.560> get<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:18.950> develop

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
just off the shelf film get it develop

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.640 
just off the shelf film get it develop
and<00:02:19.520> then<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:20.990> decide<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.320> either<00:02:21.500> they

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
and then you can decide to either they

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.500 
and then you can decide to either they
eat<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.890> camera<00:02:22.250> or<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:23.000> put<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.210> under<00:02:23.390> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
eat the camera or just put it under the

eat the camera or just put it under the
sink<00:02:23.720> with<00:02:23.870> hot<00:02:24.020> water<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.590> just<00:02:24.770> kind<00:02:24.920> of

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
sink with hot water and it just kind of

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.580 
sink with hot water and it just kind of
disappear<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:25.730> sustainability<00:02:26.390> wise<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.410> just

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
disappear so sustainability wise it just

these dead characters and extracts
moisture<00:02:46.750> they<00:02:47.750> then<00:02:47.959> add<00:02:48.200> ingredients<00:02:48.380> of

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.840 

so<00:03:05.290> we've<00:03:05.440> made<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.650> bread<00:03:06.370> which<00:03:06.610> is

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
so we've made a bread which is

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.340 
so we've made a bread which is
exploiting<00:03:07.600> free<00:03:07.780> almost<00:03:07.990> entirely

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350

our<00:03:17.620> way<00:03:17.830> of<00:03:17.980> trying<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.280> make<00:03:18.370> something

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
our way of trying to make something

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.650 
our way of trying to make something
which<00:03:19.600> isn't<00:03:19.750> very<00:03:19.870> nutritious<00:03:20.380> a<00:03:20.410> bit<00:03:20.590> more

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
which isn't very nutritious a bit more

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.900 
which isn't very nutritious a bit more
so<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.690> had<00:03:23.020> a<00:03:23.050> lovely<00:03:23.290> day<00:03:23.680> exploring<00:03:24.220> tasting
