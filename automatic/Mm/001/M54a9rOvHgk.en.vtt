 visuals they see us 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:11.969
 and when we know that learning is done with the repetition of movements 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.679
 that we see a little that leaves doubtful 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.860
 and it's not all wrong we also deny train instructors who gives 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.089
 course but a bad idea completely precarious edition

 complete 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.960
 the colossal difference of keeping it 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.720
 it's adapting in its entirety that things get complicated 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720
 unlike karate for example it's very special percussion 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.580

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:29.219
 there is a heavier penalty 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.359
