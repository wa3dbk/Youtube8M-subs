00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.099
 a plane lands soldiers jumping 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.779
 Out of this everything seems incredible 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.939
 known before but that certainly is not 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:21.300
 this little Mickey straight through the picture 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:24.509
 However , there was a boom in economy 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.949
 unknown not yet here to yes 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.070
 you need the addon that now 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.560
 Soon, enemy within is called that and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.960
 that extends the main game that is so 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.820
 that you do not bring any new ones that way 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.980
 no new campaign with it but it 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.150
 is just integrated into the main game and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.370
 you just have to catch new ones 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.160
 then you get all the features 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.410
 mediate such as the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.410
 genetic improvements that's it 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.070
 can upgrade his soldiers now 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.440
 give a hormone therapy and thereby 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.730
 if they are better off smarter 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.230
 beautiful whatever we build this 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.229
 This can be done early in the game 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.000
 and there you can decide 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.039
 resistant to the attacks of his 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.340
 or they can make themselves invisible 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.840
 or track down enemies he should be strong 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.710
 he used stronger ones on roofs 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.289
 can jump 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.819
 that's so cool because now 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.110
 so right actually so superhero 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:20.789
 not as the game is changing 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.679
 not really anymore 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.819
 soldiers to these are the choice is to 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.580
 example, a typical feature of 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.110
 masons xcom enemy unknown know man 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.190
 can not always learn everything but so 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.660
 that I always with his soldiers 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.690
 decide what you want to do exactly 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.840
 so it is with the mac soldiers 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.310
 that's pretty bitter you have to 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.310
 soldiers would be out if then all 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.429
 limb distance is not morally 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.860
 Okay, but they complain 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.270
 not and the advantage is just you can 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.989
 then always such Ruff 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.399
 stick 

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:56.580
 There you have the choice between again 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.050
 Two options per each upgrade level 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.319
 this way to the sewer 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.850
 flamethrower reinbauen grenade launcher 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.280
 or 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.000
 he can heal im allies 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.790
 circle the pretty cool and the max 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.680
 Fantastic for being awesome and you 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.590
 really have the feeling you have there 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.790
 is such a powerful unit bed it 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.010
 fantastic and the beautiful one is 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.110
 relatively early access to these units 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.410
 So even after the first two hours 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.819
 already it is players are quite different 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.209
 you can build these new labs 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.209
 just great 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.290
 with this formula also scared the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.840
 opponent yes, I thought I had one 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.109
 a bit colorful re / max yes sometimes 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.359
 very nice it is very cool with 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.129
 the player so because just these these 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.370
 her skills can still be seen 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.959
 fat jump or here ex ex 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.879
 the aliens just one on the 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.799
 give a mouthful 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.629
 But kinetic strike is exactly and 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.819
 so simply breathed the times on the 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.799
 but head is not all in vain because 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.599
 indeed this new material the 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.370
 that's the melt there 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.919
 are always two containers now too 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.669
 almost every card on the old one too 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.799
 The developers have now easy 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.599
 installed and you have to be right 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.949
 get fast because there comes in 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.980
 timer off and on after a few rounds 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:31.419
 explode that adds a bit 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.949
 Add hectic but I think it will 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.750
 this does not change the game 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.280
 not being dramatic is not like that 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.590
 mails and my god where is the melt 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.919
 but you just have to be one 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.510
 new tactical level 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.980
 yes and also inside there are new ones 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.340
 we have opponents before 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.379
 Seen this mac dopod that is cool 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.819
 they are also with normal soldiers 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.500
 to win 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.000
 so you do not the feeling that the 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.470
 play extremely focused on that 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.150
 Only the mac soldiers are left 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.639
 uses your genetically improved types 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:06.549
 but as far as you actually laser weapons 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:07.599
 do you come well your weapons 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.560
 do a lot of harm 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.359
 His people have very many 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.639
 life points, it's quite a bit 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.699
 continue in the game it's just this time 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.900
 Half time mission is so we have now 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.669
 not played much more than that 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.159
 the preview version ends after that 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.220
 that's why you can not quite say what 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:26.800
 there everything still comes but so far is great 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.449
 what are all new things this new 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.849
 parents who can make themselves invisible 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.380
 the cool now we have the 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.419
 Soldier now had a genetic 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.659
 motivation that makes them visible 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.509
 again and otherwise come the riemann 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:44.340
 and strangle you and then you have to 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.340
 The soldiers were shooting 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.629
 and it is something to celebrate a return 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.360
 I think so many friends heard 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:55.939
 yes I know but betrayed that 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.279
 should definitely be something completely 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:00.439
 nice to play in the old xcom 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:03.339
 always a big thing was again 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:05.419
 as part of the story mission 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:07.789
 fans do not want to betray then may 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.369
 it does not show here because yes 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:13.460
 So okay, the base with one attack 

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:15.169
 she must defend the high points 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.789
 that would have the boards and I have 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.969
 Just danced a minute before 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.089
 Joy as the mission beginning because 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:24.740
 perfectly staged and great 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:26.559
 besides there are also new maps 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.719
 for example, this is your colors house 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:33.020
 level that again a part of what 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:35.930
 one in the old xcom had general 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.529
 they the cable beautifully whatever 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.849
 simply more varianz thereby changes 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.409
 you just the battlefields more 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.899
 applause I ever in my game as often 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.279
 that you always and then certain cards 

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:46.909
 you have seen it again and again 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:53.270
 not the case anymore 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:54.709
 great you have yes why I do that yes 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.099
 sometimes the nice thing about the soldiers 

00:05:54.709 --> 00:06:01.249
 to do yourself and watch 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.269
 how the steffen the cool is there 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:03.979
 even a few small surveying 

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:05.659
 example, there is an upgrade with those 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.729
 then all soldiers lost two items 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.629
 many fans could wish and 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.269
 you can not there is also such a 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:12.860
 small button with which you then if you 

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:15.879
 currently not available available 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.620
 doing that can easily reduce this 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:22.300
 Search and there while others in the 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.300
 people like Graf are in this team 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:29.120
 there are human opponents the 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.550
 Hot exotic and they have something against 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.840
 the xcom and there is also a new one 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.750
 mission types it a 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.860
 send undercover agents and then with 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:42.470
 get and his team back as a 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:45.080
 defend territory or multiple hackers 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.030
 points hedge with these at these 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.470
 conquest missions, however, has 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.600
 me medica is a bit negative 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.690
 attract attention because the real race types 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.040
 actually always straight into this 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.710
 area and just like his people 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.750
 set up and the types no chance 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.070
 So there you could get to the finished one 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.110
 quietly work a bit more 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.640
 because of this, it will be good like the xcom 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.710
 soldiers and come to think about the end 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.690
 and not what other gymnasium that 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.250
 but the second hands or soldiers 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.530
 Generally very good 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.300
 especially as you grenades and rockets 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.690
 not much can be used there 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.280
 gripe 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.500
 it also can not say that I 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.240
 It would be so easy because it should 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:24.760
 Just do the thing in the higher ones 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:28.400
 level of difficulty or in the race - well 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.800
 which is of course also with and 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.290
 a great fun even if you often times 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.870
 escape because the data from nipples 

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.190
 general addon great so far what 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.270
 I've played of what it can 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.700
 only recommend 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.600
 I hope the trial will open 

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:46.840
 keep this fantastic impression and 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.840
 I'm curious
