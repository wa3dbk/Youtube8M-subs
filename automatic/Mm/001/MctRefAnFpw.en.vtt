 I've been unable to wash or wash anything for 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.450

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.789

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.640
 but I really have not had time I have not 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.890

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.349
 that is the inflatable mattress that 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.570
 suddenly I put here to see on TV my 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.950

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.920

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.770

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.680
 I remember where, but they gave me this 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.600
 It is a can be seen 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.210

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.910

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.900
 I went to the movies I went to see one that 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.479
 call the wta I do not remember the name 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.520
 but in fact you have never been to the cinema 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.290
 without knowing what movie they are going to see that they 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.360
 have bought the ticket and suddenly you 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.130
 feel and say we're going to see and you do not 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.050
 in mind and that is one thing that they 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.780
 I showed the time I made an egg and 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.830

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.869

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.340
 nothing else the kitchen or my room 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.719
 go to the movies wash clothes and I forgot 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.759

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.649
