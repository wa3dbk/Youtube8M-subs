00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.460 
the shield had but yeah I guess this
this<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> closest<00:01:08.610> thing<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:10.320> yeah

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
this is the closest thing to it so yeah

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.280 
this is the closest thing to it so yeah
this<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.189> shield<00:01:11.549> Dean<00:01:12.030> Ambrose<00:01:12.510> Roman

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.680

which<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.980> just<00:03:59.340> did<00:03:59.640> and<00:03:59.880> a<00:04:00.120> shield<00:04:00.359> is

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
which I just did and a shield is

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.559 
which I just did and a shield is
victorious<00:04:01.620> now<00:04:01.920> this<00:04:02.670> would<00:04:03.000> probably<00:04:03.239> not

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
victorious now this would probably not

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.270 
victorious now this would probably not
happen<00:04:03.930> in<00:04:04.019> real<00:04:04.170> life<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.680> don't<00:04:05.040> think<00:04:05.069> we'd

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
happen in real life I don't think we'd

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.759 
happen in real life I don't think we'd
see<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.670> heal<00:04:05.910> stables<00:04:06.870> fight<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.290> out<00:04:07.440> and

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
see to heal stables fight it out and

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.890 
see to heal stables fight it out and
just<00:04:08.040> normal<00:04:08.549> tag<00:04:08.760> team<00:04:08.970> match<00:04:09.150> but<00:04:09.540> as<00:04:09.780> you

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
just normal tag team match but as you

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.870 
just normal tag team match but as you
can<00:04:09.959> see<00:04:10.260> I'm<00:04:10.799> playing<00:04:10.859> this<00:04:11.310> match<00:04:11.549> show<00:04:11.819> up

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
can see I'm playing this match show up

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.460 
can see I'm playing this match show up
in<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.209> royal<00:04:12.480> rumble<00:04:12.780> arena<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.260> there's<00:04:13.410> a

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
in the royal rumble arena and there's a

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.920 
in the royal rumble arena and there's a
reason<00:04:13.799> for<00:04:13.829> that<00:04:13.950> that's<00:04:14.340> because<00:04:14.730> 3<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.780> B

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
reason for that that's because 3 and B

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.770 
reason for that that's because 3 and B
is<00:04:16.200> in<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.500> Rumble<00:04:16.769> match<00:04:16.799> show<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.780> the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
is in the Rumble match show and the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.629 
is in the Rumble match show and the
shield<00:04:19.109> while<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.769> shield<00:04:19.979> I'm<00:04:20.100> not<00:04:20.250> too<00:04:20.400> sure

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
shield while the shield I'm not too sure

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.610 
shield while the shield I'm not too sure
but<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.000> think<00:04:21.120> they<00:04:21.419> will<00:04:21.659> be<00:04:21.989> involved<00:04:22.260> in<00:04:22.530> the

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
but I think they will be involved in the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.530 
but I think they will be involved in the
rumble<00:04:22.919> somehow<00:04:23.460> either<00:04:23.970> as<00:04:24.510> contestants

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
rumble somehow either as contestants

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.420 
rumble somehow either as contestants
as<00:04:25.630> entrance<00:04:26.260> in<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.650> actual<00:04:26.830> Royal<00:04:27.100> Rumble

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
as entrance in the actual Royal Rumble

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.310 
as entrance in the actual Royal Rumble
matchup<00:04:27.850> or<00:04:28.060> they're<00:04:28.240> gonna<00:04:28.300> just<00:04:28.750> interfere

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
matchup or they're gonna just interfere

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.990 
matchup or they're gonna just interfere
just<00:04:29.350> for<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.800> hell<00:04:29.950> of<00:04:29.980> it<00:04:30.130> at<00:04:30.550> least<00:04:30.700> that's

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
just for the hell of it at least that's

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.270 
just for the hell of it at least that's
what<00:04:31.420> I<00:04:31.450> think<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:31.960> if<00:04:32.320> they<00:04:32.530> do<00:04:32.590> take<00:04:32.980> part<00:04:33.220> in

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
what I think and if they do take part in

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.190 
what I think and if they do take part in
the<00:04:33.520> rumble<00:04:33.850> I'm<00:04:34.270> wondering<00:04:34.750> are<00:04:34.930> we<00:04:35.020> gonna

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
the rumble I'm wondering are we gonna

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.830 
the rumble I'm wondering are we gonna
see<00:04:35.590> like<00:04:35.830> interaction<00:04:36.640> between<00:04:37.000> 3<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.480> B<00:04:37.630> and

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
see like interaction between 3 and B and

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.470 
see like interaction between 3 and B and
the<00:04:38.470> shield's<00:04:38.950> maybe<00:04:39.340> they<00:04:39.520> fight<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:39.940> out<00:04:40.060> I

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
the shield's maybe they fight it out I

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.590 
the shield's maybe they fight it out I
mean<00:04:40.810> they're<00:04:40.990> both<00:04:41.610> stables<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:42.940> both<00:04:43.390> are

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
mean they're both stables and both are

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.640 
mean they're both stables and both are
consisted<00:04:44.380> of<00:04:44.530> three<00:04:44.890> superstars<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:46.780> why<00:04:47.470> not

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
consisted of three superstars so why not

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.360 
consisted of three superstars so why not
you<00:04:48.160> know<00:04:48.280> in<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.730> 2011<00:04:49.690> Rumble<00:04:50.110> you<00:04:50.260> had<00:04:50.470> the

new<00:04:51.550> Nexus<00:04:52.080> versus<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.290> core<00:04:53.560> so<00:04:54.250> maybe<00:04:54.520> this

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
new Nexus versus the core so maybe this

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.430 
new Nexus versus the core so maybe this
time<00:04:55.000> we<00:04:55.210> get<00:04:55.330> 3<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:55.660> B<00:04:55.750> versus<00:04:56.050> the<00:04:56.140> shield

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
time we get 3 and B versus the shield

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.320 
time we get 3 and B versus the shield

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
was better than all three of these

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.110 
was better than all three of these
matches<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:05.920> they<00:05:06.430> have<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.580> kick-ass<00:05:06.850> team

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120
