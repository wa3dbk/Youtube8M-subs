00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 in 1897 in a small newspaper of low 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.340
 southern california appeared published in 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.889
 front page the next story to 40 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.840
 miles from the port of La Paz to 50 miles 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.610
 in front of the island of san francisquito 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.560
 next to San Jose 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.510
 there is a mountain that bathes the waters of the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.570
 sea ​​located between 24 42º 30 24 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.560
 degrees 42 minutes 30 seconds of the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.660
 North latitude and 110 40º 110 degrees 40 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.640
 minutes of west longitude that from 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.640
 very remote times is known with the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.950
 name of the mop perhaps the calculation of 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 the distances are not so precise but 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.000
 in a current map we find the island of 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.850
 San Jose and San Francisco north 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.620
 of peace in close coordinates but 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.700
 different those mentioned in the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.340
 1897 article one of the most divers 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.719
 old coasts of california 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.000
 account that when the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.920
 pearl hatcheries in baja california 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.109
 and that he still did not come to the world 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.270
 the yaquis since equal indigenous of the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.760
 region were free to fish 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.990
 of pearl built as now in the year 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.630
 of 1809 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.909
 and 7 date at that time the diver 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.070
 the body was bound with fat, the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.990
 stomach with a soyate kind of rope and 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.210
 he had a stick stake in his hand 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.180
 to defend against the diving whale 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.220
 dolphin sperm shark blue shark 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.409
 sword and other terrible animals that 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.750
 they abound in that place as you see 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.880
 more than 100 years ago when this was collected 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.039
 legend were considered dangerous to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.100
 animals that we consider friendly today 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.140
 like the dolphin once the divers got 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.149
 they prepared in the aforementioned way 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.069
 they were thrown to the bottom of the sea arriving 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.310
 every diver to take off in a few hours 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.049
 300 or more shells the Yaquis had the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.030
 custom of offering the virgin the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.770
 last pearl that they took in their work or 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.500
 day what they did devout and 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.229
 rigorously every day some of 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.209
 so many Yaquis when finishing their task without 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.399
 hesitate to give the air of disbelief 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:00.990
 courageous before throwing himself into the water of 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.850
 look for the pearl that touched the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.920
 virgin said he was going for it to 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.049
 give it to the devil say the chronicles 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.789
 that the unfortunate did not come out again 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.920
 from the bottom of the sea and that his companions 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.460
 they fled in terror and commenting 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.920
 result of that terrible blasphemy 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.620
 since then, according to the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.240
 locals sometimes especially before 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.160
 from the sunrise many of the 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.260
 boats that pass there have 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.240
 seen emerging from the water to an individual of 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.770
 long hair but when pretending 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.650
 get close to see it up close 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.690
 it submerges again with the passage of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.820
 time the Yaquis were abandoning 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.920
 than the second pearl farm but 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.720
 the legend is already created and in the region 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.750
 He called me cocky becoming more 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.760
 known respected and even feared well 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.670
 concludes the story published in that 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.830
 newspaper and true or not but still today in 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.660
 day that place inspires a certain fear of 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.490
 who know the story so the 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.860
 nature has adopted that coast 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.690
 of naked and imposing rocks always 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.490
 beaten for the splash of the waters 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.650
 noise that coupled with a haze 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.660
 capricious gives the place an atmosphere 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.670
 Sinister that you want or do not want 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.530
 true fear fear and even awe 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.760
 who before dawn dare 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.760
 to navigate those waters
