00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.559
 the world's first in one 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.180
 four-cylinder TSI used active 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.670
 Cylinder management is the new one 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.799
 pioneering technology from volkswagen 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.290
 for dynamic driving fun and low 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.419
 Fuel consumption correspond to the 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:25.029
 Power requirements of the engine become two 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:25.029
 cylinder off or switched on 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.040
 the cylinder shutdown finds 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.980
 Applications in the speed range of 1400 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.700
 up to 4000 revolutions per minute and in the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.559
 Load range from 25 to 75 newton meters 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.989
 it leads to an average 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.829
 Reduction of the standard consumption of 0.4 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.749
 liter at 100 kilometers 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.429
 externally the engine is different 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.800
 with cylinder shutdown of his 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.929
 power same base engine through 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.239
 Actuators on the cylinder head 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.219
 hood are attached over the 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.629
 Timing belt and the stages become 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.690
 the two built camshafts 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.690
 actuated 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.729
 they have an outer longitudinal toothing 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.470
 on this are so-called cam pieces 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.479
 inside also with a longitudinal 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.190
 toothing fitted mounted the 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.080
 toothing of the components leaves one 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.420
 axial displacement of the cam pieces 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.510
 from cylinder two and three on the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.030
 and outlet side to it are two pimples 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.070
 Contours per valve available from where 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.540
 a curly outline a continuous one 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.610
 has a basic circle 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.730
 Over a rolling tow lever is the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.620
 transfer nub contour to the valve 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.690
 The shifting mechanism will be respectively 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.990
 through a double actuator per curl 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.640
 piece set in motion 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.649
 with a switching time of 11 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.570
 milliseconds spurt a pin of the double 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.369
 The actuator is a screw drive 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.649
 the backdrop for the new piece 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.390
 connected is that one more piece 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.740
 becomes full in the basic circle phase 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.740
 moved to the 0 stroke 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.750
 the valves and then 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.820
 stay closed the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.490
 Fuel injection in the cylinders 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.870
 2 and 3 is switched off at the same time and 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.630
 they run and fire with 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.480
 the cylinder deactivation is now active 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.280
 Cylinders 1 and 4 are now in 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.830
 operated a higher load range 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.540
 lower charge exchange losses and 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.340
 a holistic higher 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.800
 efficiency of the engine provide in the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.140
 partial load operation in city traffic on the 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.530
 highway or motorway to trips 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.120
 130 km / h for one to 20 percent 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.120
 lower fuel consumption 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.799
 at an increased load requirements 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.870
 the engine for example in 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.969
 acceleration phases are within 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.739
 from one and a half camshaft revolutions 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.810
 the resting cylinders on the same 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.549
 wisely switched on again 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.959
 Switching takes place for the driver 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.959
 absolutely imperceptible 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.280
 Volkswagen manages the active cylinder 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.890
 Management for the first time in large series 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.040
 at a direct injection 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.040
 four-cylinder engine 1
