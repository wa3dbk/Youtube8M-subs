00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
bulky for here i have another small pin

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.559 
bulky for here i have another small pin
that<00:03:42.390> i'll<00:03:42.480> probably<00:03:42.720> put<00:03:43.190> back<00:03:44.190> behind<00:03:45.000> those

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
that i'll probably put back behind those

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.589 
that i'll probably put back behind those
over<00:03:46.140> there<00:03:46.260> by<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.560> dance<00:03:47.489> or<00:03:48.000> can't<00:03:48.239> be<00:03:48.360> seen

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
over there by the dance or can't be seen

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.869 
over there by the dance or can't be seen
but<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.709> other<00:03:49.830> reason<00:03:50.069> is<00:03:50.250> just<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.610> Sun

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
but the other reason is just the Sun

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.970 
but the other reason is just the Sun
hits<00:03:51.629> right<00:03:51.930> here<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.379> so<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.620> summer<00:03:52.860> I

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
hits right here and so the summer I

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.160 
hits right here and so the summer I
could<00:03:53.220> have<00:03:53.310> putting<00:03:53.489> up<00:03:53.580> in<00:03:53.670> here<00:03:53.879> anyways
