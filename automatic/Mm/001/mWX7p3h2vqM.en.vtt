ship<00:01:55.799> wrecked<00:01:56.100> or<00:01:56.460> maybe<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.000> could<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
ship wrecked or maybe this could be a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.929 
ship wrecked or maybe this could be a
cover-up<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.810> Niko<00:01:58.170> Bellic<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.189> we<00:01:59.520> also<00:01:59.670> know

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
it's the oli fantasies also in this

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.679 
it's the oli fantasies also in this
location<00:02:02.310> as<00:02:02.430> well<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.270> could<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
location as well so it could just be a

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.510 
location as well so it could just be a
lazy<00:02:03.899> mistake<00:02:04.380> from<00:02:04.619> Rockstar<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.310> don't

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
code it actually translates to hey

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.199

Niko<00:03:19.150> Bellic<00:03:19.299> could<00:03:19.570> be<00:03:19.660> inside<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:19.989> hatch

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
Niko Bellic could be inside that hatch

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.410 
Niko Bellic could be inside that hatch

is<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.750> famous<00:03:23.350> line<00:03:23.650> from<00:03:23.680> gta4<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.580> everyone

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
is a famous line from gta4 that everyone

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.820 
is a famous line from gta4 that everyone
knows<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.450> went<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.230> Niko<00:03:26.500> Bellic

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
knows that went to Niko Bellic

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.430 
knows that went to Niko Bellic
from<00:03:27.370> his<00:03:27.640> cousin<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.780> makes<00:03:29.200> that

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
from his cousin so it makes that

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.990 
from his cousin so it makes that
connection<00:03:29.680> straight<00:03:30.070> there<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:30.430> this<00:03:30.670> could

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
connection straight there so this could

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.820 
connection straight there so this could
be<00:03:31.330> leading<00:03:31.630> onto<00:03:31.989> something<00:03:32.350> I'm<00:03:32.470> really<00:03:32.620> not

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
be leading onto something I'm really not

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.949 
be leading onto something I'm really not
sure<00:03:32.890> but<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.640> think<00:03:33.940> there<00:03:34.450> was<00:03:34.570> someone<00:03:34.780> on

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
sure but I think there was someone on

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.720 
sure but I think there was someone on
that<00:03:35.080> ship<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.860> they're<00:03:36.220> trying<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.430> cover<00:03:36.610> up

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
that ship and they're trying to cover up

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.759 
that ship and they're trying to cover up
who<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.060> was<00:03:37.180> so<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.720> think<00:03:38.260> there's<00:03:38.560> something

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769
