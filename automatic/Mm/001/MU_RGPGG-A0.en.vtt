00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.880
 Tell the musÃ©e esac erick flowers and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.370
 today he talks about piracy here 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.650
 and water will never be lacking, it is not good 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.900
 salary a lot of people depends on the purchase 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.340
 in this game and companies have to take 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.770
 Strange Attitudes Protect Products 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.380
 They could make us stop. 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.970
 work but often some 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.760
 companies carry on the joke more than 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.619
 Seriously, and when you least expect it, it's called. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.029
 the serve game won in a way 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.920
 very different 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.910
 in the video revealing some of these 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.160
 ways let's go there our first game 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.260
 today is the gun two someone has tried 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.719
 download a pirated 2 to run daisy 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.670
 boo in case you have to play the game of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.309
 bohemian pirate it will start 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.969
 working fine but soon take over 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.280
 his secret identity a 'banana' the 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.180
 New basically a fruit that when 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.820
 foot fall is ripe and will rot 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.800
 rotting rotting what you mean 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.220
 that the game stops working slowly 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.909
 soon the shots to hit the targets the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.920
 vehicles stopped walking and every time but 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.020
 the game will stop working and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.370
 becoming more in others as a 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.840
 banana and rot 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.820
 second game you are gaining in 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.490
 potato and communicates that the region 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.370
 east 2 when you hacked the game there 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.460
 there is another personal and 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.860
 basically runs away from its 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.440
 douro explodes the base of players in 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.780
 only 30 seconds of starting 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.030
 almost any map and play 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:45.950
 Look, it's going to happen. Look, you look. 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:48.460
 happened to fucking tablao when he died 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.460
 the game over 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.010
 the third our list and metal gear 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.020
 solid twin snakes the use of handcuffs is 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.000
 basically the devil 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.740
 Some people remember old ones when 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.630
 games that asked for some 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.780
 a specific page of the game manual 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.090
 so you could continue good 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.250
 metal gear solid 3 snake has this same 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.350
 type of copy protection but a 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.600
 way a little different in certain 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.760
 game point the snake in contacting honey 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.560
 but the frequency for this connection does not 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.020
 appears in his codec 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.940
 the solution to this mystery is to seek 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.940
 the frequency at the back of the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.640
 wolf packaging and no it's not the box 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.020
 cd or if you noticed off the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.390
 packaging game because eventually 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.370
 tomorrow what everyone does 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.020
 the end of hiring a cloth is 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.780
 taking dust in your room 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.130
 You'll have to make me go after the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.130
