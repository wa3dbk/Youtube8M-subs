00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:05.530 

firstly<00:00:56.840> twice<00:00:58.000> okay<00:00:59.000> this<00:00:59.899> part<00:01:04.360> yeah<00:01:05.360> I'm

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
firstly twice okay this part yeah I'm

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.210 
firstly twice okay this part yeah I'm
guessing<00:01:05.990> it<00:01:06.260> because<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.710> sounds<00:01:06.950> like<00:01:07.070> he's

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
guessing it because it sounds like he's

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.080 
guessing it because it sounds like he's
uh<00:01:07.659> using<00:01:08.659> a<00:01:08.720> harmonizer<00:01:09.400> or<00:01:10.400> a<00:01:10.430> pitch<00:01:10.700> bender

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
uh using a harmonizer or a pitch bender

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.219 
uh using a harmonizer or a pitch bender
or<00:01:11.240> something<00:01:11.479> like<00:01:11.540> that<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:11.900> get<00:01:12.020> there<00:01:12.140> was

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
or something like that to get there was

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.150 
or something like that to get there was
really<00:01:12.440> high<00:01:12.650> notes
