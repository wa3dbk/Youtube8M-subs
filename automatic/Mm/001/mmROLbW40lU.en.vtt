00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
a primary shotgun so you're actually

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.260 
a primary shotgun so you're actually
able<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.649> use<00:00:49.860> another<00:00:50.340> special<00:00:50.940> weapon

been<00:01:46.259> looking<00:01:46.590> forward<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.100> getting<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.549> for

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
been looking forward to getting it for

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.090 
been looking forward to getting it for
quite<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.119> long<00:01:48.299> time<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.740> soon

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
quite a long time and what I soon

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.039 
quite a long time and what I soon
discovered<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.540> order<00:01:51.780> to

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
discovered is that in order to

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.380 
discovered is that in order to
appreciate<00:01:52.439> universal<00:01:53.430> remote<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.939> have<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
appreciate universal remote you have to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.899 
appreciate universal remote you have to
become<00:01:54.780> one<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.560> gun<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
become one with the gun you have to

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.999 
become one with the gun you have to
understand<00:01:57.540> its<00:01:57.719> weaknesses<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.979> a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
understand its weaknesses and like a

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.609 
understand its weaknesses and like a
true<00:01:59.159> partnership<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.140> make<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.500> for

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
true partnership you have to make up for

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.819 
true partnership you have to make up for
its<00:02:02.430> weaknesses<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.020> use<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> sniper

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
its weaknesses so I like to use a sniper

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.310 
its weaknesses so I like to use a sniper
rifle<00:02:04.979> when<00:02:05.579> i'm<00:02:05.670> using<00:02:06.149> universal<00:02:06.930> remote

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
rifle when i'm using universal remote

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.889 
rifle when i'm using universal remote
because<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:08.280> I'm<00:02:08.550> effective<00:02:09.209> at<00:02:09.330> range<00:02:09.629> I'm

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
because then I'm effective at range I'm

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.979 
because then I'm effective at range I'm
also<00:02:10.319> effective<00:02:10.979> at<00:02:11.160> close<00:02:11.520> range<00:02:11.970> medium<00:02:12.750> is

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
also effective at close range medium is

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.520 
also effective at close range medium is
a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.290 
a
little<00:02:13.650> bit<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.950> problem<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:14.730> we<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.120> make

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
little bit of a problem but we just make

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.240 
little bit of a problem but we just make
sure<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:15.840> don't<00:02:16.050> get<00:02:16.380> into<00:02:16.650> medium<00:02:17.010> range

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
sure that we don't get into medium range

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.400 
sure that we don't get into medium range
gunfights<00:02:17.580> that's<00:02:18.360> how<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.720> win<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.230> game

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
gunfights that's how you win the game

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.350 
gunfights that's how you win the game
you<00:02:19.860> always<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.700> play<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
you always have to play to the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.410 
you always have to play to the
advantages<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.520> universal<00:02:23.520> remote<00:02:23.880> so

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
advantages of universal remote so

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.240 
advantages of universal remote so
quickly<00:02:24.810> when<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.990> found<00:02:25.230> out<00:02:25.470> what<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.040> so

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
quickly when I found out what is so

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.730 
quickly when I found out what is so
great<00:02:26.550> about<00:02:26.959> universal<00:02:27.959> remote<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.620> it

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
great about universal remote is that it

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.760 
great about universal remote is that it
has<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.220> much<00:02:29.580> higher<00:02:30.030> range<00:02:30.569> than<00:02:31.440> other

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
has a much higher range than other

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.670 
has a much higher range than other
shotguns<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.540> course<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.290> largely

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
shotguns and of course this is largely

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.320 
shotguns and of course this is largely
down<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.400> fact<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.760> when<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.090> aim<00:02:36.300> down

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
down to the fact that when you aim down

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.930 
down to the fact that when you aim down
sights<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.560> aren't<00:02:37.800> increasingly<00:02:38.370> effective

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
sights you aren't increasingly effective

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.690 
sights you aren't increasingly effective
range<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.590> universal<00:02:40.590> remote<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.459> found

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
range of universal remote so I found

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.040 
range of universal remote so I found
that<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.940> lot<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.300> time<00:02:42.569> instead<00:02:42.989> of

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
that a lot of the time instead of

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.630 
that a lot of the time instead of
getting<00:02:43.319> killed<00:02:43.590> trades<00:02:43.980> like<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.400> usually

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
getting killed trades like I usually

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.210 
getting killed trades like I usually
would<00:02:45.090> with<00:02:45.270> other<00:02:45.450> shotguns<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.290> was<00:02:46.800> able<00:02:46.980> to

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
would with other shotguns I was able to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.400 
would with other shotguns I was able to
kill<00:02:47.489> them<00:02:47.760> before<00:02:48.060> they<00:02:48.300> got<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.930> me<00:02:49.110> because

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
kill them before they got to me because

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.190 
kill them before they got to me because
I<00:02:49.709> had<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.310> remote<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> remote<00:02:51.900> has<00:02:52.140> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
I had the remote and the remote has a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.040 
I had the remote and the remote has a
better<00:02:52.560> range<00:02:52.890> than<00:02:53.100> your<00:02:53.489> shotgun<00:02:54.239> another

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
better range than your shotgun another

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.840 
better range than your shotgun another
advantage<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.070> would<00:02:56.220> definitely<00:02:56.370> have

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
advantage that you would definitely have

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.970 
advantage that you would definitely have
to<00:02:57.090> use<00:02:57.390> universal<00:02:57.989> remote<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.440> really<00:02:58.680> figure

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
to use universal remote to really figure

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.070 
to use universal remote to really figure
out<00:02:59.069> that<00:02:59.459> it's<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.760> thing<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.330> that<00:03:00.900> when

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
out that it's a thing is that when

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.630 
out that it's a thing is that when
people<00:03:01.410> see<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.739> snipe<00:03:04.040> gun<00:03:05.040> because<00:03:05.370> why

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
people see you snipe gun because why

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.300 
people see you snipe gun because why
would<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.150> have<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.390> shotgun<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.830> can't<00:03:08.100> have

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
would you have a shotgun you can't have

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.070 
would you have a shotgun you can't have
a<00:03:08.340> sniper<00:03:08.610> rifle<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.180> shotgun<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.720> no<00:03:09.900> one

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
a sniper rifle and a shotgun and no one

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.900 
a sniper rifle and a shotgun and no one
uses<00:03:10.319> universal<00:03:11.010> remote<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.519> why<00:03:11.670> would<00:03:11.880> you

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
uses universal remote so why would you

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.759 
uses universal remote so why would you
have<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> shotgun<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.170> lot<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.560> time

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
have a shotgun so a lot of the time

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.580 
have a shotgun so a lot of the time
people<00:03:13.800> who<00:03:14.310> run<00:03:14.640> at<00:03:14.819> you<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.269> not<00:03:15.840> expect<00:03:16.319> for

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
people who run at you and not expect for

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.500 
people who run at you and not expect for
you<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.709> be<00:03:16.830> able<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.160> take<00:03:17.430> them<00:03:17.670> out<00:03:17.850> actually

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
you to be able to take them out actually

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.270 
you to be able to take them out actually
a<00:03:18.540> lot<00:03:18.900> better<00:03:19.200> than<00:03:19.530> they're<00:03:19.680> able<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:20.010> take

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
a lot better than they're able to take

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.550 
a lot better than they're able to take
you<00:03:20.430> out<00:03:20.459> with<00:03:20.850> their<00:03:21.060> shotgun<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:21.840> found<00:03:22.350> that

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
you out with their shotgun I found that

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.880 
you out with their shotgun I found that
happen<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.430> lot<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.660> happens<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.650> frequently

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
happen a lot it happens so frequently

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.130 
happen a lot it happens so frequently
that<00:03:26.340> someone<00:03:26.850> just<00:03:27.000> came<00:03:27.180> running<00:03:27.480> at<00:03:27.720> me<00:03:27.750> and

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
that someone just came running at me and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.750 
that someone just came running at me and
they<00:03:28.440> expected<00:03:28.980> me<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.160> be<00:03:29.220> completely

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
they expected me to be completely

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.580 
they expected me to be completely
defenseless<00:03:30.360> because<00:03:30.810> they<00:03:30.959> saw<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.380> was

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
defenseless because they saw that I was

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.160 
defenseless because they saw that I was
sniping<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.220> then<00:03:32.640> I'm<00:03:32.760> like<00:03:32.910> boom<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.660> have

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
sniping and then I'm like boom I have

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.110 
sniping and then I'm like boom I have
the<00:03:34.410> remote<00:03:34.739> which<00:03:35.370> is<00:03:35.519> better<00:03:35.700> than<00:03:35.940> your

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
the remote which is better than your

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.539 
the remote which is better than your
shotgun<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.870> it's<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.140> truth<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.799> it's

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
shotgun and it's the truth it is it's

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.340 
shotgun and it's the truth it is it's
not<00:03:38.790> better<00:03:39.000> when<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.390> first<00:03:39.630> get<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.110> it's

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
not better when you first get it it's

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.170 
not better when you first get it it's
definitely<00:03:40.650> one<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.190> those<00:03:41.340> exotics<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.090> you

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
definitely one of those exotics that you

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.900 
definitely one of those exotics that you
have<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.660> level<00:03:42.840> up<00:03:43.049> all<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:44.070> way<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.370> need

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
have to level up all the way you need

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.599 
have to level up all the way you need
the<00:03:45.120> universal<00:03:45.780> remote<00:03:46.109> perk<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.799> order<00:03:47.459> for

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
the universal remote perk in order for

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.970 
the universal remote perk in order for
the<00:03:47.730> shotgun<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.359> actually<00:03:48.840> be<00:03:49.019> good<00:03:49.320> but<00:03:49.829> when

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
the shotgun to actually be good but when

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.949 
the shotgun to actually be good but when
you<00:03:50.100> do<00:03:50.280> get<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.640> perk<00:03:50.970> it's<00:03:51.239> better<00:03:51.720> than

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
you do get that perk it's better than

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.140 
you do get that perk it's better than
other<00:03:52.170> shotguns<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.890> has<00:03:53.130> better<00:03:53.459> range<00:03:53.820> and

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
other shotguns it has better range and

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.060 
other shotguns it has better range and
now<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.750> we've<00:03:54.870> learned<00:03:55.109> about<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.739> bigger

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
now that we've learned about a bigger

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.759 
now that we've learned about a bigger
nerve<00:03:56.400> coming<00:03:56.970> two<00:03:57.209> shotguns<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.200> also<00:03:58.650> the

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
nerve coming two shotguns and also the

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.710 
nerve coming two shotguns and also the
fact<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.100> Bungie<00:03:59.549> are<00:03:59.730> trying<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.180> limit<00:04:00.450> the

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
fact that Bungie are trying to limit the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.479 
fact that Bungie are trying to limit the
amount<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:01.079> special<00:04:01.500> ammo<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.799> we<00:04:02.040> have<00:04:02.250> I

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
amount of special ammo that we have I

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.880 
amount of special ammo that we have I
think<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.510> universal<00:04:04.079> remote<00:04:04.320> is<00:04:04.470> actually

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
think the universal remote is actually

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.009 
think the universal remote is actually
going<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.100> have<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.310> place<00:04:05.850> in<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.780> crucible

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
going to have a place in the crucible

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.500 
going to have a place in the crucible
because<00:04:07.650> think<00:04:07.859> about<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.280> if<00:04:08.549> bungee<00:04:09.150> is<00:04:09.180> to

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
because think about this if bungee is to

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.720 
because think about this if bungee is to
limit<00:04:09.720> our<00:04:09.959> availability<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.829> special<00:04:11.519> ammo

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
limit our availability of special ammo

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.430 
limit our availability of special ammo
even<00:04:12.209> more<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:12.750> than<00:04:12.900> they're<00:04:13.079> doing<00:04:13.290> now

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
even more so than they're doing now

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.050 
even more so than they're doing now
which<00:04:13.680> actually<00:04:13.920> seems<00:04:14.489> like<00:04:14.700> they're<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:14.910> a

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
which actually seems like they're on a

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.449 
which actually seems like they're on a
road<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.750> doing<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.350> people<00:04:17.070> aren't<00:04:17.280> going

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
road to doing that people aren't going

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.250 
road to doing that people aren't going
to<00:04:17.549> be<00:04:17.640> able<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.880> run<00:04:18.060> around<00:04:18.180> with<00:04:18.630> shotguns

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
to be able to run around with shotguns

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.509 
to be able to run around with shotguns
because<00:04:19.590> it's<00:04:19.769> not<00:04:19.919> going<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.190> be<00:04:20.310> available

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
because it's not going to be available

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.120 
because it's not going to be available
for<00:04:21.120> them<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.390> do<00:04:21.630> so<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.169> now<00:04:22.530> imagine<00:04:23.010> that

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
for them to do so and now imagine that

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.560 
for them to do so and now imagine that
you're<00:04:23.250> running<00:04:23.460> around<00:04:23.669> with<00:04:23.970> universal

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
you're running around with universal

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.870 
you're running around with universal
room

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
room

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.390 
room
oh<00:04:24.910> because<00:04:25.240> it's<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.930> primary<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:27.070> you're

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
oh because it's a primary and you're

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.910 
oh because it's a primary and you're
gonna<00:04:27.550> have<00:04:27.790> ammo<00:04:28.210> for<00:04:28.420> a<00:04:28.480> primary<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.410> you're

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
gonna have ammo for a primary and you're

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.560 
gonna have ammo for a primary and you're
just<00:04:30.130> running<00:04:30.310> up<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.580> people<00:04:30.970> who<00:04:31.180> don't<00:04:31.480> have

just running up to people who don't have
ammo<00:04:32.110> in<00:04:32.260> their<00:04:32.440> shotgun<00:04:32.980> that's<00:04:33.400> going<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:34.060> be

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
ammo in their shotgun that's going to be

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.970 
ammo in their shotgun that's going to be
awesome<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.960> course<00:04:35.170> it's<00:04:35.350> just<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.620> theory

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
awesome of course it's just a theory

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.340 
awesome of course it's just a theory
that<00:04:36.310> that's<00:04:36.790> gonna<00:04:37.000> be<00:04:37.210> happening<00:04:37.390> but<00:04:38.110> if<00:04:38.200> it

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
that that's gonna be happening but if it

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.040 
that that's gonna be happening but if it
does<00:04:38.670> universal<00:04:39.670> remote<00:04:40.000> is<00:04:40.210> going<00:04:40.540> to<00:04:40.690> have<00:04:40.900> a

place for sure now another really

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.630 
place for sure now another really
positive<00:04:44.290> thing<00:04:44.440> about<00:04:44.620> universal<00:04:45.190> remote<00:04:45.460> is

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
positive thing about universal remote is

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.210 
positive thing about universal remote is
that<00:04:45.850> it<00:04:46.060> is<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.240> freakin<00:04:46.810> king<00:04:47.140> amongst<00:04:47.830> kings

around with shotguns and universal

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.140 
around with shotguns and universal
remote<00:04:58.990> is<00:04:59.170> a<00:04:59.440> better<00:05:00.040> shot<00:05:00.460> gun<00:05:00.730> and<00:05:01.000> this

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
remote is a better shot gun and this

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.460

gameplay<00:05:01.360> that<00:05:01.630> I'm<00:05:01.750> showing<00:05:01.930> you<00:05:02.050> right<00:05:02.260> now

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
gameplay that I'm showing you right now

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.830 
gameplay that I'm showing you right now
is<00:05:02.710> actually<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:03.190> perfect<00:05:03.850> example<00:05:04.030> of<00:05:04.780> that

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
is actually a perfect example of that

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.470 
is actually a perfect example of that
because<00:05:05.650> I<00:05:05.710> just<00:05:05.830> completely<00:05:06.480> annihilated

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
because I just completely annihilated

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.300 
because I just completely annihilated
people<00:05:07.900> and<00:05:08.110> they<00:05:08.230> were<00:05:08.290> also<00:05:08.590> running<00:05:08.980> around

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
people and they were also running around

with shotguns some people were using

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.040

universal<00:06:09.730> remote<00:06:10.000> to<00:06:10.210> make<00:06:10.390> its<00:06:10.570> range

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
universal remote to make its range

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.290 
universal remote to make its range
better<00:06:11.260> because<00:06:11.920> that<00:06:12.130> way<00:06:12.340> when<00:06:12.760> it<00:06:12.880> comes<00:06:13.120> to

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
better because that way when it comes to

even a thing they are a thing when you

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.860 
even a thing they are a thing when you

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.420 
use universal remote you're gonna mostly
win<00:06:20.170> them<00:06:20.350> there's<00:06:20.680> sometimes<00:06:20.920> that<00:06:21.310> you

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
win them there's sometimes that you

range than any secondary shotgun and
that's<00:06:28.330> just<00:06:28.540> a<00:06:28.690> fact<00:06:28.930> so<00:06:29.830> after<00:06:30.010> using
