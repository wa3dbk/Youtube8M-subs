00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
towards the end of the video so let's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.240 
towards the end of the video so let's
get<00:00:30.810> started<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.320> processor<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> Moto

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
get started with the processor the Moto

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.350 
get started with the processor the Moto
X<00:00:32.550> will<00:00:32.790> feature<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.120> modal<00:00:33.630> motorola<00:00:34.140> x8<00:00:34.710> cpu

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
X will feature a modal motorola x8 cpu

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.760 
X will feature a modal motorola x8 cpu
same<00:00:36.360> as<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> droid<00:00:36.809> ultra<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.380> they<00:00:37.530> both

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
same as the droid ultra so they both

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.700 
same as the droid ultra so they both
feature<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.340> same<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.780> computing<00:00:40.290> system

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
feature the same the computing system

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.979 
feature the same the computing system
which<00:00:41.399> actually<00:00:41.730> consists<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.660> many

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
which actually consists of many

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.600 
which actually consists of many
different<00:00:43.440> things<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.950> has<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> dual-core

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
different things so it has a dual-core

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.420 
different things so it has a dual-core
1.7<00:00:45.180> gigahertz<00:00:45.660> Snapdragon<00:00:46.440> s4<00:00:46.559> pro<00:00:47.160> CPU

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
1.7 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 pro CPU

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.119 
1.7 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 pro CPU
inside<00:00:48.030> along<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.079> quad-core<00:00:49.379> Adreno

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
inside along with the quad-core Adreno

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.270 
inside along with the quad-core Adreno
320<00:00:50.700> GPU<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.989> they're<00:00:52.199> pretty<00:00:52.920> much<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.129> same

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
320 GPU so they're pretty much the same

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.860 
320 GPU so they're pretty much the same
thing<00:00:53.340> built<00:00:53.760> into<00:00:54.059> both<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.239> smartphones

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
thing built into both the smartphones

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.810 
thing built into both the smartphones
both<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> smartphones<00:00:56.100> will<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.579> two

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
both the smartphones will have two

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.330 
both the smartphones will have two
gigabytes<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.390> RAM<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.840> display<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.680> where<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
gigabytes of RAM the display is where a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.819 
gigabytes of RAM the display is where a
lot<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> differences<00:01:00.300> are<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.350> Moto<00:01:01.559> X

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
lot of the differences are at the Moto X

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.990 
lot of the differences are at the Moto X
is<00:01:02.010> only<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.789> 4.7<00:01:03.690> inch<00:01:03.870> display<00:01:04.739> whereas<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
is only a 4.7 inch display whereas the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.920 
is only a 4.7 inch display whereas the
modal<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:07.170> droid<00:01:07.560> ultra<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.369> 5<00:01:09.240> inch<00:01:09.270> AMOLED

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
modal or droid ultra is a 5 inch AMOLED

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.359 
modal or droid ultra is a 5 inch AMOLED
display<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.380> they're<00:01:10.710> both<00:01:10.860> AMOLED

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
display so they're both AMOLED

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.250 
display so they're both AMOLED
technology<00:01:11.490> they're<00:01:12.119> they're<00:01:12.540> both<00:01:12.869> coming

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
technology they're they're both coming

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.820 
technology they're they're both coming
in<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:13.710> 720p<00:01:14.430> resolution<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.810> that's<00:01:15.990> 12<00:01:16.290> ATP

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
in at 720p resolution so that's 12 ATP

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.039 
in at 720p resolution so that's 12 ATP
by<00:01:17.040> 720<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.939> that's<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.600> bit<00:01:18.720> unfortunate

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
by 720 and that's a bit unfortunate

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.320 
by 720 and that's a bit unfortunate
especially<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> droid<00:01:20.670> ultra<00:01:20.820> because

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
especially for the droid ultra because

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.700 
especially for the droid ultra because
that's<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.600> larger<00:01:21.990> screen<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.500> would

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that's a larger screen so you would

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.999 
that's a larger screen so you would
expect<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.130> 1080p<00:01:23.659> display<00:01:24.659> panel<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:25.530> for

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
expect a 1080p display panel there for

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.800 
expect a 1080p display panel there for
resolution<00:01:26.670> because<00:01:26.850> that's<00:01:27.150> kind<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
resolution because that's kind of the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.109 
resolution because that's kind of the
standard<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.590> most<00:01:28.770> high-end<00:01:29.220> smartphones

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
standard for most high-end smartphones

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.520 
standard for most high-end smartphones
nowadays<00:01:30.450> its<00:01:31.189> 5-inch<00:01:32.189> 1080p<00:01:32.869> so<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.079> kind

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
nowadays its 5-inch 1080p so it's kind

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.499 
nowadays its 5-inch 1080p so it's kind
of<00:01:34.560> unfortunate<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.490> Moto<00:01:35.790> door<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
of unfortunate that the Moto door the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.179 
of unfortunate that the Moto door the
droid<00:01:36.750> ultra<00:01:36.960> doesn't<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.799> Moto<00:01:37.979> X

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
droid ultra doesn't have that the Moto X

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.280 
droid ultra doesn't have that the Moto X
is<00:01:38.369> more<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.729> mid-weight<00:01:39.119> mid<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.840> high-end

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
is more of a mid-weight mid to high-end

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.440 
is more of a mid-weight mid to high-end
smartphone<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.490> somewhere<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:41.939> between<00:01:42.180> there

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
smartphone so somewhere in between there

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.170 
smartphone so somewhere in between there
so<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.990> 720p<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.860> fine<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.640> smartphone

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
so the 720p is fine for that smartphone

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.350 
so the 720p is fine for that smartphone
