is pre snap the stem of the bounce tag

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.900 
is pre snap the stem of the bounce tag
is<00:01:26.360> all<00:01:26.870> out<00:01:27.140> in<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.320> snap<00:01:27.580> again<00:01:28.580> we<00:01:28.730> were<00:01:28.850> a

is all out in the snap again we were a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.740 
is all out in the snap again we were a
31<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.260> we<00:01:30.440> are<00:01:30.560> in<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.920> over<00:01:31.460> front<00:01:31.760> and<00:01:32.090> on<00:01:32.630> the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
31 so we are in a over front and on the

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.780 
31 so we are in a over front and on the
snap<00:01:32.960> of<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.110> ball<00:01:33.170> we're<00:01:33.500> going<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.890> move<00:01:34.130> to

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
snap of the ball we're going to move to

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.600 
snap of the ball we're going to move to
an<00:01:34.910> under<00:01:35.180> front<00:01:35.450> if<00:01:36.080> I<00:01:36.290> back<00:01:36.530> up<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.280> stem

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
an under front if I back up to the stem

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.670 
an under front if I back up to the stem
you'll<00:01:38.300> see<00:01:38.570> that<00:01:38.870> we're<00:01:39.200> moving<00:01:39.320> from<00:01:39.560> a

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
you'll see that we're moving from a

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.520 
you'll see that we're moving from a
three<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:39.950> one<00:01:40.150> so<00:01:41.150> our<00:01:41.180> seven<00:01:41.750> tech<00:01:41.960> must<00:01:42.170> ear

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
three to one so our seven tech must ear

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.770 
three to one so our seven tech must ear
