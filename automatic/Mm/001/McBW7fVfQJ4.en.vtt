cut<00:00:33.149> these<00:00:33.300> pieces<00:00:33.510> out<00:00:33.840> because<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.530> know<00:00:34.620> it

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
cut these pieces out because you know it

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.069 
cut these pieces out because you know it
takes<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.070> minute<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.399> measure<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.329> make<00:00:36.840> sure

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
takes a minute to measure and make sure

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.389 
takes a minute to measure and make sure
that<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.380> right<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:37.829> what<00:00:37.950> we're<00:00:38.070> gonna<00:00:38.160> do

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
that it's right but what we're gonna do

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.610 
that it's right but what we're gonna do
is<00:00:38.610> we're<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.450> gonna<00:00:39.750> take<00:00:40.200> our<00:00:40.260> hot<00:00:40.590> glue

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
is we're just gonna take our hot glue

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.350 
is we're just gonna take our hot glue
gun<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:43.129> we<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:45.710> line<00:00:47.149> the<00:00:48.149> outer

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
gun and we are going to line the outer

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.770 
gun and we are going to line the outer
edges<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.440> tissue<00:00:49.710> box<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.309> hot<00:00:51.239> glue

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.840 

hot<00:00:54.780> glue<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.559> experience<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.640> best

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
hot glue in my experience is the best

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.319 
hot glue in my experience is the best
with<00:00:57.210> felt<00:00:59.480> because<00:01:00.480> felt<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.050> very<00:01:01.320> porous

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
with felt because felt is very porous

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.960 
with felt because felt is very porous
and<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:06.420> sticks<00:01:06.840> well<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> we're<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.760> gonna

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and it sticks well so we're just gonna

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.750 
and it sticks well so we're just gonna
place<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> top<00:01:09.600> over<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:13.760> it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
place the top over just like this it

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.280 
place the top over just like this it
responds<00:01:15.240> very<00:01:15.270> well<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.900> hot<00:01:16.080> glue<00:01:19.640> okay

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
responds very well to the hot glue okay

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:35.170 
responds very well to the hot glue okay
now<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> sides<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> take

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:02:12.360 

there<00:01:35.900> we<00:01:36.020> go<00:01:36.910> reload

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.839 

I'm<00:02:12.909> just<00:02:13.150> pressed<00:02:13.480> down<00:02:13.720> there<00:02:17.580> yeah<00:02:18.580> and

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
I'm just pressed down there yeah and

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.839 
I'm just pressed down there yeah and
we'll<00:02:19.000> do<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.209> other<00:02:19.360> side

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
we'll do the other side

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.530 
we'll do the other side
of<00:02:21.849> course<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.360> patterned<00:02:23.640> felt<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.879> a<00:02:25.150> little

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
of course the patterned felt is a little

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.750 
of course the patterned felt is a little
bit<00:02:25.690> cost<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.019> little<00:02:26.110> bit<00:02:26.260> more<00:02:26.470> but<00:02:26.760> still

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
bit cost a little bit more but still

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.809 
bit cost a little bit more but still
fairly<00:02:28.239> inexpensive<00:02:28.900> for<00:02:29.230> example<00:02:29.680> this<00:02:30.459> felt

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
fairly inexpensive for example this felt

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.210 
fairly inexpensive for example this felt
that<00:02:31.299> I'm<00:02:31.420> using<00:02:31.629> in<00:02:31.810> particular<00:02:32.349> was<00:02:32.980> made
