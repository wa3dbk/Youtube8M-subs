00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.869
 and how good are you all here at the resort 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.320
 we are again next for the kingdom 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:25.610
 Test 5.2 with new changes in the 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.470
 pique have not implemented a new 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.920
 patch tonight and well then 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.570
 they have finally eliminated the talent that 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.070
 we already knew that he was going to remove or 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.160
 we assumed that it was going to be removed that was 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.470
 the talent we were already testing what 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.710
 we saw that it was a little bit a little 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.340
 useless why it was 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.170
 nothing nothing momentous have implemented 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.210
 several changes which I will go 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.280
 commenting but good the change 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.350
 main thing we wanted to tell you today 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:00.370
 is that they have replaced the hit and run by 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.960
 the cloud talent is doing well or what 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.440
 it would be something like layer and 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:12.130
 dagger or coat and dagger alright let's go to 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.259
 open the talents book there we have it 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.729
 let's make it a little bit bigger and 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:21.280
 let's read what has been going on 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.860
 it's a passive ability, that is, not 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.160
 we need to activate it says our 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.890
 ambush stick or hit low now 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.830
 It can be used from 30 yards away 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.570
 distance and that is going to cause that 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.200
 we appear directly behind 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.990
 our goal is to say that good is 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.350
 that always very much stability 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.330
 we will appear behind our objective 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.470
 well this is really fine since 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.150
 Let's do the dance of the shadows 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.340
 much that our target moves through 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.979
 example us when we give to the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.899
 ambush we're always going to hit 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.690
 always be always let's talk 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.380
 with the fly is something that automatically 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.720
 makes us france to the shadows be 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.239
 impossible but impossible to block 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.910
 let's take away the talent we're going to 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.450
 activate it we have it here active and 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.150
 Well, as I said before, it's 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.690
 something passive is to say this ability does not 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.130
 we will be able to take it to the bar 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.170
 skills as you see good then now 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.790
 same I have there the step of the shadows 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.280
 that is as if darkened because 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.590
 I have that skill and but the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.569
 club wins see the cape and dagger you're not going to 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.950
 to be able to take it to the skill bar 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.910
 because it's not going to be used is going to 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.580
 always use regardless of 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.190
 in our activation because it does not require 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.950
 activation as I already am 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.330
 commenting 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.099
 well come on let's do tests what 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.800
 let's do now is we are here in 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.190
 forge as you see tarjeteados we get 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.200
 in stealth and we will use first the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.239
 low blow for you to see how 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.519
 works well what drives 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.650
 directly the skill bar and you see 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.880
 to look for we appear from behind and 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.220
 I also have the macro for the 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.430
 premeditation and that without any problem 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.790
 We appeared well behind will 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.590
 repeat this same operation with the 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.500
 garrote and with the ambush so that what 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.150
 you see that it works with the three so that 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.849
 see that I do not lie to you 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.299
 reading we also get into stealth 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.280
 let's now make the club well and 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.170
 you see that we appear completely by 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.130
 behind 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.450
 and that without problems of launching the macro 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.940
 of premeditation not 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.349
 well let's put back the required 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.780
 it's a bit repetitive to apologize and 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.510
 let's do the ambush well and 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.340
 normally without problem is something passive 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.739
 as we have said let's do it 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.060
 now much more difficult is to say we 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.620
 let's separate more and you'll see what 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.680
 well then when we get into 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.630
 stealth and we took our bar away 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.430
 of tasks is placed in red like 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.410
 our skills hanging but 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.540
 when we approach a little bit they are already 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.569
 in white this will tell us how many 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.489
 it's the 30 yards of range and you're going to see 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.040
 it's good then we have a range 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.980
 quite acceptable we can hit from 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.470
 approximately from there you can no longer 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.930
 and since she can, this is pretty 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.840
 well because they to these constants 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.820
 whenever we have it you have to good 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.100
 that we make the low blow and that without 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.229
 any kind of problem let's do it 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.639
 now harder still because this is 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.389
 something that I discovered doing here 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.770
 pots that is with objects in between 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.919
 that is to say around the column 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.710
 we use the club and it does 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.699
 well that is just me 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.409
 jump the column and obviated 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.389
 completely and what have I done we are going to 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.569
 make it harder now we still 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.379
 let's put inside this building 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.449
 well inside this building 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:06.900
 we select the domi that is closest 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.220
 you see I'm super away there's already a 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.919
 I'm going to teach you from 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.180
 again because it 's quite obvious is 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.740
 a wall that's why I came here to 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.960
 forge because I knew there were buildings 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.440
 around here in half booths and we're going to 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.849
 put Vicente inside the building and 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.130
 we are going to prove it you are going to definitive 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.770
 you're like a goat, you watch guys 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.580
 because there it goes 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.860
 and without any problem metele 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.460
 contributed behind our goal and I have 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:40.080
 put a club or this is something that 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:43.830
 goes through the walls if it goes through 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.330
 the walls this is super over fine 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.940
 why then because normally when 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.159
 we are in the sand what hurts us and 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.250
 it's customary for us to happen is that our 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.810
 our card was planning us what 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.129
 remove and because the column that follows there is 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.199
 I'm going over here, you have to move to 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:00.169
 there who do not know what then from 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.230
 now we get into stealth 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.500
 all right 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.970
 let's go into stealth in the area 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.350
 the column without any program 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.480
 because obviously it does not hit us 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.860
 we beat apart from behind and we split 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.850
 head 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:18.300
 well directly without any kind of 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.590
 problem is something really spectacular 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.480
 well I do not know if this came to 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.980
 change or something like that because I think that 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:30.070
 the possibilities are enormous 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.080
 and in the new way of seeing the game that 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.530
 would have the picador to make appear a 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.800
 unit seems like something can of any 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:42.970
 type of reasoning and rule will 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.250
 talk to repeat it is a barbarity that 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.600
 I'm getting inside a house and 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.160
 I'm going through the walls I'm going to 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.890
 make it harder still I'm going to jump 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.710
 there 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:56.260
 and I'm here in the little corner I get in 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.780
 stealth now rotate and time goes by 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.340
 the wall gives completely the same as 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.090
 there is a concrete wall that has 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:06.280
 cement this is a barbarity 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.930
 I assume I still did not have a time of 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.440
 try them I will comment on the next days 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.930
 that all this does not take away countries is better 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.780
 right now of fairy and it does not do well 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.790
 but good has been the skill 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:23.260
 there have been more changes I'm going to pull 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.910
 stone I'm going towards you see storm and good 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.150
 You are going to see me in a storm 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:30.460
 been repaired already ok they have already left 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.940
 as it was originally before the 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.169
 paseíto that would be around to death and 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.030
 well just so you can see a 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:40.610
 How is the city already? 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.770
 that is again our city to her 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.110
 relates with its turret completely 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:49.730
 arranged with the zinc watch without those 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:52.220
 problems there are of claw are those at 

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.540
 except there in the main towers that 

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.620
 they are completely fixed 

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:59.540
 pretty pretty chulilla de escobar 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.700
 that nothing has happened if I do not remember 

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.280
 bad but to the name for not going through 

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.260
 animating is also repaired with which 

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.640
 perfect good guys that's been all 

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.380
 for the video and I hope with skill 

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.100
 I liked the brass that has 

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.530
 liked quite 

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.710
 in the next days I will put him answer 

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:19.030
 of changes in the ctr and good guys we 

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.030
 we see we have very well
