00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
found the highlighter wasn't what is

found the highlighter wasn't what is
what<00:02:13.960> I<00:02:13.990> thought<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.350> would<00:02:14.440> be<00:02:14.500> wasn't<00:02:14.800> what<00:02:14.890> I

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
what I thought it would be wasn't what I

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.200 
what I thought it would be wasn't what I
expected

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
expected

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.450

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
the second row down and I didn't feel

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.860 
the second row down and I didn't feel
like<00:02:24.070> they<00:02:24.310> picked<00:02:24.580> up<00:02:24.730> really<00:02:24.940> well<00:02:25.090> i<00:02:25.330> tried

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
and its transfer value like when I took

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.080 
and its transfer value like when I took
it<00:02:35.950> from<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.160> brush<00:02:36.340> or<00:02:36.550> my<00:02:36.670> finger<00:02:37.000> it's

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.860 
actually did the swatch also wasn't
really<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:39.880> great<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.240> came<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.450> very<00:02:40.630> faint

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
really that great it came a very faint

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.480 
really that great it came a very faint
so<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:42.030> they<00:02:43.030> are<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.450> shimmers<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:44.370> for<00:02:45.370> me

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
so and they are the shimmers so for me

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.430 
so and they are the shimmers so for me
the<00:02:45.610> shimmers<00:02:45.940> were<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> bit<00:02:46.240> of<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.360> no<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:46.870> just

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
the shimmers were a bit of a no I just

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.490 
the shimmers were a bit of a no I just
don't<00:02:47.620> think<00:02:47.800> they<00:02:47.890> really<00:02:48.070> worked<00:02:48.340> um<00:02:49.500> I'll

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
don't think they really worked um I'll

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.380 
don't think they really worked um I'll
show<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.740> now<00:02:51.010> like<00:02:51.610> this<00:02:51.730> one<00:02:51.910> here's<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.150> deep

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
show you now like this one here's a deep

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.680 
show you now like this one here's a deep
pink<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:54.070> comes<00:02:54.280> like<00:02:54.460> out<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.330> and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
pink and it comes like out like that and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.240 
pink and it comes like out like that and
then<00:02:58.050> you<00:02:59.050> see<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.290> difference<00:02:59.410> in<00:02:59.740> how<00:02:59.860> faint

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
then you see the difference in how faint

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.980 
then you see the difference in how faint
that<00:03:00.670> looks<00:03:01.260> compared<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.440> how<00:03:02.530> strong<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.190> is

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
that looks compared to how strong it is

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.070 
that looks compared to how strong it is
when<00:03:04.990> I<00:03:05.940> put<00:03:06.940> on<00:03:06.970> my<00:03:07.210> finger<00:03:07.540> it's<00:03:07.570> like<00:03:07.960> the

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
when I put on my finger it's like the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.380 
when I put on my finger it's like the
trance<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.950> can<00:03:09.100> build<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.490> up<00:03:09.580> definitely

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
trance you can build it up definitely

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.550 
trance you can build it up definitely
but<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:10.690> mean<00:03:10.930> some<00:03:11.140> people<00:03:11.350> don't<00:03:11.470> like

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
but I mean some people don't like

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.870 
but I mean some people don't like
building<00:03:11.980> up<00:03:12.100> they<00:03:12.190> just<00:03:12.250> want<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.700> product

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880

straight away and I want it to work so i

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.680 
straight away and I want it to work so i
found<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.520> problem<00:03:16.030> really<00:03:16.330> with<00:03:16.540> that

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
found that problem really with that

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.080 
found that problem really with that
whole<00:03:16.990> second<00:03:17.530> row<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.710> colors<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.700> shimmers

whole second row of colors the shimmers
all<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.660> shimmers<00:03:19.960> i<00:03:20.110> found<00:03:20.320> didn't<00:03:20.680> really

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
all the shimmers i found didn't really

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.770 
all the shimmers i found didn't really
pick<00:03:20.920> up<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.190> cutter<00:03:21.280> lot<00:03:21.520> well<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.540> map

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
pick up the cutter lot well the map

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.370 
pick up the cutter lot well the map
colors<00:03:23.320> were<00:03:23.620> brilliant<00:03:24.460> for<00:03:24.820> example<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
colors were brilliant for example the

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.810 
colors were brilliant for example the
green<00:03:26.620> i<00:03:26.650> used<00:03:27.780> really<00:03:28.780> nice<00:03:28.930> lime<00:03:29.260> green<00:03:29.820> here

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
green i used really nice lime green here

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.920 
green i used really nice lime green here
and<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:33.040> fairness<00:03:33.280> now<00:03:33.610> my<00:03:33.760> lighting<00:03:34.210> is<00:03:34.330> sort

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
and in fairness now my lighting is sort

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.480 
and in fairness now my lighting is sort
of<00:03:35.260> because<00:03:35.470> i'm<00:03:35.590> using<00:03:35.620> natural<00:03:36.040> light

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
of because i'm using natural light

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.880 
of because i'm using natural light
but<00:03:37.390> i<00:03:37.630> did<00:03:37.900> definitely<00:03:38.050> think<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.620> mats

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
but i did definitely think that the mats

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.490 
but i did definitely think that the mats
came<00:03:39.310> out<00:03:39.490> a<00:03:39.520> lot<00:03:39.940> stronger<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:41.080> a<00:03:41.110> lot<00:03:41.290> better

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
came out a lot stronger and a lot better

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.140 
came out a lot stronger and a lot better
than<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:43.810> lot<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.770> it<00:03:44.980> was<00:03:45.190> pretty<00:03:45.580> chalky<00:03:46.120> i

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
than a lot of it was pretty chalky i

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.380 
than a lot of it was pretty chalky i
mean<00:03:46.390> i<00:03:46.420> have<00:03:47.040> about<00:03:48.040> four<00:03:48.370> or<00:03:48.400> five<00:03:48.520> of<00:03:48.910> the

thought they were really good value for

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.290 
thought they were really good value for
the<00:03:56.530> colors<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.520> were<00:03:57.610> getting<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.060> how<00:03:58.090> much

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
the colors you were getting and how much

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.380 
the colors you were getting and how much
was<00:03:58.480> costing<00:03:58.870> but<00:03:59.830> I<00:04:00.220> don't<00:04:01.000> know<00:04:01.090> if<00:04:01.210> they've

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
was costing but I don't know if they've

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.820 
was costing but I don't know if they've
changed<00:04:01.600> their<00:04:01.810> formula<00:04:02.320> or<00:04:02.500> if<00:04:02.650> they're

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
changed their formula or if they're

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.520 
changed their formula or if they're
putting<00:04:03.100> more<00:04:03.310> money<00:04:03.490> into<00:04:04.290> packaging<00:04:05.290> and

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
putting more money into packaging and

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.930 
putting more money into packaging and
not<00:04:05.620> as<00:04:05.740> much<00:04:05.920> into<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.370> actual<00:04:06.610> formula

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
not as much into the actual formula

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.180 
not as much into the actual formula
because<00:04:07.630> some<00:04:08.320> of<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.470> colors<00:04:08.710> I<00:04:08.830> found<00:04:09.040> were

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.380 
know some of their regular colors are
chalky<00:04:15.460> but<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.610> felt<00:04:15.880> some<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.150> them<00:04:16.239> were<00:04:16.330> very

colors and the blush palette blush
palette<00:04:37.550> being<00:04:37.790> one<00:04:37.880> of<00:04:37.910> my<00:04:38.000> favorites<00:04:38.390> but<00:04:38.870> so

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.130 
palette being one of my favorites but so
I<00:04:39.470> can't<00:04:39.740> really<00:04:39.830> compare<00:04:40.190> it<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.490> their<00:04:40.640> other

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
I can't really compare it to their other

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.160 
I can't really compare it to their other
blush<00:04:42.140> or<00:04:42.350> shimmer<00:04:42.650> palette<00:04:43.060> but<00:04:44.060> I<00:04:44.720> was

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
blush or shimmer palette but I was

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.890 
blush or shimmer palette but I was
definitely<00:04:45.350> I<00:04:45.560> think<00:04:46.570> considering<00:04:47.570> this<00:04:47.750> was

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
definitely I think considering this was

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.450 
definitely I think considering this was
only<00:04:47.990> something<00:04:48.260> like<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:48.440> tenor<00:04:48.710> or<00:04:48.980> ten

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
only something like a tenor or ten

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.190 
only something like a tenor or ten
dollars<00:04:49.790> which<00:04:50.030> for<00:04:50.240> me<00:04:50.360> was<00:04:50.480> like<00:04:50.630> seven<00:04:50.960> euro

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
dollars which for me was like seven euro

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.360 
dollars which for me was like seven euro
um<00:04:51.670> I<00:04:52.960> do<00:04:53.960> think<00:04:54.290> it<00:04:54.380> was<00:04:54.410> worth<00:04:54.830> it<00:04:55.100> because

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
um I do think it was worth it because

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.130 
um I do think it was worth it because
there<00:04:55.850> are<00:04:56.000> good<00:04:56.300> selection<00:04:56.660> colors<00:04:56.960> that

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
there are good selection colors that

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.320 
there are good selection colors that
still<00:04:57.530> do<00:04:57.860> work<00:04:58.190> really<00:04:58.400> well<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:58.850> that<00:04:59.090> black

still do work really well and that black

still do work really well and that black
is<00:04:59.570> really<00:04:59.870> good<00:05:02.110> well<00:05:03.110> so<00:05:03.440> I<00:05:03.470> think<00:05:03.650> that

is really good well so I think that

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.130 
is really good well so I think that
those<00:05:04.340> colors<00:05:04.700> made<00:05:04.940> up<00:05:05.090> for<00:05:05.360> that<00:05:05.390> one<00:05:05.750> strip

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
sort of opinion on it um is that I do

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.090 
sort of opinion on it um is that I do
think<00:05:49.790> it<00:05:49.910> was<00:05:49.940> still<00:05:50.270> worth<00:05:50.480> it<00:05:50.720> for<00:05:51.140> how<00:05:51.950> much

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
think it was still worth it for how much

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.750 
think it was still worth it for how much
I<00:05:52.250> paid<00:05:52.520> for<00:05:52.550> it<00:05:52.970> because<00:05:53.650> I<00:05:54.650> did<00:05:55.430> get<00:05:55.550> some

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
I paid for it because I did get some

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.150 
I paid for it because I did get some
really<00:05:55.970> nice<00:05:56.180> colors<00:05:56.570> and<00:05:56.780> I<00:05:56.870> did<00:05:57.080> like<00:05:57.440> this

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
really nice colors and I did like this

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.980 
really nice colors and I did like this
entire<00:05:58.550> look<00:05:58.880> from<00:05:59.090> this<00:05:59.180> palette<00:05:59.540> which<00:05:59.690> I

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
entire look from this palette which I

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.420 
entire look from this palette which I
think<00:06:00.290> it<00:06:00.350> looked<00:06:00.500> at<00:06:00.620> I<00:06:00.650> think<00:06:00.830> it<00:06:01.190> turned<00:06:01.370> out

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
think it looked at I think it turned out

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.260 
think it looked at I think it turned out
gorgeous<00:06:01.580> so<00:06:03.070> they<00:06:04.070> are<00:06:04.220> totally<00:06:04.490> usable<00:06:04.940> this

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
gorgeous so they are totally usable this

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.090 
gorgeous so they are totally usable this
was<00:06:05.420> with<00:06:05.540> a<00:06:05.570> primer<00:06:05.930> and<00:06:06.770> obviously<00:06:07.010> the

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
was with a primer and obviously the

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.670 
was with a primer and obviously the
swatches<00:06:07.340> warrant<00:06:08.020> but<00:06:09.020> I<00:06:09.080> still<00:06:09.320> needed<00:06:09.590> to

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
swatches warrant but I still needed to

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.900 
swatches warrant but I still needed to
build<00:06:09.920> up<00:06:10.160> so<00:06:10.670> my<00:06:11.360> final<00:06:11.540> opinion<00:06:12.470> is<00:06:12.740> I<00:06:13.250> feel

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
build up so my final opinion is I feel

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.480 
build up so my final opinion is I feel
it<00:06:14.060> was<00:06:14.150> death<00:06:14.330> is<00:06:14.510> still<00:06:14.780> worth<00:06:14.960> it<00:06:15.140> for<00:06:15.560> it
