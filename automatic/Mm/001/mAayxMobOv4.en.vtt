00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.199
 All cats have their origin in 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.750
 America's original goods are free there 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.160
 live cats the wild cats 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.570
 in all of farms 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.519
 have stopped 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.800
 so are very tall and strong 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.199
 Then you have the colors free from rats or 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.900
 keep on and off too much rabbits 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.510
 and the first one came in the middle 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.660
 the 1980s thereafter recognized here 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.660
 they are only since 1984 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.289
 the visual appearance of a maine 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.860
 coon are like velvet for our eyes 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.809
 are very tall imposing anyway 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.969
 she looks like a real cat to her 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.589
 have very muscular body and you 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.110
 certain features have the other 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.149
 Cats have not got very much 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.970
 sociable by doing so you can be good at it 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.950
 promo hold as a single or as a 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.110
 society's on larger groups 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.600
 are possible, there is even the breeders 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.490
 can hold their charter and that works 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.640
 it's actually a mini very saturated 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.640
 his 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.080
 of course the outward appearance of 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.380
 those who have lost those too 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.990
 tufts in the ears then these big ones 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.750
 ears the beautiful eyes have these 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.550
 this elongated body is that 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.550
 simply that is typical schwenkow 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:54.100
 but if someone sees this for the first time 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.899
 he thinks wildcat is but if 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.819
 you know, you know that 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.459
 the totally different are totally different 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.200
 people oriented correctly affectionate 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:05.439
 of course there were others 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.160
 they prefer to be alone 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.780
 But most are looking for the nearness 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.929
 to the people and that's easy 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.929
 fantastic 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.340
 that is not really that many know 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.410
 that the character too 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.050
 sexually bound are a cat 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.610
 is quite different from a hangover in the squad 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.750
 is always present with it always in the 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.900
 center point 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.940
 very self-confident and they still need 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.220
 more the proximity of the people 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.470
 so you do not need to be lonely 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.720
 more contact with people quite well 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.340
 to other cats than to the uncastrated 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.940
 Tom, of course, shocked a bit 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.230
 the girls who are somehow are like 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.989
 they are maternal ones 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.360
 smart we are very intelligent 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.560
 even better jump and are something 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.470
 daintier from the outside and there 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.510
 are very different and I say 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.030
 someone like that still no humans or 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.790
 No cat has it on everyone 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.250
 falling just first time a girl to 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.250
 because they are easier to care for
