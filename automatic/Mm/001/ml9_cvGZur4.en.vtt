so<00:02:04.940> let's<00:02:05.940> take<00:02:06.180> off<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.420> cup<00:02:06.570> now<00:02:06.720> this<00:02:06.900> cover

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
so let's take off the cup now this cover

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.109 
so let's take off the cup now this cover
come<00:02:07.320> left<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:07.710> differently<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.759> opens<00:02:09.030> up

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
come left little differently it opens up

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.660 
come left little differently it opens up
in<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.270> back<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:10.039> couple<00:02:11.039> little<00:02:11.130> hooks<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
in the back a couple little hooks in the

in the back a couple little hooks in the
front<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:12.510> kind<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.170> slice<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.530> back

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.780 

here's<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.709> cable<00:02:31.160> we're<00:02:31.370> going<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.550> take<00:02:31.700> out

here's the cable we're going to take out

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.179 
here's the cable we're going to take out
this<00:02:34.239> kind<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.599> sits<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.049> there<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.439> couple<00:02:36.010> of

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
this kind of sits in there a couple of

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.399 
this kind of sits in there a couple of
it<00:02:36.459> sets<00:02:36.790> in<00:02:36.909> a<00:02:36.969> couple<00:02:37.209> of<00:02:37.329> grooves<00:02:37.659> and<00:02:37.900> the

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
it sets in a couple of grooves and the

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.959 
it sets in a couple of grooves and the
mx518<00:02:38.980> with<00:02:39.719> identical<00:02:40.719> to<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.670> as<00:02:42.670> far<00:02:42.939> as

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
mx518 with identical to this as far as

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.509 
mx518 with identical to this as far as
the<00:02:43.209> cable<00:02:43.750> placement<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.590> connector<00:02:45.250> is

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
the cable placement and the connector is

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.509 
the cable placement and the connector is
the<00:02:45.670> same<00:02:45.879> connector<00:02:46.390> it's<00:02:46.569> a<00:02:46.659> I<00:02:47.340> guess<00:02:48.340> it's

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
the same connector it's a I guess it's

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.740 
the same connector it's a I guess it's
some<00:02:48.640> sort<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.909> standard<00:02:49.299> or<00:02:49.450> something

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.960 

so<00:02:53.350> you<00:02:53.410> can<00:02:53.920> chance<00:02:54.520> that<00:02:54.670> they're<00:02:54.760> likely

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
so you can chance that they're likely

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.100 
so you can chance that they're likely
you're<00:02:55.210> going<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.360> be<00:02:55.420> able<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.630> swap<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.050> out

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
you're going to be able to swap it out

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.390 
you're going to be able to swap it out
with<00:02:57.660> any<00:02:58.660> other<00:02:58.810> housekeeper<00:02:59.410> and<00:03:00.310> what

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
with any other housekeeper and what

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.690 
with any other housekeeper and what
we're<00:03:00.490> going<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.670> do<00:03:00.820> now<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.450> get<00:03:01.600> a<00:03:01.660> voltmeter

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
we're going to do now is get a voltmeter

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.400 
we're going to do now is get a voltmeter
we're<00:03:03.700> going<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.910> set<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.870> continuity

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
we're going to set it to the continuity

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.910 
we're going to set it to the continuity
setting<00:03:05.920> basically<00:03:06.580> you're<00:03:06.760> testing

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
setting basically you're testing

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.480 
setting basically you're testing
continuity<00:03:08.920> if<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.610> have<00:03:11.490> continuity

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
continuity if you have continuity

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.750 
continuity if you have continuity
between<00:03:12.580> two<00:03:12.970> eggs<00:03:13.150> meaning<00:03:14.110> is<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.500> wire<00:03:14.760> all

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
between two eggs meaning is the wire all

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.810 
between two eggs meaning is the wire all
intact

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
intact

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:25.680 
intact
I'm<00:03:18.820> just<00:03:19.210> going<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.390> put<00:03:19.600> this<00:03:19.780> there's<00:03:24.690> four

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
I'm just going to put this there's four

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.050 
I'm just going to put this there's four
pins

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.820 

I'm<00:03:29.569> going<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.780> do<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:30.020> test<00:03:30.230> these<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:30.530> want

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
I'm going to do is test these you want

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.710 
I'm going to do is test these you want
to<00:03:30.920> put<00:03:31.040> this<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.459> this<00:03:32.060> lead<00:03:32.330> of<00:03:32.540> the

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
to put this and this lead of the

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.290 
to put this and this lead of the
voltmeter<00:03:33.380> on<00:03:33.590> one<00:03:34.069> pin<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.760> then<00:03:34.910> go<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.090> the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
voltmeter on one pin and then go to the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.510 
voltmeter on one pin and then go to the
other<00:03:35.480> end<00:03:35.750> of<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.959> cable<00:03:36.319> and<00:03:36.470> match<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.430> up

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
other end of the cable and match it up

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.600 
other end of the cable and match it up
finally<00:03:37.970> take<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.480> wire<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.170> matches<00:03:39.590> up<00:03:39.770> I'm

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
finally take the wire it matches up I'm

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.300 
finally take the wire it matches up I'm
going<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.819> do<00:03:40.910> this<00:03:41.060> for<00:03:41.239> each<00:03:41.390> wire

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.060 

matches<00:03:49.310> up<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.550> that<00:03:49.730> one

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
matches up to that one

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.040 
matches up to that one
and<00:03:52.070> then<00:03:52.160> what<00:03:52.250> I'm<00:03:52.340> going<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.490> do<00:03:52.670> is<00:03:53.050> when

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
and then what I'm going to do is when

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.860 
and then what I'm going to do is when
they're<00:03:54.170> all<00:03:54.290> matched<00:03:54.530> up<00:03:55.660> I'm<00:03:56.660> going<00:03:56.780> to

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
they're all matched up I'm going to

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.810 
they're all matched up I'm going to
wiggle<00:03:57.020> the<00:03:57.170> table<00:03:57.860> around<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:58.370> once<00:03:58.550> it's<00:03:58.730> all

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
wiggle the table around so once it's all

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.460 
wiggle the table around so once it's all
mashed<00:03:59.060> up<00:03:59.330> I<00:03:59.540> want<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.780> wiggle<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.080> cable

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
mashed up I want to wiggle the cable

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.900 
mashed up I want to wiggle the cable
around<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:01.160> see<00:04:01.310> if<00:04:01.370> there's<00:04:01.520> any<00:04:01.670> kind<00:04:01.790> of

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
around and see if there's any kind of

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.420 
around and see if there's any kind of
breaks<00:04:02.210> or<00:04:02.420> anything<00:04:02.450> in<00:04:02.840> there<00:04:03.020> so<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:04.220> first

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
breaks or anything in there so the first

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.850 
breaks or anything in there so the first
one<00:04:04.550> I'm<00:04:04.610> testing<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:05.120> like<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.410> black<00:04:06.590> wire<00:04:06.830> I

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
one I'm testing is like the black wire I

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.740 
one I'm testing is like the black wire I
can

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.950 

you<00:04:11.680> hear<00:04:11.830> that<00:04:11.980> beep<00:04:12.190> that<00:04:12.460> tone<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.660> you<00:04:13.810> see

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
you hear that beep that tone and you see

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.900 
you hear that beep that tone and you see
the<00:04:14.080> meter<00:04:14.260> change<00:04:14.530> that's<00:04:15.400> saying<00:04:15.640> we<00:04:15.760> have

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
the meter change that's saying we have

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.110 
the meter change that's saying we have
continuity<00:04:16.209> that<00:04:16.510> means<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.870> there's<00:04:17.079> a

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
continuity that means that there's a

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.460 
continuity that means that there's a
connection<00:04:19.120> between<00:04:19.239> one<00:04:20.049> end<00:04:20.200> of<00:04:20.230> the<00:04:20.320> cable

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
connection between one end of the cable

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.850 
connection between one end of the cable
and<00:04:20.920> the<00:04:21.130> other<00:04:22.050> now<00:04:23.050> this<00:04:23.260> is<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.500> white<00:04:23.680> one

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
and the other now this is the white one

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.530 
and the other now this is the white one
and<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.670> is<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.880> one<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.060> actually<00:04:25.240> had

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
and this is the one I actually had

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.970 
and this is the one I actually had
problems<00:04:25.750> with<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:26.320> you<00:04:26.380> can<00:04:26.500> see<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.800> meter

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
problems with and you can see the meter

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.190 
problems with and you can see the meter
kind<00:04:27.280> of<00:04:27.370> acting<00:04:27.640> funny<00:04:27.820> if<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:28.870> listen

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
kind of acting funny if you listen

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.590 
kind of acting funny if you listen
closely<00:04:29.410> you<00:04:29.680> hear<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.670> beep<00:04:30.880> going<00:04:31.360> in<00:04:31.510> and

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
closely you hear the beep going in and

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.650 
closely you hear the beep going in and
out

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.080 

right

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
right

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.589 
right
that's<00:04:39.690> what<00:04:39.870> was

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.129 

that's<00:04:43.169> what<00:04:43.349> was<00:04:43.499> dropping<00:04:43.889> out

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.460 

when<00:04:47.620> I<00:04:47.650> hear<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:48.009> boom

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.070 

he<00:04:51.010> was<00:04:51.130> Elsa<00:04:51.460> please

you<00:04:56.530> move<00:04:56.710> a<00:04:56.740> certain<00:04:57.009> way

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.330 

they're<00:05:00.440> right<00:05:00.890> there

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.990 

so<00:05:06.850> if<00:05:07.000> there's<00:05:07.240> only<00:05:07.450> okay<00:05:07.810> that's<00:05:08.440> it<00:05:09.000> let's

so if there's only okay that's it let's

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.150 
so if there's only okay that's it let's
replace<00:05:10.240> his<00:05:10.450> cable<00:05:10.660> we<00:05:11.320> have<00:05:11.470> one<00:05:11.890> that<00:05:12.040> we

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
replace his cable we have one that we

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.010 
replace his cable we have one that we
don't<00:05:12.340> at<00:05:12.430> work

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
don't at work

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.600 
don't at work
first<00:05:14.020> you<00:05:14.110> crumple<00:05:14.410> this<00:05:14.500> up<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:14.860> roll<00:05:15.580> down

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
first you crumple this up and roll down

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.910 
first you crumple this up and roll down
like<00:05:15.940> that

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:33.560 

like<00:05:22.920> this<00:05:32.030> pretend<00:05:33.030> that<00:05:33.120> miles<00:05:33.330> had<00:05:33.390> the

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
like this pretend that miles had the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.180 
like this pretend that miles had the
cable<00:05:33.840> already<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.140> okay<00:05:35.240> and<00:05:36.380> we<00:05:37.380> took<00:05:37.500> that<00:05:37.560> we

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190
