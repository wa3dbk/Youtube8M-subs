just<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> standpoint<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.750> have

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
just from the standpoint that we have

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.660 
just from the standpoint that we have
the<00:01:42.960> largest<00:01:43.110> genetic<00:01:43.799> pool<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> industry

the largest genetic pool in the industry

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.920 
the largest genetic pool in the industry
would<00:01:44.850> probably<00:01:45.180> made<00:01:45.299> more<00:01:45.509> genetic

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
would probably made more genetic

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.690 
would probably made more genetic
progress<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.649> more<00:01:46.920> tools<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.340> make<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
progress and that more tools to make the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.240 
progress and that more tools to make the
cattle<00:01:48.119> better<00:01:48.450> for<00:01:48.720> DNA<00:01:49.110> etc<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.159> think

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
cattle better for DNA etc and I think

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.830 
cattle better for DNA etc and I think
the<00:01:50.430> exciting<00:01:50.820> thing<00:01:50.970> about<00:01:51.000> being<00:01:51.420> an<00:01:51.540> angus

again<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.320> think<00:02:07.500> regionally<00:02:07.829> we<00:02:08.129> will<00:02:08.489> have

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
again I think regionally we will have

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.850 
again I think regionally we will have
some<00:02:08.879> challenges<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.539> terms<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.560> cattle

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
some challenges in terms of the cattle

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.260 
some challenges in terms of the cattle
that<00:02:10.920> may<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.190> left<00:02:11.370> out<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.670> those<00:02:11.849> parts<00:02:12.150> of

the country that were severely affected

the country that were severely affected
by<00:02:14.010> drought<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.150> general<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:16.140> think<00:02:16.560> early

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
really cold rigidly also on I feel like

the really good bulls are going to bring

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.619 
the really good bulls are going to bring
a<00:02:33.599> real<00:02:33.780> premium<00:02:34.050> issue<00:02:34.730> now<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.760> think<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.269> day

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
a real premium issue now I think the day

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.930 
a real premium issue now I think the day
of<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> mediocre<00:02:37.200> bull<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.739> over<00:02:38.040> he<00:02:38.580> needs<00:02:38.819> to

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
of the mediocre bull is over he needs to

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.430 
of the mediocre bull is over he needs to
be<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> steer<00:02:39.420> he'll<00:02:39.660> bring<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.959> lot<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.110> money<00:02:40.349> on

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
be a steer he'll bring a lot of money on

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.339 
be a steer he'll bring a lot of money on
the<00:02:40.620> market<00:02:41.060> so<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.090> feel<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.629> future<00:02:42.989> for<00:02:43.140> beef

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
the market so I feel the future for beef

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.949 
the market so I feel the future for beef
cattle<00:02:43.620> has<00:02:44.250> never<00:02:44.610> been<00:02:44.790> right<00:02:45.030> when<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.720> think

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
cattle has never been right when I think

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.140 
cattle has never been right when I think
we're<00:02:46.080> see<00:02:46.349> record<00:02:46.709> prices<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.340> bulls<00:02:47.580> part<00:02:48.120> of

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
we're see record prices on bulls part of

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.479 
we're see record prices on bulls part of
that<00:02:48.209> is<00:02:48.300> from<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.840> genetic<00:02:49.290> standpoint<00:02:49.590> good

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
that is from a genetic standpoint good

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.640 
that is from a genetic standpoint good
value<00:02:51.300> genetics<00:02:51.989> are<00:02:52.080> worth<00:02:52.260> more<00:02:52.500> than

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
value genetics are worth more than

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.410 
value genetics are worth more than
they've<00:02:52.830> ever<00:02:52.950> been<00:02:53.129> with<00:02:53.519> inputs<00:02:54.000> costs

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
they've ever been with inputs costs

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.270 
they've ever been with inputs costs
rising<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.989> record<00:02:55.260> prices<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:56.099> I<00:02:56.129> think

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
rising and record prices so I think

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.380 
rising and record prices so I think
we're<00:02:56.519> going<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.700> see<00:02:56.730> record<00:02:57.180> prices

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
we're going to see record prices

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.910 
we're going to see record prices
throughout<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.959> whole<00:02:58.110> cell<00:02:58.379> season<00:02:58.800> this

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
throughout the whole cell season this

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.309 
throughout the whole cell season this
year<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.340> the<00:03:00.000> one<00:03:00.150> caveat<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.690> course<00:03:00.989> is<00:03:01.170> we're

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
year I the one caveat of course is we're

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.720 
year I the one caveat of course is we're
seeing<00:03:01.590> drought<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.860> lot<00:03:02.159> of<00:03:02.250> areas<00:03:02.550> of<00:03:02.670> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
seeing drought a lot of areas of the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.670 
seeing drought a lot of areas of the
country<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.360> that's<00:03:03.659> kind<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.110> wild<00:03:04.230> card

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
country and that's kind of the wild card

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.229 
country and that's kind of the wild card
we<00:03:04.860> need<00:03:04.890> some<00:03:05.250> moisture<00:03:05.700> but<00:03:05.819> if<00:03:05.940> we<00:03:06.060> do<00:03:06.209> that

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
we need some moisture but if we do that

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.820 
we need some moisture but if we do that
things<00:03:06.720> look<00:03:06.870> really<00:03:07.110> really<00:03:07.349> good<00:03:07.440> for<00:03:07.769> the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
things look really really good for the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.009 
things look really really good for the
cattle<00:03:08.129> business<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:09.030> drought<00:03:09.360> has<00:03:09.690> caused

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
cattle business the drought has caused

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.369 
cattle business the drought has caused
us<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.650> be<00:03:10.800> very<00:03:11.129> much<00:03:11.519> more<00:03:11.790> selective<00:03:12.379> call

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
us to be very much more selective call

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.589 
us to be very much more selective call
the<00:03:13.620> cows<00:03:13.860> harder<00:03:16.459> just<00:03:17.459> do<00:03:17.760> those<00:03:18.120> things

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
the cows harder just do those things

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.800 
the cows harder just do those things
that<00:03:18.870> make<00:03:19.800> us<00:03:19.830> improve<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.640> quality<00:03:20.849> as<00:03:21.510> much

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
that make us improve the quality as much

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.800 
that make us improve the quality as much
as<00:03:22.019> we<00:03:22.170> possibly<00:03:22.220> can<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:24.150> cut<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.569> feed
