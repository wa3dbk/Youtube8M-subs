00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.270 
the overclocker achievement and this
achievement<00:00:12.420> requires<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.170> be<00:00:13.710> test

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
achievement requires you to be test

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.749 
achievement requires you to be test
chamber<00:00:14.580> 10<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:14.969> less<00:00:15.330> than<00:00:15.540> 70<00:00:16.080> seconds<00:00:16.759> so

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:17.759 
chamber 10 in less than 70 seconds so

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.269 
chamber 10 in less than 70 seconds so
you're<00:00:18.210> just<00:00:18.269> going<00:00:18.419> to<00:00:18.509> load<00:00:18.749> up<00:00:18.929> the<00:00:19.279> third

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
you're just going to load up the third

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.050 
you're just going to load up the third
level<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:22.069> there's<00:00:23.069> actually<00:00:23.339> going<00:00:23.489> to<00:00:23.669> be<00:00:23.789> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
level and there's actually going to be a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.359 
level and there's actually going to be a
test<00:00:24.509> chamber<00:00:24.839> that<00:00:24.929> comes<00:00:25.140> before<00:00:25.319> 10<00:00:25.949> so

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
test chamber that comes before 10 so

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.200 
test chamber that comes before 10 so
you're<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.669> have<00:00:26.729> to<00:00:26.849> play<00:00:27.029> through

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
you're going to have to play through

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.790 
you're going to have to play through
that<00:00:27.359> first<00:00:27.659> and<00:00:27.960> you're<00:00:28.109> going<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.289> get<00:00:28.409> here

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
that first and you're going to get here

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.349 
that first and you're going to get here
and<00:00:29.960> it's<00:00:31.340> pretty<00:00:32.340> easy<00:00:32.699> to<00:00:32.879> get<00:00:33.090> through<00:00:33.239> this

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:33.359 
and it's pretty easy to get through this

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:34.819 
and it's pretty easy to get through this
in<00:00:33.480> less<00:00:33.600> than<00:00:33.750> 70<00:00:34.079> seconds<00:00:34.379> once<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.679> know

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
in less than 70 seconds once you know

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.069 
in less than 70 seconds once you know
you're<00:00:35.039> doing<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.670> think<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> toughest<00:00:36.809> part

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
you're doing I think the toughest part

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.319 
you're doing I think the toughest part
is<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.489> figuring<00:00:38.489> out<00:00:38.519> the<00:00:38.699> lay<00:00:38.910> out<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
is just figuring out the lay out and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.520 
is just figuring out the lay out and
like<00:00:39.660> what<00:00:39.839> the<00:00:39.929> quickest<00:00:40.260> way<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> do

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
like what the quickest way to do

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.729 
like what the quickest way to do
everything<00:00:40.769> is<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:43.079> could<00:00:43.440> actually

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
everything is so this could actually

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.290 
everything is so this could actually
take<00:00:44.039> you<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> couple<00:00:44.219> tries<00:00:44.730> even<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.210> you

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
take you a couple tries even if you

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.680 
take you a couple tries even if you
watch<00:00:45.449> a<00:00:45.570> video<00:00:45.809> or<00:00:45.870> whatever<00:00:47.149> it<00:00:48.149> took<00:00:48.300> me<00:00:48.480> two

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
watch a video or whatever it took me two

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.229 
watch a video or whatever it took me two
tries<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:50.190> didn't<00:00:50.429> have<00:00:50.519> too<00:00:50.760> much<00:00:50.910> trouble

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
tries and I didn't have too much trouble

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.250 
tries and I didn't have too much trouble
with<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> achievement<00:00:53.780> if<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.140> follow

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
with the achievement if you just follow

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.779 
with the achievement if you just follow
everything<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.890> video<00:00:56.159> you<00:00:56.249> really
