00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.720 
needed to get it able to run his old ps1
games<00:00:44.969> on<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:46.190> luckily<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.340> was<00:00:47.430> an<00:00:47.520> older

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
games on it luckily it was an older

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.290 
games on it luckily it was an older
firmware<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.870> all<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.289> had<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.530> do<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:50.370> upgraded

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
firmware so all I had to do was upgraded

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.490 
firmware so all I had to do was upgraded
to<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:53.070> official<00:00:53.489> sony<00:00:53.730> 5.03<00:00:54.719> firmware<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
to the official sony 5.03 firmware and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.979 
to the official sony 5.03 firmware and
that's<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.070> unique<00:00:56.399> firmware<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
that's a unique firmware because it is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.950 
that's a unique firmware because it is
capable<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.680> running<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.219> latest<00:00:59.879> chick<00:01:00.690> n

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
capable of running the latest chick n

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.149 
capable of running the latest chick n
exploit<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.670> chicken<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.739> homebrew

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
exploit and the chicken is the homebrew

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.980 
exploit and the chicken is the homebrew
enabler<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.450> allow<00:01:06.600> us<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> run

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
enabler and that will allow us to run

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.230 
enabler and that will allow us to run
other<00:01:07.200> things<00:01:07.590> such<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.640> custom<00:01:09.000> former

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
other things such as a custom former

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.460 
other things such as a custom former
installer<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:10.650> i'm<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.460> show<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.610> now<00:01:11.820> a

more detail but basically after you've
upgraded<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:20.670> put<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> TIFF<00:01:21.509> image<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.170> it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
upgraded you put the TIFF image in it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.070 
upgraded you put the TIFF image in it
reboots<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:24.119> you're<00:01:24.270> able<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.689> install

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
reboots and then you're able to install

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.590 
reboots and then you're able to install
the<00:01:25.380> custom<00:01:25.500> firmware<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.210> case<00:01:27.420> since

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the custom firmware in this case since

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.640 
the custom firmware in this case since
it's<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> fat<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.820> 5.5<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:31.400> this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.479> the

too because you can also make pen to our

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.020 
too because you can also make pen to our
batteries<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.579> install<00:01:44.880> this

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
batteries with this they install this

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.249 
batteries with this they install this
custom<00:01:45.420> firmware<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:45.869> you're<00:01:45.990> trying<00:01:46.170> to

too<00:01:48.869> far<00:01:49.549> anyways<00:01:50.990> we're<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> use

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
too far anyways we're going to use

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.090 
too far anyways we're going to use
utility<00:01:53.490> called<00:01:54.049> magic<00:01:55.049> iso<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.770> ripping<00:01:55.979> the

utility called magic iso for ripping the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.760 
utility called magic iso for ripping the
disks<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.930> make<00:01:58.110> sure<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.409> use<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
disks and just make sure you use the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.490 
disks and just make sure you use the
extract<00:01:59.250> disc<00:01:59.549> function<00:02:00.079> when<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.200> put<00:02:01.380> in

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
extract disc function when you put in

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.370 
extract disc function when you put in
your<00:02:01.680> ps1<00:02:02.369> game<00:02:02.579> into<00:02:02.820> your<00:02:02.909> pc<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.420> then<00:02:04.350> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
your ps1 game into your pc and then a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.919 
your ps1 game into your pc and then a
program<00:02:04.920> called<00:02:05.189> simple<00:02:05.729> pop<00:02:05.969> station<00:02:06.979> GUI

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
program called simple pop station GUI

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.750 
program called simple pop station GUI
simply<00:02:09.929> browse<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:11.039> where<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.370> saved<00:02:11.580> your

ISO and

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.780 
ISO and
and<00:02:13.260> then<00:02:13.410> pick<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.830> destination<00:02:14.040> where<00:02:14.700> you

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and then pick the destination where you

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.260 
and then pick the destination where you
wanted<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.090> output<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:17.550> hit<00:02:17.730> go<00:02:18.000> I

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
wanted to output to and just hit go I

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.550 
wanted to output to and just hit go I
mean<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.720> don't<00:02:18.810> really<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.200> mess<00:02:19.410> with

was<00:02:53.910> longer<00:02:54.150> than<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.480> explanation<00:02:55.019> on<00:02:55.049> how

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
was longer than the explanation on how

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.640 
was longer than the explanation on how
to<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:56.510> on<00:02:57.510> our<00:02:57.870> website<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.290> have<00:02:58.410> some

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
to do it on our website we have some

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.320 
to do it on our website we have some
more<00:02:58.739> details<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.220> customizing<00:02:59.730> these<00:02:59.940> images

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
more details on customizing these images

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.430 
more details on customizing these images
so<00:03:00.690> they<00:03:00.780> don't<00:03:00.930> just<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.200> ps1<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.739> them<00:03:03.440> but

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
so they don't just a ps1 on them but

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:13.410 
so they don't just a ps1 on them but
it's<00:03:04.620> basically<00:03:04.799> running<00:03:05.220> Sony's<00:03:06.440> emulator
