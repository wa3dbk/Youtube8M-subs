and sonic electronix at namm 2014 and we
are<00:00:05.339> super<00:00:06.029> excited<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.569> be<00:00:06.690> introducing<00:00:07.230> a

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
are super excited to be introducing a

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.530 
are super excited to be introducing a
brand<00:00:07.589> new<00:00:07.980> digital<00:00:08.460> wireless<00:00:08.610> for<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.330> show

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
brand new digital wireless for the show

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.410 
brand new digital wireless for the show
now<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.590> called<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.070> system<00:00:11.580> 10<00:00:11.880> stomp

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
now this is called the system 10 stomp

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.870 
now this is called the system 10 stomp
box<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.200> based<00:00:13.440> on<00:00:13.679> our<00:00:13.860> very<00:00:14.070> successful

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
box this is based on our very successful

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.939 
box this is based on our very successful
system<00:00:15.299> 10<00:00:15.509> platform<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.289> what<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.680> means

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
system 10 platform and what that means

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.179 
system 10 platform and what that means
is<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.670> get<00:00:17.850> rock-solid<00:00:18.390> RF<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.380> 2.4

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
is you get rock-solid RF it's a 2.4

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.750 
is you get rock-solid RF it's a 2.4
gigahertz<00:00:20.420> system<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:22.199> tons<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.010> technology

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
gigahertz system with tons of technology

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.150 
gigahertz system with tons of technology
under<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.119> hood<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:25.109> has<00:00:25.350> space<00:00:25.769> diversity

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
under the hood this has space diversity

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.279 
under the hood this has space diversity
so<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.939> two<00:00:27.180> antennas<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.930> both<00:00:28.109> our

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
so we have two antennas in both our

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.650 
so we have two antennas in both our
transmitter<00:00:28.920> or<00:00:29.220> receiver<00:00:29.269> and<00:00:30.269> we<00:00:30.539> have

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
transmitter or receiver and we have

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.470 
transmitter or receiver and we have
frequency<00:00:31.289> diversity<00:00:31.560> meeting<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:33.000> system

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
frequency diversity meeting this system

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.420 
frequency diversity meeting this system
actually<00:00:33.660> transmits<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.620> two<00:00:34.950> separate

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
actually transmits on two separate

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.350 
actually transmits on two separate
frequencies<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.870> encounters<00:00:37.290> any<00:00:38.360> problem

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
frequencies if it encounters any problem

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.209 
frequencies if it encounters any problem
frequencies<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.230> actually<00:00:40.590> switches<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
frequencies it actually switches on the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.830 
frequencies it actually switches on the
fly<00:00:41.520> because<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> transmitter<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
fly because the transmitter and the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.229 
fly because the transmitter and the
receiver<00:00:43.290> are<00:00:43.980> full<00:00:44.460> duplex<00:00:44.760> they're

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
receiver are full duplex they're

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.660 
receiver are full duplex they're
constantly<00:00:45.899> talking<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.590> each<00:00:46.710> other<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.520> what

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
constantly talking to each other so what

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.369 
constantly talking to each other so what
that<00:00:47.730> means<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.899> plug<00:00:49.170> this

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that means to you is you plug this

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.920 
that means to you is you plug this
system<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.039> that's<00:00:50.760> all<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.690> it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
system in that's all you have to do it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.830 
system in that's all you have to do it
finds<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> frequency<00:00:53.160> for<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.210> sets<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
finds the frequency for you it sets the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.139 
finds the frequency for you it sets the
right<00:00:55.140> frequency<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:56.010> changes<00:00:56.520> frequencies

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
right frequency it changes frequencies

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
right frequency it changes frequencies
if<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.600> easiest<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> use<00:00:58.440> wireless<00:00:58.920> now<00:00:59.309> we

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
if the easiest to use wireless now we

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.189 
if the easiest to use wireless now we
have<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> couple<00:00:59.760> unique<00:01:00.210> features<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
have a couple unique features on this I

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.000 
have a couple unique features on this I
have<00:01:01.980> another<00:01:02.250> receiver<00:01:03.059> unit<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.890> we<00:01:04.890> have

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
have another receiver unit here we have

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.950 
have another receiver unit here we have
two<00:01:05.280> outputs<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.390> output<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
two outputs you can see we have output a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.490 
two outputs you can see we have output a
and<00:01:07.140> B<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.490> back<00:01:08.869> we<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:09.960> an<00:01:10.080> output

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and B and on the back we have an output

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.609 
and B and on the back we have an output
mode<00:01:10.799> selector<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.750> mute<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.439> what

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
mode selector we have a mute so what

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.490 
mode selector we have a mute so what
that<00:01:13.650> means<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:15.270> take<00:01:15.450> my<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.900> go<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> my

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
that means I can take my a and go to my

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.830 
that means I can take my a and go to my
guitar<00:01:16.860> amp<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.280> might<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.360> go<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.600> my

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
guitar amp and might be and go to my

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.670 
guitar amp and might be and go to my
tuner<00:01:19.350> when<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> hit<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.520> foot<00:01:20.700> switch<00:01:21.320> my<00:01:22.320> able

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
tuner when I hit the foot switch my able

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.760 
tuner when I hit the foot switch my able
mute<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.460> my<00:01:23.640> line<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> amp<00:01:25.080> gets<00:01:25.320> muted

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
mute so my line to the amp gets muted

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.429 
mute so my line to the amp gets muted
and<00:01:25.979> my<00:01:26.520> B<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.820> still<00:01:27.060> hot<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.869> now

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
and my B is still hot so I can do now

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.620 
and my B is still hot so I can do now
here's<00:01:28.799> where<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.040> gets<00:01:29.100> fun<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.360> switch

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
here's where it gets fun if I switch

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.399 
here's where it gets fun if I switch
this<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.290> or<00:01:31.619> b<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.820> these<00:01:33.090> outputs<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.990> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
this to a or b now these outputs a is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.710 
this to a or b now these outputs a is
either<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.829> or<00:01:34.860> b<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.369> either<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.790> now<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.479> do

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
either on or b is either on now I can do

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.830 
either on or b is either on now I can do
am<00:01:37.350> switching<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.159> say<00:01:38.369> my<00:01:38.610> output<00:01:39.270> goes<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.689> my

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
am switching so say my output goes to my

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.830 
am switching so say my output goes to my
electric<00:01:40.590> guitar<00:01:40.890> amp<00:01:41.100> my<00:01:41.790> V<00:01:42.030> output<00:01:42.210> goes<00:01:42.630> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
electric guitar amp my V output goes to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.200 
electric guitar amp my V output goes to
an<00:01:42.960> acoustic<00:01:43.470> amp<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:44.430> doesn't<00:01:44.759> even<00:01:44.820> stop

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
an acoustic amp it doesn't even stop

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.170 
an acoustic amp it doesn't even stop
there<00:01:45.530> another<00:01:46.530> cool<00:01:46.829> feature<00:01:46.860> i<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.030> i
