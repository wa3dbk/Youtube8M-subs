00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.970 
it's got this kind of hard to remember
part<00:03:01.860> but<00:03:02.610> i<00:03:02.790> really<00:03:03.150> like<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.569> because<00:03:04.349> i<00:03:04.620> made

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
part but i really like it because i made

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.610 
part but i really like it because i made
sure<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:06.180> all<00:03:06.330> my<00:03:06.360> loving<00:03:06.750> man<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.260> it

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
sure that all my loving man this it

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.500 
sure that all my loving man this it
didn't<00:03:07.920> have<00:03:08.099> it<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.640> was<00:03:08.760> always<00:03:09.000> needing

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
didn't have it and I was always needing

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.580 
didn't have it and I was always needing
it<00:03:09.660> so<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.739> time<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:10.980> got<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.640> saw<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.630> little

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
it so this time I got it I saw a little

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.009 
it so this time I got it I saw a little
wood<00:03:13.890> saw<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.000> same<00:03:15.209> length<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
wood saw it's the same length is the

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.050 
wood saw it's the same length is the
blade<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.709> think<00:03:17.959> maybe<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:19.079> little<00:03:19.260> longer<00:03:20.060> but

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
blade I think maybe a little longer but

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.319 
blade I think maybe a little longer but
and<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:22.260> reason<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.829> don't<00:03:23.370> pull<00:03:23.970> these<00:03:24.120> all

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
and the reason I don't pull these all

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.220 
and the reason I don't pull these all
out<00:03:24.510> at<00:03:24.630> once<00:03:24.890> because<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:26.250> can't<00:03:26.820> if<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.720> take

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
out at once because I can't if I take

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.910 
out at once because I can't if I take
most<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.650> them<00:03:28.850> out<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.900> tension<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.560> really

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
most of them out the tension is really

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.750 
most of them out the tension is really
high<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:33.239> can't<00:03:33.450> pull<00:03:33.690> out<00:03:33.840> one<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.500> them

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
high and it can't pull out one of them

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.130 
high and it can't pull out one of them
like<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.319> reamer<00:03:37.319> with<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.980> selling<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.519> hear

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
like the reamer with the selling I hear

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.199 
like the reamer with the selling I hear
this<00:03:40.140> one<00:03:41.540> uh<00:03:43.160> obviously<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.700> has<00:03:44.880> black

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
this one uh obviously it has black

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.940 
this one uh obviously it has black
scales<00:03:45.569> so<00:03:46.049> that's<00:03:46.200> why<00:03:46.380> it's<00:03:46.530> called<00:03:46.620> the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
scales so that's why it's called the

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.809 
scales so that's why it's called the
black<00:03:47.430> camper<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:49.250> really<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.400> his<00:03:50.609> knife
