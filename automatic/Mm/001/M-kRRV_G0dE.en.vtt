it<00:01:56.009> does<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.460> perfect<00:01:57.090> please<00:01:57.390> don't<00:01:57.659> try

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
it does not be perfect please don't try

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:58.730 
it does not be perfect please don't try
to<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.140> perfect

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
to be perfect

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.429 
to be perfect
this<00:01:59.039> is<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> warm-up<00:01:59.789> in<00:02:00.030> practice<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.749> value

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
this is a warm-up in practice for value

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.160 
this is a warm-up in practice for value
so<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.130> get<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.520> generally<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.780> best<00:02:04.049> you

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
so just get it generally in the best you

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.649 
so just get it generally in the best you
can<00:02:04.380> okay<00:02:04.969> they<00:02:05.969> kind<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.240> look<00:02:06.359> the<00:02:06.479> same

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
can okay they kind of look the same

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.460 
can okay they kind of look the same
value<00:02:07.140> right<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:08.190> make<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.610> more<00:02:09.470> meaning

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
value right now to make it more meaning

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.729 
value right now to make it more meaning
darker<00:02:11.009> will<00:02:11.549> add<00:02:11.730> another<00:02:11.910> layer<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> box

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
darker will add another layer to the box

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.339 
darker will add another layer to the box
so<00:02:14.040> we're<00:02:14.160> make<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.519> side<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:14.970> from<00:02:15.349> dark

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
so we're make this side going from dark

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.740 
so we're make this side going from dark
to<00:02:16.560> light<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:17.160> good<00:02:18.060> way<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> think<00:02:18.269> of<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.599> is

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
to light a good way to think of it is

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.650 
to light a good way to think of it is
the<00:02:18.900> size<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.290> sunny<00:02:19.560> side<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:21.180> side<00:02:21.239> is

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
the size is sunny side and this side is

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.830 
the size is sunny side and this side is

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
the Sun is down and this is the dark no

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.949 
the Sun is down and this is the dark no
son<00:02:25.410> okay<00:02:25.970> now<00:02:26.970> go<00:02:27.150> ahead<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.450> add<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:27.780> this

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
son okay now go ahead and add in this

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.990 
son okay now go ahead and add in this
box<00:02:28.230> another<00:02:29.190> layer<00:02:29.849> on<00:02:30.120> top<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.730> see<00:02:32.940> how

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
box another layer on top and see how

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.080 
box another layer on top and see how
that's<00:02:33.180> much<00:02:33.360> darker<00:02:33.690> now<00:02:34.640> okay<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.000> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
that's much darker now okay this is a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.229 
that's much darker now okay this is a
globe<00:02:36.420> don't<00:02:36.720> weigh<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:36.900> much<00:02:37.140> take<00:02:37.920> off

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
globe don't weigh that much take off

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.119 
globe don't weigh that much take off
like<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.269> on<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.049> side<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.739> too<00:02:40.980> much

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
like that on the side you have too much

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.059 
like that on the side you have too much
take<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.150> off<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:43.049> they<00:02:43.170> go<00:02:43.319> into<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.829> box

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
take it off and they go into that box

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.860 
take it off and they go into that box
and<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:45.030> inner<00:02:45.299> layer

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
and that inner layer

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.380 
and that inner layer
see<00:02:46.650> how<00:02:46.739> it's<00:02:46.890> darker<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:48.120> see<00:02:48.269> the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
see how it's darker you see the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.410 
see how it's darker you see the
difference<00:02:48.870> dark<00:02:49.200> light<00:02:49.620> dark<00:02:49.650> now<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:51.269> do

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
difference dark light dark now you do

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.569 
difference dark light dark now you do
the<00:02:51.540> same<00:02:51.750> thing<00:02:52.019> for<00:02:52.260> all<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.739> boxes<00:02:53.190> what

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
the same thing for all the boxes what

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.660 
the same thing for all the boxes what
I'd<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.239> for<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.840> one<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:56.430> have

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
I'd like you to do for this one you have

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.699 
I'd like you to do for this one you have
one<00:02:57.420> layer<00:02:57.889> two<00:02:58.889> layers<00:02:59.329> three<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:00.569> four<00:03:01.500> and

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
one layer two layers three and four and

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.410 
one layer two layers three and four and
we'll<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:02.639> see<00:03:02.760> what<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:02.970> looks<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:03.239> when

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
we'll just see what it looks like when

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.800 
we'll just see what it looks like when
you<00:03:03.510> do<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.049> each<00:03:04.739> box<00:03:05.010> are<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.310> go<00:03:05.400> in

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
you do that so each box are you go in

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.000 
you do that so each box are you go in
any<00:03:06.810> paint<00:03:08.599> one<00:03:09.599> layer<00:03:09.840> oops

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
any paint one layer oops

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.559 
any paint one layer oops
not<00:03:11.370> enough<00:03:11.489> paint<00:03:11.700> there<00:03:11.880> won't<00:03:12.419> so<00:03:12.540> much

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
not enough paint there won't so much

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.000 
not enough paint there won't so much
there<00:03:13.130> paint<00:03:14.130> one<00:03:14.549> layer<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:15.569> that<00:03:15.750> box<00:03:16.019> there

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
there paint one layer in that box there

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.780 
there paint one layer in that box there
we<00:03:17.099> go<00:03:17.280> one<00:03:18.000> layer<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.359> this<00:03:18.450> box<00:03:19.160> okay<00:03:20.190> then

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
we go one layer in this box okay then

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.789 
we go one layer in this box okay then
you<00:03:20.880> go<00:03:21.000> back<00:03:21.209> again<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.720> how<00:03:22.440> many<00:03:22.590> layers

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
you go back again and how many layers

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.539 
you go back again and how many layers
are<00:03:23.010> in<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.220> box<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.819> 0<00:03:24.720> into<00:03:24.930> 2<00:03:25.519> one<00:03:26.519> more

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
are in this box to 0 into 2 one more

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.800 
are in this box to 0 into 2 one more
layer<00:03:27.560> okay<00:03:28.590> wait<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.669> one<00:03:29.880> set<00:03:30.120> go<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:30.630> to

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
layer okay wait to that one set go on to

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.360 
layer okay wait to that one set go on to
next<00:03:30.930> one<00:03:31.109> this<00:03:31.260> one<00:03:31.349> needs<00:03:31.590> how<00:03:31.769> many<00:03:31.919> three

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
next one this one needs how many three

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.150 
next one this one needs how many three
so<00:03:32.910> we're<00:03:33.030> doing<00:03:33.180> three<00:03:33.329> layers<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.079> one<00:03:34.319> is

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
so we're doing three layers so one is

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.150 
so we're doing three layers so one is
already<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:35.849> is<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> second<00:03:36.419> layer<00:03:37.160> okay

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
already so this is the second layer okay

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.099 
already so this is the second layer okay
I'm<00:03:38.669> gonna<00:03:38.760> get<00:03:38.849> some<00:03:38.910> more<00:03:39.180> paint<00:03:39.450> pick<00:03:39.959> up<00:03:40.049> a

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
I'm gonna get some more paint pick up a

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.229 
I'm gonna get some more paint pick up a
little<00:03:40.230> bit<00:03:40.349> more<00:03:40.579> and<00:03:41.579> then<00:03:41.669> you<00:03:41.730> go<00:03:41.880> top<00:03:42.209> of

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
little bit more and then you go top of

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.729 
little bit more and then you go top of
it<00:03:42.480> again<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:43.349> this<00:03:43.500> makes<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.829> three<00:03:45.739> okay

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
it again so this makes it three okay

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.710 
it again so this makes it three okay
this<00:03:47.340> one<00:03:47.519> needs<00:03:47.669> four<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.120> we<00:03:48.239> go<00:03:48.359> top<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.569> this

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
this one needs four so we go top of this

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.360 
this one needs four so we go top of this
one<00:03:48.870> again<00:03:49.109> because<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.349> think<00:03:49.530> we<00:03:49.590> redid<00:03:49.829> twice

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
one again because I think we redid twice

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.350 
one again because I think we redid twice
so<00:03:50.910> just<00:03:51.209> in<00:03:51.299> case<00:03:51.450> I'll<00:03:51.720> do<00:03:51.900> two<00:03:52.349> times

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
so just in case I'll do two times

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.950 
so just in case I'll do two times
one<00:03:54.050> two<00:03:54.440> three<00:03:54.950> there's<00:03:55.370> one<00:03:55.550> layer<00:03:55.840> lets<00:03:56.840> off

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
one two three there's one layer lets off
