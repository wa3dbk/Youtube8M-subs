00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
this hair is the Brazilian straight hair

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.130 
this hair is the Brazilian straight hair
and<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:54.059> opted<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.510> go<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.780> straight<00:00:55.110> hair

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
and I opted to go with straight hair

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.560 
and I opted to go with straight hair
since<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.680> am<00:00:55.890> relaxed<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.449> my

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
since I am relaxed I just this is my

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.750 
since I am relaxed I just this is my
first<00:00:57.930> time<00:00:58.109> trying<00:00:58.500> straight<00:00:58.890> hair<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
first time trying straight hair so I

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.900 
first time trying straight hair so I
figured<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.480> would<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.780> fun<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.670> wear<00:01:02.670> I'm

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
figured that it would be fun to wear I'm

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.299 
figured that it would be fun to wear I'm
still<00:01:03.449> working<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.320> blending<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.100> better

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
still working on blending it better

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.050 
still working on blending it better
because<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.939> did<00:01:06.360> dye<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.409> hair<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:08.400> jet<00:01:08.820> black

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
because I did dye the hair a jet black

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.510 
because I did dye the hair a jet black
and<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.450> hair<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.380> jet<00:01:10.650> black<00:01:10.890> my<00:01:11.070> hair<00:01:11.340> is

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
and my hair is not jet black my hair is

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.780 
and my hair is not jet black my hair is
off<00:01:11.880> black<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.049> I'm<00:01:13.500> probably<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.580> have

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
off black so I'm probably going to have

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.950 
off black so I'm probably going to have
to<00:01:15.710> dye<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:17.100> hair<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.030> don't<00:01:18.270> figure<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:18.810> how

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
style though I did wash it and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.560 
style though I did wash it and
straighten<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:37.310> with<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.700> flat<00:02:37.910> iron<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.450> it

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
straighten it with the flat iron so it

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.680 
straighten it with the flat iron so it
is<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:39.220> not<00:02:40.220> in<00:02:40.430> its<00:02:40.550> natural<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.420> strict

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
is in not in its natural a strict

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.070 
is in not in its natural a strict
texture<00:02:42.080> but<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.650> like<00:02:43.459> silk<00:02:43.850> press<00:02:44.180> straight

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
texture but of like silk press straight

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.660 
texture but of like silk press straight
textures<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:45.800> thought<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.010> would<00:02:46.190> just<00:02:46.310> still

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
textures so I thought I would just still

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.840 
textures so I thought I would just still
get<00:02:46.850> out<00:02:47.000> for<00:02:47.720> kind<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.080> first<00:02:48.320> look<00:02:48.850> like
