goalkeeper and ten defenders we create a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.730 
goalkeeper and ten defenders we create a
lot<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.210> chances<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:18.960> give<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.260> goalkeeper

I'd be surprised if Sarah goes I went in

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.359 
I'd be surprised if Sarah goes I went in
to<00:01:38.750> see<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:39.890> go<00:01:40.070> saw<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:45.530> very<00:01:45.740> much<00:01:45.890> mas<00:01:46.340> o

to see so I go saw the very much mas o

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.180 
to see so I go saw the very much mas o
menos<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:46.970> butter<00:01:47.619> Atletico<00:01:48.619> Madrid<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:49.009> stock

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
menos and butter Atletico Madrid a stock

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.340 
menos and butter Atletico Madrid a stock
away<00:01:49.369> I<00:01:49.490> think<00:01:49.700> it'll<00:01:49.850> be<00:01:49.940> a<00:01:50.060> time<00:01:50.390> Atletico<00:01:51.229> de

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
away I think it'll be a time Atletico de

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.109 
away I think it'll be a time Atletico de
Madrid<00:01:51.619> aren't<00:01:52.040> playing<00:01:52.250> well<00:01:52.520> enough<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:52.970> win

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
Madrid aren't playing well enough to win

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.330 
Madrid aren't playing well enough to win
they<00:01:53.840> have<00:01:53.990> very<00:01:54.020> good<00:01:54.409> strikers<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.040> they

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
they have very good strikers and they

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.520 
they have very good strikers and they
score<00:01:55.580> goals<00:01:55.850> but<00:01:56.270> also<00:01:56.300> concede<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.020> lot<00:01:57.259> too

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
score goals but also concede a lot too

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.820 
score goals but also concede a lot too
so<00:01:57.710> I<00:01:58.070> think<00:01:58.190> at<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.610> end<00:01:58.640> it'll<00:01:59.300> be<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.479> drunk

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
so I think at the end it'll be a drunk

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:14.230 
so I think at the end it'll be a drunk
with<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:00.890> certain<00:02:01.190> buttons<00:02:10.959> be<00:02:11.959> win
