00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.119
 makos we can eliminate it if you 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.680
 they want to read, they copy and translate 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.289

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.539
 and there is god and here we have the result 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.800

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:49.280
 is the next 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.700
 let's say right click to the folder of the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.240
 map 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.500
 We give you cut or copy 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.500
 and we write 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:04.490
 here at the start 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:06.869
 we write app data percentage 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.780
 percentage and we will appear this 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.349
 folder running running as you say 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.670
 then we click on the open and we 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:21.500
 let's go to minecraft point we give you know and 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.500
 let's bring the map worth 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.890
 and 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.830
 and now ready to paste the summary for 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.990
 make the reservation as we do 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.280
 exactly the same 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:39.310
 copy or cut to the right click with 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.819
 the east that you know 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.480
 and we go again pointed minecraft and in 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.260
 rzeszÃ³w be park worth 90 stupak because 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.140
 it will not work in reserve 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.920
 ok here I do not have it, let's do as 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.880
 if you do not delete and here we copy it later 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.040
 we hit it that I've seen here we're going to 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.140
 have the cluster so as you see it is 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.650
 all this took the whole story 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.380
 roll this is worth now the next thing that 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.660
 let's do is let's open the biker 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.270
 to show them that I have both the 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.080
 Map 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.080

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.100
 the testuz back ok 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.130

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.260
 I already have the reservation selected 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.650
 but what are you going to do then 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.110
 it is simply to arrive at packages of 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.390
 resources and they will appear and all 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.680
 What you do is take it here 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.590
 they give to the little arrow that will appear 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.110
 and it is already in the des to be such that 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.990
 A) Yes 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.990
 and well let's see the map 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.720
 and it is for a moment that it charges and we 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.510
 is going to see well the webs m the guide or we are going 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.900
 to see if these are the shadows that 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.790
 put the creator on the map worth then 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.670
 to solve these are the on chip 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.840
 do what I went up to mediafire ok 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.840
 then ale 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:21.790
 we close the minecraft 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:25.070
 and with it we can eliminate this 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:28.820
 when you eliminated it you will see 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.580
 and well here we click right this was 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.100

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.920
 game of words and boys is worth what 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.080
 what we are going to do is double click and then 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.780
 already suppose that you should install then I 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.970
 tuning installs because I already have it and 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.120

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.650
 chip to be it has always been the one that 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.390

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.550
