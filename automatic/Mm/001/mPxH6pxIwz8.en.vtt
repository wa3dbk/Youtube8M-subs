00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.290
 it is 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.709
 c today thing done 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:10.160
 inferior to high school the great the relative of he did besides 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:15.449
 the company that manufactures cellulose wadding in France on the site of 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.199
 golbey in the vosges cellulose wadding is a product that is to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.119
 originally 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.919
 of a simply torn foot 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.829
 you advocate% 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.480
 like this one and then in euros 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.060
 as to deaths 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.600
 I'm going to do it live in this way 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 3 you can without too much 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.840
 that's what I see my hand 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.710
 it's the voice of cellulose 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.220
 as for some extremely simple products 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.290
 what we do to protect the paper 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.610
 it floats to add an additive 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.680
 this simple modification 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.510
 in the final product which is the law of silence then that's the method 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.730
 craft that I do not recommend because you still have to 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.220
 the power 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.970
 have time to be able to make the voice decides this way 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.200
 so that the industrialists like the commune in gaza we set up 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.870
 factories a plant that emarges that way so you have in 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.900
 a first time 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
 % the paper that comes in form 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.620
 for they are balloons who are they who make about a ton 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.080
 this year on a meter 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.080
 that product states loving by a single party 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.040
 and delicately this year right now on the solutions of 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.060
 manufacturing that is composed rightfully to the mistake you have a prime 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.890
 crusher 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.469
 who will transform the newspaper I had in my hand in my hand 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.810
 wholesale flakes that are hawks about 10 me tall about 10 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.800
 centimeters in diameter 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.910
 and then 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.560
 not sure that this current flow in a second landlord who will transform it 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.870
 in the form of not just beating 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.430
 It's that simple 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.670
 then when ben alaoui look forward to it and finally she talks in a compactor 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.240
 who will prepare the balloons 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.490
 the balloons which roughly represents generally 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.339
 then between 10 and 13 kilos of goods 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:12.699
 we are going ourselves without prosecution filming on a year the pallet a pallet 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.879
 which includes barely forty balls 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.129
 to the pallet then loaded into a truck and then bring it directly 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.739
 at the distributor 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.769
 which you yourself if you are an individual or an artisan who use 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.299
 modesty lose what are you going to do you're going to take one of these balloons law 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.179
 and you're going to cut it in half 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.499
 to then carry directly into a machine called a carder and 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.529
 in this famous in fact and well you're still it's like a 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.229
 vacuum cleaner with an inverted system you will blow the matte of 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.709
 cellulose mainly in the accounts but a minister you are a 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.119
 little more technician al-assad is more for craftsmen and 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.779
 professionals you will also take the technique to wait 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:49.699
 in the walls 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.199
 and as the building we are in today is a building 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:57.199
 which is not entirely isolated at the silos way whatever it is in its 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.669
 hand 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:58.700
 whether it is 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.470
 in the ceiling recently the walls gold this building is a building 13 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.190
 so we're dealing with brucellosis patients and the journal also relates 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.260
 with them olaf directories also with cigarette paper also 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.239
 with banknotes 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.120
 and as we can hear with them a production line that is found 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.760
 right next to you have in his sleeve a thermal performance but 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.509
 also an acoustic performance since 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.890
 as it's happening right now I was even talking to you pre 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.290
 still very gently in the environment and still the voice of these 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.780
 lots has this feature 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.480
 as you understand it do not use they have no energy to it 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.630
 manufacturing but I'm just going to delegate grinders and at his 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.790
 cause it's pretty simplistic in fact today we can isolate houses 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.630
 entirely with the same thing as the demonstration that I can not 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.760
 accept
