00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.980
 video and good because this time they 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.080
 I bring a gameplay of gears of war 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.180
 ultimate in that good then there we have 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.710
 out there hidden and good because this is 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.290
 video is to talk about the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.300
 editions contained prices that brings what 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.640
 which is the ultimate software in its 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.739
 digital versions at least for now 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.480
 and it's good that two were announced 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.070
 versions the standard edition that good 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.680
 because everyone knows that it is the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.380
 of the current as the law limited ok 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.140
 and a deluxe version was announced that 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.059
 well at a higher cost with 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.160
 quite a considerable amount of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.780
 skins for what are our weapons 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.789
 remember that gears of war ultimate 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.129
 bring that little novelty is that good 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.679
 well we know how to follow 3d software power 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.870
 have what are skins on weapons and 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.429
 good prices were announced something very 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.859
 important that I would like to leave a 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.899
 little bit clear is that if near your 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.890
 net locality the game is also 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.990
 in 1200 best buy balance cards 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.640
 of xbox I say everywhere cost what 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.650
 same because it's the balance they give you 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.690
 and with an 800 card you can 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.010
 buy up lately and software 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.200
 how good there are people to whom in which 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.210
 and jose are selling them in up to a thousand 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.850
 200 pesos ok then the truth is that 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.500
 it is not fair and good for me in everything 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.690
 case if they want to spend 1200 pesos good 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.370
 because we have the issue of lux that good 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.930
 and it's even a little cheaper 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.360
 so then we go with the first one 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.760
 is the normal edition in the edition as 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.640
 He mentioned the edition because there is 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.710
 all this edition includes what they are 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.210
 two characters have already civil that good since 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.890
 had mentioned a little on the page 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.720
 of the software however we did not know 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.000
 well how was the show going to be 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.620
 respect this character the second 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.240
 character that we have is adam finish 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.670
 remember what good came out in what is 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.190
 software 3 and well we have it from 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.680
 back in what is ultimate edition ok 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.360
 and finally we have the emulsion skin 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.700
 animated that we also saw in gears of 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.320
 war 3 what good looked enough then 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.910
 pretty Chinese in this case you see a 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.100
 little bit better can I be a little 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.020
 better and good this is the content of the 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.580
 normal edition of the standard edition 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.310
 for 796 Mexican pesos in the store 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.870
 xbox she can do the first order 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.130
 since today 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.530
 good is yesterday actually 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.670
 can lose and well this is the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.400
 simplest edition 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.830
 I mention 800 pesos is not the price 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.569
 accurate even considering the dollar more 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.160
 or less and out there going then is not that 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.380
 it is really expensive is the price 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.989
 should be and well all this for the 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.450
 question of the dollar ok and good the edition 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.489
 what we have in next is the deluxe 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.520
 edition I suppose I will not have 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.010
 special edition in the case of the 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.930
 physical version or at least that's what 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.060
 it seems to me maybe and maybe and she 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.300
 but good this edition is very much 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.870
 more complete we talk about 300 pesos in 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.680

 300 pesos 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.250
 pure d lc of arms the truth is that no 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.710
 I know how much it's worth, I think 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.710
 from my point of view it is not worth 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.290
 pay 300 pesos more for then skins 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.270
 extras many extra skins that good 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.190
 we talk about 300 pesos in skins like 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.620
 I mention and well the difference of 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.990
 the characters walk phoenix and aaron not 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.460
 lie in marcus and an armor and aaron 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.560
 griffin are exclusive characters of 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.570
 this edition that surely afterwards 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.720
 they will sell separately as they always have 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.090
 done then I say if you have the 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.800
 need of the skins forward grasp 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.780
 the editing of the look however if they are 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.580
 people who are looking for nothing more 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.900
 fun get the camouflages there 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.540
 inside the game that is obviously going to 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.450
 have to perform x or and actions good 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.000
 so go ahead and I could tell you that 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.470
 from this list that I mentioned 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.990
 none good no none maybe some 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.210
 three or four call me attention and now 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.430
 that is too many skins but good 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.380
 that may be not as I mentioned and 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.330
 It is the decision of each one to acquire these 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.830
 editions however good with the 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.140
 amount of games that come and if there 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.850
 many gaming enthusiasts as 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.080
 that is coming for the console I would 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.879
 I would recommend saving 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.810
 hundred pesos and buy the edition 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:24.800
 normal of gears of war ultimate edition 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.150
 So, good people, I hope you have them 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.400
 liked this video with this information 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.780
 about these skins as you want them 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.090
 I will leave the page in the description 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.699
 for you to check the images of 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.680
 each one but well then now that 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.180
 that has been all people I hope that you 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.219
 have liked the video not analyze its law 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.599
 Do not forget to share it with your friends and 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:43.610
 well then leave here in the comments 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:46.219
 that is who they liked the most they pretend 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.770
 or not buy the lux and good edition 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:50.389
 because if if this is so good for you 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.610
 is who intend to use not me the truth 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.469
 is that there may be physical addiction of 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.699
 this although I doubt it very much and good if 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.409
 they will buy the physical vision that 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:58.849
 I mentioned in what goes into this I do not know 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.469
 beats or not the edition of the 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:02.870
