00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
one with the other and so I just simply

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.130 
one with the other and so I just simply
it's<00:04:35.950> just<00:04:36.130> a<00:04:36.220> matter<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.610> which<00:04:37.480> one's<00:04:37.780> get

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
it's just a matter of which one's get

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.160 
it's just a matter of which one's get
velcro<00:04:38.650> do<00:04:38.830> okay<00:04:39.580> that's<00:04:39.850> all<00:04:40.000> it<00:04:40.150> is<00:04:40.300> I<00:04:40.540> went

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
velcro do okay that's all it is I went

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.140 
velcro do okay that's all it is I went
ahead<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:41.440> spent<00:04:41.710> 60<00:04:42.220> bucks<00:04:42.430> on<00:04:42.670> this<00:04:42.790> super

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
ahead and spent 60 bucks on this super

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.090 
ahead and spent 60 bucks on this super
heavy-duty<00:04:43.510> case<00:04:43.990> of<00:04:44.230> this<00:04:44.350> iPad<00:04:45.180> and

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
heavy-duty case of this iPad and

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.260 
heavy-duty case of this iPad and
realistically<00:04:48.100> if<00:04:48.280> I<00:04:48.400> scratched<00:04:48.790> up<00:04:49.060> the

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
realistically if I scratched up the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.660 
realistically if I scratched up the
screen<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:50.560> know<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.710> screen<00:04:51.010> replacements

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
screen you know the screen replacements

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.120 
screen you know the screen replacements
aren't<00:04:51.820> super<00:04:52.210> expensive<00:04:52.830> one<00:04:53.830> thing<00:04:54.040> I

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
aren't super expensive one thing I

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.100 
aren't super expensive one thing I
noticed<00:04:54.520> in<00:04:54.700> putting<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.060> velcro<00:04:55.270> on<00:04:55.510> here<00:04:55.930> it

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
noticed in putting the velcro on here it

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.650 
noticed in putting the velcro on here it
only<00:04:56.530> wants<00:04:56.920> to<00:04:56.980> stick<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.210> hard<00:04:58.420> plastic

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
only wants to stick to the hard plastic

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.660 
only wants to stick to the hard plastic
stuff<00:04:59.170> on<00:04:59.320> this<00:04:59.440> case<00:04:59.710> I<00:04:59.950> think<00:05:00.250> it's<00:05:00.370> one<00:05:00.580> of

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
stuff on this case I think it's one of

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.810 
stuff on this case I think it's one of
those<00:05:01.620> survivor<00:05:02.620> cases<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.460> thought<00:05:03.640> it<00:05:03.730> was

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
those survivor cases I thought it was

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.130 
those survivor cases I thought it was
kind<00:05:04.000> of<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.120> neat<00:05:04.270> little<00:05:04.300> theme<00:05:04.750> to<00:05:04.900> go<00:05:04.930> with

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
kind of a neat little theme to go with

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.010 
kind of a neat little theme to go with
my<00:05:05.290> channel<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.390> rest<00:05:07.600> of<00:05:07.750> this<00:05:07.810> is

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
my channel and the rest of this is

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.630 
my channel and the rest of this is
rubberized<00:05:08.410> well<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.770> velcro<00:05:08.950> won't<00:05:09.340> stick

now we've got another screen position I
mean<00:05:36.880> it's<00:05:37.360> not<00:05:37.750> hard<00:05:38.170> to<00:05:38.320> do<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:39.580> now<00:05:39.820> we've

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
mean it's not hard to do and now we've

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.180

pocket like I normally do I just put

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.660 
pocket like I normally do I just put
some<00:06:01.780> velcro<00:06:02.260> strips<00:06:02.800> on<00:06:02.980> the<00:06:03.010> backs<00:06:03.340> of<00:06:03.610> these

right and they go on my pocket and
that's<00:06:06.130> it<00:06:06.370> I<00:06:06.400> always<00:06:06.670> have<00:06:06.760> these<00:06:07.060> with<00:06:07.330> me<00:06:07.480> in

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
that's it I always have these with me in

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.990 
that's it I always have these with me in
one<00:06:08.440> of<00:06:08.470> the<00:06:08.620> reasons<00:06:08.950> I'm<00:06:09.130> not<00:06:09.160> really<00:06:09.610> into

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
one of the reasons I'm not really into

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.050 
one of the reasons I'm not really into
those<00:06:10.150> super<00:06:10.720> cases<00:06:11.350> for<00:06:12.220> the<00:06:12.490> iPod<00:06:13.030> and

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
those super cases for the iPod and

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.320 
those super cases for the iPod and
iPhone<00:06:13.770> is<00:06:14.770> because<00:06:15.430> they<00:06:15.550> start<00:06:15.820> taking<00:06:15.970> up<00:06:16.240> a

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
iPhone is because they start taking up a

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.450 
iPhone is because they start taking up a
lot<00:06:16.480> of<00:06:16.510> space<00:06:16.900> like<00:06:17.200> if<00:06:17.410> I<00:06:17.500> need<00:06:17.830> extra<00:06:18.160> data

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
lot of space like if I need extra data

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.120 
lot of space like if I need extra data
storage<00:06:19.030> or<00:06:19.260> simply<00:06:20.260> to<00:06:20.380> have<00:06:20.500> another<00:06:20.830> window

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
storage or simply to have another window

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.000 
storage or simply to have another window
open<00:06:21.810> you<00:06:22.810> know<00:06:22.900> for<00:06:23.170> another<00:06:23.380> task<00:06:23.710> or

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
open you know for another task or

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.460 
open you know for another task or
another<00:06:24.220> website<00:06:24.460> I<00:06:24.970> can<00:06:25.540> carry<00:06:25.960> two<00:06:26.230> of<00:06:26.260> these

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
another website I can carry two of these

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.580 
another website I can carry two of these
close<00:06:26.830> together<00:06:27.390> and<00:06:28.390> that<00:06:29.020> takes<00:06:29.260> up<00:06:29.470> about

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
close together and that takes up about

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.690 
close together and that takes up about
the<00:06:29.890> space<00:06:30.280> of<00:06:30.610> the<00:06:31.330> iPhone<00:06:31.870> alone<00:06:32.500> in<00:06:32.950> let's

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
the space of the iPhone alone in let's

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.930 
the space of the iPhone alone in let's
say<00:06:33.940> an<00:06:34.150> otterbox

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
say an otterbox

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.030 
say an otterbox
case<00:06:35.120> you<00:06:36.080> know<00:06:36.140> or<00:06:36.350> you<00:06:36.650> know<00:06:36.740> one<00:06:36.890> of<00:06:36.920> these

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.040 
case you know or you know one of these

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.280 
case you know or you know one of these
heavy-duty<00:06:37.400> cases<00:06:38.090> so<00:06:38.330> there's<00:06:38.660> a<00:06:38.810> lot<00:06:39.020> to<00:06:39.170> be

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
heavy-duty cases so there's a lot to be

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.710 
heavy-duty cases so there's a lot to be
said<00:06:39.590> for<00:06:39.650> that<00:06:39.890> now<00:06:40.250> if<00:06:41.030> somebody<00:06:41.390> wants<00:06:41.660> to

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
said for that now if somebody wants to

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.600 
said for that now if somebody wants to
just<00:06:42.050> consider<00:06:42.530> this<00:06:42.680> to<00:06:42.890> be<00:06:42.950> a<00:06:43.040> proof<00:06:43.400> of

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
just consider this to be a proof of

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.750 
just consider this to be a proof of
concept<00:06:43.820> type<00:06:44.450> thing<00:06:44.720> then<00:06:45.710> I<00:06:46.040> have<00:06:46.370> an<00:06:46.490> idea

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 
concept type thing then I have an idea

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.760 
concept type thing then I have an idea
come<00:06:47.030> out<00:06:47.180> with<00:06:47.390> one<00:06:47.690> of<00:06:47.780> these<00:06:47.870> cases<00:06:48.530> it's

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
come out with one of these cases it's

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.870 
come out with one of these cases it's
just<00:06:48.950> a<00:06:49.070> little<00:06:49.310> bit<00:06:49.520> thicker<00:06:51.610> have<00:06:52.610> it<00:06:52.760> just
