00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
to do is remove this plastic shield

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.170 
to do is remove this plastic shield
which<00:01:50.670> fits<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.570> shield<00:01:51.899> fits<00:01:52.259> up<00:01:52.979> inside<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.850 

like<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.870> 10-millimeter<00:01:59.870> boats<00:02:00.170> hold<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.740> in

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
like so 10-millimeter boats hold it in

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.050 
like so 10-millimeter boats hold it in
there<00:02:01.930> hold<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:03.020> in<00:02:03.170> there<00:02:05.320> there<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:07.060> this

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
there hold it in there there and this

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:17.440 
there hold it in there there and this
corner<00:02:08.510> down<00:02:08.840> here<00:02:09.220> happen<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.550> be<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:12.460> pin<00:02:16.450> one

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
corner down here happen to be a pin one

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.390 
corner down here happen to be a pin one
of<00:02:17.570> these<00:02:18.130> okay

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400

the<00:02:19.910> way<00:02:20.030> these<00:02:20.180> work<00:02:20.240> is<00:02:20.810> when<00:02:21.320> this<00:02:21.470> pin<00:02:21.890> is

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
the way these work is when this pin is

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.120 
the way these work is when this pin is
there<00:02:22.610> they're<00:02:22.820> normally<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.330> place<00:02:24.130> when

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
there they're normally in place when

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.520 
there they're normally in place when

can<00:03:25.580> see<00:03:25.610> holes<00:03:26.090> where<00:03:26.510> other<00:03:26.870> pins<00:03:27.440> go<00:03:27.830> in<00:03:28.010> you

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
can see holes where other pins go in you

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.460 
can see holes where other pins go in you
remove<00:03:28.790> all<00:03:29.090> those<00:03:29.420> all<00:03:29.720> three<00:03:30.019> of<00:03:30.080> those<00:03:30.140> pins

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470

at now that's where the things in the

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.680 
at now that's where the things in the
hole<00:03:41.450> where<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.780> fog<00:03:42.110> lamp<00:03:42.500> set<00:03:43.600> where<00:03:44.600> this

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
hole where the fog lamp set where this

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.270 
hole where the fog lamp set where this
thing<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.019> situated<00:03:45.650> is<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:48.140> fits<00:03:48.440> up<00:03:48.620> inside

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:06.900 

lock<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.459> in<00:03:52.640> place<00:03:53.120> here

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.870 

you<00:04:07.450> can<00:04:07.630> zoom<00:04:07.840> in<00:04:07.900> on<00:04:08.140> that<00:04:08.350> there<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:11.880> then

finally it's a clip on it which locks

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.350 
finally it's a clip on it which locks
into<00:04:19.030> place

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
into place

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.650 
into place
there<00:04:20.340> those<00:04:21.340> are<00:04:21.640> eight<00:04:21.850> millimeter<00:04:22.420> boats

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
there those are eight millimeter boats

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.380 
there those are eight millimeter boats
that's<00:04:23.650> these<00:04:23.920> boats<00:04:24.250> right<00:04:24.550> here<00:04:24.790> I've

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
that's these boats right here I've

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.450 
that's these boats right here I've
already<00:04:25.660> pulled<00:04:25.840> them<00:04:26.020> up<00:04:26.110> one<00:04:26.860> two<00:04:27.040> three

splash<00:04:35.920> shield<00:04:36.280> in<00:04:36.670> place<00:04:38.580> what<00:04:39.580> I've<00:04:39.670> done<00:04:39.880> is

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
splash shield in place what I've done is

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.620 
splash shield in place what I've done is
this<00:04:40.570> is<00:04:40.630> not<00:04:40.960> dangling<00:04:41.730> by<00:04:42.730> its<00:04:42.910> wire<00:04:43.150> it's

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
this is not dangling by its wire it's

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.810 
this is not dangling by its wire it's
actually<00:04:43.960> sitting<00:04:44.140> down<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:45.100> wires<00:04:45.310> loose<00:04:45.640> do

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
actually sitting down the wires loose do

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.250 
actually sitting down the wires loose do
not<00:04:45.970> let<00:04:46.150> this<00:04:46.270> hang<00:04:46.510> by<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.720> wire<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.110> it's
