have<00:00:46.940> probably<00:00:47.030> heard<00:00:47.239> of<00:00:47.540> it<00:00:47.630> some<00:00:47.840> of<00:00:47.870> you

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050

haven't<00:00:48.550> just<00:00:49.550> brief<00:00:50.000> history<00:00:50.329> on<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:50.660> it<00:00:51.320> was

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
haven't just brief history on it it was

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.950 
haven't just brief history on it it was
first<00:00:51.739> invented<00:00:52.460> by<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.149> guy<00:00:53.270> named<00:00:53.570> Arthur

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
first invented by a guy named Arthur

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.880 
first invented by a guy named Arthur
Jones<00:00:54.640> which<00:00:55.640> pioneered<00:00:56.210> that<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:57.530> should

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
Jones which pioneered that you should

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.979 
Jones which pioneered that you should
only<00:00:58.100> be<00:00:58.250> working<00:00:58.880> you<00:00:59.270> should<00:00:59.450> be<00:00:59.540> training

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
only be working you should be training

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.620 
only be working you should be training
super<00:01:00.800> intense<00:01:01.219> for<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.940> short<00:01:02.180> period<00:01:02.239> of<00:01:02.570> time

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
super intense for a short period of time

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.819 
super intense for a short period of time
and<00:01:02.960> that<00:01:03.050> was<00:01:03.079> the<00:01:03.260> best<00:01:03.410> way<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.680> build

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
and that was the best way to build

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.389 
and that was the best way to build
muscle<00:01:04.600> from<00:01:05.600> there<00:01:05.869> again<00:01:06.740> like<00:01:07.100> I<00:01:07.130> said<00:01:07.190> this

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
muscle from there again like I said this

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.730 
muscle from there again like I said this
is<00:01:07.460> only<00:01:07.670> brief<00:01:07.940> from<00:01:08.540> there<00:01:08.810> Mike<00:01:09.170> metzner

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
is only brief from there Mike metzner

is only brief from there Mike metzner
then<00:01:10.070> followed<00:01:10.550> in<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.700> footsteps<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:11.119> Arthur

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
then followed in the footsteps of Arthur

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.900 
then followed in the footsteps of Arthur
Jones<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.170> learn<00:01:12.320> from<00:01:12.619> him<00:01:12.890> I'm<00:01:13.070> tweaked

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
Jones and learn from him I'm tweaked

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.240 
Jones and learn from him I'm tweaked
changed<00:01:14.690> it<00:01:14.810> slightly<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.289> suit<00:01:15.649> him<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.130> what

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
changed it slightly to suit him to what

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.670 
changed it slightly to suit him to what
he<00:01:16.460> felt<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.060> made<00:01:17.930> high<00:01:18.140> intensity<00:01:18.650> training

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
he felt and made high intensity training

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.880 
he felt and made high intensity training
even<00:01:19.130> better<00:01:19.690> from<00:01:20.690> there<00:01:20.900> he<00:01:21.229> then<00:01:21.500> coached

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
even better from there he then coached

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.710 
even better from there he then coached

way to stimulate muscle growth and

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.640 
way to stimulate muscle growth and
strength<00:01:46.580> in<00:01:46.909> a<00:01:47.420> limited<00:01:47.960> amount<00:01:48.049> of<00:01:48.290> time<00:01:48.439> as

possible<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.970> basically<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.290> thought

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
possible and basically the the thought

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.609 
possible and basically the the thought
was<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:53.689> longer<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.140> spend<00:01:54.229> in<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.530> gym

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
was that the longer you spend in the gym

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.789 
was that the longer you spend in the gym
the<00:01:55.040> more<00:01:55.220> damage<00:01:55.400> or<00:01:55.759> goes<00:01:56.030> into<00:01:56.270> your<00:01:56.329> body

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
the more damage or goes into your body

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.990 
the more damage or goes into your body
potentially<00:01:57.799> slowing<00:01:58.280> down<00:01:58.460> there<00:01:58.759> quickly

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
potentially slowing down there quickly

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.929 
potentially slowing down there quickly
you<00:01:59.240> can<00:01:59.390> build<00:01:59.600> muscle<00:02:00.020> think<00:02:00.710> about<00:02:00.979> think

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
you can build muscle think about think

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.990 
you can build muscle think about think
about<00:02:02.000> being<00:02:02.299> in<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.479> gym<00:02:02.689> for<00:02:03.430> an<00:02:04.430> hour<00:02:04.490> as<00:02:05.710> it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
about being in the gym for an hour as it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.520 
about being in the gym for an hour as it
actually<00:02:08.000> let<00:02:08.209> me<00:02:08.299> start<00:02:08.509> again<00:02:08.540> think<00:02:09.320> about

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
actually let me start again think about

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.620 
actually let me start again think about
your<00:02:09.950> body<00:02:10.220> being<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.640> whole<00:02:10.880> like<00:02:11.329> a<00:02:11.360> whole

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
your body being a whole like a whole

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.240 
your body being a whole like a whole
unit<00:02:12.079> and<00:02:12.489> there's<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.549> certain<00:02:13.760> percentage<00:02:14.480> of

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
unit and there's a certain percentage of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.620 
unit and there's a certain percentage of
ability<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.459> can<00:02:16.700> recover<00:02:17.030> from<00:02:17.299> they

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
ability that it can recover from they

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.140 
ability that it can recover from they
can<00:02:17.810> recover

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
can recover

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.869 
can recover
from<00:02:18.329> exercise<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.170> certain<00:02:19.379> stresses<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.489> it

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
from exercise and certain stresses so it

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.970 
from exercise and certain stresses so it
would<00:02:21.239> start<00:02:21.450> off<00:02:21.659> you<00:02:22.230> know<00:02:22.349> on<00:02:22.650> Monday

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
would start off you know on Monday

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.470 
would start off you know on Monday
morning<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.430> slept<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.970> rest<00:02:24.120> over<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
morning you slept and rest over the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.850 
morning you slept and rest over the
weekend<00:02:24.840> you've<00:02:25.290> got<00:02:25.470> one<00:02:25.560> hundred<00:02:25.829> percent

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
weekend you've got one hundred percent

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.289 
weekend you've got one hundred percent
of<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.610> recovery<00:02:27.120> ability<00:02:27.840> what<00:02:28.709> happens<00:02:29.069> is

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
of this recovery ability what happens is

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.819 
of this recovery ability what happens is
as<00:02:30.299> you<00:02:30.540> do<00:02:30.689> a<00:02:30.720> workout<00:02:30.959> if<00:02:31.409> you<00:02:31.500> do<00:02:31.620> quite<00:02:31.799> a

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
as you do a workout if you do quite a

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.979 
as you do a workout if you do quite a
long<00:02:32.099> work<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.579> a<00:02:32.610> big<00:02:33.000> chunk<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:33.689> ability

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
long work a a big chunk of this ability

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.229 
long work a a big chunk of this ability
comes<00:02:34.470> down<00:02:34.769> where<00:02:35.099> your<00:02:35.189> body<00:02:35.340> has<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.819> use<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
comes down where your body has to use it

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.990 
comes down where your body has to use it
in<00:02:36.420> order<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.079> it<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.439> be<00:02:37.829> replenished<00:02:38.519> you

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
in order for it to be replenished you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.530 
in order for it to be replenished you
have<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.299> rest<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.900> recover<00:02:40.409> yeah<00:02:41.189> so<00:02:41.939> see<00:02:42.359> if

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
have to rest and recover yeah so see if

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.899 
have to rest and recover yeah so see if
you<00:02:42.659> go<00:02:42.810> into<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.049> gym<00:02:43.290> four<00:02:44.010> or<00:02:44.220> five<00:02:44.459> times<00:02:44.700> a

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
you go into the gym four or five times a

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.119 
you go into the gym four or five times a
week<00:02:44.939> for<00:02:45.239> an<00:02:45.510> hour<00:02:45.629> and<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.079> give<00:02:47.010> yourself

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
week for an hour and you give yourself

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.210 
week for an hour and you give yourself
no<00:02:47.489> rest<00:02:48.000> they<00:02:48.720> say<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.170> theory<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.560> basically

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
no rest they say the theory is basically

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.920 
no rest they say the theory is basically
you're<00:02:50.370> slowly<00:02:50.670> stopping<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.480> all<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> way

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
you're slowly stopping this all the way

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.410 
you're slowly stopping this all the way
down<00:02:52.139> to<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.349> point<00:02:52.709> where<00:02:53.180> you're<00:02:54.180> at<00:02:54.299> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
down to the point where you're at the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.300 
down to the point where you're at the
bottom<00:02:54.569> over<00:02:55.139> training<00:02:55.409> and<00:02:55.739> then<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.040> start

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
bottom over training and then you start

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.099 
bottom over training and then you start
going<00:02:56.430> further<00:02:56.730> down<00:02:56.909> and<00:02:57.359> that's<00:02:57.750> when<00:02:58.019> you

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
going further down and that's when you

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.020 
going further down and that's when you
get<00:02:58.260> lethargic<00:02:58.409> and<00:02:59.010> tired<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.579> not<00:02:59.819> getting

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
get lethargic and tired you not getting

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.479 
get lethargic and tired you not getting
any<00:03:00.180> stronger<00:03:00.690> etc<00:03:01.200> etc<00:03:01.260> but<00:03:02.010> their<00:03:02.190> thought

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
any stronger etc etc but their thought

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.910 
any stronger etc etc but their thought
was<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:03.120> if<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.810> can<00:03:04.109> take<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.439> down<00:03:04.470> as

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
was that if you can take it down as

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.780 
was that if you can take it down as
little<00:03:05.280> as<00:03:05.400> possible<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:06.150> then<00:03:06.209> rest<00:03:07.549> back<00:03:08.549> up

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
little as possible and then rest back up

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.119 
little as possible and then rest back up
to<00:03:08.939> the<00:03:08.970> top<00:03:09.090> you're<00:03:09.900> then<00:03:10.139> all<00:03:10.439> the<00:03:10.709> rest<00:03:10.889> is

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
to the top you're then all the rest is

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.589 
to the top you're then all the rest is
then<00:03:11.280> spent<00:03:11.609> on<00:03:11.760> building<00:03:12.030> muscle<00:03:12.510> and

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
then spent on building muscle and

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.960 
then spent on building muscle and
strength<00:03:12.799> yeah<00:03:13.799> rather<00:03:14.250> than<00:03:14.430> simply<00:03:14.670> just

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
strength yeah rather than simply just

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.210 
strength yeah rather than simply just
recovering<00:03:15.599> your<00:03:15.930> body<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.739> only<00:03:16.920> has<00:03:17.069> to

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
recovering your body it only has to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.649 
recovering your body it only has to
recover<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.639> body<00:03:17.909> a<00:03:18.000> little<00:03:18.209> bit<00:03:18.359> and<00:03:18.569> all

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
recover the body a little bit and all

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.330 
recover the body a little bit and all
the<00:03:18.780> rest<00:03:18.959> can<00:03:19.170> be<00:03:19.230> used<00:03:19.470> on<00:03:19.590> building<00:03:20.010> extra

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
the rest can be used on building extra

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.430 
the rest can be used on building extra
muscle<00:03:20.670> it's<00:03:20.790> kind<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.199> digging<00:03:22.199> a

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
muscle it's kind of like digging a

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.740 
muscle it's kind of like digging a
little<00:03:22.769> hole<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.940> they've<00:03:24.060> been<00:03:24.239> able<00:03:24.329> fill

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
little hole but they've been able fill

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.530 
little hole but they've been able fill
it<00:03:24.870> up<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.290> lot<00:03:26.069> rather<00:03:26.549> than<00:03:26.760> big<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.239> huge

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
it up a lot rather than big in a huge

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.180 
it up a lot rather than big in a huge
role<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.989> only<00:03:28.199> filling<00:03:28.500> up<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.769> little<00:03:29.010> bit

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
role and only filling up a little bit

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.710 
role and only filling up a little bit
eventually<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.209> whole<00:03:30.299> is<00:03:30.449> going<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:30.629> get

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
eventually the whole is going to get

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.330 
eventually the whole is going to get
deeper<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:31.109> deeper<00:03:31.260> where<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.769> this<00:03:31.889> way<00:03:32.129> it's

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
deeper and deeper where is this way it's

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.210 
deeper and deeper where is this way it's
down<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> little<00:03:33.359> bit<00:03:33.599> but<00:03:34.199> then<00:03:34.319> up<00:03:34.650> yeah

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
down a little bit but then up yeah

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.659 
down a little bit but then up yeah
that's<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.940> basic<00:03:36.510> theory<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:38.280> way

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
that's the basic theory of it the way

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.640 
that's the basic theory of it the way
basically<00:03:39.569> what<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.870> if<00:03:40.230> i<00:03:40.319> take<00:03:40.500> the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
basically what it is if i take the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.170 
basically what it is if i take the
dorian<00:03:41.040> yates<00:03:41.069> version<00:03:41.730> this<00:03:41.849> was<00:03:42.000> my

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
dorian yates version this was my

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.390 
dorian yates version this was my
favorite<00:03:42.419> version<00:03:43.069> basically<00:03:44.069> what<00:03:44.250> you

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
favorite version basically what you

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.009 
favorite version basically what you
would<00:03:44.489> do<00:03:44.669> is<00:03:44.909> you<00:03:44.940> would<00:03:45.120> say<00:03:45.659> we<00:03:45.810> took<00:03:45.930> a

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
would do is you would say we took a

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.379 
would do is you would say we took a
chest<00:03:46.260> workout<00:03:46.709> what<00:03:47.699> you<00:03:47.790> do<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.239> would

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
chest workout what you do is you would

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.559 
chest workout what you do is you would
take<00:03:48.599> a<00:03:48.659> compound<00:03:49.290> exercise<00:03:49.769> first

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
take a compound exercise first

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.509 
take a compound exercise first
traditionally<00:03:51.680> say<00:03:52.680> an<00:03:52.799> incline<00:03:53.159> bench<00:03:53.370> press

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
traditionally say an incline bench press

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.420 
traditionally say an incline bench press
you<00:03:54.000> would<00:03:54.449> perform<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:55.229> warm<00:03:55.590> up<00:03:55.799> sets<00:03:56.129> that

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
you would perform to warm up sets that

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.640 
you would perform to warm up sets that
would<00:03:56.549> just<00:03:56.819> be<00:03:56.879> warm<00:03:57.150> ups<00:03:57.359> that's<00:03:57.599> it<00:03:57.900> you

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
would just be warm ups that's it you

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.369 
would just be warm ups that's it you
would<00:03:58.799> then<00:03:58.829> perform<00:03:59.639> one<00:04:00.090> all<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.569> would<00:04:01.079> set

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
would then perform one all I would set

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.300 
would then perform one all I would set
to<00:04:01.739> maximum<00:04:02.370> failure<00:04:02.940> now<00:04:03.720> this<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:04.159> this<00:04:05.159> is

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
to maximum failure now this is this is

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.580 
to maximum failure now this is this is
it's<00:04:05.579> ridiculous<00:04:06.299> intensity<00:04:06.989> may<00:04:07.169> the<00:04:07.319> only

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
just one big all I'd say have me to

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.279 
just one big all I'd say have me to
failure<00:05:02.409> to<00:05:02.650> pass<00:05:03.520> failure<00:05:04.180> yeah<00:05:04.779> to<00:05:05.199> the

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
failure to pass failure yeah to the

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:06.779 
failure to pass failure yeah to the
point<00:05:05.469> where<00:05:05.680> you're<00:05:05.770> not<00:05:05.949> moving<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.580> is

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
point where you're not moving it is

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.450 
point where you're not moving it is
really<00:05:07.300> it's<00:05:07.629> really<00:05:07.990> tough<00:05:08.229> I<00:05:08.529> think<00:05:09.189> this<00:05:09.340> is

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
really it's really tough I think this is

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.339 
really it's really tough I think this is
why<00:05:09.580> it's<00:05:09.639> not<00:05:09.939> very<00:05:10.090> popular<00:05:10.419> a<00:05:10.900> lot<00:05:10.930> of<00:05:11.199> guys

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
why it's not very popular a lot of guys

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.260 
why it's not very popular a lot of guys
they<00:05:11.680> let<00:05:11.830> it<00:05:11.949> go<00:05:12.069> into<00:05:12.219> the<00:05:12.340> gym<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:12.759> they<00:05:13.090> get

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
they let it go into the gym and they get

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.939 
they let it go into the gym and they get
like<00:05:13.389> to<00:05:13.539> get<00:05:13.659> a<00:05:13.689> big<00:05:13.900> pump<00:05:14.259> put<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.800> weight

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
like to get a big pump put the weight

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.119 
like to get a big pump put the weight
standing<00:05:15.490> another<00:05:15.819> big<00:05:16.060> pump<00:05:16.389> and<00:05:16.659> yeah<00:05:17.289> some

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:18.129 
standing another big pump and yeah some

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:19.469 
standing another big pump and yeah some
people<00:05:18.159> just<00:05:18.520> don't<00:05:18.610> have<00:05:18.849> the<00:05:18.969> discipline<00:05:19.419> to

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
people just don't have the discipline to

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.360 
people just don't have the discipline to
do<00:05:19.659> in<00:05:19.810> certain<00:05:19.960> body<00:05:20.259> parts<00:05:20.620> especially<00:05:20.800> legs

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
do in certain body parts especially legs

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.579 
do in certain body parts especially legs
which<00:05:21.969> is<00:05:22.089> why<00:05:22.240> i<00:05:22.270> think<00:05:22.419> it's<00:05:22.719> it's<00:05:23.020> not<00:05:23.349> very

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:23.589 
which is why i think it's it's not very

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:27.839 
which is why i think it's it's not very
popular<00:05:24.599> I<00:05:26.189> don't<00:05:27.189> know<00:05:27.249> same<00:05:27.430> thing<00:05:27.460> else<00:05:27.729> to
