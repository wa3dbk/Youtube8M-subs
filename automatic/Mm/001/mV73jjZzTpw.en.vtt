00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.010 
guitar humbucker equipped guitar I just
take<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.729> through<00:01:32.939> some<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.299> settings<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
take it through some of the settings and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.490 
take it through some of the settings and
see<00:01:34.680> how<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.950> sounds<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:36.200> said<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> a

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.820 
camera anyways this day I'm set up in
its<00:02:09.590> clean<00:02:09.860> setting<00:02:10.190> right<00:02:10.490> now<00:02:11.650> I'm<00:02:12.650> gonna

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
its clean setting right now I'm gonna

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.540 
its clean setting right now I'm gonna
disengage<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:14.000> mid<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.890> rock<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.220> just<00:02:16.310> let

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
disengage the mid and rock and just let

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:35.580 
disengage the mid and rock and just let
you<00:02:16.670> listen<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.209> clean<00:02:17.420> sound

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.320 

it's<00:02:36.430> got<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> very<00:02:37.390> black<00:02:37.840> face<00:02:38.140> clean<00:02:38.920> tone<00:02:39.330> if

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
it's got a very black face clean tone if

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.870 
it's got a very black face clean tone if
you<00:02:40.630> engage<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.950> mid

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.970 

the<00:02:47.450> camera<00:02:47.810> picks<00:02:48.050> up<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.410> volume<00:02:48.650> boost

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
the camera picks up that volume boost

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.450 
the camera picks up that volume boost
but<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.220> definitely<00:02:49.640> get<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.790> volume<00:02:50.060> below<00:02:50.450> as

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
but you definitely get a volume below as

00:02:51.460 --> 00:03:01.400 
but you definitely get a volume below as
well<00:02:52.460> as<00:02:53.200> emphasize<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.410> mints

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.340 

and<00:03:02.410> if<00:03:02.770> you<00:03:02.860> switch<00:03:03.160> from<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:05.080> Jazz

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.480 

you<00:03:11.150> get<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.300> slowly<00:03:11.630> brighter<00:03:12.020> tone<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.770> a

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
you get a slowly brighter tone and a

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:32.080 
you get a slowly brighter tone and a
little<00:03:13.940> bit<00:03:14.060> more<00:03:29.740> the<00:03:30.820> footswitch<00:03:31.820> has<00:03:32.060> a

part of the tone stack it leaves the

part of the tone stack it leaves the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
trouble in the tone stack takes them in

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.110 
trouble in the tone stack takes them in
the<00:03:39.350> base<00:03:39.530> before<00:03:39.980> all<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.460> get<00:03:40.610> a<00:03:40.640> definite

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
the base before all you get a definite

00:03:41.120 --> 00:04:06.089 
the base before all you get a definite

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.500 

and<00:04:07.099> if<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.489> switch<00:04:07.610> over<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:08.030> overdrive

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
and if I switch over the overdrive

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.460 
and if I switch over the overdrive
channel<00:04:09.019> which<00:04:09.290> has<00:04:09.319> its<00:04:09.709> own<00:04:11.230> kicks<00:04:12.230> on<00:04:12.379> an

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
extra preamp tube as well as a much more

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.150 
extra preamp tube as well as a much more
circuitry<00:04:18.530> that<00:04:18.560> adds<00:04:18.950> a<00:04:19.100> lot<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.400> gain<00:04:20.979> to<00:04:21.979> the

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
circuitry that adds a lot of gain to the

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:38.520 
circuitry that adds a lot of gain to the
amplifier

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.680 

if<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:39.710> if<00:04:40.010> you<00:04:40.190> add<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.699> preamp<00:04:41.210> boost<00:04:41.480> on

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
if you if you add the preamp boost on

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.620 
if you if you add the preamp boost on
top<00:04:41.930> of<00:04:42.110> that<00:04:42.760> you<00:04:43.760> can<00:04:43.970> a<00:04:44.000> lot<00:04:44.180> more<00:04:44.389> volume

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
top of that you can a lot more volume

00:04:44.630 --> 00:05:25.499 
top of that you can a lot more volume
out<00:04:44.870> of<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.080> but<00:04:45.230> you<00:04:45.350> get<00:04:45.500> more<00:04:45.770> set

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.670 

there's<00:05:26.509> no<00:05:26.719> effects

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
there's no effects

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.439 
there's no effects
this<00:05:28.009> is<00:05:28.189> just<00:05:28.430> straight<00:05:28.699> into<00:05:29.059> the<00:05:29.180> amp

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
this is just straight into the amp

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.820 
this is just straight into the amp
there's<00:05:29.689> no<00:05:29.900> nothing<00:05:30.860> in<00:05:30.979> the<00:05:31.129> effect<00:05:31.520> loop

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
there's no nothing in the effect loop

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.679 
there's no nothing in the effect loop
and<00:05:33.830> I<00:05:34.580> have<00:05:34.939> the<00:05:35.120> gain<00:05:37.449> adjustments<00:05:38.449> inside

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:38.689 
and I have the gain adjustments inside

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.339 
and I have the gain adjustments inside
the<00:05:39.139> amplifier<00:05:39.259> setup<00:05:40.039> for<00:05:40.430> the<00:05:41.110> very<00:05:42.110> low

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
the amplifier setup for the very low

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.079 
the amplifier setup for the very low
levels<00:05:42.889> so<00:05:43.159> there's<00:05:43.400> a<00:05:43.460> lot<00:05:43.639> more<00:05:43.819> game

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:44.089 
levels so there's a lot more game

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:53.969 
levels so there's a lot more game
available<00:05:50.349> sometime<00:05:51.349> give<00:05:51.529> that<00:05:51.770> up<00:05:51.800> to<00:05:52.039> body

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
available sometime give that up to body

00:05:53.979 --> 00:06:27.300 
available sometime give that up to body
overdrive<00:05:54.979> and<00:05:55.339> feedback

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.840 

anyways<00:06:28.310> I<00:06:28.550> hope<00:06:28.760> you<00:06:28.910> enjoyed<00:06:29.150> the<00:06:29.300> demo<00:06:29.510> and

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
anyways I hope you enjoyed the demo and

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.490 
anyways I hope you enjoyed the demo and
check<00:06:31.850> all<00:06:32.000> my<00:06:32.150> stuff<00:06:32.390> out<00:06:32.540> out<00:06:32.810> frugal<00:06:33.230> amps

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
check all my stuff out out frugal amps

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.980 
check all my stuff out out frugal amps
calm
