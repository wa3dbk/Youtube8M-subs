00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.700
The light from up above the ground, Ah~

00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:35.600
It’s not happiness, it’s just a trap!

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.600
Even so, I clung to it desperately

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:42.550
To this effect on everyday paradise

00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:49.200
A soaked and battered spirit in exchange for life

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:56.900
Yes, I already have nothing I can do but blame.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.199
Even so, despite my love for you, I can’t find “reality”

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:12.100
This preciously bound journal, just touching it brings my tears to surface.

00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:18.800
On this ship that’s lost it’s bearings I light a beacon of atonement.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.100
Like a starmine it shines,

00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:26.200
Steering a course towards the starry sky.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
These locked up emotions, if I do it now

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:46.899
Together with the light I can break open and expose them

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900
In order to save you, to save the world

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:53.830
The spell is now unraveled.

00:01:53.831 --> 00:02:00.500
Even though tomorrow has no destination, that’s alright

00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:08.000
Yes, I already have nothing I can do but continue.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.400
There will be no third time; I have left behind as much love as I can

00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:23.500
For you continued in this journal, and as if it were a happy ending,

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:30.399
I’ll send you so many thousands of stars that your entire life would be too short to see all of them

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.500
Like starmines, sparkling, let these precious emotions reach you!

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.200
Although the hands of a clock can not be turned back, new fates are made.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.300
I want to find a route overflowing with light so that I can journey together with you.

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:24.299
Even so, despite my love for you, I can’t find “reality”

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.200
This preciously bound journal… I can’t look back anymore.

00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:38.000
Reaching this station in the starry sky, this destination, this world of illusions

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:45.500
Like a starmine, this shining world is my present to you.
