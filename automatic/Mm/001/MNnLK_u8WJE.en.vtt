00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.080
 hey people that's where anna and you 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.939
 Wanted to know two guards 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.190
 First, how do I create one 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.440
 screenshot and 2 and let sit down 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.830
 device completely back both is show 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.290
 I you 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.600
 both are very simple we start 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.590
 with the screenshot one takes the volume 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.050
 down or 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.750
 the button and the start button presses it 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.820
 at the same time a second and the wait 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.820
 screenshot is saved and saved 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.880
 can be viewed immediately and the 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.920
 other thing the settings no the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.960
 the whole thing stood on the mountain 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.280
 It's easy to reset 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.710
 save the system settings and 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.789
 reset and then to factory condition 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.879
 reset to default 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.069
 everything is cleared out here 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.829
 the google account system and data and 

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.659
 downloaded apps phone back 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.229
 We also want to set the data securely 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.429
 or not we delete everything the device 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.100
 will then shut down 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:05.360
 I'll let it run for a minute and show you 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.890
 what that looks like now 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.560
 may take a bit of time 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.079
 and I will fast forward the whole thing 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.259
 not five minutes here now 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:17.259
 sitting and not having so much fun 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.660
 so here we see that android people 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.320
 that you also like to see when you are 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.970
 an update or something like that 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.280
 I'll show you a little closer 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:38.740
 so that they can possibly read what the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:41.650
 still happening that lasts now of course 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.410
 a little something after that is the device 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.570
 back on the stand with it 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.010
 was delivered to factory condition that 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.790
 means we have to completely new 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.430
 set up 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:59.460
 sometimes that must be unfortunately and so 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:03.150
 as that is ok there what ok means 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.300
 finished now the device reboots 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:10.170
 sign up again and everything new 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.170
 set up 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:19.110
 the courage or startscreen 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.359
 and there are 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.999
 he has seen it now we have to 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.469
 we would not have entered our pin 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:35.439
 sim card in it we would do the whole thing 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.030
 android systems re-set up and that 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.499
 It was so much of me already 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.590
 a lot of my video now you know 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.590
 decision
