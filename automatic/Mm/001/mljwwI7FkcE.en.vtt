00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.490
 j 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.559
 when there is the opportunity to help 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.360
 kids to have respect for education 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.600
 I believe that they are piercing themselves 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.630
 lose both pretty fast enough 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.250
 in this in this modern world so 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.920
 respected men accepted 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.840
 a hierarchy is an authority I 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.910
 think it's good if I think 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.310
 better evolution that must be 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.809
 for football is to make sure 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.809
 that referees do not feel alone 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.190
 anything that can give visibility 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 at the event 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.699
 and then it's good to have a 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.110
 old field first movement that that 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:51.000
 gives even more visibility that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.199
 shows that the players are interested 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.920
 also to referees like referees 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.920
 must be interested in widows 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.859
 these days are also an opportunity to 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.739
 remember that there is no sport there 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.720
 has no competition without referees and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.759
 that the arbitration decisions 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.430
 referees must be respected this is 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.490
 an essential foundation of sport 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.770
 it's a school of beautiful life 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.250
 learns taking responsibility the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.710
 decision- making the management of the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.200
 conflict management etc etc and we are not 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.990
 not the same person before and after 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.990
 having directed football matches 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.799
 still says arbitration 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.799
 always right is the one who directed 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.050
 younger age stone I believe it 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.920
 must educate young people about respect 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.500
 young referees 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.840
 it's a human being sometimes he can 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.550
 but I say sometimes have a 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.150
 different judgment of what they 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.890
 should have 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.570
 but there was no not arbitrated 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.220
 competition is an experience that 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.450
 all players should have so much 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.010
 than me if I put on the jersey it's 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.360
 to honor them and for their 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.500
 to say that I am their first trio and 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.030
 then you really have to help 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.920
 I know that the French federation 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.140
 football and especially the districts are 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.400
 very hard on all those who do not 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.580
 respect the referees and they have 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.580
 reason 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.750
 I have really interesting and then laureate 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.780
 zeit because I have plenty of advice and 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.790
 then I had 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.880
 also interpretations of the steps 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.170
 necessarily different but here we are 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.590
 imagine relieved by moment and me 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.980
 reinforce in the decision that the judge 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.980
 2000
