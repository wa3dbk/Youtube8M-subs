about ten years now a stick clipping on
on<00:00:19.190> some<00:00:19.699> routes<00:00:19.850> can<00:00:20.300> reduce<00:00:20.690> the<00:00:21.050> danger

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
on some routes can reduce the danger

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.920 
on some routes can reduce the danger
factor<00:00:21.949> significantly<00:00:22.760> a<00:00:23.270> lot<00:00:23.690> of<00:00:23.780> times

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
factor significantly a lot of times

or it might be a bad landing if you
stick<00:00:27.800> clip<00:00:27.980> it<00:00:28.130> then<00:00:28.250> you're<00:00:28.370> on<00:00:28.460> top<00:00:28.730> rope

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
falling directly onto your blair if you

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.500 
falling directly onto your blair if you
can<00:00:36.230> stick<00:00:36.500> clip<00:00:36.739> you<00:00:37.640> know<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.969> first<00:00:38.180> bolt

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
can stick clip you know the first bolt

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.450 
can stick clip you know the first bolt
then<00:00:38.809> you<00:00:39.079> have<00:00:39.320> that<00:00:39.530> in<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.859> system<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:40.399> you

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
then you have that in the system so you

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.099 
then you have that in the system so you
don't<00:00:40.699> end<00:00:40.789> up<00:00:40.969> taking<00:00:41.149> a<00:00:41.359> back<00:00:41.539> door<00:00:41.690> to<00:00:41.870> fall

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
don't end up taking a back door to fall

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.509 
don't end up taking a back door to fall
or<00:00:42.320> anything<00:00:42.379> like<00:00:42.800> that<00:00:42.859> so<00:00:43.309> it's<00:00:43.460> pretty

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
or anything like that so it's pretty

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.090 
or anything like that so it's pretty
pretty<00:00:44.210> handy<00:00:44.600> it's<00:00:44.719> safe<00:00:45.019> it's<00:00:45.319> a<00:00:45.409> really

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100
