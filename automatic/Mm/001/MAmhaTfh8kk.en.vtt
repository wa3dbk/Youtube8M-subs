so here we were just we just have the
class

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.520 

other<00:01:05.700> instruments<00:01:07.220> some<00:01:08.220> all<00:01:08.460> young

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530

and<00:01:12.910> you'll<00:01:13.910> have<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.330> do<00:01:14.630> quite<00:01:14.870> a<00:01:14.990> few<00:01:15.560> others

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
and you'll have to do quite a few others

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.790 
and you'll have to do quite a few others
now<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.130> it's<00:01:19.570> still<00:01:20.570> very<00:01:20.600> very<00:01:21.260> plain<00:01:21.530> and

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
now and it's still very very plain and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.340 
now and it's still very very plain and
now<00:01:22.010> after<00:01:22.370> after<00:01:23.330> few<00:01:23.630> minutes<00:01:23.720> you've<00:01:24.140> done

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
now after after few minutes you've done

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.340 
now after after few minutes you've done
you've<00:01:24.560> tried<00:01:24.770> everything<00:01:25.070> you<00:01:25.190> could<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.350> now

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
you've tried everything you could so now

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.090 
you've tried everything you could so now
instead<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:28.430> we<00:01:28.790> will<00:01:28.940> use<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.450> USB<00:01:30.410> USB

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
instead of this we will use the USB USB

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.190 
instead of this we will use the USB USB
connection<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:32.090> these<00:01:32.330> ways<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:32.960> many

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
connection of these ways and many

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.700 
connection of these ways and many
similar<00:01:33.500> signals<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:35.350> this<00:01:36.350> device<00:01:36.680> will

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
similar signals and this device will

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.870 
similar signals and this device will
take<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.340> relay

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
take the relay

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.620 
take the relay
so<00:01:39.160> instead<00:01:41.830> yes<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.759> it<00:01:43.880> will<00:01:44.060> take<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.330> mini

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
so instead yes so it will take the mini

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.320 
so instead yes so it will take the mini
signals<00:01:45.110> through<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:46.330> actually

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
signals through it to actually

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.420 
signals through it to actually
synthesize<00:01:48.020> new<00:01:48.050> sounds<00:01:48.830> it's<00:01:49.130> only<00:01:49.280> the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
synthesize new sounds it's only the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.249 
synthesize new sounds it's only the
computer<00:01:49.910> all<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:50.479> need<00:01:50.660> is<00:01:50.810> just<00:01:50.840> this

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
computer all you need is just this

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.290 
computer all you need is just this
device<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:52.280> should<00:01:52.310> have<00:01:52.580> new<00:01:52.790> instruments

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
device you should have new instruments

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.350 
device you should have new instruments
you<00:01:53.420> can<00:01:53.450> just<00:01:53.810> put<00:01:54.020> them<00:01:54.170> on<00:01:54.259> a<00:01:54.290> stick<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:56.270> it

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
you can just put them on a stick so it

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
you can just put them on a stick so it
will<00:01:56.570> sound<00:01:56.780> like<00:01:57.729> this<00:01:59.050> this<00:02:00.050> is<00:02:00.229> actually

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
will sound like this this is actually

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.389 
will sound like this this is actually
the<00:02:00.830> synthesizer

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
the synthesizer

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.760 
the synthesizer
this<00:02:03.759> sound<00:02:04.030> is<00:02:04.149> not<00:02:04.359> Allah<00:02:04.630> is<00:02:04.960> not<00:02:05.140> surrani

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
this sound is not Allah is not surrani

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.330 
this sound is not Allah is not surrani
it<00:02:06.130> cannot<00:02:06.429> be<00:02:06.640> using<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:08.340> keyboard

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
it cannot be using this this keyboard

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.839 
it cannot be using this this keyboard
will<00:02:09.670> bite<00:02:09.940> it's<00:02:10.300> just<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:11.040> new<00:02:12.040> instrument<00:02:12.430> so

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
will bite it's just a new instrument so

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.000 
will bite it's just a new instrument so
using<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:13.780> turn<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.620> wheel<00:02:14.739> let's

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
using this you just turn the wheel let's

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.100 
using this you just turn the wheel let's
say<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.670> it's<00:02:15.790> real<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.090> will<00:02:16.629> show<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.900> which

this on this very classic piano you

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:41.850 
this on this very classic piano you
cannot<00:02:30.970> get<00:02:31.269> these<00:02:31.480> frogs<00:02:31.840> apart<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.709> get

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
cannot get these frogs apart so you get

00:02:41.860 --> 00:03:00.810 
cannot get these frogs apart so you get
beats<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.920> also<00:02:48.069> get<00:02:48.340> passed

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.420 

typically<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:02.180> a

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
typically this is a

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.030 
typically this is a
this<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.879> just<00:03:04.180> some<00:03:05.019> kind<00:03:05.140> of<00:03:05.260> instrument<00:03:05.799> you

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
this is just some kind of instrument you

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.679 
this is just some kind of instrument you
can<00:03:06.159> achieve<00:03:06.250> by<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:07.030> will<00:03:07.209> download<00:03:07.480> your

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
can achieve by it will download your

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.130 
can achieve by it will download your
file<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.379> plug<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.769> into<00:03:08.950> it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
file and and plug it into it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.960 
file and and plug it into it
so<00:03:11.140> now<00:03:11.290> if<00:03:11.349> I<00:03:11.560> had<00:03:11.920> done<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.310> somehow<00:03:12.519> smaller

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
something more interesting maybe we're

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.550 
something more interesting maybe we're
gonna<00:03:49.269> have<00:03:49.510> some<00:03:49.720> some<00:03:50.319> more<00:03:50.379> sounds

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.640 

I<00:03:54.590> know<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.310> can<00:03:55.640> hear<00:03:55.880> on<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.510> video<00:03:56.870> of<00:03:57.050> it

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.259 

distorted<00:04:02.370> that's<00:04:02.670> very<00:04:02.849> different<00:04:03.060> from

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
distorted that's very different from

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:25.580 
distorted that's very different from
what<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.510> get<00:04:03.780> seizures<00:04:04.160> best<00:04:05.160> car

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:33.490 

and<00:04:25.860> let's<00:04:26.100> try<00:04:26.310> an<00:04:27.000> aerophone

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.280 

you<00:04:34.430> get<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.730> idea<00:04:34.820> now<00:04:35.710> for<00:04:36.710> now<00:04:36.890> at<00:04:37.130> USB<00:04:38.290> USB

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
you get the idea now for now at USB USB

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.030 
you get the idea now for now at USB USB
connection<00:04:40.120> hot<00:04:41.120> plug<00:04:41.390> in<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.500> future<00:04:42.890> we

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
connection hot plug in the future we

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.320 
connection hot plug in the future we
have<00:04:43.220> some<00:04:43.460> records<00:04:43.910> too<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:46.060> then<00:04:47.060> there's

have some records too and then there's

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.910 
have some records too and then there's
some<00:04:47.540> awesome<00:04:47.720> officials<00:04:48.410> who<00:04:48.500> come<00:04:48.740> with

some awesome officials who come with

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.260 
some awesome officials who come with
their<00:04:49.100> connected<00:04:50.080> connected<00:04:51.080> features<00:04:52.270> we

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
their connected connected features we

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.170 
their connected connected features we
make<00:04:53.420> another<00:04:53.660> video<00:04:53.810> fat
