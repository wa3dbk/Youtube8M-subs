the<00:02:39.940> basement<00:02:42.989> amazing<00:02:43.989> that<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.260> hasn't

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
the basement amazing that it hasn't

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.390 
the basement amazing that it hasn't
frozen<00:02:45.010> but<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:46.560> pretty<00:02:47.560> amazing<00:02:47.860> a

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
frozen but that is pretty amazing a

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.699 
frozen but that is pretty amazing a
little<00:02:49.269> bit<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.480> ice<00:02:49.600> forming<00:02:50.080> over<00:02:50.200> there<00:02:50.470> but

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
little bit of ice forming over there but

00:02:50.709 --> 00:03:02.090 
little bit of ice forming over there but
i<00:02:51.180> guess<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.330> earth<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.750> holding<00:02:53.519> some<00:02:54.519> warmth

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100
