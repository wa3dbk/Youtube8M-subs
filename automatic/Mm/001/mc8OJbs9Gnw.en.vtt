money the way we should were we spending
it<00:00:52.760> most<00:00:53.030> efficiently<00:00:53.590> obviously<00:00:54.590> we<00:00:54.710> had<00:00:54.860> to

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
it most efficiently obviously we had to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.530 
it most efficiently obviously we had to
look<00:00:55.130> at<00:00:55.280> agencies<00:00:55.880> and<00:00:56.150> agency

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
consolidation and as part of that we

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.310 
consolidation and as part of that we
realized<00:00:59.540> that<00:00:59.780> there<00:00:59.930> was<00:00:59.990> a<00:01:00.050> huge

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
realized that there was a huge

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.979 
realized that there was a huge
opportunity<00:01:00.680> for<00:01:01.040> PepsiCo<00:01:01.730> to<00:01:02.329> focus<00:01:02.840> our

opportunity for PepsiCo to focus our

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.999 
opportunity for PepsiCo to focus our
efforts<00:01:03.350> behind<00:01:03.860> fewer<00:01:04.339> relationships<00:01:05.210> and

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
efforts behind fewer relationships and

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.770 
efforts behind fewer relationships and
to<00:01:07.009> be<00:01:07.100> able<00:01:07.220> to<00:01:07.460> both<00:01:07.670> leverage<00:01:08.630> our

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.660 
to be able to both leverage our
activities<00:01:09.380> with<00:01:09.590> fewer<00:01:09.950> partners<00:01:10.369> so<00:01:10.640> they

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
activities with fewer partners so they

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.730 
activities with fewer partners so they

goals<00:02:49.300> so<00:02:49.569> I<00:02:49.600> think<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:50.290> general<00:02:50.530> movement<00:02:50.920> to

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
goals so I think the general movement to

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.280 
goals so I think the general movement to
its<00:02:51.580> consumers<00:02:52.150> wanting<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.989> be<00:02:53.080> better

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
its consumers wanting to be better

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.140 
its consumers wanting to be better
informed<00:02:53.530> about<00:02:54.010> what<00:02:54.400> they're<00:02:54.580> consuming

informed about what they're consuming

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.059 
informed about what they're consuming
joy<00:02:55.390> is<00:02:55.600> there<00:02:55.930> in<00:02:56.049> virtually<00:02:56.470> every<00:02:56.560> market

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
joy is there in virtually every market

joy is there in virtually every market
in<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.310> world<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.760> think<00:02:58.049> more<00:02:59.049> countries<00:02:59.530> are

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
in the world I think more countries are

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.650 
in the world I think more countries are
more<00:02:59.799> sensitive<00:03:00.069> about<00:03:00.519> what<00:03:00.940> is<00:03:01.090> advertised

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
more sensitive about what is advertised
