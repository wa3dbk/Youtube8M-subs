00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 we all know barbie xense this 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.600
 books on books tell me about a series 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.580
 of unfortunate events practically from 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.300
 freud to a series of unfortunate events 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.849
 for a 13- year-old, however, 13 books 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.190
 and I read it because it's just a market 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.170
 the movie so i wanted to see if they were 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.939
 kevin is also books or not 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.880
 let's start means that movies and books don't 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.230
 c'azzeccano nothing literally my 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.480
 the film talks about the first three chapters 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.279
 literally twists history vi 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.500
 I recommend reading the film and books 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.020
 I think they are different 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.460
 I found some very nice ideas 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.640
 always remember we are for an audience 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.910
 of boys so in short for children no 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.460
 but I believe for boys of and is 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.530
 interesting that the first chapters 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.649
 the words are practically explained 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.289
 important difficult of the boys through 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.940
 the dialogue between the three brothers 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.280
 I will speak micron I never went to get 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.809
 the dictionary I preferred to ask the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.690
 meaning of a word because I was 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.420
 lazy and I think this is a version 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.129
 nice to be able to perceive what it wants 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 say that certain word a 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
 boy despite his beauty 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.250
 as we move forward in the chapters 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.770
 but this thing was not there and therefore it was 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.350
 explains explicitly therefore not 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.900
 I found it too cute a thing 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.479
 to 34 chapters it is very very tight the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.549
 things that happen in books are a lot 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.369
 one behind the other very badly 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.130
 pounding as you see it lasts one 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.590
 some of the tank the narration can do 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.689
 get to 13 made books we talk about 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.290
 bad luck there are thirteen books per pound 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.140
 13 chapters except for missing chapters 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.659
 or extra chapters in the penultimate il 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.250
 book and in the last there is a chapter laga 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.680
 the fourteenth to explain a 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.110
 little of an end these books do not 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.470
 have an end i will tell the truth i would have 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.399
 preferred by banal reader to have 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.399
 a trivial ending 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.109
 would have made it much happier though 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:07.679
 I appreciate this decision very much 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.119
 difficult to take the 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.580
 challenging word on a video in which 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.010
 I speak of children 's books in short, is 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.370
 exaggerating a nice thing that many 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.500
 characters will be the name of characters 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.879
 famous but not important characters 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.000
 for example the baudelaire orphans 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:28.530
 of the writer. the trigiani quagmire who 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.760
 if they call it isadora duncan come 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.879
 idanka inventor 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.950
 or the threads of Mr. Po the banker 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.430
 that takes care of the affairs of the orphans who 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.829
 they call edgar and alan and allan poe parma 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.310
 the baudelaire grow where it goes on 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:48.000
 just as he thought about why they grow up 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.950
 even the voters this one 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.819
 books always boys but a little less 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.620
 children 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.900
 another choice that I liked very much 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.590
 and that boys' tutors are often 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.170
 people who have ideas to want 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.930
 save yourself from evil and end up doing 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.680
 of evil as well as baudelaire are not 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.660
 good manna guys to defeat 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.730
 evil does the same thing therefore not 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.579
 we will limit ourselves to good and bad 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.160
 and here is a fairly elaborate concept 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.410
 in a manner of too trivial handwriting is 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.959
 very different precise detail because 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.419
 are not there is not solved 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.840
 practically nothing but a mystery 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:29.459
 which was the most marginal of all 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.340
 from the book series 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.889
 but I think it's much nicer than that 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.510
 to the film 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.730
 under this size in the aspect 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.769
 aesthetic the film in my opinion very nice 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.880
 but it is also a slightly different tone 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.010
 here is the murders procure evil 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.139
 kill us I'm not the only person 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.269
 than in May over 13 years 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.810
 all three cockerel books 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.810
 let me know
