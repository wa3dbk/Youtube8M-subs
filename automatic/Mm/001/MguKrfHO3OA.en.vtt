00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
that's the difference and when it feels

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.230 
that's the difference and when it feels
right<00:06:14.570> and<00:06:14.870> when<00:06:14.990> it<00:06:15.080> doesn't<00:06:15.290> feel<00:06:15.560> right<00:06:16.240> it

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
right and when it doesn't feel right it

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.879 
right and when it doesn't feel right it
feels<00:06:17.479> right<00:06:17.720> there's<00:06:17.960> no<00:06:18.139> question<00:06:18.590> about<00:06:18.710> it

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
feels right there's no question about it

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.249 
feels right there's no question about it
when<00:06:19.729> it<00:06:19.850> doesn't<00:06:20.060> feel<00:06:20.330> right<00:06:20.600> doesn't

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:21.259 
when it doesn't feel right doesn't

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:22.810 
when it doesn't feel right doesn't
matter<00:06:21.380> how<00:06:21.590> far<00:06:21.860> how<00:06:22.070> hard<00:06:22.370> you<00:06:22.520> try<00:06:22.669> and

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
matter how far how hard you try and

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.580 
matter how far how hard you try and
force<00:06:23.060> it<00:06:23.240> it<00:06:23.389> just<00:06:23.419> is<00:06:23.900> just<00:06:23.960> not<00:06:24.320> going<00:06:24.530> to

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
force it it just is just not going to

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.740 
force it it just is just not going to
end<00:06:24.740> up<00:06:24.860> right<00:06:24.919> so<00:06:25.520> it's<00:06:26.000> better<00:06:26.180> just<00:06:26.419> to<00:06:26.539> let

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
end up right so it's better just to let

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.900 
end up right so it's better just to let
him<00:06:26.840> go<00:06:27.050> I<00:06:29.949> don't<00:06:30.949> know<00:06:31.070> if<00:06:31.130> she<00:06:31.250> broke<00:06:31.460> my<00:06:31.520> hair
