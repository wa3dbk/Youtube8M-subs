 hunger are the lbs geo a server but 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.189
 he mentioned more the hunger games 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.140
 because he is the creator of the games of 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.489
 hungry or let's say that the creator of the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.930
 Hunger games best known in 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.219
 minecraft that edition or server 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.200
 the most well-known hunger games of 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.149
 minecraft edition is for them to recognize 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.010
 that's good, only the 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.260
 servers of the lbs g of the creator of 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.969
 william what good to start if you do not 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.100
 let in if you do not let them log in if 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.630
 it does not work if x motive can be 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.160
 that is not online, it may be that 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.260
 growing it may be played 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.630
 it can be you can not be infinity of 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.700
 things that is canceled to be for a 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.190
 moment that is offline that is 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.870
 saturated there is a lot bunch and great 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.690
 since he's just setting them up 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.369
 as to be able to make them fluid and 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.869
 stable so it's barely in 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.090
 preparation these guys so I do not know 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.009
 despair patience black patience and 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.299
 good so if it does not work for you it's that 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.909
 why are they going to see I already have it 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.710
 registered and then right now I do not even 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.450
 is going to let in a little while ago 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.830
 to enter by miracle but he was super 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.540
 super guided and 2 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.100
 Note that this is the same server 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.890
 which I had previously entered 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.450
 where I put the server for 0.9 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.400
 leave the video for them to see there 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.410
 yes I could enter but that was weeks ago 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.270
 where they were just in beta and good 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.100
 now as he entered as the record as 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.840
 they see they do not even even enter or 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.280
 right now not letting in I think it has to 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.370
 to be super full has to be super 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.900
 super 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.250
 well I think that drink 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.700
 and that work I'm not going to close 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.640

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.070
 start let's go to this part of here 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.110
 to this this address that I leave to the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.820
 long jing point the sg dot net what is 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.380
 this is good if you are new websites or 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.380
 he never clarified to me that edition of sure you 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.610
 you do not have the lbs g account so you 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.080
 you have to create one you will give in 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.310
 register and you register there are many that 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.960
 they say that you can not there are others that I 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.459
 they say that you can I do not know just 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.619
 these are the procedures if you 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.570
 it works and it starts you already excellent 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.130
 you have the first step if you already played 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.260
 the famous axis in the games of 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.570
 hungry 'catch the flag oo some 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.250
 game or some previous server of the 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.580
 celebrities is the only thing you have to 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.980
 do 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.690
 for example the infiniti word the only thing 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.160
 what you have to do is give it in login and 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.510

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.980
 put is your own username those who 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.330

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.769
 they will know that he needed his name 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.360

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.489

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.870

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.830
 give them server dinner and it is added to your 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.270
 server and it gets something like this 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.980
 just the only thing you have to 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.260
 to do is to enter and if you have a lot of 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.670
