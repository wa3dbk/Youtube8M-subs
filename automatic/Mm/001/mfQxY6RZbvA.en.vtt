this look with Urban Decay primer potion
and<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> original<00:00:52.199> one<00:00:52.379> mine

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and this is just the original one mine

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.040 
and this is just the original one mine
is<00:00:53.309> actually<00:00:53.699> broken<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.600> really<00:00:54.809> weird

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
is actually broken so it's really weird

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.920 
is actually broken so it's really weird
to<00:00:55.199> use<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.800> because<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.820> wand<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.480> super

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
to use it because the wand is like super

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.029 
to use it because the wand is like super
flimsy<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.559> weird<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.190> that's<00:01:00.090> okay

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
flimsy and weird but that's okay

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.290 
flimsy and weird but that's okay
obviously<00:01:02.039> naked<00:01:02.399> smoky<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> palette

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
obviously naked smoky is the palette

fallout issues with me I noticed that

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.399 
fallout issues with me I noticed that
when<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.409> editing<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.600> beware<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
when I was editing so beware of that the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.910 
when I was editing so beware of that the
glitter<00:01:25.619> shades<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.130> kinda<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.820> little

finicky<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.310> glittery<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.240> probably<00:01:30.810> apply

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
finicky and glittery so probably apply

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.920 
finicky and glittery so probably apply

back in with black market and a flat

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.830 
back in with black market and a flat
brush<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.130> going<00:02:35.460> on<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:36.450> lower

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
brush and this is going on the lower

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.510

kind of create like a smoky look I just

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.600 
kind of create like a smoky look I just
figured<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.620> would<00:02:40.800> be<00:02:40.860> easier<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.430> more

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
figured this would be easier and more

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.510 
figured this would be easier and more
subtle<00:02:42.030> than<00:02:42.150> if<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.510> used<00:02:42.810> an<00:02:43.110> eyeliner<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.340> do

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
subtle than if I used an eyeliner to do

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.460 
subtle than if I used an eyeliner to do
it<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:45.180> was<00:02:45.330> right<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:46.020> TOI<00:02:46.200> this

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
it and I was right I like TOI this

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.320 
it and I was right I like TOI this
looked<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.740> lot<00:02:46.890> more<00:02:46.950> than<00:02:47.280> if<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.550> smoked<00:02:48.180> out

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
looked a lot more than if I smoked out

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.960 
looked a lot more than if I smoked out
an<00:02:48.420> eyeliner<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.800> haven't<00:02:50.400> noticed<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
an eyeliner if you haven't noticed the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.420 
an eyeliner if you haven't noticed the
key<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.840> look<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.590> blend<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.310> blend

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
key to this look is to blend and blend

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.690 
key to this look is to blend and blend
more<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.210> then<00:02:54.360> blend<00:02:54.660> more<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.490> my
