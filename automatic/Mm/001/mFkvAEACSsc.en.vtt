to<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.120> conditions<00:00:55.900> so<00:00:56.590> eventually<00:00:57.129> yeah

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
to the conditions so eventually yeah

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:44.039

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.870 

it's<00:01:45.049> crazy<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.560> route<00:01:45.770> ride<00:01:46.009> took<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.609> guess

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
it's crazy the route ride took I guess

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.789 
it's crazy the route ride took I guess
yeah<00:01:47.569> the<00:01:47.689> whole<00:01:47.840> beginning<00:01:47.990> it's<00:01:48.439> kind<00:01:48.679> of<00:01:48.740> a

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
yeah the whole beginning it's kind of a

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.370 
yeah the whole beginning it's kind of a
crux<00:01:49.009> in<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.280> bottom<00:01:49.609> and<00:01:49.819> I<00:01:50.090> wasn't<00:01:51.020> excited

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
crux in the bottom and I wasn't excited

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.929 
crux in the bottom and I wasn't excited
to<00:01:51.469> really<00:01:51.710> onset<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.280> but<00:01:52.429> then<00:01:52.579> I<00:01:52.670> eventually

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
to really onset it but then I eventually

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.550 
to really onset it but then I eventually
get<00:01:53.329> in<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.600> experience<00:01:54.079> that<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.319> was<00:01:54.380> like

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
get in the experience that I was like

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.440 
get in the experience that I was like
haha<00:01:54.740> maybe<00:01:55.340> I'm<00:01:55.549> going<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.759> try<00:01:55.939> it<00:01:55.999> on<00:01:56.090> set<00:01:56.329> it

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
haha maybe I'm going to try it on set it

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.490 
haha maybe I'm going to try it on set it
because<00:01:56.630> they<00:01:56.719> go<00:01:56.869> through<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.109> bottom<00:01:57.289> and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
because they go through the bottom and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.959 
because they go through the bottom and
then<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:57.709> have<00:01:57.799> this<00:01:57.890> big<00:01:58.100> giant<00:01:58.369> calling<00:01:58.819> it

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
then you have this big giant calling it

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.270 
then you have this big giant calling it
this<00:01:59.719> huge<00:02:00.020> beautiful<00:02:00.319> calling<00:02:00.799> it<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.069> I<00:02:01.130> get

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
this huge beautiful calling it and I get

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.429 
this huge beautiful calling it and I get
kind<00:02:01.429> of<00:02:01.520> lost<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:01.939> it<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:02.719> I<00:02:02.750> was<00:02:02.899> lost<00:02:03.109> in<00:02:03.349> the

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
kind of lost in it so I was lost in the

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.139 
kind of lost in it so I was lost in the
car<00:02:03.619> net<00:02:03.799> for<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.009> while<00:02:04.130> eventually<00:02:04.429> gets<00:02:05.060> in

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
car net for a while eventually gets in

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:30.180 
car net for a while eventually gets in
the<00:02:05.240> middle

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.470 

copal<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.210> end<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.510> little<00:02:31.600> bit<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.940> then<00:02:37.330> it

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
copal the end a little bit and then it

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.850 
copal the end a little bit and then it
starts<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.960> get<00:02:38.050> more<00:02:38.110> interesting<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.770> you

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
starts to get more interesting and you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.820 
starts to get more interesting and you
have<00:02:39.010> kind<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.460> a<00:02:39.640> hole<00:02:40.630> with<00:02:41.050> dirt<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.560> stuff

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
have kind of a hole with dirt and stuff

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.200 
have kind of a hole with dirt and stuff
when<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.190> get<00:02:42.340> after<00:02:42.490> this<00:02:42.700> collar<00:02:42.940> net<00:02:43.120> you

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
when you get after this collar net you

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.640 
when you get after this collar net you
get<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.510> separation<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.230> get<00:02:44.440> kind<00:02:44.560> of

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
get the separation and you get kind of

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.290 
get the separation and you get kind of
Nokia<00:02:45.040> rest<00:02:45.220> but<00:02:45.400> you're<00:02:45.520> in<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:45.730> cave<00:02:46.060> and

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
Nokia rest but you're in this cave and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.270 
Nokia rest but you're in this cave and
you're<00:02:46.990> coming<00:02:47.230> off<00:02:47.440> kind<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.770> strange<00:02:48.070> and

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
you're coming off kind of strange and

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.980 
you're coming off kind of strange and
then<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.520> have<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.790> do<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.180> really<00:02:49.750> cool

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
then you have to do a really cool

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.450 
then you have to do a really cool
sequence<00:02:50.380> where<00:02:50.560> you're<00:02:50.740> going<00:02:50.980> up<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.310> right

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
sequence where you're going up and right

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.100 
sequence where you're going up and right
into<00:02:51.670> this<00:02:51.850> ledge<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.540> getting<00:02:52.840> with<00:02:52.960> these

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
into this ledge and getting with these

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.570 
into this ledge and getting with these
stalactites<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.770> then<00:02:53.920> traversing<00:02:54.430> this

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
stalactites and then traversing this

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.760 
stalactites and then traversing this
ramp<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.180> eventually<00:02:56.050> like<00:02:56.320> especially

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
ramp and eventually like especially

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.930 
ramp and eventually like especially
outside<00:02:56.920> it's<00:02:57.310> really<00:02:57.520> interesting<00:02:57.670> because

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
outside it's really interesting because

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.940 
outside it's really interesting because
it<00:02:58.210> was<00:02:58.240> no<00:02:58.480> really<00:02:58.840> not<00:02:59.230> chalk<00:02:59.530> everywhere

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
it was no really not chalk everywhere

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.800 
it was no really not chalk everywhere
just<00:03:00.160> some<00:03:00.310> marks<00:03:00.610> they<00:03:00.760> put<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.480> just<00:03:01.630> kind

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
just some marks they put it's just kind

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.540 
just some marks they put it's just kind
of<00:03:01.870> confusing<00:03:02.380> even<00:03:02.560> marks<00:03:02.950> on<00:03:03.100> holds<00:03:03.430> that

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
of confusing even marks on holds that

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.880 
of confusing even marks on holds that
weren't<00:03:03.730> really<00:03:03.910> good<00:03:04.150> ones<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.890> confusing

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
weren't really good ones and confusing

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.400 
weren't really good ones and confusing
and<00:03:06.040> then<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.340> eventually<00:03:06.490> go<00:03:07.120> left<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.720> down

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
and then you eventually go left and down

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.980 
and then you eventually go left and down
in<00:03:08.890> into<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:09.370> huge<00:03:09.610> ball<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.210> then<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.840> have

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990

in into this huge ball and then you have
to<00:03:11.110> go<00:03:11.260> out<00:03:11.500> again<00:03:11.830> after<00:03:12.100> you've<00:03:12.460> traversed

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
to go out again after you've traversed

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.120 
to go out again after you've traversed
you<00:03:13.420> have<00:03:13.600> this<00:03:13.690> big<00:03:13.930> stalactite<00:03:14.530> ball<00:03:14.890> thing

it's really powerful and I found a knee
bar<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.170> then<00:03:49.800> you<00:03:49.890> get<00:03:50.040> these<00:03:50.160> big<00:03:50.460> slippers

and in this big call Annette and then
that<00:03:53.760> was<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:53.940> point<00:03:54.150> when<00:03:54.360> I<00:03:54.390> realized<00:03:54.600> okay

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:05.040 
that was the point when I realized okay
I<00:03:55.140> think<00:03:55.290> I'm<00:03:55.530> gonna<00:03:55.620> make<00:03:55.830> it<00:03:56.010> maybe
