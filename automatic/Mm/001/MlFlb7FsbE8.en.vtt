when<00:00:44.700> i<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:44.910> reading<00:00:45.090> about<00:00:45.270> these<00:00:45.539> black<00:00:45.809> ops

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079

when i was reading about these black ops
fixes<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.710> glitches<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.250> stuff<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.520> they

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.459 
fixes and glitches and stuff that they
prevented<00:00:48.059> they<00:00:48.450> had<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.840> become<00:00:49.079> widespread

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
prevented they had not become widespread

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.319 
prevented they had not become widespread
and<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.280> were<00:00:50.340> already<00:00:50.730> getting<00:00:50.910> them<00:00:51.149> fixed

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and they were already getting them fixed

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.819 
and they were already getting them fixed
so<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.539> need<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.020> keep<00:00:52.199> coming<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
so we need that to keep coming and

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.500 
so we need that to keep coming and
informative<00:00:53.340> leaderboards<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.420> of

the things I miss from black ops then
I'm<00:00:56.640> sure<00:00:56.850> they'll<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.210> drop<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.570> there

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780

actually play in a competitive game hi

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.300 
actually play in a competitive game hi
or<00:04:45.660> maybe<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.230> know<00:04:46.350> he<00:04:46.560> has<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:47.010> but<00:04:47.250> he

or maybe you know he has that but he

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.070 
or maybe you know he has that but he
doesn't<00:04:47.640> have<00:04:47.670> and<00:04:48.000> he's<00:04:48.300> using<00:04:48.540> an<00:04:48.720> mp5

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
doesn't have and he's using an mp5

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.170 
doesn't have and he's using an mp5
instead<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.590> an<00:04:49.680> AK<00:04:49.920> 74<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:50.610> in<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:50.850> competitive

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
instead of an AK 74 you in a competitive

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.740 
instead of an AK 74 you in a competitive
game<00:04:51.510> and<00:04:51.750> that<00:04:52.140> just<00:04:52.410> stinks<00:04:52.620> for<00:04:52.830> him<00:04:53.010> so<00:04:53.750> um

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
game and that just stinks for him so um

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.020 
game and that just stinks for him so um
anyway<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.800> think<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.370> would<00:04:56.490> be<00:04:56.580> really<00:04:56.730> cool

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
anyway I think it would be really cool

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.750 
anyway I think it would be really cool
