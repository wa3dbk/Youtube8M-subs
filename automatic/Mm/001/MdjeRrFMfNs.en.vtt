00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
and roll away the biggest problem that I

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.750 
and roll away the biggest problem that I
had<00:01:17.410> with<00:01:17.560> learning<00:01:17.860> varial<00:01:18.160> kick<00:01:18.310> flips<00:01:18.520> was

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
had with learning varial kick flips was

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.570 
had with learning varial kick flips was
over<00:01:19.150> rotating<00:01:19.660> the<00:01:19.750> board<00:01:19.960> like<00:01:20.200> this<00:01:20.580> now

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
over rotating the board like this now

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.190 
over rotating the board like this now
there's<00:01:21.850> two<00:01:22.000> solutions<00:01:22.180> I<00:01:22.570> came<00:01:22.780> up<00:01:22.900> with<00:01:23.020> or

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
there's two solutions I came up with or

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.110 
there's two solutions I came up with or
fix<00:01:23.380> you<00:01:23.470> missed<00:01:23.650> one<00:01:24.280> move<00:01:24.670> your<00:01:24.850> front

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
fix you missed one move your front

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.430 
fix you missed one move your front
finger<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.600> towards<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.050> middle<00:01:26.260> of<00:01:26.350> the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
finger in towards the middle of the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.900 
finger in towards the middle of the
board<00:01:26.620> a<00:01:26.710> little<00:01:26.830> bit<00:01:26.980> more<00:01:27.250> I<00:01:27.490> found<00:01:27.820> that

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
board a little bit more I found that

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.250 
board a little bit more I found that
this<00:01:28.030> gives<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.360> a<00:01:28.390> lot<00:01:28.690> more<00:01:28.900> control<00:01:29.020> over

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
this gives you a lot more control over

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.780 
this gives you a lot more control over
the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.030 
the
flip<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.840> little<00:01:31.230> bit<00:01:31.350> slower<00:01:31.620> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
flip it just a little bit slower the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.350 
flip it just a little bit slower the
second<00:01:32.430> thing<00:01:32.550> that<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:32.730> found<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.180> really

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
second thing that I found that really

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.210 
second thing that I found that really
helps<00:01:33.750> me<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:34.050> using<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.350> wider<00:01:34.590> fingerboard

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
helps me was using a wider fingerboard

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.700 
helps me was using a wider fingerboard
this<00:01:35.730> is<00:01:35.940> a<00:01:35.970> thirty<00:01:36.300> two<00:01:36.540> millimeter<00:01:36.780> Burwood

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
this is a thirty two millimeter Burwood

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.470 
this is a thirty two millimeter Burwood
deck<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.160> you're<00:01:38.520> using<00:01:38.670> anything<00:01:38.970> skinnier

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
deck if you're using anything skinnier

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.000 
deck if you're using anything skinnier
than<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.960> recommend<00:01:40.440> trying<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.800> wider

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
than that I recommend trying a wider

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.320 
than that I recommend trying a wider
board<00:01:41.310> because<00:01:41.880> they<00:01:41.970> gives<00:01:42.120> you<00:01:42.180> more

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
board because they gives you more

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.000 
board because they gives you more
surface<00:01:42.570> area<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.380> probe<00:01:43.560> or<00:01:43.740> finger

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
surface area and then probe or finger

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.950 
surface area and then probe or finger
positions<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.610> mess<00:01:44.760> around<00:01:44.910> wider<00:01:45.660> boards

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
positions to mess around wider boards
