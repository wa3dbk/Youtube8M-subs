00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
title there and then they have a new

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.889 
title there and then they have a new
discipline<00:01:02.789> called<00:01:02.940> slopestyle<00:01:03.390> which<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
discipline called slopestyle which is

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.840 
discipline called slopestyle which is
basically<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.350> series<00:01:04.649> of<00:01:04.949> jumps<00:01:05.190> in<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.610> run

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
basically a series of jumps in one run

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.570 
basically a series of jumps in one run
right<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.830> I've<00:01:07.830> got<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.009> little<00:01:08.160> catching<00:01:08.340> up

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
right and I've got a little catching up

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.430 
right and I've got a little catching up
to<00:01:08.729> doing<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.149> but<00:01:09.330> I'm<00:01:09.479> which<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.259> two

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
to doing that but I'm which of the two

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.800 
to doing that but I'm which of the two
is<00:01:10.710> more<00:01:11.070> seminal<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> sport<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
is more seminal to the sport of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.080 
is more seminal to the sport of
snowboarding<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.830> halfpipe<00:01:14.039> or<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.759> slope

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
snowboarding the halfpipe or the slope

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.450 
snowboarding the halfpipe or the slope
so<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.600> mean<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.649> all<00:01:16.770> kind<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.070> Ridge<00:01:17.250> innate

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
so I mean they all kind of Ridge innate

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.660 
so I mean they all kind of Ridge innate
from<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> same<00:01:17.940> place<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.509> mean<00:01:19.670> snowboarding

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
from the same place I mean snowboarding

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.060 
from the same place I mean snowboarding
and<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.940> halfpipe<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.800> kind<00:01:23.039> of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
and the halfpipe you know it's kind of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.150 
and the halfpipe you know it's kind of
like<00:01:23.220> surfing<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.940> wave<00:01:23.970> or<00:01:25.009> skateboarding<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
like surfing a wave or skateboarding a

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.219 
like surfing a wave or skateboarding a
pool<00:01:26.580> or<00:01:26.789> something<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.300> so<00:01:28.020> they<00:01:28.110> all

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
pool or something like that so they all

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.770 
pool or something like that so they all
kind<00:01:28.440> of<00:01:28.500> tie<00:01:28.679> in<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.700> think<00:01:30.090> jumping<00:01:30.720> is

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
kind of tie in but I think jumping is

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.570 
kind of tie in but I think jumping is
just<00:01:30.960> jumping<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.500> think<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.039> think<00:01:32.250> Evel

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
just jumping I think we think Evel

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.440 
just jumping I think we think Evel
Knievel<00:01:32.940> for<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:34.369> but<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.700> terms<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
Knievel for that but in terms of the the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.510 
Knievel for that but in terms of the the
slope<00:01:36.690> style<00:01:36.899> that<00:01:37.319> almost<00:01:37.800> is<00:01:37.979> reminiscent

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
slope style that almost is reminiscent

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.900 
slope style that almost is reminiscent
of<00:01:38.670> early<00:01:39.410> skateboarding<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.640> rails

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
of early skateboarding you know rails

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.880 
of early skateboarding you know rails
and<00:01:42.209> stuff<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.660> that<00:01:42.899> building<00:01:43.440> what<00:01:43.619> John's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and stuff like that building what John's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.010 
and stuff like that building what John's
yeah<00:01:44.190> things<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.550> that<00:01:44.759> uh<00:01:44.819> have<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.929> ever

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
yeah things like that uh have you ever

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.150 
yeah things like that uh have you ever
thought<00:01:46.170> about<00:01:46.319> working<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.830> that<00:01:47.039> you're

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
thought about working on that you're

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.260 
thought about working on that you're
working<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.489> the<00:01:47.580> halfpipe<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.000> ever<00:01:48.119> thought

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
working on the halfpipe I ever thought

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.880 
working on the halfpipe I ever thought
about<00:01:48.390> working<00:01:48.690> on<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> full<00:01:49.020> pipe<00:01:49.229> because

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
about working on the full pipe because

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.430 
about working on the full pipe because
then<00:01:50.130> you'd<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.459> something<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.959> is<00:01:52.200> why<00:01:52.410> I

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
then you'd have something this is why I

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.389 
then you'd have something this is why I

tired of answering but a snowboarding or

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.789 
tired of answering but a snowboarding or
a<00:03:42.519> skateboarding<00:03:43.329> which<00:03:44.139> came<00:03:44.379> first<00:03:44.560> for<00:03:44.709> you

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
a skateboarding which came first for you

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.170 
a skateboarding which came first for you
probably<00:03:45.069> skateboarding<00:03:45.669> came<00:03:45.819> first<00:03:46.090> for

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
probably skateboarding came first for

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.589 
probably skateboarding came first for
you<00:03:46.299> right<00:03:46.889> it<00:03:47.889> did<00:03:48.159> actually<00:03:48.419> just<00:03:49.419> cuz<00:03:49.540> I

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
you right it did actually just cuz I

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.149 
you right it did actually just cuz I
could<00:03:49.750> go<00:03:49.840> out<00:03:49.959> in<00:03:50.079> front<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.469> a<00:03:50.530> house<00:03:50.709> and

which now is more satisfying you know to

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.589 
which now is more satisfying you know to
be<00:03:54.010> honest<00:03:54.280> it's<00:03:54.430> both<00:03:54.639> that's<00:03:54.939> why<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.150> do<00:03:55.239> both

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
be honest it's both that's why I do both

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.690 
be honest it's both that's why I do both
