well there is a location mark on these
control<00:01:44.720> arms<00:01:45.200> on<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.440> shaft<00:01:45.740> here<00:01:46.100> there's<00:01:46.940> a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
control arms on the shaft here there's a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.160 
control arms on the shaft here there's a
hole<00:01:47.450> in<00:01:48.670> this<00:01:49.670> cross<00:01:50.000> shaft<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.690> lines<00:01:50.960> up

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
hole in this cross shaft that lines up

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.050 
hole in this cross shaft that lines up
with<00:01:51.229> a<00:01:51.410> hole<00:01:51.710> in<00:01:51.980> the<00:01:52.070> backside<00:01:52.490> of<00:01:52.670> this<00:01:52.760> here

push through and you can just start the

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.389 
push through and you can just start the
nuts<00:02:07.660> all<00:02:08.660> right<00:02:08.959> once<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:09.920> got<00:02:10.130> all<00:02:10.160> the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
freely so you can line up the dowel pins

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.410 
freely so you can line up the dowel pins
or<00:02:19.010> whatever<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.310> want<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.489> call<00:02:19.670> them<00:02:19.910> before

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
you tighten up the lower control arm so

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.610 
you tighten up the lower control arm so
that<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.640> there's<00:02:23.209> no<00:02:23.330> question<00:02:23.870> whether<00:02:24.470> or

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
will know have a reference point so he

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:51.569 
will know have a reference point so he
didn't<00:02:43.670> have<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.850> start<00:02:44.030> from<00:02:44.120> scratch<00:02:44.390> either

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.369 

as<00:02:52.579> usual<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.150> didn't<00:02:53.420> read<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.720> instructions

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
as usual I didn't read the instructions

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.220 
as usual I didn't read the instructions
so<00:02:54.739> you<00:02:55.489> probably<00:02:56.060> saw<00:02:56.299> that<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.540> had<00:02:56.629> my<00:02:56.989> ball

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
so you probably saw that I had my ball

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.309 
so you probably saw that I had my ball
joints<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:58.390> within<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.599> control<00:02:59.930> arm<00:03:00.140> like

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
joints in within the control arm like

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.770 
joints in within the control arm like
this<00:03:00.349> which<00:03:00.890> is<00:03:01.069> not<00:03:01.280> correct<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.390> had<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:02.689> go

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
this which is not correct so I had to go

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.539 
this which is not correct so I had to go
back<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.170> read<00:03:03.349> the<00:03:03.470> instructions<00:03:04.129> after

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
back and read the instructions after

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.899 
back and read the instructions after
some<00:03:04.849> mockery<00:03:05.750> from<00:03:06.019> my<00:03:06.140> coworkers<00:03:06.379> now<00:03:07.189> the

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
some mockery from my coworkers now the

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.030 
some mockery from my coworkers now the
ball<00:03:08.750> joint<00:03:09.019> goes<00:03:09.200> in<00:03:09.379> like<00:03:09.560> this<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:09.799> my

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
ball joint goes in like this and my

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.679 
ball joint goes in like this and my
control<00:03:10.370> arm<00:03:10.579> needs<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.849> be<00:03:10.970> like<00:03:11.120> this<00:03:11.359> so

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:11.689 
control arm needs to be like this so

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.229 
control arm needs to be like this so
it's<00:03:12.170> it's<00:03:12.530> an<00:03:12.650> easy<00:03:12.829> thing<00:03:13.129> to<00:03:13.189> fix<00:03:13.489> but<00:03:13.879> it

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
it's it's an easy thing to fix but it

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.479 
it's it's an easy thing to fix but it
won't<00:03:14.420> be<00:03:14.569> able<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.109> I<00:03:15.560> won't<00:03:16.040> be<00:03:16.189> able<00:03:16.310> to

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
won't be able to I won't be able to

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.210 
won't be able to I won't be able to
re-inflate<00:03:16.970> my<00:03:17.180> ego<00:03:17.659> very<00:03:17.870> easily<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:18.650> this<00:03:19.040> is

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
re-inflate my ego very easily so this is

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.860 
re-inflate my ego very easily so this is
the<00:03:19.340> correct<00:03:19.670> way<00:03:19.879> to<00:03:19.909> put<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.239> ball<00:03:20.359> joint<00:03:20.690> in

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
the correct way to put the ball joint in

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.259 
the correct way to put the ball joint in
in<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.230> correct<00:03:21.500> way<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:22.489> have<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.879> control

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
in the correct way to have the control

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.960 
in the correct way to have the control
arm<00:03:23.450> positioned<00:03:25.989> this<00:03:26.989> is<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.260> 3/8<00:03:28.129> by<00:03:28.280> 3/4<00:03:28.790> boat

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
arm positioned this is a 3/8 by 3/4 boat

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.330 
arm positioned this is a 3/8 by 3/4 boat
and<00:03:29.150> goes<00:03:29.269> right<00:03:29.510> up<00:03:29.690> into<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.109> bottom<00:03:30.889> of<00:03:31.069> the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
and goes right up into the bottom of the

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.679 
and goes right up into the bottom of the
air<00:03:32.000> spring<00:03:32.569> and<00:03:34.090> probably<00:03:35.090> if<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.239> had<00:03:35.389> a

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:35.689 
air spring and probably if you had a

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.720 
air spring and probably if you had a
brain<00:03:36.230> you'd<00:03:36.260> be<00:03:36.739> using<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.099> jack<00:03:37.370> right<00:03:37.609> now

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
brain you'd be using a jack right now

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.940 
brain you'd be using a jack right now
because<00:03:37.939> it's<00:03:38.180> really<00:03:38.450> very<00:03:38.959> hard<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.560> lift<00:03:39.769> up

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
because it's really very hard to lift up

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.259 
because it's really very hard to lift up
with<00:03:40.040> your<00:03:40.099> legs<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.730> I'm<00:03:40.849> going<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.030> go<00:03:41.120> get

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
with your legs so I'm going to go get

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:48.220 
with your legs so I'm going to go get
one<00:03:43.840> Jack<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:46.150> assembly<00:03:47.150> up<00:03:47.329> so<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:47.930> can<00:03:48.109> get

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
one Jack this assembly up so I can get

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.220 
one Jack this assembly up so I can get
the<00:03:48.409> bolt<00:03:48.620> started<00:03:49.250> for<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.060> lower<00:03:50.389> air

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
the bolt started for the lower air

00:03:51.230 --> 00:04:05.760 
the bolt started for the lower air
spring<00:03:51.859> mount

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:16.479 

all<00:04:06.340> right<00:04:07.380> bolts<00:04:08.400> for<00:04:09.400> that<00:04:09.520> went<00:04:09.910> right<00:04:10.120> in

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.120 

same<00:04:17.150> as<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.449> lower<00:04:17.630> control<00:04:17.930> arm<00:04:18.440> will<00:04:18.919> use<00:04:19.100> a

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
same as the lower control arm will use a

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.789 
same as the lower control arm will use a
large<00:04:19.729> flat<00:04:20.060> washer<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:21.049> a<00:04:21.109> lock<00:04:21.139> nut<00:04:21.560> on<00:04:21.590> the

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
large flat washer and a lock nut on the

large flat washer and a lock nut on the
upper<00:04:24.610> one<00:04:25.610> of<00:04:25.729> the<00:04:25.819> things<00:04:26.060> I've<00:04:26.270> learned

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
upper one of the things I've learned

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.890 
upper one of the things I've learned
being<00:04:27.410> around<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.830> shop<00:04:28.180> for<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.240> while<00:04:29.360> is

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
being around the shop for a while is

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.059 
being around the shop for a while is
that<00:04:30.259> if<00:04:30.500> you<00:04:30.650> over<00:04:30.889> tighten<00:04:31.160> these<00:04:31.599> nuts<00:04:32.599> up

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:33.069 
that if you over tighten these nuts up

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.770 
that if you over tighten these nuts up
it<00:04:34.069> costs<00:04:34.460> some<00:04:34.610> binding<00:04:35.030> in<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.210> suspension

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
it costs some binding in the suspension

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.870 
it costs some binding in the suspension
travel<00:04:35.990> here<00:04:36.319> so<00:04:36.500> don't<00:04:36.979> use<00:04:37.160> an<00:04:37.310> impact<00:04:37.610> on

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
that you you find out what the torque

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
you over tighten these it'll do nothing

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.120
