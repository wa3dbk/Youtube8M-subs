I<00:00:14.880> mean<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.330> tropical<00:00:15.719> fruit<00:00:16.320> yes<00:00:17.250> yeah

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
I mean it's a tropical fruit yes yeah

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.670 
I mean it's a tropical fruit yes yeah
but<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.060> seems<00:00:18.270> like<00:00:18.420> these<00:00:18.539> clients<00:00:19.289> are<00:00:19.380> more

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
but it seems like these clients are more

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.130 
but it seems like these clients are more
of<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.800> bush<00:00:20.220> than<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.609> tree<00:00:20.910> or<00:00:21.180> can<00:00:21.689> be<00:00:21.840> pruned

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
of a bush than a tree or can be pruned

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.200 
of a bush than a tree or can be pruned
they<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:22.769> be<00:00:22.890> held<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.490> about<00:00:23.730> any<00:00:23.970> size

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
they can be held in to about any size

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.970 
they can be held in to about any size
that<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.570> want<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.260> they<00:00:25.500> probably<00:00:25.769> will

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
that you want and they probably will

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.250 
that you want and they probably will
never<00:00:26.189> fall<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.670> massive<00:00:27.210> tree<00:00:27.570> okay<00:00:28.050> we'll

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
never fall in a massive tree okay we'll

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.140 
never fall in a massive tree okay we'll
get<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> fairly<00:00:29.070> good-sized<00:00:29.429> tree<00:00:29.789> if<00:00:29.970> you

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
get to a fairly good-sized tree if you

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.849 
get to a fairly good-sized tree if you
if<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.510> trim<00:00:30.750> them<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.050> way<00:00:31.199> but<00:00:31.740> they're

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
if you trim them that way but they're

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.500 
if you trim them that way but they're
easy<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.219> keep<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> bush<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.210> prefer

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510

well the varieties are usually named

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.770 
well the varieties are usually named
according<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> color<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.270> fruit<00:01:12.510> in

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
common but those are the three main ones

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.749 
common but those are the three main ones
that<00:01:25.110> most<00:01:25.380> people<00:01:25.619> are<00:01:25.710> looking<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.490> how

that most people are looking for and how
do<00:01:26.820> they<00:01:26.970> take<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> cold<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.630> allocate<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
do they take the cold and allocate the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.590 
do they take the cold and allocate the
heat<00:01:28.400> they<00:01:29.400> don't<00:01:29.579> want<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> get<00:01:29.939> too<00:01:30.119> terribly

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
heat they don't want to get too terribly

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.170 
heat they don't want to get too terribly
cold<00:01:30.950> but<00:01:31.950> they're<00:01:32.100> not<00:01:32.220> real<00:01:32.520> sensitive<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
cold but they're not real sensitive to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
extremely tough tree I've got one in my

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.200 
extremely tough tree I've got one in my
backyard<00:01:39.530> that<00:01:40.530> lost<00:01:40.829> its<00:01:41.159> leaves<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.909> died

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
backyard that lost its leaves and died

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
backyard that lost its leaves and died
back<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> ground<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.350> about<00:01:43.439> three<00:01:43.770> years

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
back to the ground for about three years

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.760 
back to the ground for about three years
in<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.250> row<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.119> came<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.200> back<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.590> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
in a row and came right back up and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.830 
in a row and came right back up and
produced<00:01:46.979> fruit<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> very<00:01:47.670> next<00:01:47.909> year<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
produced fruit the very next year and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.630 
produced fruit the very next year and
this<00:01:49.079> year<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.500> didn't<00:01:49.829> died<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.159> back<00:01:50.340> down<00:01:50.610> so

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
this year it didn't died it back down so

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
this year it didn't died it back down so
we<00:01:50.909> didn't<00:01:51.180> get<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.420> big<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.899> freeze<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
we didn't get that big of a freeze and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.460 
we didn't get that big of a freeze and
it's<00:01:53.399> six<00:01:53.670> feet<00:01:53.820> tall<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.140> real

it's six feet tall so it's a it's a real

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.709 
it's six feet tall so it's a it's a real

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
strongly growing tree here I can trim it

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.569 
strongly growing tree here I can trim it
down<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.170> any<00:01:58.290> size<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.860> want<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.310> keep<00:01:59.430> it

if<00:02:02.509> we're<00:02:02.719> gonna<00:02:02.810> get<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.049> hard<00:02:03.229> frost<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.770> want

if we're gonna get a hard frost you want

if we're gonna get a hard frost you want
to<00:02:04.009> protect<00:02:04.310> them<00:02:04.460> just<00:02:05.240> because<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.600> don't

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
to protect them just because you don't

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.149 
to protect them just because you don't
want<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.960> waste<00:02:06.109> the<00:02:06.289> time<00:02:06.319> with<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:06.829> growing

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
want to waste the time with it growing

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.639 
want to waste the time with it growing
back<00:02:07.340> next<00:02:07.609> year<00:02:07.789> if<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.569> choose<00:02:08.840> not<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.110> you

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
back next year if you choose not to you

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.670 
back next year if you choose not to you
can't<00:02:09.920> do<00:02:10.129> it<00:02:10.250> that's<00:02:10.519> fine<00:02:10.610> it'll<00:02:11.060> grow<00:02:11.239> back

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
can't do it that's fine it'll grow back

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.520 
can't do it that's fine it'll grow back
but<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:13.280> does<00:02:13.580> exceptionally<00:02:14.299> well<00:02:14.510> in<00:02:14.959> our

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
but it does exceptionally well in our

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.509 
but it does exceptionally well in our
very<00:02:16.160> bright<00:02:16.549> exposed<00:02:17.239> Sun<00:02:18.140> here<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.310> can

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
very bright exposed Sun here so it can

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.089 
very bright exposed Sun here so it can
handle<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:20.000> lot<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.360> Sun<00:02:20.599> and<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.650> not<00:02:21.830> nearly

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
handle a lot of Sun and it's not nearly

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.070 
handle a lot of Sun and it's not nearly
as<00:02:22.310> water<00:02:22.849> sensitive<00:02:23.390> there's<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.810> lot<00:02:23.959> of

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
as water sensitive there's a lot of

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.750 
as water sensitive there's a lot of
other<00:02:24.200> plants<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:24.980> can<00:02:25.129> handle<00:02:25.310> just<00:02:25.610> a

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
other plants so it can handle just a

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.550 
other plants so it can handle just a
little<00:02:26.030> bit<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.209> drought<00:02:26.420> okay<00:02:27.049> it's<00:02:27.349> not<00:02:27.530> a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.539 
cactus it's not a Palo Verde
Ironwood<00:02:29.930> no<00:02:30.349> it's<00:02:30.500> not<00:02:30.650> an<00:02:30.769> Ironwood<00:02:31.250> tree

Ironwood no it's not an Ironwood tree

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.039 
Ironwood no it's not an Ironwood tree
but<00:02:31.849> it<00:02:31.940> can<00:02:32.090> handle<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.450> little<00:02:32.629> bit<00:02:32.870> more

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
but it can handle a little bit more

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.360 
but it can handle a little bit more
drought<00:02:33.349> than<00:02:33.560> most<00:02:33.739> of<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:33.980> other<00:02:34.160> tropical

Wow<00:02:37.220> good<00:02:37.940> question<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.660> me<00:02:38.840> it's<00:02:39.349> got<00:02:39.590> a

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
spongy almost icy texture to it it's not

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.190 
spongy almost icy texture to it it's not
real<00:02:43.519> substantial<00:02:44.150> it's<00:02:44.329> not<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> heavy<00:02:44.780> fruit

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200
