00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.209
 good three attached to a good new video 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.910
 new final fantasy gameplays 15 

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:11.730
 You can see quite a lot of the game 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.280
 the gameplay basically because it's a demo 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.890
 we could say of I think it's going to be the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.529
 demo that we are going to have in the end 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.029
 fantasy type-0 hd if I'm not wrong that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.800
 the games in March if I do not go back to 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.810
 wrong I have a lot of fucking things 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.099
 in the head how can I be wrong 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.749
 forgive basically in the description 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.189
 you will have a couple of videos one of a 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:34.410
 hour and forty and another 42 minutes I've 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.660
 seen the 42 minutes this big part 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.820
 of that I recommend a lot to see it because it's 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.160
 the demo was being cool 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.019
 this is running on a play 4 the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.560
 up can be running an xbox not 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:49.100
 I know I'm not very sure 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.460
 and well, basically, in the demo 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.380
 we can see how it is done at night in the 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.140
 night we can see the world so open 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.330
 that we will have the battle system on 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.520
 battle system by the way I find 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.880
 quite familiar not for all those who 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.300
 you are used to games 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.300
 common 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.460
 like kingdom hearts and others I think that 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.259
 everyone is given all that public then 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.360
 I think you will like the game 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.909
 because I think he sees a lot of that 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.890
 system and others I think I'm going to 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.740
 nomura wanted there then to put 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.759
 quite a lot of before going to 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.380
 develop kingdom hearts 3 the gameplay 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.810
 as I say it is pretty cool 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.610
 the game leads us to have a downgrade 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.610
 or what but graphically is also 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.380
 pretty christian for what it offers 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.450
 to be such a large and large world and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.149
 others the particles and everything because they are 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.380
 very well done in the battle mode of 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.240
 I think it's going to be a game 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.189
 pretty good if you just watching the demos 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.140
 it's already impressive to see the final game is going to 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.880
 be a real wonder as I say 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.579
 I invite you to go through the gameplay 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.780
 if you do not have a better coffee obviously and 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.490
 you take a look so good 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.179
 nothing more guys see you in the next 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.179
