hey<00:00:08.340> uh<00:00:08.370> boo<00:00:08.760> hi<00:00:09.660> Priya<00:00:10.580> witnesses<00:00:12.139> this<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.320> a

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
hey uh boo hi Priya witnesses this is a

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.720 
hey uh boo hi Priya witnesses this is a
number<00:00:13.710> chart<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.190> made<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:14.610> myself

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
number chart that I made for myself

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.470 
number chart that I made for myself
let's<00:00:15.570> learn<00:00:15.809> numbers<00:00:16.320> from<00:00:16.680> 21<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.550> 50<00:00:17.970> so

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
let's learn numbers from 21 to 50 so

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.300 
let's learn numbers from 21 to 50 so
that<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.900> two<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.590> make<00:00:19.740> such<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> chart

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
that you two can make such a chart

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.730 
that you two can make such a chart
before<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.640> start<00:00:23.939> learning<00:00:24.300> numbers<00:00:24.660> from<00:00:25.230> 21

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
before we start learning numbers from 21

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.759 
before we start learning numbers from 21
to<00:00:25.920> 50<00:00:26.340> let's<00:00:27.269> brush<00:00:27.599> up<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.230> numbers<00:00:28.590> we

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
to 50 let's brush up on the numbers we

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.370 
to 50 let's brush up on the numbers we
had<00:00:28.859> learned<00:00:29.099> earlier<00:00:30.230> okay

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
had learned earlier okay

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.900 
had learned earlier okay
now<00:00:31.759> let<00:00:32.759> me<00:00:32.790> draw<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.239> bunch<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.630> grapes

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.330 

so<00:00:36.810> how<00:00:37.230> many<00:00:37.290> grapes<00:00:37.680> are<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.220> this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
so how many grapes are there in this

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.040 
so how many grapes are there in this
bunch<00:00:38.640> let's<00:00:39.450> count<00:00:39.780> them<00:00:40.010> one<00:00:41.600> two<00:00:43.400> three

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
bunch let's count them one two three

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:54.580 
bunch let's count them one two three
four<00:00:46.430> five<00:00:47.900> six<00:00:49.580> seven<00:00:50.580> eight<00:00:51.080> nine<00:00:52.310> and<00:00:53.310> ten

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
four five six seven eight nine and ten

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
four five six seven eight nine and ten
so<00:00:55.590> now<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.860> know<00:00:56.130> there<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.580> ten<00:00:57.120> grapes<00:00:57.450> in

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
so now we know there are ten grapes in

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
so now we know there are ten grapes in
this<00:00:57.960> bunch<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.290> grapes<00:00:59.480> that<00:01:00.480> means<00:01:00.810> these

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
this bunch of grapes that means these

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.560 
this bunch of grapes that means these
grapes<00:01:02.070> are<00:01:02.220> 1/10<00:01:03.120> now<00:01:04.110> let<00:01:04.650> me<00:01:04.770> draw<00:01:05.040> 3<00:01:05.729> single

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
grapes are 1/10 now let me draw 3 single

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.700 
grapes are 1/10 now let me draw 3 single
grapes<00:01:07.100> 1<00:01:09.050> 2<00:01:10.490> 3

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
grapes 1 2 3

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.170 
grapes 1 2 3
let<00:01:13.710> us<00:01:13.860> write<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:15.229> 3<00:01:16.580> okay<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.060> have

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
let us write this is 3 okay so we have

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.580 
let us write this is 3 okay so we have
three<00:01:18.509> grapes<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:19.170> which<00:01:19.800> means<00:01:20.160> 3<00:01:20.940> ones<00:01:21.590> now

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
three grapes here which means 3 ones now

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.780 
three grapes here which means 3 ones now
how<00:01:22.830> many<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.190> have<00:01:23.300> it<00:01:24.300> can<00:01:24.540> be<00:01:24.660> written<00:01:24.869> as

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
how many do we have it can be written as

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.359 
how many do we have it can be written as
tens<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:28.190> ones<00:01:29.190> so<00:01:29.729> under<00:01:30.030> tens<00:01:30.410> we<00:01:31.410> have<00:01:31.650> one

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
tens and ones so under tens we have one

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.830 
tens and ones so under tens we have one
under<00:01:33.300> ones<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.500> three<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.600> have

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
under ones here we have three so we have

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.770 
under ones here we have three so we have
in<00:01:37.110> total<00:01:37.710> 13<00:01:38.610> grapes<00:01:38.970> here

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.640 

let<00:01:42.590> us<00:01:42.740> denote<00:01:42.980> a<00:01:43.340> 10<00:01:43.810> with<00:01:44.810> this<00:01:45.020> circle<00:01:45.500> as

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
let us denote a 10 with this circle as

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.470 
let us denote a 10 with this circle as
we<00:01:46.130> had<00:01:46.250> done<00:01:46.400> in<00:01:46.460> our<00:01:46.670> earlier<00:01:47.060> videos

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
we had done in our earlier videos

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.880 
we had done in our earlier videos
remember<00:01:48.470> when<00:01:48.740> we<00:01:48.860> learned<00:01:49.040> numbers<00:01:49.520> till<00:01:49.730> 20

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
remember when we learned numbers till 20

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.990 
remember when we learned numbers till 20
let's<00:01:51.890> write<00:01:52.160> it<00:01:52.280> here<00:01:53.260> so<00:01:54.260> this<00:01:54.500> circle<00:01:56.050> plus

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
let's write it here so this circle plus

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.640 
let's write it here so this circle plus
another<00:01:59.000> circle<00:01:59.860> is<00:02:00.860> 1<00:02:01.220> 10<00:02:01.490> plus<00:02:02.270> another<00:02:03.260> 10

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
another circle is 1 10 plus another 10

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.490 
another circle is 1 10 plus another 10
equals<00:02:05.320> 20

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
equals 20

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.250 
equals 20
that<00:02:07.130> is<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:08.000> number<00:02:08.330> twenty<00:02:08.750> is<00:02:09.399> two<00:02:10.399> tens

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
that is the number twenty is two tens

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.510 
that is the number twenty is two tens
okay<00:02:12.260> now<00:02:12.410> let's<00:02:12.620> move<00:02:12.860> up<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.280> more<00:02:13.490> than

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
okay now let's move up to more than

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.430 
okay now let's move up to more than
twenty<00:02:13.970> grapes<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:16.489> let's<00:02:16.700> try<00:02:17.030> here<00:02:17.540> circle

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
twenty grapes so let's try here circle

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:27.520 
twenty grapes so let's try here circle
plus<00:02:19.750> circle<00:02:21.280> plus<00:02:23.050> one<00:02:24.050> grape<00:02:25.390> equals<00:02:26.530> we

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
plus circle plus one grape equals we

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.770 
plus circle plus one grape equals we
already<00:02:27.920> know<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.610> circle<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.150> ten<00:02:29.480> so

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
already know that this circle is ten so

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.290 
already know that this circle is ten so
that's<00:02:29.930> another<00:02:30.200> ten<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.739> plus<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:32.030> grape

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
that's another ten and plus one grape

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.729 
that's another ten and plus one grape
let's<00:02:32.570> write<00:02:32.780> this<00:02:32.930> is<00:02:33.080> some<00:02:33.410> ten<00:02:34.280> plus<00:02:35.270> ten

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
let's write this is some ten plus ten

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.270 
let's write this is some ten plus ten
plus<00:02:36.739> one<00:02:37.310> grape<00:02:38.200> equals<00:02:39.580> 21

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
plus one grape equals 21

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.990 
plus one grape equals 21
let's<00:02:43.120> try<00:02:43.300> another<00:02:43.450> one<00:02:44.220> ten<00:02:45.810> plus<00:02:46.810> ten<00:02:48.000> plus

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
let's try another one ten plus ten plus

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.600 
let's try another one ten plus ten plus
two<00:02:49.840> delicious<00:02:50.680> grapes<00:02:51.870> equals<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:54.250> know<00:02:54.370> this

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
two delicious grapes equals we know this

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
two delicious grapes equals we know this
is<00:02:54.820> ten<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:56.260> know<00:02:56.380> this<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.740> another<00:02:57.010> ten<00:02:57.630> this

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
is ten you know this is another ten this

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.700 
is ten you know this is another ten this
is<00:02:58.810> one<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.380> this<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.010> two<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.750> that's<00:03:02.020> ten

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
is one and this is two so that's ten

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:12.810 
is one and this is two so that's ten
plus<00:03:03.490> ten<00:03:04.410> plus<00:03:05.490> two<00:03:06.490> grapes<00:03:07.170> equals<00:03:09.270> 22<00:03:11.820> so

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
plus ten plus two grapes equals 22 so

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.690 
plus ten plus two grapes equals 22 so
what<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.240> a<00:03:13.510> circle<00:03:14.140> we<00:03:14.920> know<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.220> circle<00:03:15.610> is

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
what is a circle we know the circle is

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.070 
what is a circle we know the circle is
ten<00:03:15.970> plus<00:03:16.600> three<00:03:17.400> grapes<00:03:18.540> one<00:03:19.540> two<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.860> three

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
ten plus three grapes one two and three

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.990 
ten plus three grapes one two and three
plus<00:03:23.190> another<00:03:24.190> circle<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:25.300> tens<00:03:25.630> equals<00:03:27.000> now

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
plus another circle of tens equals now

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.780 
plus another circle of tens equals now
as<00:03:28.300> you<00:03:28.450> can<00:03:28.600> see<00:03:28.810> here<00:03:29.140> we<00:03:29.380> have<00:03:29.620> two<00:03:30.459> tens

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
as you can see here we have two tens

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.220 
as you can see here we have two tens
there's<00:03:31.060> one<00:03:31.300> here<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:31.750> there's<00:03:31.840> one<00:03:32.530> here

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
there's one here and there's one here

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.660 
there's one here and there's one here
now<00:03:35.230> let<00:03:35.410> me<00:03:35.530> write<00:03:35.680> down<00:03:35.740> the<00:03:36.010> place<00:03:36.250> values

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
now let me write down the place values

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.150 
now let me write down the place values
here<00:03:36.910> that's<00:03:37.840> tens<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:39.240> ones<00:03:40.350> now<00:03:41.350> we<00:03:41.410> have<00:03:41.950> a

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
here that's tens and ones now we have a

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.030 
here that's tens and ones now we have a
circle<00:03:42.940> here<00:03:43.240> that<00:03:44.230> is<00:03:44.470> 1/10<00:03:45.900> we<00:03:46.900> have<00:03:47.140> another

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
circle here that is 1/10 we have another

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.910 
circle here that is 1/10 we have another
10<00:03:48.430> here

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
10 here

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.180 
10 here
so<00:03:50.550> we<00:03:50.700> have<00:03:50.850> two<00:03:51.270> tens<00:03:51.710> so<00:03:52.710> now<00:03:52.830> we<00:03:52.890> go<00:03:53.160> back

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
so we have two tens so now we go back

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.790 
so we have two tens so now we go back
and<00:03:53.730> we<00:03:54.510> see<00:03:54.810> we<00:03:55.350> have<00:03:55.590> three<00:03:56.400> single<00:03:57.270> grapes

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
and we see we have three single grapes

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.180 
and we see we have three single grapes
so<00:03:58.800> we<00:03:59.100> write<00:03:59.280> three<00:03:59.910> ones<00:04:00.540> here<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:01.190> let's

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
so we write three ones here so let's

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.190 
so we write three ones here so let's
write<00:04:02.490> that<00:04:02.520> down<00:04:02.760> what's<00:04:03.300> two<00:04:03.600> tens<00:04:03.900> plus

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
write that down what's two tens plus

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.720 
write that down what's two tens plus
three<00:04:04.590> ones<00:04:04.970> that's<00:04:06.410> 23<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.709> think<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.520> should

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
three ones that's 23 I think you should

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.000 
three ones that's 23 I think you should
have<00:04:08.850> seen<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.090> pattern<00:04:09.390> here<00:04:09.860> try<00:04:10.860> and

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
have seen a pattern here try and

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.160 
have seen a pattern here try and
complete<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.490> numbers<00:04:11.880> till<00:04:12.209> 29<00:04:12.690> yourself

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
complete the numbers till 29 yourself

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.800 
complete the numbers till 29 yourself
keep<00:04:13.860> adding<00:04:14.280> one<00:04:14.670> more<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.330> previous

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
keep adding one more to the previous

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.200 
keep adding one more to the previous
number
