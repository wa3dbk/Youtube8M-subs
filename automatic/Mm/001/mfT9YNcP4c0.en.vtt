all right and the soulard video card on

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.870 
all right and the soulard video card on
my<00:01:48.659> list<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> nvidia<00:01:49.439> gtx<00:01:49.829> 650ti<00:01:50.399> i<00:01:50.700> just

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
my list is the nvidia gtx 650ti i just

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.789 
my list is the nvidia gtx 650ti i just
think<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.090> 650<00:01:51.570> TI<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> best<00:01:52.170> nvidia<00:01:52.560> card

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
think the 650 TI is the best nvidia card

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.830 
think the 650 TI is the best nvidia card
that's<00:01:52.950> out<00:01:53.070> right<00:01:53.220> now<00:01:53.399> um<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:54.390> know<00:01:54.659> this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that's out right now um I know this

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.340 
that's out right now um I know this
thing's<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.560> 660<00:01:56.189> ti<00:01:56.340> 670<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.240> their<00:01:57.780> prices

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
thing's like 660 ti 670 but their prices

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.690 
thing's like 660 ti 670 but their prices
don't<00:01:58.500> match<00:01:58.740> their<00:01:59.009> performance<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.579> think

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
don't match their performance I think

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.670 
don't match their performance I think
the<00:02:00.000> 650<00:02:00.479> Ti<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:00.780> really<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.079> only<00:02:01.200> card<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
the 650 Ti was really the only card that

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.370 
the 650 Ti was really the only card that
matches<00:02:01.950> price<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.579> performance<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.659> 660<00:02:04.200> ti

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
matches price to performance the 660 ti

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.709 
matches price to performance the 660 ti
gets<00:02:04.619> beat<00:02:04.829> by<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.040> 7870<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.060> midi<00:02:06.240> occasions

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
gets beat by the 7870 in midi occasions

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.229 
gets beat by the 7870 in midi occasions
because<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.020> 7870<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.910> two<00:02:09.090> hundred

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
because the 7870 it's like two hundred

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.839 
because the 7870 it's like two hundred
dollars<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.869> 660<00:02:10.560> ti<00:02:10.739> was<00:02:10.890> like<00:02:10.979> 270<00:02:11.670> so

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
dollars and the 660 ti was like 270 so

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.559 
dollars and the 660 ti was like 270 so
there's

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
there's

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.130 
there's
a<00:02:12.829> disparity<00:02:13.829> there<00:02:14.159> so<00:02:14.459> um<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.019> was

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
a disparity there so um like I was

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.720 
a disparity there so um like I was
saying<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.409> 650<00:02:16.829> Ti<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.010> really<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.340> think<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
saying the 650 Ti is really I think the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.789 
saying the 650 Ti is really I think the
only<00:02:17.969> nvidia<00:02:18.810> card<00:02:19.019> that's<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.290> lied<00:02:19.439> with<00:02:19.650> its

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
only nvidia card that's it lied with its

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.080 
only nvidia card that's it lied with its
price<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> know<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.489> lot<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.730> people<00:02:20.819> are

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
price and I know a lot of people are

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.910 
price and I know a lot of people are
afraid<00:02:21.269> of<00:02:21.389> it<00:02:21.599> via<00:02:21.780> exclusive<00:02:22.379> features<00:02:22.739> so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
afraid of it via exclusive features so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.039 
afraid of it via exclusive features so
if<00:02:23.639> you<00:02:23.849> do<00:02:23.999> have<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.180> hard<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.510> for<00:02:24.569> like

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
if you do have a hard on for like

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.720 
if you do have a hard on for like
adaptive<00:02:25.379> vsync<00:02:25.680> khudai<00:02:26.310> things<00:02:26.489> like<00:02:26.609> that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
adaptive vsync khudai things like that

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.759 
adaptive vsync khudai things like that

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
100 people think differently so I try to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.879 
100 people think differently so I try to
put<00:02:39.299> my<00:02:39.450> preferences<00:02:40.019> aside<00:02:40.169> and<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:40.530> put

put my preferences aside and just put

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.559 
put my preferences aside and just put
the<00:02:41.129> best<00:02:41.310> dollar<00:02:41.549> for<00:02:41.819> dollar<00:02:41.849> graphics<00:02:42.389> card

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
the best dollar for dollar graphics card

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.449 
the best dollar for dollar graphics card
I<00:02:42.749> think<00:02:43.290> that's<00:02:43.409> this<00:02:43.859> is<00:02:43.919> the<00:02:44.069> best<00:02:44.280> one<00:02:44.400> that

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
I think that's this is the best one that

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.429 
I think that's this is the best one that
nvidia<00:02:45.030> has<00:02:45.060> right<00:02:45.359> now<00:02:45.389> for<00:02:46.079> like<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> hundred

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
nvidia has right now for like a hundred

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:47.569 
nvidia has right now for like a hundred
forty<00:02:46.799> dollars<00:02:47.040> you're<00:02:47.159> getting<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.400> lot<00:02:47.549> of

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
forty dollars you're getting a lot of

those two games for and it crushes those
the<00:05:29.790> 671<00:05:30.510> overclocked<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.200> they<00:05:31.290> cost<00:05:31.560> about

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
the 671 overclocked and they cost about

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.560 
the 671 overclocked and they cost about
the<00:05:31.800> same<00:05:31.860> price<00:05:32.220> i<00:05:32.460> think<00:05:32.790> the<00:05:33.000> 670<00:05:33.510> is

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
the same price i think the 670 is

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.940 
the same price i think the 670 is
actually<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:33.930> twenty<00:05:34.260> dollar<00:05:34.290> is<00:05:34.650> twenty

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
actually a twenty dollar is twenty

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.880 
actually a twenty dollar is twenty
dollars<00:05:35.160> cheaper<00:05:35.310> but<00:05:35.580> still<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:37.590> extra

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
dollars cheaper but still that extra

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.470 
dollars cheaper but still that extra
