00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hi all guys obviously this 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.940
 new video as you know we just have 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.670
 performed the untethered jailbreak of 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.650
 ios 6.1 on our iphone 5 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.059
 and what we want to do today today vi 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.750
 I want to show the tweaks that are already 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.220
 compatible with ios and 6.1 therefore not 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.900
 originals also harvey all why 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.369
 obviously many of these are not needed 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.619
 well I don't like it slow down the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.600
 device for which I will list packages 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.849
 which I use in this video is in 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.400
 description also leaves you a link that 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.019
 shows an inspirational page in which 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.759
 you will find all the tweaks is right there 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.579
 complete list that are compatible with 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.280
 ios 6.1 now I'll show you little of it 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.050
 only work with 5 to do this 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.270
 I'm going to use a software called 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.239
 reflector that lets you show the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.850
 our iphone on the mac even without it 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.559
 jailbreak actually did it 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.270
 see in my video if you want 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 go there and look for here we are 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.559
 this is our iphone 5 as you see 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.719
 all very fluid but never mind 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.920
 the visualization because I have already done 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.920
 I leave a video about it as well 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.100
 this link.in description then how 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.470
 see ostellato five column springboard 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.290
 which serves to have five rows of cones 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.310
 on the springboard then on the other file 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.880
 colon doc which serves to have five 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.509
 icons in the bar just below 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.630
 iPhone's 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.270
 then later or even installed sb setting 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.180
 clearly needed to visualize 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.110
 precisely this screen that gives free 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.640
 fast access especially to the control 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.990
 of various settings such as 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.119
 of all of brightness clearly not 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.340
 you see that changes because on computer 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.380
 always the same was possible 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.790
 disable wi fi respring 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.579
 know lippi and so on 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:01.049
 then I added it as you see it seems 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:04.920
 sb setting notification center ho 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.420
 installed wifi booster which serves as 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 having precisely the optimized wifi that 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.420
 detects all the wi fi networks that are 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.840
 also present those that really are 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.420
 distant that normally apple excludes 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.920
 from visualization and converting into 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.260
 in this case we have the resolution of 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.150
 our pp 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:31.709
 then we also installed SMS bytes 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.840
 that this here and is an icon that we don't 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.090
 leads to this application 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.879
 similar to that of normal messages of 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.410
 ios that however involves some novelties yes 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.440
 can send normal messages 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.290
 imessage mms and also you can 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.670
 know with those who have texting bytes and 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.920
 it is also possible to carry out another 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.510
 operation when someone who sends a 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.269
 message normally looks like message from 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.709
 ios warning with light sms instead will be 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.349
 a screen similar to appears 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.989
 android now I can't show it 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.030
 because I can't send the message in 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.560
 this moment, however, I tell you that 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.090
 when you receive a message you can 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.670
 also respond from the lockscreen for 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.620
 whose very huts are much easier 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.599
 sms you have the normal application then 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.300
 to another tweet that I would like to install 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.459
 now that I don't have time 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.110
 on the iphone because the version of 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.390
 reflector and I'm using to see 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.720
 the screen of the iphone on the mac is one 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.930
 trial version I tell you that this tweak 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.239
 which is called a wii flash 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.040
 flashlight is a tweak that lets you 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.780
 go find the flash behind 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.640
 of the iPhone simply from 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.390
 notification always so much more 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.790
 comfortable than going to open 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.950
 torch application 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.780
 then a last thing notification center 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.150
 which you see in the lower right corner 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.830
 we have this message icon that 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.590
 allows you to quickly dial a 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.720
 message is that this is the screen 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.909
 that I wanted to show sms bytes before 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.280
 present writes a recipient of it 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.770
 so nicolas 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.240
 then I put the key on the message 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.370
 I then do away I can too 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.170
 call it call go on skype facetime 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.610
 add templates add 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.160
 model this message and so on 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.560
 by pressing on the arrow at the top I can 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.239
 see all our conversations 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.120
 and simply with the home button 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.400
 leave this view then 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.770
 all very fluid clearly silvia su 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.210
 iphone 5 a bomb load thanks to the 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.930
 new processor as you see it is 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.270
 updating all the erap and it really is 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.130
 the download is very fast too 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.950
 of very fluid tweak extraction 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.590
 so I recommend this time by 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:46.980
 to play the game because it's worth it 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.260
 so question this side i like you 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.120
 I repeat for more information on 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.970
 compatible tweets not compatible with 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.010
 iphone 5 go into the description of the 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.990
 video and there will be a link that will take you 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.900
 a page of inspiration in which 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.990
 you will find the complete list of tweets 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.110
 which are compatible with the con 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.500
 five beings 6.1 and so on 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:14.700
 to finish I show you this 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:19.440
 application that you can download but 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.420
 only via punto cydia and it is then 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.560
 funny prof 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.520
 this application allows you to find 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.870
 the golf networks the passwords of the wifi networks 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.390
 simply after finding them 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.220
 precisely with the scanner function at 0 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.930
 we arrive on fastweb and it is we understand the 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.410
 two possible passwords that were of 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:41.100
 default on modem 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:43.170
 then we also have youtube to mp3 which 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.210
 lets you simply looking for the 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.430
 video go to download harlock 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.980
 convert it insert in the appropriate 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.930
 music folder then engineers too

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.700
 all new with regards to the 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.490
 ios device owner 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.380
 of course you can do everything by having the 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.460
 the iphone without the break but a lot 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.919
 application really cost 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.530
 excessively sometimes you want it 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.210
 I can customize your device 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.740
 clearly I did not ask about issues 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.800
 so I didn't show anything 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.050
 about 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.030
 winterboard and so on but I tell you that 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.590
 they are already compatible so if you want 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.409
 go and personalize yours 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.810
 device you can already do this 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.430
 video ends here
