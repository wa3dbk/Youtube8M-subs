in<00:00:22.779> three-needle<00:00:23.289> Castille<00:00:23.980> you<00:00:24.520> place<00:00:24.789> two

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
in three-needle Castille you place two

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.060 
in three-needle Castille you place two
pieces<00:00:25.330> of<00:00:25.570> knitted<00:00:26.050> fabric<00:00:26.470> with<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:26.770> right

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
pieces of knitted fabric with the right

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.340 
pieces of knitted fabric with the right
side<00:00:27.580> facing<00:00:27.789> together<00:00:28.330> like<00:00:28.599> this

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350

and you cast off from both side of the
fabric<00:00:33.410> on<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.890> wrong<00:00:34.070> side<00:00:34.400> so<00:00:34.700> that<00:00:35.030> the

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
fabric on the wrong side so that the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.420 
fabric on the wrong side so that the
seam<00:00:35.390> will<00:00:36.080> stay<00:00:36.440> on<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.740> wrong<00:00:36.890> side<00:00:37.220> and

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
seam will stay on the wrong side and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.650 
seam will stay on the wrong side and
from<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:37.910> right<00:00:38.060> side<00:00:38.360> it<00:00:38.630> will<00:00:38.840> look<00:00:39.050> neat

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
from the right side it will look neat

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.810 
from the right side it will look neat
okay<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:41.720> using<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.560> third<00:00:42.770> needle<00:00:43.100> which<00:00:43.520> is

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
okay so using the third needle which is

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.110 
okay so using the third needle which is
the<00:00:44.360> bamboo<00:00:44.540> needle<00:00:45.050> in<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.710> video<00:00:45.980> knit<00:00:46.820> the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
the bamboo needle in the video knit the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.700 
the bamboo needle in the video knit the
first<00:00:47.270> stitch<00:00:47.450> from<00:00:47.900> both<00:00:48.080> needles<00:00:48.559> together

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
first stitch from both needles together

00:00:50.710 --> 00:01:02.390 
first stitch from both needles together
like<00:00:51.710> this

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.729 

and<00:01:02.490> then<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.330> knit<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.720> second<00:01:04.080> stitch<00:01:04.440> from

and then you knit the second stitch from

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.000 
and then you knit the second stitch from
the<00:01:05.870> from<00:01:06.870> the<00:01:07.020> needle<00:01:07.350> left<00:01:07.590> needles

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the from the needle left needles

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:20.510 
the from the needle left needles
together

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.389 

then<00:01:21.520> pass<00:01:21.999> the<00:01:22.359> first<00:01:22.600> stitch<00:01:22.960> on<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:24.219> right

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
then pass the first stitch on the right

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.469 
then pass the first stitch on the right
needle<00:01:24.759> over<00:01:25.539> to<00:01:25.689> the<00:01:25.810> second<00:01:26.170> stitch<00:01:26.469> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
needle over to the second stitch and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:36.959 
needle over to the second stitch and
this<00:01:28.479> is<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.750> first<00:01:28.960> stitch<00:01:29.259> cast<00:01:29.649> it<00:01:29.920> off

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
stitches you can cut the yarn and pull

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.520 
stitches you can cut the yarn and pull
the<00:02:14.230> thread<00:02:14.380> like<00:02:14.650> this<00:02:15.900> now<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.960> can<00:02:17.290> see

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
the thread like this now you can see

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.680 
the thread like this now you can see
that<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.370> pink<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.090> green<00:02:19.120> fabric

that the the pink and the green fabric

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.089 
that the the pink and the green fabric
is<00:02:20.170> really<00:02:20.710> nicely<00:02:20.980> joined<00:02:21.460> together

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.610 

if<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.969> look<00:02:27.209> at<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.780> wrong<00:02:27.959> side<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.439> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
if you look at the wrong side of the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.220 
if you look at the wrong side of the
fabric<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:29.519> can<00:02:29.760> see<00:02:29.999> it's<00:02:30.689> a<00:02:30.959> little<00:02:31.049> bit

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
fabric you can see it's a little bit

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.369 
fabric you can see it's a little bit
raised<00:02:31.590> where<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.430> cast<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.879> off<00:02:33.139> and<00:02:34.139> that's

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
raised where you cast it off and that's

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.949 
raised where you cast it off and that's
why<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:34.889> important<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.700> cast<00:02:35.999> off<00:02:36.269> on<00:02:36.510> the

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
why it's important to cast off on the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.869 
why it's important to cast off on the
wrong<00:02:37.109> side<00:02:37.409> of<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.680> fabric<00:02:37.859> if<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.459> want<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
wrong side of the fabric if you want to

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.750 
wrong side of the fabric if you want to
show<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:40.290> neat<00:02:40.769> seam<00:02:41.069> line<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.609> right

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
show the neat seam line on the right

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.700 
show the neat seam line on the right
side

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.190 

what<00:02:47.520> I<00:02:47.550> love<00:02:47.820> about<00:02:47.850> three<00:02:48.450> needle<00:02:48.750> cast-off

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
what I love about three needle cast-off

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.260 
what I love about three needle cast-off
is<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.800> can<00:02:49.980> easily<00:02:50.520> separate<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.060> two

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
is that you can easily separate a two

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.410 
is that you can easily separate a two
pieces<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.750> fabric<00:02:52.340> by<00:02:53.340> undoing<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.940> cast<00:02:54.180> off

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
pieces of fabric by undoing the cast off

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:03.830 
pieces of fabric by undoing the cast off
from<00:02:54.660> where<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.990> finished

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840
