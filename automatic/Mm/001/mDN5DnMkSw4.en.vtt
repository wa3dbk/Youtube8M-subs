00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
girls we got a lot of requests for video

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.280 
girls we got a lot of requests for video
covering<00:00:08.849> mobility<00:00:09.389> so<00:00:09.660> it's<00:00:09.780> exactly<00:00:10.110> what

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
covering mobility so it's exactly what

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.230 
covering mobility so it's exactly what
we're<00:00:10.380> going<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.530> cover<00:00:10.679> today<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.340> thing<00:00:12.150> you

we're going to cover today a thing you
gotta<00:00:12.389> remember<00:00:12.480> about<00:00:12.870> mobility<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.530> there

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
gotta remember about mobility is there

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.680 
gotta remember about mobility is there
some<00:00:14.040> joints<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.519> need<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.910> be<00:00:15.030> very<00:00:15.269> mobile

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
some joints that need to be very mobile

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.540 
some joints that need to be very mobile
in<00:00:15.870> some<00:00:16.440> joints<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.949> need<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.310> just

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
in some joints that need to just

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.849 
in some joints that need to just
stabilize<00:00:18.090> some<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.109> mobility<00:00:19.529> joints

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
stabilize some of the mobility joints

be the elbow the knee the lumbar spine
and<00:00:27.570> what<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.289> got<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.590> remember<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:28.980> well<00:00:29.250> is

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and what you got to remember as well is

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.700 
and what you got to remember as well is
a<00:00:30.090> lot<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.420> times<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.199> joints<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.560> are

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
a lot of times if the joints that are

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.560 
a lot of times if the joints that are
supposed<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.070> be<00:00:32.160> mobile<00:00:32.640> aren't<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
supposed to be mobile aren't the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.639 
supposed to be mobile aren't the
stability<00:00:34.079> joints<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.410> going<00:00:34.590> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
stability joints are going to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.680 
stability joints are going to
overcompensate<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.670> possibly<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.300> injury

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
overcompensate and possibly get injury

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.750 
overcompensate and possibly get injury
so<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.230> want<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> perform<00:00:37.710> these<00:00:38.040> exercises

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
so you want to perform these exercises

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.729 
so you want to perform these exercises
to<00:00:38.850> keep<00:00:39.059> those<00:00:39.300> joints<00:00:39.570> mobile<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.530> way

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
to keep those joints mobile so that way

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.590 
to keep those joints mobile so that way
you<00:00:40.800> prevent<00:00:41.160> injury<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> future<00:00:42.000> so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
you prevent injury in the future so

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.180 
you prevent injury in the future so
these<00:00:42.809> exercise<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.680> want<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.950> do<00:00:44.040> is

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
these exercise what you want to do is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.010 
these exercise what you want to do is
perform<00:00:44.520> them<00:00:44.670> around<00:00:44.879> five<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.450> ten<00:00:45.690> minutes

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
perform them around five to ten minutes

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.380 
perform them around five to ten minutes
immediately<00:00:46.350> before<00:00:46.800> your<00:00:47.460> actual<00:00:47.670> workout

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
immediately before your actual workout

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.510 
immediately before your actual workout
that<00:00:48.989> way<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.200> keep<00:00:49.649> those<00:00:49.800> joints<00:00:50.129> mobile

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
that way you keep those joints mobile

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.279 
that way you keep those joints mobile
you<00:00:50.910> keep<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.210> range<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.480> motion<00:00:51.539> high<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
you keep that range of motion high and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.619 
you keep that range of motion high and
you<00:00:52.530> also<00:00:52.890> lessen<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> chance<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.820> injury<00:00:54.210> so

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
you also lessen the chance of injury so

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.180 
you also lessen the chance of injury so
when<00:00:54.780> you're<00:00:54.870> performing<00:00:54.989> those<00:00:55.320> squats<00:00:55.649> dead

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
when you're performing those squats dead

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.099 
when you're performing those squats dead
live<00:00:56.430> bench<00:00:56.820> press<00:00:57.090> overhead<00:00:57.480> press<00:00:57.899> you're

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
live bench press overhead press you're

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.049 
live bench press overhead press you're
going<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.289> feel<00:00:58.440> strong<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.190> ready<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.520> go<00:00:59.760> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
going to feel strong and ready to go I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.729 
going to feel strong and ready to go I
hope<00:01:00.719> you're<00:01:00.960> ready<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.170> go<00:01:01.350> because<00:01:01.500> we're

hope you're ready to go because we're
about<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.219> started

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
about to get started

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.800 
about to get started
mobility<00:01:04.860> style<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.180> we're<00:01:06.330> starting<00:01:06.479> off

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
mobility style so we're starting off

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.170 
mobility style so we're starting off
with<00:01:06.869> lower<00:01:07.409> body<00:01:07.770> mobility<00:01:08.010> exercises<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
with lower body mobility exercises and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.640 
with lower body mobility exercises and
first<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> list<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
first on the list is going to be the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.789 
first on the list is going to be the
lateral<00:01:11.010> lunge<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.820> what<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.060> want<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.799> is

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
lateral lunge so what you want to do is

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.249 
lateral lunge so what you want to do is
get<00:01:14.070> wider<00:01:14.430> than<00:01:14.909> shoulder<00:01:15.330> stance<00:01:15.689> actually

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
get wider than shoulder stance actually

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.200 
get wider than shoulder stance actually
pretty<00:01:16.530> wide<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.130> wider<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> easier

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
pretty wide the wider you get the easier

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.490 
pretty wide the wider you get the easier
it's<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.869> lot<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> mistake<00:01:19.470> is

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
it's going to be a lot of mistake is

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.530 
it's going to be a lot of mistake is
people<00:01:19.619> start<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.280> narrow<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.030> they<00:01:21.390> actually

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
people start to narrow and they actually

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270 
people start to narrow and they actually
don't<00:01:22.080> get<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> full<00:01:22.560> benefit<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.009> this

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
don't get the full benefit of this

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.580 
don't get the full benefit of this
mobility<00:01:23.610> exercise<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.750> start<00:01:25.020> nice<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.439> wide

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
mobility exercise so start nice and wide

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.320 
mobility exercise so start nice and wide
you<00:01:25.619> want<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.009> keep<00:01:26.130> your<00:01:26.280> feet<00:01:26.520> straight<00:01:27.000> it's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
you want to keep your feet straight it's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.510 
you want to keep your feet straight it's
going<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> work<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.110> hip<00:01:28.320> mobility<00:01:28.520> ankle

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
going to work on hip mobility ankle

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.920 
going to work on hip mobility ankle
mobility<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.060> it's<00:01:30.210> also<00:01:30.360> going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> work<00:01:30.689> on

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
mobility and it's also going to work on

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.600 
mobility and it's also going to work on
stabilization<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> knee<00:01:32.070> joint<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.430> well

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
stabilization of the knee joint as well

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.370 
stabilization of the knee joint as well
so<00:01:33.090> you're<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.450> pulling<00:01:33.990> into<00:01:34.170> one

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
so you're going to be pulling into one

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.410 
so you're going to be pulling into one
side<00:01:34.680> bending<00:01:35.490> at<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.640> knee<00:01:35.939> putting<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
side bending at the knee putting the

side bending at the knee putting the
pressure<00:01:36.630> laterally<00:01:37.470> keeping<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.340> leg

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
pressure laterally keeping this leg

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.859 
pressure laterally keeping this leg
straight<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.360> you're<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.720> come

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
straight and then you're going to come

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.990 
straight and then you're going to come
up<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.710> go<00:01:40.799> directly<00:01:41.130> into<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.549> next<00:01:41.820> side

up and go directly into the next side
just<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> don't<00:01:43.799> want<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.189> as

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
that foot externally rotate outward is

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.859 
that foot externally rotate outward is
that's<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.729> compensation<00:01:51.420> for<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
movement and is not necessarily going to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.889 
movement and is not necessarily going to
be<00:01:53.520> working<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> mobility<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> hips

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.710 
exercise really going to work on the
mobility<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.550> hip<00:03:28.700> joint<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.239> also<00:03:29.600> an

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
mobility of the hip joint and also an

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.720 
mobility of the hip joint and also an
ankle<00:03:30.140> joint<00:03:30.410> so<00:03:31.130> what<00:03:31.250> you're<00:03:31.340> going<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.489> do

ankle joint so what you're going to do

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.630 
ankle joint so what you're going to do
put<00:03:32.510> pressure<00:03:32.810> on<00:03:33.140> one<00:03:33.200> leg<00:03:33.739> just<00:03:34.100> like<00:03:34.220> so<00:03:34.430> and

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
put pressure on one leg just like so and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.850 
put pressure on one leg just like so and
let<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.880> other<00:03:35.060> one<00:03:35.300> free<00:03:35.600> to<00:03:35.840> swing<00:03:36.140> and

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
let the other one free to swing and

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.080 
let the other one free to swing and
you're<00:03:37.040> just<00:03:37.280> going<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.430> kick<00:03:38.650> from<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.739> side

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
you're just going to kick from the side

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.650 
you're just going to kick from the side
to<00:03:41.090> side

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
to side

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.119 
to side
almost<00:03:42.440> like<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.590> pendulum<00:03:42.950> in<00:03:43.190> a<00:03:43.250> way

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
almost like a pendulum in a way

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:52.410 
almost like a pendulum in a way
I'm<00:03:45.579> doing<00:03:46.709> 10<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:48.159> there's<00:03:48.430> 1<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.670> 10<00:03:52.180> and

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
I'm doing 10 so there's 1 and 10 and

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.539 
I'm doing 10 so there's 1 and 10 and
then<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.049> can<00:03:53.170> go<00:03:53.290> right<00:03:53.469> into<00:03:53.739> for<00:03:54.159> kicks

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
then you can go right into for kicks

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
slightly bend the knees so that way your

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.100 
slightly bend the knees so that way your
muscles<00:04:49.060> are<00:04:49.150> contracted<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:49.900> you're<00:04:49.990> going

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
muscles are contracted and you're going

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.140 
muscles are contracted and you're going
to<00:04:50.199> take<00:04:50.380> nice<00:04:50.770> slow<00:04:50.800> steps<00:04:51.580> in<00:04:51.789> either

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
to take nice slow steps in either

direction so this one we're going to

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.909 
direction so this one we're going to
start<00:04:53.889> right<00:04:54.539> small<00:04:55.539> walks<00:04:55.840> fire<00:04:56.259> those<00:04:56.500> up<00:04:56.710> in

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
start right small walks fire those up in

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.550 
start right small walks fire those up in
