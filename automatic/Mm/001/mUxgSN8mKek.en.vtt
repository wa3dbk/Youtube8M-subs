00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 if there is no lizard I you 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.490
 confirms my coming for the japan expo and 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.259
 this year's paris games week is 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.529
 Moreover, I saw that the paris games 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.690
 weekend 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.429
 five years say apps that will grow from 32 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.559
 thousand square meters to 50 thousand meters 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.330
 square is cool but I think we 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.980
 will always be so much compressed by 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.840
 compared to the japan expo which proposes for 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.900
 as many visitors 125 millimeters 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.900
 square 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.930
 I confirm you murray my coming from here 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.730
 there and especially what day what day I 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.379
 then will be for purchases from this 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.059
 week bachelet buy only three games 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.739
 why because last week 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.540
 I did not visit any lofts 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.809
 since there was nothing close to 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.820
 home 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.199
 in fact I still do thirty six thousand 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.050
 bounds with I go to perpetuity and to 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.890
 final low I did not want to move from 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.699
 to make 40 terminals 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.949
 so I fled repatriated on 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.129
 shopping in a cache and I did them 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.739
 just thaler then this week 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.110
 it will be a special retro a special 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.630
 nintendo and a special comic 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.229
 with his games bought so so I get 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.450
 am paid 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.490
 this one I liked on the game 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.539
 boy down just the game boy so in the end 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.929
 I found myself for the super 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.789
 nintendo 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:19.060
 Smurfs around the world for 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:22.899
 6.99 one cartridge is super Nintendo 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.729
 I will end this one on the la 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.929
 on the game boy and I believe that the 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.159
 smurf that accompanies the 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.400
 smurfette 6 do not fool me if I 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.200
 found curious then confirmed the 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.520
 two at the games they are youths and 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.500
 youths box 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.350
 so that's cool so I got 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.049
 the asterix in addition in perfect condition 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.149
 after for two-band games 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.890
 drawn down I played none on the 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.470
 the oldest I played well 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.049
 sure there the super nes I remember the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.860
 tintin asterix asterix and obelix 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.740
 the spiro also so if I come back 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.380
 the games therefore the games from 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.450
 Belgian comic strip to day is not 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.399
 not played on the leash so the first 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.710
 it's asterix besides looking at the state 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.909
 it is frankly nickel the dock that 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.160
 brought back lanka railwaymen really going 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.750
 well cared for and I find that 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.640
 it's true that 15 euros is not the 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.920
 price that I currently put but it's 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.630
 so rare boxed youths and 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.590
 especially in this state there that 15 euros I 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.450
 find it's really cheap 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.850
 so if you see for less than 20 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.250
 euros boxed games have 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.620
 super nes games boxed in this state there 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.049
 frankly seized funds while 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.670
 it's not sports games of course 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.260
 I I thought of nothing and suddenly it 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.520
 this is the asterix henry are complete in 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.580
 plus there are notices for both there 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.200
 after the wedge finally hold 6 they are 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.480
 in addition and second so that's the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.310
 smurfs on the nes and continues if 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.010
 I was a little bit cheaper 12 99 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.280
 so that makes me both 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.120
 youths in a box for 27 28 28 euros 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.550
 27 98 and I also find that for this 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.770
 price there do not look it's true 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.930
 can on the internet it's about 20 30 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.700
 Youth euros box to add 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.410
 ports is this a super good state 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.330
 you have to see it frankly in this 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.080
 state there is a great price is 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.150
 also 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.670
 it's true that in this cash it's the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.960
 hides a quilting of bourgoin he 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.980
 was called plating who one is and they 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.290
 were redeemed by applying 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.730
 they changed their name and suddenly they 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.400
 also sell I saw a zapper in 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.050
 box just the zapper is against 35 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.580
 I did not want the promised 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.340
 France was a bit expensive but this 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.450
 I said to the sellers that it's going 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.880
 is not going to stay that long at 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.960
 to go quickly do that and so that's it 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.300
 all for this week's purchases 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.420
 so with only three games as I 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.430

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.660
 of the Belgian comic strip 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.190

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.140
 brother advised me but for 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.880
 the moment it did not tempt me so I 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.950
 the game side minerals for now I 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.390

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.300
 city 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.710
 I bat so I find myself 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.140
 I found them pretty Catalan arkham 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.419
 city ​​to start a goty version of 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.550
 preference and I could test it and 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.409
 compare it with the arkham asylum that I 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.169
 find huge and also I am 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.399
 relaunched on a fighting game he's here 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:52.110

 pretty funny good it's not great it's 

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:03.589
 not a super fashion of phew 

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:05.759

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.599
