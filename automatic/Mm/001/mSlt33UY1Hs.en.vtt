00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
whole year now let me say one thing that

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.319 
whole year now let me say one thing that
this<00:01:30.509> actually<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.729> definitely<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.150> bus

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
this actually is definitely the bus

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.210 
this actually is definitely the bus
anything<00:01:33.630> I've<00:01:33.720> seen<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> while<00:01:34.229> not<00:01:34.950> saying

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
anything I've seen in a while not saying

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.740 
anything I've seen in a while not saying
that<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.490> gonna<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> end<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.210> fairy

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
that this is gonna be the end of fairy

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.149 
that this is gonna be the end of fairy
tale<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.140> i'm<00:01:37.259> guessing<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.650> boot<00:01:37.829> will<00:01:38.009> have

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
tale but i'm guessing the boot will have

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.920 
tale but i'm guessing the boot will have
like<00:01:38.280> maybe<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.729> three<00:01:38.939> month<00:01:39.210> break<00:01:39.270> which<00:01:39.750> is

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
like maybe a three month break which is

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.840 
like maybe a three month break which is
kind<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> upsetting<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:41.250> maybe<00:01:41.549> we<00:01:41.729> won't

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
kind of upsetting but maybe we won't

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.030 
kind of upsetting but maybe we won't
maybe<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.390> one<00:01:42.689> year<00:01:42.930> transition<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.829> knots

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
maybe that one year transition of knots

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.859 
maybe that one year transition of knots
