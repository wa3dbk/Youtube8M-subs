00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.359
 red how to make a plastic boat 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.480
 bottles 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.670
 idea for creativity on the channel you and so 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.500
 do not build ships to you need 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.250
 shampoo bottle switch 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.560
 motor 1 battery type krone 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.820
 some tin scissors but glue 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.699
 gun and solder 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.970
 we already stand up posting go 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.600
 white thin wires and make a markup with 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.410
 boat's nose on the bottle two corners on top 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.670
 and the bottom and such are the strips 2 floor now 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.710
 the whole thing looks like 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.770
 itâ€™s best to do it with a heated knife 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.079
 unfortunately we ran out of gas therefore 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.340
 Bulling look like we got here 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.950
 such a boat nose 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.020
 the back of the bottle we cut off like 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.420
 too cumbersome it turns out 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.149
 and the front of the case na byoo cover we 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.940
 glue here but install it before 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.570
 our motor cheeks take care of the place where was 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.580
 cover such services and hermetically it 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.360
 taped with glue with extreme caution 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.440
 so as not to glue the shaft into the housing and so we 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.980
 glue on 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.160
 in feed with committee and how to feed 9 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.440
 volt we took three years for effect 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.020
 starboard red i'm coffee to you 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.110
 green we are all not somewhere inside and 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.080
 centers for general lighting done just 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.700
 switch found this item 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.720
 connecting all the diodes follow us 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.720
 get food act just 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.840
 so we put the battery in the center 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.920
 did not grab the price 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:51.480
 printer soldered wires diodes one 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.870
 diode we left but on the right side 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.970
 staples 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.300
 and it remains to combine the two parts 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.920
 and carefully seal all this cut off 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.700
 part 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.280
 we use to close the nose of the hair 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.259
 to start their 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.560
 we isolate your wiring and then 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:19.180
 will combine from so we are taped 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:26.000
 the boat remained itself 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:32.959
 who was his for his own wall can 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.300
 love we took dimensional to mind. not 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.740
 it was hard not white casino big step 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.100
 Screw now we neatly 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.880
 glue click but from this worm 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:48.310
 and we will dress a wave, then we understand the wanderings 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.310
 may have a density trimming 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.840
 what boat did we get 2 of course 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.540
 somewhere goes good for the first version 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.940
 vodka and think come down here I found something 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:34.289
 place where we have a little bit of Vlad 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:38.850
 it's not scary it can be stuck with 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:43.050
 time all those places that are not very 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.300
 tightly they are such small water leaks 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.800
 not terrible, then as we have all the contacts 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.470
 good by pinnacle 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.810
 I think the first time turned out well 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.410
 subscribe to channel like 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.410
