following my videos you know I did a

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.479 
following my videos you know I did a
carburetor<00:00:58.660> conversion<00:00:59.230> on<00:00:59.320> this<00:00:59.530> bike<00:00:59.770> and

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
carburetor conversion on this bike and

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.320 
carburetor conversion on this bike and
the<00:01:01.000> last<00:01:01.210> time<00:01:01.390> you<00:01:01.540> guys<00:01:01.690> saw<00:01:01.989> it<00:01:02.140> I<00:01:02.350> had<00:01:03.330> had

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
the last time you guys saw it I had had

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.150 
the last time you guys saw it I had had
it<00:01:04.449> up<00:01:04.570> on<00:01:04.690> jack<00:01:04.960> stands<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.650> it<00:01:05.860> was<00:01:05.979> the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
it up on jack stands and it was the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.300 
it up on jack stands and it was the
first<00:01:06.670> start<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.619> carburetor<00:01:08.619> conversion

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
first start of the carburetor conversion

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.460 
first start of the carburetor conversion
so<00:01:09.520> now<00:01:10.330> that<00:01:10.390> I've<00:01:10.660> been<00:01:10.750> riding<00:01:10.990> in<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.290> bit

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
so now that I've been riding in a bit

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.130 
so now that I've been riding in a bit
and<00:01:11.619> going<00:01:11.800> through<00:01:11.979> all<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.190> bugs<00:01:12.460> I'll<00:01:13.140> run

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
and going through all the bugs I'll run

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.389 
and going through all the bugs I'll run
through<00:01:14.320> some<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.649> the<00:01:14.710> updates<00:01:14.830> I've<00:01:15.250> been

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
through some of the updates I've been

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.219 
through some of the updates I've been
doing<00:01:15.700> I've<00:01:16.240> actually<00:01:16.420> put<00:01:16.660> a<00:01:16.720> couple<00:01:17.020> hundred

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
doing I've actually put a couple hundred

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.790 
doing I've actually put a couple hundred
miles<00:01:17.380> on<00:01:17.649> it<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:19.360> runs<00:01:19.450> great<00:01:19.800> carburetor

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
miles on it and it runs great carburetor

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.859 
miles on it and it runs great carburetor
needs<00:01:21.009> a<00:01:21.100> little<00:01:21.280> bit<00:01:21.369> of<00:01:21.460> tuning<00:01:21.790> still<00:01:22.030> but

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
needs a little bit of tuning still but

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.320 
needs a little bit of tuning still but
other<00:01:22.990> than<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:24.430> running<00:01:24.700> great<00:01:24.940> I

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
other than that it's running great I

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.600 
other than that it's running great I
don't<00:01:26.200> want<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.410> take<00:01:26.560> my<00:01:26.680> seat<00:01:26.950> off<00:01:27.130> but<00:01:27.369> if

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
don't want to take my seat off but if

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.540 
don't want to take my seat off but if

that's all the wiring what is it five

this<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.830> new<00:01:39.490> tank<00:01:39.729> I<00:01:39.880> got<00:01:40.060> with<00:01:40.300> the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
this is the new tank I got with the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.270 
this is the new tank I got with the
petcock<00:01:40.750> for<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.080> carburetor<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.800> probably

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
petcock for the carburetor I probably

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.320 
petcock for the carburetor I probably
could<00:01:42.550> have<00:01:42.640> converted<00:01:42.910> my<00:01:43.240> old<00:01:43.679> tank<00:01:44.679> but<00:01:45.330> for

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
could have converted my old tank but for

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.480 
could have converted my old tank but for
the<00:01:46.390> price<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:46.630> this<00:01:46.929> thing<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:48.130> wasn't<00:01:48.310> even

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
the price of this thing it wasn't even

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.859 
the price of this thing it wasn't even
worth<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.929> effort<00:01:49.929> I<00:01:50.170> made<00:01:50.979> some<00:01:51.190> new<00:01:51.310> mounts

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
worth the effort I made some new mounts

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.020 
worth the effort I made some new mounts
what<00:01:52.869> I<00:01:52.899> did<00:01:53.110> was<00:01:53.340> mill<00:01:54.340> out<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.550> nice<00:01:54.819> little

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
what I did was mill out a nice little

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.749 
what I did was mill out a nice little
piece<00:01:55.240> of<00:01:55.300> round<00:01:55.539> bar<00:01:55.869> for<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:56.920> bolt<00:01:57.130> welded

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
piece of round bar for the bolt welded

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.760 
piece of round bar for the bolt welded
it<00:01:57.849> to<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.060> top<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.420> frame<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.899> I<00:01:59.470> drilled

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
it to the top of the frame and I drilled

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.889 
it to the top of the frame and I drilled
and<00:02:00.099> reinforced<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.060> frame<00:02:01.240> in<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.479> back<00:02:01.660> for

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
and reinforced the frame in the back for

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.930 
and reinforced the frame in the back for
the<00:02:01.929> back<00:02:02.020> mount<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.560> this<00:02:02.679> tank<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:03.220> few<00:02:03.280> weeks

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
the back mount of this tank a few weeks

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.609 
the back mount of this tank a few weeks
ago<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.209> made<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.630> little<00:02:04.840> gauge<00:02:05.110> pot<00:02:05.410> here

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
ago I made this little gauge pot here

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:06.779 
ago I made this little gauge pot here
out<00:02:05.709> of<00:02:05.770> some<00:02:05.950> sheet<00:02:06.190> metal<00:02:06.340> head<00:02:06.610> laying

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
out of some sheet metal head laying

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.020 
out of some sheet metal head laying
around<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:08.380> not<00:02:08.530> quite<00:02:08.800> done<00:02:08.979> I<00:02:09.039> got<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.369> paint

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
around it's not quite done I got a paint

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.730 
around it's not quite done I got a paint
it<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:10.300> whatnot<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.899> figured<00:02:11.410> I'd<00:02:11.530> least

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
it and whatnot I figured I'd least

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.410 
it and whatnot I figured I'd least
needed<00:02:12.099> an<00:02:12.190> oil<00:02:12.370> pressure<00:02:12.640> gauge<00:02:12.849> and<00:02:13.360> an

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
needed an oil pressure gauge and an

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.570 
needed an oil pressure gauge and an
odometer<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.140> can<00:02:14.290> track<00:02:14.470> my<00:02:14.500> fuel<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.190> don't

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
odometer so I can track my fuel I don't

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.750 
odometer so I can track my fuel I don't
have<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.790> fuel<00:02:16.120> gauge<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:16.660> this<00:02:17.380> bike<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.580> those

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
have a fuel gauge on this bike so those

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.100 
have a fuel gauge on this bike so those
will<00:02:18.880> come<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.120> handy<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.569> haven't<00:02:19.840> hooked<00:02:19.990> them

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
will come in handy I haven't hooked them

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.130 
will come in handy I haven't hooked them
up<00:02:20.200> yet<00:02:20.440> as<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.190> can<00:02:21.370> see<00:02:21.610> but<00:02:22.140> they're

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
up yet as you can see but they're

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.820 
up yet as you can see but they're
getting<00:02:23.410> there

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
getting there

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.530 
getting there
doesn't<00:02:24.580> mean<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.760> can't<00:02:24.940> ride<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.209> bike<00:02:25.360> just

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
doesn't mean I can't ride the bike just

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.030 
doesn't mean I can't ride the bike just
means<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.810> got<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.020> check<00:02:26.140> my<00:02:26.290> fuel<00:02:26.530> more<00:02:26.739> often

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
means I got to check my fuel more often

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.589 
means I got to check my fuel more often
figured<00:02:28.030> why<00:02:28.209> have<00:02:28.480> 18<00:02:29.050> switches<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.770> Harley

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
figured why have 18 switches on a Harley

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.850 
figured why have 18 switches on a Harley
when<00:02:31.599> you<00:02:31.720> can<00:02:31.840> have<00:02:32.020> one<00:02:32.230> little<00:02:32.380> box<00:02:32.680> like

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
when you can have one little box like

XS 650 and these are my high lows this
is<00:02:40.660> my<00:02:40.750> blinkers<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:42.459> that's<00:02:42.760> gonna<00:02:42.880> be<00:02:43.060> from

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
is my blinkers and that's gonna be from

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.270 
is my blinkers and that's gonna be from
my<00:02:43.300> horn<00:02:43.590> that's<00:02:44.590> all<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:44.830> need

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
my horn that's all I need

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.840 
my horn that's all I need
one<00:02:45.459> little<00:02:45.760> pod

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
one little pod

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.630 
one little pod
I<00:02:46.940> don't<00:02:47.480> need<00:02:47.570> switches<00:02:47.990> up<00:02:48.140> here<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.640> don't

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
I don't need switches up here I don't

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.060 
I don't need switches up here I don't
need<00:02:49.730> switches<00:02:50.150> over<00:02:50.360> there<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:50.810> only<00:02:51.710> need

need switches over there I only need
this<00:02:52.280> switch<00:02:52.550> here<00:02:52.790> now<00:02:53.630> I've<00:02:53.810> had<00:02:53.990> a<00:02:54.020> lot<00:02:54.110> of

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
this switch here now I've had a lot of

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.900 
this switch here now I've had a lot of
questions<00:02:54.830> about<00:02:54.950> what<00:02:55.220> ignition<00:02:55.610> I'm<00:02:55.730> using

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
questions about what ignition I'm using

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.430 
questions about what ignition I'm using
since<00:02:56.240> I'm<00:02:56.360> not<00:02:56.450> using<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.810> Harley<00:02:57.110> system

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
since I'm not using the Harley system

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.030 
since I'm not using the Harley system
anymore

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
anymore

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.920

the<00:02:58.340> bike<00:02:58.520> is<00:02:58.550> carbureted<00:02:59.270> so<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.510> computers

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
the bike is carbureted so the computers

can't work the way they would before for
the<00:03:02.810> ignition<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:04.160> I<00:03:04.190> went<00:03:04.490> with<00:03:04.730> this

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
the ignition so I went with this

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.780 
the ignition so I went with this
thunderheart<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:06.140> can't<00:03:07.010> remember<00:03:07.190> what<00:03:07.400> model

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
where you don't even need a battery I've

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.580

but it is a cool option I have to admit

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.830 
but it is a cool option I have to admit
for<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.850> future<00:03:44.180> although<00:03:44.360> I<00:03:44.480> don't<00:03:44.660> know<00:03:44.750> if

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
for the future although I don't know if

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.800 
for the future although I don't know if
I<00:03:44.870> want<00:03:45.050> to<00:03:45.080> kick<00:03:45.230> over<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.500> 96<00:03:45.980> inch<00:03:46.130> motor<00:03:46.810> but

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
I want to kick over a 96 inch motor but

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.050 
I want to kick over a 96 inch motor but
anyway<00:03:48.140> this<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:48.680> my<00:03:48.830> setup<00:03:49.100> it's<00:03:49.520> electronic

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
anyway this is my setup it's electronic

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.630 
anyway this is my setup it's electronic
ignition<00:03:50.270> it's<00:03:50.870> for<00:03:51.590> for<00:03:51.920> my<00:03:52.010> purpose<00:03:52.460> it's

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
ignition it's for for my purpose it's

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.520 
ignition it's for for my purpose it's
great<00:03:52.850> it's<00:03:53.060> reliable<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:53.870> go<00:03:54.170> on<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.320> lot<00:03:54.410> of

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
great it's reliable I go on a lot of

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.590 
great it's reliable I go on a lot of
long<00:03:54.770> trips<00:03:55.010> with<00:03:55.130> this<00:03:55.250> bike<00:03:55.490> and<00:03:55.790> that's

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
long trips with this bike and that's

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.110 
long trips with this bike and that's
what<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:56.750> need<00:03:57.190> one<00:03:58.190> of<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.340> biggest<00:03:58.640> changes<00:03:58.820> I

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
what I need one of the biggest changes I

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.560 
what I need one of the biggest changes I
made<00:03:59.330> on<00:03:59.480> this<00:03:59.570> bike<00:03:59.840> is<00:04:00.790> swapping<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:01.910> 200

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
made on this bike is swapping that 200

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.420 
made on this bike is swapping that 200
millimeter<00:04:03.020> tire<00:04:03.350> from<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.650> crossbones<00:04:04.220> out

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
millimeter tire from the crossbones out

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.570 
millimeter tire from the crossbones out
for<00:04:04.670> this<00:04:05.020> 150<00:04:06.020> millimeter<00:04:06.680> dinah<00:04:06.980> tire<00:04:07.310> I

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
for this 150 millimeter dinah tire I

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.610 
for this 150 millimeter dinah tire I
think<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.090> looks<00:04:08.240> much<00:04:08.360> better<00:04:08.600> I<00:04:08.930> don't

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
think it looks much better I don't

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.900 
think it looks much better I don't
really<00:04:09.830> like<00:04:10.070> that<00:04:11.470> wide<00:04:12.470> tire<00:04:12.890> look<00:04:13.310> it's<00:04:13.760> a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
really like that wide tire look it's a

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.390 
really like that wide tire look it's a
Dyna<00:04:14.180> wheel<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.930> Dyna<00:04:15.200> tire<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.560> guess<00:04:15.980> it's

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
Dyna wheel and a Dyna tire I guess it's

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.650 
Dyna wheel and a Dyna tire I guess it's
150<00:04:16.940> millimeters

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
150 millimeters
