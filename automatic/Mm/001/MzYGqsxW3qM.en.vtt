00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.220
 that's it now it's almost done 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.230
 all the ontarians as they say are 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.450
 gone on vacation from their new port 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.280
 of temporary attachment he we imagine 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.190
 we who stay in the northern region 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.180
 disillusioned can be sad but mostly 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.130
 deprived of sun 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.199
 well let them imagine what they 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.390
 want the sun is there and it's fine 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.519
 there for almost a week 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.070
 the thermometer comes and goes around the 30 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.099
 degrees he even teased the 33 degrees 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.989
 under shelter on the side of Cambrai in a few 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.420
 days he became the main subject 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.340
 discussion we talk a lot and a 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.750
 of our worries number 1 now this is 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.800
 but what can we do well 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.469
 to refresh itself 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.180
 all means are good of course but 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.879
 the best is still a bath 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.850
 either at sea ​​or the pool or any 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.920
 stupidly at home and then after that he 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.840
 y to drink in this area 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.820
 he's happy people right now and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.829
 bistro bosses for them this is the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.469
 good season we sell everything and a lot 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.690
 but by the way in the region what is 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.549
 we drink when it's hot people 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.130
 are thirsty with good weather we sell 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.200
 diabolos hand the diabolos this title gold 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.880
 we sell vittel we make juice 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.640
 fruits but still it is necessary 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.549
 to say one thing is that beer being 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.240
 the favorite drink of the region 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.009
 drinks anyway 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.720
 usually one uses one drinks 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.470
 2 beat mathieu on it right or in 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.210
 wood 4 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.520
 is there an hour to drink from 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.900
 the beer throwing spawn a name that is 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.250
 11 hours they are that is twelve o'clock 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.450
 six hours due to the lack we have hot we have 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.450
 thirsty we drink beer 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.260
 to the 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:50.220
 mossy tease since I hear you me 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.220
 do you say 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.750
 but by dint of drinking beer and 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.869
 especially if he continues to do so too 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.340
 hot we wonder if like in 1959 and 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:07.069
 well a score of it was missing I do not 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.019
 do not think of the moment that they become 59 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.640
 it's not exactly right people 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.989
 was queuing wholesalers 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.910
 waited maybe two three four 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.150
 hours to have beer on the other hand 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.920
 in 1913 according to the memories we have 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.170
 of the profession he clearly missed 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.530
 of beer in the north there was more than 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.530
 war at all 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.270
 as you can notice this 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.200
 year it's not the reserves of 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.060
 beer that are missing 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.310
 there are stocks and deliverers 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.319
 continue their tour so this year 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.239
 despite the heat that persists and who 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.890
 incites aboard the northerners do not 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.810
 will not miss their favorite beverage 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.250
 and then the beer is not bad 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.470
 for health as long as you are 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.209
 reasonable of course the national committee 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.100
 defense against alcoholism even says 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.390
 that we can drink up to one liter and 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.700
 half safe for health 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.440
 it's still so good and 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.930
 what to drink in a day 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.220
 and then why deny it because if 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.019
 ourselves here in the north that the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.880
 manufacture or manufacture a lot 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.910
 better done the production in hectoliters 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.900
 there are some here we make a million two 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.330
 hundred thousand hectoliters ie we 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.130
 about 25% of the production of the 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.090
 north which is 5 million hectoliters 10.5 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.190
 million slums of that represents 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.870
 how many people about 120 liters 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.299
 for the north and no calais so 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.370
 each inhabitant of the north wood 120 liters 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.430
 of beer a year babies included two y 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.049
 including the big vacation no it's 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.430
 rather month of may june when it does 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.220
 very nice month of may june this is where 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.670
 our biggest tip to good once 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.130
 cash 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.230
 once the 15th of July it's already less 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:42.359
 they say that beer makes you sweat but 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:44.900
 Finally, we do not see it going anyway 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.900
 do good 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.010
 I found 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.620
 we
