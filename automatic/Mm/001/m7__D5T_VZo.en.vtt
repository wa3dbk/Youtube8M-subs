00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.269 

in<00:00:05.750> this<00:00:05.899> problem<00:00:06.350> it<00:00:06.470> says<00:00:06.680> that<00:00:06.890> in<00:00:07.009> a<00:00:07.040> class

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:07.279 
in this problem it says that in a class

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.619 
in this problem it says that in a class
of<00:00:07.490> 25<00:00:07.939> students<00:00:09.400> 80%<00:00:10.400> of<00:00:10.639> the<00:00:11.000> class<00:00:11.240> turned

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:11.629 
of 25 students 80% of the class turned

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:13.810 
of 25 students 80% of the class turned
their<00:00:11.780> homework<00:00:12.110> in<00:00:12.289> on<00:00:12.379> time<00:00:12.760> how<00:00:13.760> many

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
their homework in on time how many

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.549 
their homework in on time how many
students<00:00:14.449> handed<00:00:14.779> their<00:00:14.900> homework<00:00:15.260> in<00:00:15.439> on

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
students handed their homework in on

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.340 
students handed their homework in on
time<00:00:16.090> so<00:00:17.090> basically<00:00:17.480> we<00:00:17.750> have<00:00:17.900> to<00:00:18.050> figure<00:00:18.320> out

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
time so basically we have to figure out

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.179 
time so basically we have to figure out
what<00:00:18.980> 80%<00:00:19.820> of<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.269> 25<00:00:20.720> students<00:00:21.199> is<00:00:21.410> which<00:00:22.009> is

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
what 80% of the 25 students is which is

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.210 
what 80% of the 25 students is which is
actually<00:00:22.339> most<00:00:22.849> of<00:00:23.029> the<00:00:23.089> students<00:00:24.039> there<00:00:25.039> are

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
actually most of the students there are

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.850 
actually most of the students there are
a<00:00:25.249> few<00:00:25.550> ways<00:00:25.759> of<00:00:25.999> solving<00:00:26.240> this<00:00:26.539> problem

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
a few ways of solving this problem

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.140 
a few ways of solving this problem
trying<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.250> find<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.520> percentage<00:00:29.970> of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
trying to find the percentage of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.060 
trying to find the percentage of
something<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.960> may<00:00:31.140> take<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.560> something

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
something you may take that something

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.280 
something you may take that something
which<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.700> case<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.150> 25<00:00:33.450> students<00:00:34.170> and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
which in this case is 25 students and

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.950 
which in this case is 25 students and
multiply<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.310> by<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.820> percentage<00:00:36.510> written

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
multiply that by the percentage written

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.810 
multiply that by the percentage written
as<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.200> decimal

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.780 

point<00:00:40.750> 8<00:00:40.960> is<00:00:41.200> the<00:00:41.260> most<00:00:41.770> simple<00:00:42.190> way<00:00:42.340> to<00:00:42.400> write

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
point 8 is the most simple way to write

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.160 
point 8 is the most simple way to write
80<00:00:43.030> percent<00:00:43.540> as<00:00:43.720> a<00:00:43.780> decimal<00:00:45.390> 8<00:00:46.390> times<00:00:46.690> 5<00:00:46.900> is<00:00:46.960> 40

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
80 percent as a decimal 8 times 5 is 40

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.360 
80 percent as a decimal 8 times 5 is 40
so<00:00:47.830> we<00:00:47.860> place<00:00:48.220> a<00:00:48.430> zero<00:00:48.730> carry<00:00:49.420> our<00:00:49.629> 4<00:00:49.960> 8<00:00:50.710> times<00:00:51.100> 2

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
so we place a zero carry our 4 8 times 2

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.190 
so we place a zero carry our 4 8 times 2
is<00:00:51.520> 16<00:00:52.030> plus<00:00:52.540> 4<00:00:52.780> is<00:00:52.960> 20

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.230 

and<00:00:56.290> we<00:00:56.770> have<00:00:56.980> one<00:00:57.190> place<00:00:57.460> value<00:00:57.820> after<00:00:58.150> our

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
and we have one place value after our

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.060 
and we have one place value after our
decimal<00:00:58.690> and<00:00:58.840> the<00:00:58.930> problem<00:00:59.410> so<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.800> same

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
decimal and the problem so the same

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.270 
decimal and the problem so the same
thing<00:01:00.310> has<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.610> be<00:01:00.640> true<00:01:00.760> for<00:01:01.270> our<00:01:01.300> answer<00:01:01.840> so

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
thing has to be true for our answer so

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.430 
thing has to be true for our answer so
we<00:01:03.280> would<00:01:03.460> say<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.670> 20<00:01:04.300> of<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.540> 25<00:01:04.989> students

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
we would say that 20 of the 25 students

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.380 
we would say that 20 of the 25 students
in<00:01:05.590> this<00:01:05.740> class<00:01:06.040> handed<00:01:06.700> their<00:01:06.850> homework<00:01:07.210> in

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
in this class handed their homework in

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.380 
in this class handed their homework in
on<00:01:07.570> time<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:09.430> may<00:01:09.580> check<00:01:09.790> our<00:01:09.970> answer<00:01:10.360> by

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
on time we may check our answer by

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.290 
on time we may check our answer by
writing<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:11.110> fraction<00:01:11.620> 20<00:01:12.220> out<00:01:12.340> of<00:01:12.370> 25<00:01:12.790> and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
writing the fraction 20 out of 25 and

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.270 
writing the fraction 20 out of 25 and
seeing<00:01:13.870> if<00:01:14.020> that<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:14.350> equivalent<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:15.040> the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
seeing if that is equivalent to the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.550 
seeing if that is equivalent to the
fraction<00:01:15.960> 80<00:01:16.960> out<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.260> 100

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.950 

and<00:01:19.670> notice<00:01:20.670> how<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> denominator<00:01:21.270> increases

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
and notice how the denominator increases

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.560 
and notice how the denominator increases
by<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> factor<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:22.979> four<00:01:23.399> and<00:01:23.790> also<00:01:24.119> notice<00:01:24.450> how

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
by a factor of four and also notice how

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.810 
by a factor of four and also notice how
the<00:01:24.600> numerator<00:01:25.189> increases<00:01:26.189> by<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> factor<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the numerator increases by a factor of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.649 
the numerator increases by a factor of
four<00:01:27.149> so<00:01:28.079> 20<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.619> 25<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.520> indeed<00:01:30.149> equal<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
four so 20 out of 25 is indeed equal to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.370 
four so 20 out of 25 is indeed equal to
80<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.530> 100<00:01:32.539> another<00:01:33.539> way<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.899> solving<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
80 out of 100 another way of solving the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.289 
80 out of 100 another way of solving the
same<00:01:34.560> problem<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.250> by<00:01:35.430> creating<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:36.060> ratio

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
same problem is by creating a ratio

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.310 
same problem is by creating a ratio
table

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
table

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.860 
table
the<00:01:39.040> ratio<00:01:39.430> for<00:01:39.670> our<00:01:39.790> table<00:01:40.210> is<00:01:40.390> going<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.750> be

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
the ratio for our table is going to be

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.940 
the ratio for our table is going to be
the<00:01:41.110> parts<00:01:41.500> as<00:01:41.680> compared<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:43.270> whole

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.670 

the<00:01:46.790> problem<00:01:47.240> states<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:47.689> 80%<00:01:47.869> of<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.470> class

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
the problem states that 80% of the class

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.490 
the problem states that 80% of the class
turned<00:01:49.040> in<00:01:49.130> their<00:01:49.250> homework<00:01:50.110> Edie<00:01:51.110> would<00:01:51.320> be

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
turned in their homework Edie would be

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.160 
turned in their homework Edie would be
the<00:01:51.619> part<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.570> 100<00:01:53.570> would<00:01:53.960> be<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.320> whole<00:01:56.170> and

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
the part and 100 would be the whole and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.440 
the part and 100 would be the whole and
it<00:01:57.470> also<00:01:57.619> says<00:01:57.979> that<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.520> class<00:01:58.729> has<00:01:58.970> 25

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
it also says that the class has 25

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.240 
it also says that the class has 25
students<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:00.290> is<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.560> total<00:02:00.740> amount<00:02:01.159> of

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
students and that is the total amount of

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.010 
students and that is the total amount of
students<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:01.759> we<00:02:01.909> must<00:02:02.119> put<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.600> in<00:02:02.810> our

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
students so we must put that in our

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.029 
students so we must put that in our
whole<00:02:03.350> category

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.920 

now<00:02:09.039> notice<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.520> 25<00:02:10.270> can<00:02:10.720> fit<00:02:10.990> into<00:02:11.340> 100<00:02:12.340> four

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
now notice that 25 can fit into 100 four

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.220 
now notice that 25 can fit into 100 four
times<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.790> whatever<00:02:16.090> number<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:16.720> write<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
times so whatever number we write in the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.050 
times so whatever number we write in the
part<00:02:17.500> category<00:02:18.070> right<00:02:18.340> next<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.820> number

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
part category right next to the number

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.020 
part category right next to the number
25<00:02:19.540> must<00:02:20.260> also<00:02:20.500> increase<00:02:21.100> by<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.490> factor<00:02:21.610> of

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
25 must also increase by a factor of

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.199 
25 must also increase by a factor of
four<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.830> must<00:02:24.130> create<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.520> total<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.030> 80

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
four and it must create a total of 80

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.150 
four and it must create a total of 80
and<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.990> only<00:02:26.200> thing<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:26.530> we<00:02:26.620> can<00:02:26.770> place<00:02:27.010> in

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
and the only thing that we can place in

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.570 
and the only thing that we can place in
this<00:02:27.250> category<00:02:27.610> here<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.510> number<00:02:28.780> 20<00:02:29.110> and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
this category here is the number 20 and

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.750 
this category here is the number 20 and
20<00:02:30.580> times<00:02:30.820> 4<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.390> equivalent<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.110> 80<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:33.580> that

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
20 times 4 is equivalent to 80 so that

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.940 
20 times 4 is equivalent to 80 so that
is<00:02:33.910> another<00:02:34.150> way<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.600> figuring<00:02:34.780> out<00:02:35.260> how<00:02:35.890> many

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
is another way of figuring out how many

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.710 
is another way of figuring out how many
students<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:36.850> class<00:02:37.180> turned<00:02:37.540> their

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
students in this class turned their

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.440 
students in this class turned their
homework<00:02:38.050> in<00:02:38.260> on<00:02:38.380> time
