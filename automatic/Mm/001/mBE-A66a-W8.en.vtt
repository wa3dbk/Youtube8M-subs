00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.610
 ah 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.049
 hello we are all in a new 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.119
 tutorial in which I'll show you how 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.540
 put thumbnails in videos of 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:23.189
 youtube without having to be a partner and 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:28.230
 this is a novelty so let's go 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.230
 let's go to the youtube page 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:34.450
 here 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.840
 the button is trier and we give the manager 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.840
 Of video 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.140
 and we will see all our videos as 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.480
 you can see in some and the 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.710
 miniatures that you 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.050
 I do it with this program here 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.820
 for it's called artex 2 it's in the 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.820
 appstore for how many euros but 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.060
 how can you charge and if not also 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.800
 you can search by taringa and those places 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.550
 from here but good 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.250
 you can also see illustrator or the 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.760
 program 7 readers that you want 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.660
 to write things and then I'm going to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.660
 teach for example 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.219
 so there's no mistake, so we give 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.409
 edit and only here the video 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.920
 inconsequential here then below 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.899
 These will come out custom miniature 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.469
 we are here and well I have a 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:40.520
 thumbnail folder so all that 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:47.939
 I have done them and I already have one called 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:50.819
 they are perfect 4-4 and as you can see 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.970
 our number four federal kleenex will 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:56.880
 We select and automatically 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.459
 it has left us as of while it continues 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.289
 some do not come out okay I do not know why 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.110
 It will be because of people who have told me that 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:07.229
 it did not work out that he wants to give the clock 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.869
 but I know that is not there I have something 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.730
 more or less but I have not been given 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.799
 nothing on partner television and not much 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.650
 less because I think you need to have 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:19.290
 thousand reproductions and in the subscriber and 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.950
 things and they are rare so I do not have 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.550
 50 so 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.550
 good 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.599
 in four minutes the three that come already 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.030
 with the video and this shows so 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.750
 we already selected and we will save 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.470
 the changes 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.050
 OK 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.000
 according to the ying bad because you feel here 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.470
 do not address them and we remain with the manager of 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.170
 video 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.540
 and it can automatically take a 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.180
 little in updating the image but as 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.910
 you can see here and it puts you number 4 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.900
 of the writer area and we already have good 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.270
 Well, that's that easy, good guys, not 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.310
 there is no complication nothing more if 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.230
 These two videos and students so 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.460
 good 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.460
 and until the next video
