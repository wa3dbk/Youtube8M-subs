00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
want to cut up too and it's a good idea

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.839

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
to have click stop on hand or blood

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.330 
to have click stop on hand or blood
stopper<00:05:18.849> in<00:05:19.210> case<00:05:19.680> you<00:05:20.680> cut<00:05:20.860> into<00:05:21.009> the<00:05:21.189> wing

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
stopper in case you cut into the wing

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.580 
stopper in case you cut into the wing
but<00:05:21.580> as<00:05:21.789> you<00:05:22.300> can<00:05:22.419> see<00:05:22.659> they're<00:05:23.139> all<00:05:23.319> weight

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
but as you can see they're all weight

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.369 
but as you can see they're all weight
none<00:05:23.830> of<00:05:23.860> them<00:05:24.039> are<00:05:24.159> bleeding<00:05:24.990> so<00:05:25.990> that's<00:05:26.169> that

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379 
none of them are bleeding so that's that

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:30.050 
none of them are bleeding so that's that
that's<00:05:26.650> how<00:05:26.830> you<00:05:26.860> do<00:05:27.039> it

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.890
