chorus<00:00:17.160> before<00:00:18.160> we<00:00:18.250> start<00:00:18.490> playing<00:00:18.670> with<00:00:18.910> the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
chorus before we start playing with the

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.230 
chorus before we start playing with the
pedal<00:00:19.510> it<00:00:20.080> would<00:00:20.320> be<00:00:20.500> beneficial<00:00:21.160> for<00:00:21.340> us<00:00:21.880> to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
pedal it would be beneficial for us to

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.750 
pedal it would be beneficial for us to
understand<00:00:22.750> how<00:00:23.080> a<00:00:23.350> chorus<00:00:23.800> works<00:00:24.160> let's

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
understand how a chorus works let's

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.510 
understand how a chorus works let's
consider<00:00:25.119> a<00:00:25.390> guitar<00:00:25.810> track<00:00:25.990> guitar<00:00:26.830> track<00:00:27.340> is

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
consider a guitar track guitar track is

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.850 
consider a guitar track guitar track is
right<00:00:27.699> here<00:00:28.000> if<00:00:28.150> I<00:00:28.570> copy<00:00:28.840> that<00:00:29.230> guitar<00:00:29.560> track

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
right here if I copy that guitar track

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.670 
right here if I copy that guitar track
right<00:00:30.610> here<00:00:30.640> I'm<00:00:31.300> gonna<00:00:31.539> have<00:00:31.720> both<00:00:32.020> sounds

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
right here I'm gonna have both sounds

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.799 
right here I'm gonna have both sounds
play<00:00:32.980> at<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.190> same<00:00:33.399> time<00:00:33.760> if<00:00:34.210> I<00:00:34.420> take<00:00:34.629> that

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
play at the same time if I take that

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.590 
play at the same time if I take that
second<00:00:35.350> track<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:35.980> now<00:00:36.280> add<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.790> that<00:00:36.940> track<00:00:37.329> a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
second track and now add to that track a

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:46.830 
second track and now add to that track a
vibrato<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:43.180> it<00:00:43.470> is<00:00:44.470> gonna<00:00:44.710> create<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
vibrato with it is gonna create the

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.080 
vibrato with it is gonna create the
chorus<00:00:47.200> effect<00:00:47.620> now<00:00:48.489> that<00:00:48.700> you<00:00:48.790> know<00:00:48.910> how<00:00:49.059> a

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
chorus effect now that you know how a

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.180 
chorus effect now that you know how a
chorus<00:00:49.510> works<00:00:49.780> these<00:00:50.290> knobs<00:00:50.620> are<00:00:50.829> gonna<00:00:50.980> make

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
chorus works these knobs are gonna make

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.760 
chorus works these knobs are gonna make
much<00:00:51.550> more<00:00:51.790> sense<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:52.570> speed<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.230> depth<00:00:53.530> and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
much more sense to speed the depth and

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.160 
much more sense to speed the depth and
the<00:00:54.040> tone<00:00:54.280> are<00:00:54.550> going<00:00:54.700> to<00:00:54.760> affect<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.690> second

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
the tone are going to affect the second

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.560 
the tone are going to affect the second
track<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.980> track<00:00:57.280> on<00:00:57.489> which<00:00:57.670> we<00:00:57.879> have<00:00:58.090> the

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
track the track on which we have the

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.270 
track the track on which we have the
vibrato<00:00:58.930> effects<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.680> that's<00:00:59.829> why<00:01:00.010> if<00:01:00.160> you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
vibrato effects and that's why if you

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.600 
vibrato effects and that's why if you
compare<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:01.300> chorus<00:01:01.690> pedal<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.250> vibrato

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
compare the chorus pedal to the vibrato

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.109 
compare the chorus pedal to the vibrato
pedal<00:01:04.149> very<00:01:04.539> similar<00:01:05.049> controls<00:01:05.500> speed<00:01:06.340> depth

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
pedal very similar controls speed depth

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.120 
pedal very similar controls speed depth
and<00:01:07.390> tone<00:01:07.930> in<00:01:08.200> order<00:01:08.470> to<00:01:08.619> have<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.799> perfect

and tone in order to have a perfect
chorus<00:01:09.940> effect<00:01:10.479> we<00:01:11.110> need<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:12.010> original<00:01:12.460> track

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
chorus effect we need the original track

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.030 
chorus effect we need the original track
and<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.900> track<00:01:14.170> on<00:01:14.320> which<00:01:14.470> we<00:01:14.710> added<00:01:14.860> a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
and the track on which we added a

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.609 
and the track on which we added a
vibrato<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.640> be<00:01:15.940> at<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.270> same<00:01:16.510> level<00:01:16.780> that's

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
vibrato to be at the same level that's

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.580 
vibrato to be at the same level that's
what<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.610> effect<00:01:19.000> level<00:01:19.299> is<00:01:19.659> for<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.290> corona

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
what the effect level is for the corona

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.560 
what the effect level is for the corona
chorus<00:01:21.040> has<00:01:21.280> three<00:01:21.760> different<00:01:21.939> modes<00:01:22.270> a

chorus has three different modes a
standard<00:01:23.320> chorus<00:01:23.680> mode<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.280> toneprint<00:01:25.000> mode

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
standard chorus mode a toneprint mode

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.370 
standard chorus mode a toneprint mode
which<00:01:25.450> allows<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:26.439> pedal<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.430> receive

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
which allows the pedal to receive

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.080 
which allows the pedal to receive
previously<00:01:29.380> created<00:01:29.920> patches<00:01:30.760> by<00:01:30.939> your

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
previously created patches by your

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.179 
previously created patches by your
favorite<00:01:31.420> artists<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.380> tri<00:01:32.619> chorus<00:01:32.979> mode

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
favorite artists and the tri chorus mode

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.550 
favorite artists and the tri chorus mode
the<00:01:33.670> Tri<00:01:33.909> chorus<00:01:34.299> mode<00:01:34.509> is<00:01:34.689> very<00:01:34.869> similar<00:01:35.380> to

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
the Tri chorus mode is very similar to

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.410 
the Tri chorus mode is very similar to
the<00:01:35.680> standard<00:01:35.950> chorus<00:01:36.549> mode<00:01:36.759> but<00:01:37.000> this<00:01:37.119> time

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
the standard chorus mode but this time

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.870 
the standard chorus mode but this time
we're<00:01:37.930> gonna<00:01:37.990> have<00:01:38.110> three<00:01:38.710> tracks<00:01:39.280> an

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
we're gonna have three tracks an

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.600 
we're gonna have three tracks an
original<00:01:40.360> track<00:01:40.659> and<00:01:41.020> two<00:01:41.920> tracks<00:01:42.310> on<00:01:42.580> which

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
original track and two tracks on which

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.700 
original track and two tracks on which
we<00:01:42.939> added<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.330> vibrato<00:01:43.720> which<00:01:44.290> is<00:01:44.470> going<00:01:44.650> to

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
we added a vibrato which is going to

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.250 
we added a vibrato which is going to
create<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.070> wider<00:01:45.490> type<00:01:45.909> of<00:01:46.180> chorus

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.320 

let's<00:01:53.260> go<00:01:53.440> back<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.890> standard<00:01:54.250> chorus<00:01:54.970> not

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
let's go back to the standard chorus not

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:05.830 
let's go back to the standard chorus not
too<00:01:55.660> fast<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.410> wave

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.479 

I'm<00:02:06.840> going<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.079> crease<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.350> speed<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.310> that

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
I'm going to crease the speed so that

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.400 
I'm going to crease the speed so that
that<00:02:08.759> second<00:02:09.300> tracks<00:02:09.599> vibrato

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
that second tracks vibrato

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:24.240 
that second tracks vibrato
is<00:02:11.069> going<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> little<00:02:11.760> faster

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.150 

turn<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.370> all<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.670> way<00:02:25.760> down

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.640 

now<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.220> vibrato<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:31.910> very<00:02:32.240> slow<00:02:33.050> let's<00:02:33.470> go

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
now the vibrato is very slow let's go

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.580 
now the vibrato is very slow let's go
back<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.190> depth<00:02:34.610> at<00:02:34.910> about<00:02:35.540> fifty<00:02:36.410> percent

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
back to a depth at about fifty percent

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.580 
back to a depth at about fifty percent
I'm<00:02:37.490> going<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.820> increase<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.210> speed<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
I'm going to increase the speed of the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.790 
I'm going to increase the speed of the
vibrato<00:02:43.600> almost<00:02:44.600> sounds<00:02:44.870> like<00:02:44.900> Leslie<00:02:45.530> kind

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
vibrato almost sounds like Leslie kind

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.950 
vibrato almost sounds like Leslie kind
of<00:02:45.860> effect<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.910> should<00:02:53.270> be<00:02:53.420> an<00:02:53.660> excellent

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
of effect this should be an excellent

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.900 
of effect this should be an excellent
addition<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.590> anyone<00:02:55.100> looking<00:02:55.340> for<00:02:55.580> a

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
addition to anyone looking for a
