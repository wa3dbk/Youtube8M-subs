00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
the blue buff and they loop back around

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.550 
the blue buff and they loop back around
to<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.850> bot<00:01:45.149> lane<00:01:45.390> with<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.380> type<00:01:46.530> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
to go to bot lane with this type of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.840 
to go to bot lane with this type of
route<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.009> want<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.220> make<00:01:47.340> sure<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.759> they

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
route you want to make sure that they

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.450 
route you want to make sure that they
are<00:01:47.970> indeed<00:01:48.240> doing<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.780> by<00:01:49.020> checking<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.220> see

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
are indeed doing this by checking to see

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.010 
are indeed doing this by checking to see
if<00:01:50.490> they've<00:01:50.700> shown<00:01:50.939> themselves<00:01:51.119> either<00:01:51.570> top

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
if they've shown themselves either top

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.410 
if they've shown themselves either top
lane<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:52.470> mid<00:01:53.100> lane<00:01:53.310> because<00:01:53.880> with<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.240> type

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
lane or mid lane because with this type

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.880 
lane or mid lane because with this type
of<00:01:54.450> route<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.899> much<00:01:55.079> more<00:01:55.259> easier<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
of route it's much more easier for the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.139 
of route it's much more easier for the
jungler<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> gank<00:01:56.430> those<00:01:56.640> lanes<00:01:56.880> because

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
jungler to gank those lanes because

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.120 
jungler to gank those lanes because
they're<00:01:57.509> closer<00:01:57.810> instead<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.649> wasting<00:01:58.799> time

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
they're closer instead of wasting time

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.440 
they're closer instead of wasting time
walking<00:01:59.430> all<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.700> way<00:01:59.820> back<00:02:00.030> down<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
walking all the way back down to the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.749 
walking all the way back down to the
bottling<00:02:01.100> alright<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.549> an<00:02:02.670> example

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
bottling alright so this is an example

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.319 
bottling alright so this is an example
of<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.630> blue<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> red<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> bot<00:02:05.939> lane<00:02:06.090> gang

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
of a blue to a red to a bot lane gang

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.139 
of a blue to a red to a bot lane gang
again<00:02:07.320> look<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.220> see<00:02:08.520> where<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.879> min<00:02:09.000> later

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
again look to see where the min later

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.300 
again look to see where the min later
comes<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.599> lane<00:02:09.750> from<00:02:09.959> comes<00:02:10.679> from<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.920> here<00:02:11.160> so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
comes the lane from comes from I here so

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.160 
comes the lane from comes from I here so
say<00:02:11.459> blue<00:02:11.700> buff<00:02:11.879> stir<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.300> also<00:02:13.020> they're

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
say blue buff stir and also they're

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.670 
say blue buff stir and also they're
laying

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
laying

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.140

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
kind of get a feel for the gank because

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.420 
kind of get a feel for the gank because
they<00:02:36.930> walk<00:02:37.200> up<00:02:37.439> like<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.739> just<00:02:37.980> randomly

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
they walk up like this just randomly

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.459 
they walk up like this just randomly
your<00:02:39.239> kind<00:02:39.389> of<00:02:39.450> tips<00:02:39.659> us<00:02:39.750> off<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.200> because

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
your kind of tips us off and because

they start walking up past the caster

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.119 
they start walking up past the caster
minions<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:43.200> even<00:02:43.349> more<00:02:43.650> alarming<00:02:43.889> because

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
minions it's even more alarming because

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.800 
minions it's even more alarming because
nobody<00:02:44.579> really<00:02:44.639> does<00:02:44.909> that<00:02:45.209> nobody<00:02:45.510> plays

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
backup and indeed we're getting ganks so

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.280 
backup and indeed we're getting ganks so
although<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.359> do<00:02:51.419> have<00:02:51.480> Ward's<00:02:51.900> be<00:02:52.019> able<00:02:52.200> to

although we do have Ward's be able to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.229 
although we do have Ward's be able to
kind<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.620> escape<00:02:52.889> that<00:02:53.220> luckily<00:02:53.430> enough<00:02:53.939> and

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
kind of escape that luckily enough and

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.599 
kind of escape that luckily enough and
that's<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:54.510> an<00:02:54.659> example<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.439> red<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:56.579> a

wrap up we'll talk a little bit about

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.199 
wrap up we'll talk a little bit about
