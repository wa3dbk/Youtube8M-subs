00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.170
 hello today i want to test the app 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.250
 vsc ok a relatively controversial app 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.469
 some of you might have them 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.170
 ever installed and then have 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.900
 Maybe that's not what found 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.840
 you expected the app needs it 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.310
 first start pretty long until you 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:31.920
 because sometimes it is ready if you 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.920
 The app can now find pictures 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.460
 to import into the library or yourself 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.550
 which record with the camera 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.200
 You can buy effects in the store 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.930
 I have to test 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.430
 the complete package bought at the top 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.520
 there are all 38 presets in it 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.559
 for the price of four euro 52 at the moment 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.500
 still 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.100
 supposedly the 16 us dollars then 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.340
 cost someday 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.450
 Well, I have all the defects 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.799
 downloaded 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.810
 also the free effects if you 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.869
 now here in this store overview 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.470
 once the effects look on 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.360
 one always has letters here 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:35.670
 sg1 to se 3 for example or here at 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:39.680
 g there is a g1 to g 3 that pulls 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:44.100
 here through the entire category 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.189
 when I go to library ge and one 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.970
 image open what I provided with effects 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.770
 I would like to have to go down here 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.110
 this wrench the brush 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.420
 then the picture will be opened then 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.649
 I see these letters here 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.990
 number combination 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.600
 the stupid thing is here 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.320
 I can not see anymore now 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.580
 what was that actually an effect 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.509
 I can only do this here 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.509
 apply effect 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.180
 i can put all the effects through here 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.500
 scroll 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.629
 but as I said I can now 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.620
 example no longer see what that for 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.989
 an effect was 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.870
 Of course you can also stay here 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.269
 make further adjustments that it 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.769
 no problem 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.720
 What disturbs me now is mainly 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:39.859
 I can not see here what 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:42.670
 for an effect that was now has become 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.670
 the app ends 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.129
 As you can see, it takes a lot of time 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:55.239
 long until the app starts it is 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:58.450
 also a minus point I think because it 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:02.769
 simply gives android loads of apps 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:08.950
 offer the same and the more comfortable 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:10.739
 are and above all things faster 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.370
 start 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:19.290
 so now the app and emotional is because you 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.569
 Of course this can also be done at vs.de 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.510
 sign up and a so-called device 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.310
 set up where then his pictures 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.719
 upload this is an account like 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.329
 instagram I guess or something like 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:38.500
 flickr just stop here at the 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:41.319
 make the app personally 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.449
 my flickr account because I'm there 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:49.299
 regardless'm not load the 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.220
 times there is a picture I have to test times 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.680
 uploaded 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.500
 Here I can still settings 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.879
 In addition, for example, a make 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:04.349
 profile picture and my personal data 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.349
 then there is the journal here 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:12.930
 everything is of course dependent on 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.930
 internet if it works it says 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.699
 good that the app is free because 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.880
 In my opinion, that would be no money 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:28.729
 worth of the filters now apart 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.490
 the filters cost four euro 52 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.310
 someone who deals with photography and 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.620
 processing and filtering 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.660
 May I work really hard 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.310
 maybe inspired by these filters 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.520
 his 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.889
 I personally do not find anything special 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.660
 at the filter 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.389
 personally , it would be enough if the 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.210
 App would start a little faster 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.780
 and if it does not work 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.850
 would crash that would ever be one 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.500
 Nice thing 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.919
 I think there will be some updates 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.220
 Submitted in the future this 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.690
 fix teething problems 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.729
 at the moment it is really no fun 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.180
 app because we like you see 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:17.419
 you wait you do not know what you are looking for 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.900
 Just wait around for this one 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.060
 see 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.160
 I assume now images are loaded 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.500
 exactly the other user already made 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.289
 to have 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:30.349
 normal everyday pictures like you 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:36.169
 you on flickr or google + for example 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:37.669
 to find millions like me already 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.639
 said and probably you 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:43.400
 itself also knows there are quite a few apps 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.139
 with which you can do something like that yes 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.930
 There is not much more here now 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.090
 say you can do that yourself 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.660
 try in the store are some 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.849
 filter for free it is mine now 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.910
 opinion about nothing special nothing 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.240
 what you should have been waiting for now 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.490
 The app was indeed with great fanfare 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.710
 her filter is announced for example 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.530
 there is a small one for free 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.020
 description including but as I said 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.080
 so do not expect too much it is not 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.630
 but I'll say the blast 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.449
 maybe the maker of that will surprise us 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.940
 app year or the makers and submit 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:26.270
 update to which then the super 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.250
 we'll just be there 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.950
 curious what the future of this app 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.050
 will bring 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.500
 I'll say goodbye until the moment 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.500
 next time
