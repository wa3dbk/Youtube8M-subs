Facebook only owned ninety percent of
the<00:02:15.580> company<00:02:16.030> not<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> hundred<00:02:16.750> percent

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
the company not a hundred percent

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.890 
the company not a hundred percent
however<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.250> always<00:02:18.430> makes<00:02:18.849> sense<00:02:19.150> if<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.599> 90

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
however it always makes sense if the 90

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.839 
however it always makes sense if the 90
percent<00:02:20.349> in<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.680> end<00:02:20.769> is<00:02:20.950> much<00:02:21.280> better<00:02:21.580> than

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
percent in the end is much better than

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.130 
percent in the end is much better than
100<00:02:22.269> percent<00:02:22.690> before<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:24.420> maybe<00:02:25.420> Peter<00:02:25.780> Thiel

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
100 percent before and maybe Peter Thiel
