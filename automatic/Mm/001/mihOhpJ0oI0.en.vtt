 unusual 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:11.929
 1 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.540
 only after criticism 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.730
 Blow by blow and now several times Netbook similar to the Asus Eee 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.109
 PC 1000he 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.150
 Dean with 10 inch screen 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.050
 the Eee PC 1000he 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.909
 is actually different from the engineering room 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:28.849
 from the previous model Nano 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.989
 the big difference is of course Tel 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.209
 Christine screen with a diagonal of 10 inches 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.570
 as these have become even larger through the chassis infinite is one 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.330
 big keyboard 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.430
 the course 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.990
 many users are very interesting because even this keyboard is clear 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.800
 on 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.340
 especially as the guest became larger by two to three millimeters 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.070
 the roof is held 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.790
 as well as the new 01 or dates have hundreds off 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.730
 Politician carries that means 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.300
 Two more fingers moving up and down Kamil Stoch Scroll or Meal Meals 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.320
 Documents 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.320
 but you can move any opposite 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.850
 the keys are pulled forward it means 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.090
 You can also start from scratch 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.410
 make the mind that 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.560
 that is a concept has therefore rounded off to practical 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.770
 edge 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.930
 lives shiny surface 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.150
 the clock has been polished though 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.450
 the case a bit more sensitive 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.130
 at the ports in Germany in Sebnitz they basically took 1000 eggs 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.340
 nothing was as varied 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.240
 as well as the previous models the plan connecting the USB's eyes outputs 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.619
 here card-reader he is not coped with Bayer 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.620
 normal hard drive installed 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.360
 Orban here the two usb interfaces 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.480
 and the 4th 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.620
 the bike and is up 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.750
 again 1-comeback 3 canned 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.750
 Proteins for video conferencing two microphones 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.400
 you can too 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.399
 over the internet Viktor Troicki 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.509
 The technology inside is again an Intel Atom processor 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.329
 Smith as a concept study 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.789
 these consumption-related electricity product aspects together 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:24.479
 Zwicker sticks with Wachsmann for six to seven hours 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:27.109
 and switched on 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.109
 the balance even 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.249
 underneath it, you can see that one gigabyte of memory is here 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.419
 can put the paper shows 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.619
 the Wiener Motoren with 300 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:43.309
 post-cup and no normal notebook hard drive Jens Wagner 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:44.859
 5 Inch format 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.929
 with a capacity of 160 gigawatts 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:50.019
 earlier Ekici models 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.589
 flash memory 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:53.999
 against Jena 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:57.009
 Space basically the Eee PC 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.749
 almost no way over 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.679
 and says notebook 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:03.629
 that does not cost that much 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.479
 to note is that earlier models 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:10.889
 boot up for chess that means you shake your head you could on the 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.209
 Throw ground 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.069
 4 1 percent of a data is not lost 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.239
 female c 1000 should learn to handle it more cautiously 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.549
 The mechanical hard disk is much more sensitive to shocks 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.539
 the brightness of the display on the Eee PC 1000he 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:30.590
 is not over 500 more 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.009
 they are smart by fast 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.469
 it is noticeably brighter than the predecessor models that are between 80 and 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:37.929
 100 Klux Klan 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:42.499
 came with the construction of the ICE and therefore also working near windows or 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:43.819
 even outdoors 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.179
 As long as not 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:48.839
 this has the key data radiates otherwise the matte display 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:50.969
 starting team 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:54.619
 the first 1000 differs from the technology also on the 4th 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.299
 London 1 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.329
 but by the larger dimension this is true even if God wants it 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.069
 and that's for sure 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.289
 good is also if 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:05.589
 for many users 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.879
 through the big keyboard 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.879
 and that's interesting for prolific writers 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.509
 complete the report 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.789
