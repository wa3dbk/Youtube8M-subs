00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.139
 good in this new video I will show you 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.859
 two applications that will help us 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.689
 to see our movies online 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.840
 free good the first 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.600
 application that we will see is snail 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.720
 and the truth for me is very good 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.720
 application 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.809
 and something else what I see about this application 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.570
 is that you can all your movies are not 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.720
 are new the truth is that they have some 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.850
 time they left but still the 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.830
 truth is that it is very good application 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.370
 that shows you the applications in very 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.699
 good definition and 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.290
 with very good audio and good when 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.050
 we open can be the interface that we 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.900
 It shows that I like to I like 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.060
 much 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.340
 as you see here, you 're going to the whole section 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.100
 d 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.310
 of movies and series 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.460
 as you see in the bottom part 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.290
 we have a few doors how many 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.840
 tabs that show up whether they're 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.750
 only in our movies the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.780
 movies that are available too 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.380
 we can see what series are 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.260
 they are quite serious and they are all 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.820
 complete 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.330
 to anyone 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.330
 Y 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:41.280
 as you see it shows us a small 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:46.450
 a little description of what it is 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.399
 this series and well here it gives us some 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.640
 how many options of how we want to see it 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.770
 if in Spanish or English with gasol goes to 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.020
 life in Spanish 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.930
 and how well can you 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.900
 it shows us 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.460
 the seasons is season 1 the 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.130
 season 2 although I do not find 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.350
 completely products 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.200
 and as you see, it shows us all the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.910
 episodes of the first season and if 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.330
 because we really just do 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.330
 we give here and how they see will begin to load 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.250
 and well this would be the issue of 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.990
 truth is very good as if we are going to 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.400
 the next tab then our 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.540
 and 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.720
 the series or movie that we got to 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.140
 add to our list or to our 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.830
 collection 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.820
 here in two movies 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.940
 and good if it 's like that would be a lifetime 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.480
 the application that the truth is very good 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.450
 if you want to see 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.900
 movies in very good definition and with 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.959
 a good sound and well that would be all 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.849
 that would be all this direction and good 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.940
 now we will see what are the following 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.100
 what is I movie 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.680
 and good as you see when opening it 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.450
 will give you two options to search 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.450
 movies either in English or in Spanish 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.190
 and will be looking for all the movies 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.410
 Available in Spanish but good thing 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.090
 bad that does not always show you all the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.580
 movies totally in Spanish there are 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.400
 some that only shows her 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.290
 subtitled and well as you see here then 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.910
 shows us all the movies that 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.440
 are available 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:39.830
 Young is a very long list that 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.800
 the truth has and has very good 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.480
 movies a few in a very 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.090
 good definition but some 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.340
 unfortunately they eat us if we go 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:54.530
 here if we see a goes in the low part of 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.480
 any movie shows us a 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.700
 small square 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.769
 what does it tell us in which server it is 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.920
 Available if available in what 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.010
 is youtube or directly in the 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.470
 browser in the movie server of 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.549
 its application in case we want 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.010
 see a movie because it shows us what 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.389
 who are these different options 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.180
 we can see directly in our 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.790
 browser or from youtube from the 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.130
 application you look play we want to see 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.710
 a server application of it 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.600
 application then it will tell us that from that 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.420
 it takes a little longer in what it is to load 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.090
 this movie 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:40.640
 and good as you can see, it's a very 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:45.180
 extensive that does not have all the movies 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:48.590
 of very good definition or sometimes as he 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.169
 the sound is a bit late 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.380
 but good and the truth is that most 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:58.970
 well it works very well I do not complain much 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.010
 of this application and good 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:05.430
 and I told them to look around to see 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.860
 the movies is very good definition and 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.220
 with a very good audio great clip it is 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.890
 the best application believed that then 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.260
 his two films are not the newest 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.380
 they are already movies that already have 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.320
 a time 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.630
 and they came out but well in case 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.970
 They wanted to see a movie, nothing, 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.220
 you can search here maybe maybe the 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.310
 find and the truth is that they 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.550
 I recommend these two applications 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:38.050
 I've tried a lot and I think the truth 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.050
 they are the best applications 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.930
 and see if we go to the top 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.690
 of the application because it opens us what it is 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.270
 the search engine that we can look for some 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.540
 application that I will look for the games of the 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.540
 hungry' 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:00.399
 and good as we have the name is read 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:02.409
 town we will give you in search and it will be 

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:04.029
 looking if yes is it finds the 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.429
 movie and as you can see here are the 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:09.789
 hamas games but as you can see is 

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:12.759
 subtitled and good because the truth is 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:16.119
 that I am very good application and good 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:18.219
 here this would be everything I hope there is 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:19.749
 liked that the applications the truth 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:23.169
 is that I highly recommend you these 

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:25.239
 applications as I tell you then great 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.789
 Well, they do not have the most movies 

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:30.969
 bad but if they are very good 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:32.379
 definition and I recommend them a lot and 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:36.610
 in case you want to see some 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:39.849
