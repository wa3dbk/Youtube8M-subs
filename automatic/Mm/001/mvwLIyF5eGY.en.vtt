case I have for my tea or heavy horse
mighty<00:00:37.860> horse<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.250> remember<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.730> think

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
mighty horse I remember with I think

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.360 
mighty horse I remember with I think
their<00:00:39.000> mighty<00:00:39.239> horse<00:00:39.480> no<00:00:40.050> heavy<00:00:40.290> horse<00:00:40.559> heavy

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
their mighty horse no heavy horse heavy

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.010 
their mighty horse no heavy horse heavy
horse<00:00:41.640> they're<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> great<00:00:42.180> value<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> cost

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
horse they're a great value for the cost

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.660 
horse they're a great value for the cost
in<00:00:43.260> my<00:00:43.350> opinion<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:43.710> mighty<00:00:44.190> horse<00:00:44.460> are

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
in my opinion I think mighty horse are

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.190 
in my opinion I think mighty horse are
an<00:00:44.760> even<00:00:45.030> better<00:00:45.270> value<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.870> cost<00:00:46.050> I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
an even better value for the cost I

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.479 
an even better value for the cost I
think<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.500> Nervii<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> who<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.280> field

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
think it's the Nervii I who can field

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.090 
think it's the Nervii I who can field
mighty<00:00:47.879> horse<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.829> course<00:00:49.860> my

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
mighty horse and then of course my

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.619 
mighty horse and then of course my
generals<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.579> noble<00:00:50.850> horse<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.180> most<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> my

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
generals in a noble horse so most of my

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.779 
generals in a noble horse so most of my
powers<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.320> my<00:00:52.440> calves<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.610> beware

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
of shock calves still and again my my

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.000 
of shock calves still and again my my
idea<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.809> pretty<00:00:57.930> simple<00:00:58.050> support<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> calf

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010

still<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.070> great<00:01:41.340> damage<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> good<00:01:43.320> good

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
still have great damage so a good good

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.740 
still have great damage so a good good
unit<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.070> bring<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.060> available<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.720> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
unit to bring if it's available to you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.310 
unit to bring if it's available to you
so<00:01:46.229> my<00:01:46.920> opponent<00:01:47.100> has<00:01:47.369> made<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.119> think<00:01:48.840> some

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
so my opponent has made a I think some

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.910 
so my opponent has made a I think some
some<00:01:49.920> sensible<00:01:50.399> choices<00:01:51.329> here<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.320> Ptolemaic

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
some sensible choices here is Ptolemaic

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.149 
some sensible choices here is Ptolemaic
cab<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.340> pretty<00:01:53.549> expensive<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.829> not<00:01:55.829> sure<00:01:56.040> how

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
cab is pretty expensive and not sure how

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.280 
cab is pretty expensive and not sure how
that's<00:01:56.340> gonna<00:01:56.490> turn<00:01:56.610> out<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.290> be

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
that's gonna turn out to be

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.959 
that's gonna turn out to be
cost-effective<00:01:58.799> his<00:01:59.250> Ptolemaic<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.820> would

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
cost-effective his Ptolemaic I would

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.149 
cost-effective his Ptolemaic I would
have<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.180> kill<00:02:00.390> entirely<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.799> my<00:02:01.950> heavy

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
have to kill entirely to of my heavy

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.740 
have to kill entirely to of my heavy
horse<00:02:02.430> which<00:02:03.210> i<00:02:03.360> think<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.990> unlikely<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.600> I'm

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
horse which i think is unlikely so I'm

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.389 
horse which i think is unlikely so I'm
in<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> bit<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.229> standoff<00:02:07.710> with<00:02:07.770> my<00:02:08.009> opponent

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
in a bit of a standoff with my opponent

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.410 
in a bit of a standoff with my opponent
here<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.550> don't<00:02:08.640> want<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.179> charge

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
here I don't want to just charge

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.729 
here I don't want to just charge
straight<00:02:09.720> at<00:02:09.959> him<00:02:10.080> yet<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:10.500> I'm<00:02:10.619> not

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
straight at him yet because I'm not

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.040 
straight at him yet because I'm not
exactly<00:02:10.920> sure<00:02:11.310> how<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.640> want<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
exactly sure how I want to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.810 
exactly sure how I want to
what<00:02:12.350> he's<00:02:12.440> brought<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:13.430> I'm<00:02:13.520> kind<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.760> just

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
what he's brought so I'm kind of just

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.310 
what he's brought so I'm kind of just
moving<00:02:14.090> around<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.510> little<00:02:14.600> bit<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:14.990> biding<00:02:15.290> my

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
moving around a little bit and biding my

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.040 
moving around a little bit and biding my
time<00:02:15.410> thinking<00:02:16.160> about<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.430> few<00:02:16.670> strategies<00:02:17.050> it

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
time thinking about a few strategies it

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.720 
time thinking about a few strategies it
is<00:02:18.170> fairly<00:02:18.440> simple<00:02:18.710> what<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.040> need<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.340> do<00:02:19.490> I

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
is fairly simple what I need to do I

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.430 
is fairly simple what I need to do I
need<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.090> get<00:02:20.210> in<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.480> destroy<00:02:20.780> his<00:02:20.930> pike<00:02:21.170> line

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
need to get in and destroy his pike line

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.110 
need to get in and destroy his pike line
with<00:02:21.710> my<00:02:21.860> skirmishers<00:02:22.340> but<00:02:22.550> he's<00:02:22.670> got<00:02:22.820> three

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
with my skirmishers but he's got three

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.420 
with my skirmishers but he's got three
light<00:02:23.300> peltasts<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.930> back<00:02:24.440> them<00:02:24.680> up<00:02:24.800> that's

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
light peltasts to back them up that's

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.730 
light peltasts to back them up that's
gonna<00:02:25.640> badly<00:02:26.210> damage<00:02:26.570> my<00:02:26.750> men<00:02:26.990> before<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.530> can

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
gonna badly damage my men before I can

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.010 
gonna badly damage my men before I can
probably<00:02:28.040> destroy<00:02:28.340> his<00:02:28.460> pike<00:02:28.670> line<00:02:28.930> but<00:02:29.930> at

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
probably destroy his pike line but at

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.600 
probably destroy his pike line but at
the<00:02:30.110> same<00:02:30.320> time<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.560> can't<00:02:30.890> always<00:02:31.130> got<00:02:31.370> four

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
the same time I can't always got four

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.220 
the same time I can't always got four
line<00:02:31.820> peltasts<00:02:32.270> it's<00:02:32.660> my<00:02:32.810> opponents<00:02:33.140> come

with<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.380> fairly<00:02:33.650> similar<00:02:34.010> idea<00:02:34.910> as<00:02:35.060> me<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:36.290> yeah

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
with a fairly similar idea as me so yeah

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.590 
with a fairly similar idea as me so yeah
the<00:02:36.890> thing<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.130> is<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.520> I<00:02:37.550> need<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:38.030> do<00:02:38.150> damage<00:02:38.420> to

are<00:05:15.919> kind<00:05:16.099> of<00:05:16.129> like<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.370> match<00:05:16.550> locks<00:05:16.939> of

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090

Roman<00:05:17.389> -<00:05:17.569> I'm<00:05:18.080> trying<00:05:18.349> to<00:05:18.439> drill<00:05:18.650> that<00:05:18.740> in

Roman - I'm trying to drill that in

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.189 
Roman - I'm trying to drill that in
because<00:05:19.729> I<00:05:19.759> think<00:05:19.939> that<00:05:20.210> it's<00:05:20.419> true<00:05:20.659> if<00:05:20.990> you

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
because I think that it's true if you

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.809 
because I think that it's true if you
all<00:05:21.319> disagree<00:05:21.770> that's<00:05:22.039> fine<00:05:22.310> but<00:05:22.550> right<00:05:22.669> now

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:22.819 
all disagree that's fine but right now

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:24.399 
all disagree that's fine but right now
from<00:05:23.000> what<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:23.150> see<00:05:23.389> if<00:05:23.539> they<00:05:23.689> can<00:05:23.840> act<00:05:24.050> in<00:05:24.229> much

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
from what I see if they can act in much

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.439 
from what I see if they can act in much
the<00:05:24.439> same<00:05:24.620> way<00:05:24.860> and<00:05:25.370> now<00:05:25.789> that<00:05:25.969> his<00:05:26.060> units<00:05:26.360> are

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
the same way and now that his units are

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.480 
the same way and now that his units are

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
people the benefit of the doubt but

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.320 
people the benefit of the doubt but
clearly<00:05:54.400> there's<00:05:55.400> one<00:05:55.610> of<00:05:55.729> two<00:05:55.759> things<00:05:56.090> that

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
clearly there's one of two things that

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.019 
clearly there's one of two things that
happen<00:05:56.629> here<00:05:57.009> one<00:05:58.009> people<00:05:58.430> think<00:05:58.819> that

00:05:59.019 --> 00:05:59.029 
happen here one people think that

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:00.820 
happen here one people think that
stopping<00:05:59.629> the<00:05:59.900> game<00:06:00.050> on<00:06:00.229> here<00:06:00.409> is<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:00.620> same<00:06:00.650> as

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
stopping the game on here is the same as

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.580 
stopping the game on here is the same as
conceding<00:06:01.460> defeat<00:06:01.490> on<00:06:01.909> Rome<00:06:02.150> 1<00:06:02.360> it's<00:06:02.900> not<00:06:03.199> when

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
conceding defeat on Rome 1 it's not when

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.680 
conceding defeat on Rome 1 it's not when
you<00:06:03.710> leave<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:04.069> game<00:06:04.250> it<00:06:04.490> forces<00:06:05.000> a<00:06:05.029> draw<00:06:05.360> and

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
you leave the game it forces a draw and

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.439 
you leave the game it forces a draw and
it's<00:06:06.500> not<00:06:06.650> fair<00:06:06.979> if<00:06:07.219> you're<00:06:07.490> gonna<00:06:07.610> go<00:06:07.879> in<00:06:08.120> to

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
it's not fair if you're gonna go in to

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.719 
it's not fair if you're gonna go in to
quick<00:06:08.719> battle<00:06:08.930> there<00:06:09.770> is<00:06:09.919> no<00:06:10.159> concede<00:06:10.610> defeat

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
quick battle there is no concede defeat

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.119 
quick battle there is no concede defeat
like<00:06:11.120> in<00:06:11.270> Rome<00:06:11.449> 1<00:06:11.690> so<00:06:12.050> in<00:06:12.319> case<00:06:12.560> this<00:06:12.740> was<00:06:12.919> just

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:13.129 
like in Rome 1 so in case this was just

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:14.469 
like in Rome 1 so in case this was just
an<00:06:13.219> error<00:06:13.400> in<00:06:13.550> my<00:06:13.669> opponents<00:06:13.849> part<00:06:14.210> of<00:06:14.330> not

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
an error in my opponents part of not

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.100 
an error in my opponents part of not
knowing<00:06:14.810> which<00:06:14.930> I<00:06:15.050> don't<00:06:15.110> think<00:06:15.319> it<00:06:15.620> was<00:06:17.110> stop

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
knowing which I don't think it was stop

the game
it<00:07:09.949> doesn't<00:07:10.219> matter<00:07:10.520> so<00:07:11.120> I<00:07:11.150> have<00:07:11.330> no<00:07:11.509> idea<00:07:11.539> why

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
doing i understand the game shows how

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.489 
doing i understand the game shows how
many<00:07:15.710> losses<00:07:16.129> you<00:07:16.460> have<00:07:16.639> this<00:07:17.180> one<00:07:17.419> doesn't<00:07:17.659> so

00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:18.499 
many losses you have this one doesn't so

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:20.230

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
I've just never understood that in fact

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.279 
I've just never understood that in fact
I<00:07:20.330> think<00:07:20.389> we<00:07:20.539> can<00:07:20.659> go<00:07:20.749> look<00:07:20.930> at<00:07:20.990> the<00:07:21.110> ladder

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:21.289 
I think we can go look at the ladder

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:23.830 
I think we can go look at the ladder
I'll<00:07:21.979> try<00:07:22.219> and<00:07:22.340> prove<00:07:22.520> it<00:07:22.729> so<00:07:23.360> it's<00:07:23.749> just

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 
I'll try and prove it so it's just

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.029 
I'll try and prove it so it's just
something<00:07:24.080> I<00:07:24.229> don't<00:07:24.349> understand<00:07:24.680> stop

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 
something I don't understand stop

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:27.790 
something I don't understand stop
quitting<00:07:25.990> leaderboards<00:07:26.990> don't<00:07:27.259> matter<00:07:27.499> and

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:40.490 
find it I guess maybe I understand why

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.119 
find it I guess maybe I understand why
they're<00:07:40.639> trying<00:07:40.759> to<00:07:41.409> to<00:07:42.409> do<00:07:42.560> it<00:07:42.710> but<00:07:42.889> I<00:07:42.919> mean
