 Management techniques well techniques for working with 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.180
 control panel I'll interrupt that 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.660
 the control panel doesnâ€™t change a bit 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.090
 is and if you do not know how and 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.150
 control panel where the light on the site you 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.840
 can not be wrong because there we 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.390
 everything is the same as on your computer 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.890
 so generally shorter long speech is higher but 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.650
 we keep making sense 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.959

 will allow you to block ip address but 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.590
 on your server, that is, no 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.180
 access this completely excludes dos 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:49.690
