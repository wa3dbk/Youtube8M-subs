00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.040 
so in between rounds coach Wesley and I
are<00:00:21.820> doing<00:00:21.939> a<00:00:22.090> pretty<00:00:22.270> cool<00:00:22.480> circuit<00:00:22.900> right

are doing a pretty cool circuit right
now<00:00:23.260> it<00:00:23.590> has<00:00:23.830> broad<00:00:24.130> jumps<00:00:24.640> in<00:00:24.760> it<00:00:24.910> skipping

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
now it has broad jumps in it skipping

gaining<00:01:07.119> size<00:01:07.659> okay<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:08.770> there's<00:01:09.430> different

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
gaining size okay and there's different

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.490 
gaining size okay and there's different
theories<00:01:10.270> on<00:01:10.450> how<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:10.659> go<00:01:10.840> about<00:01:10.869> doing<00:01:11.320> that

theories on how to go about doing that
now<00:01:11.979> hyper<00:01:12.310> growth<00:01:13.590> talks<00:01:14.590> about<00:01:14.800> a

now hyper growth talks about a

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.930 
now hyper growth talks about a
particular<00:01:15.520> principle<00:01:16.180> your<00:01:16.840> max<00:01:17.110> set<00:01:17.530> point

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.940 
particular principle your max set point
which<00:01:18.940> is<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:20.140> I<00:01:20.170> can<00:01:20.350> get<00:01:20.470> into<00:01:20.740> some

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
which is and I can get into some

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.130 
which is and I can get into some
specifics<00:01:21.070> with<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:21.910> course<00:01:22.120> it's<00:01:22.870> a<00:01:22.930> very

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
specifics with you of course it's a very

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.190 
specifics with you of course it's a very
simplistic<00:01:23.590> formula<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:25.630> take<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.870> weight

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
simplistic formula you take a weight

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.650 
simplistic formula you take a weight
that<00:01:26.230> you<00:01:26.710> typically<00:01:27.190> do<00:01:27.580> nine<00:01:27.880> or<00:01:28.090> ten<00:01:28.330> times

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
that you typically do nine or ten times

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.750 
that you typically do nine or ten times
let's<00:01:29.050> say<00:01:29.290> let's<00:01:29.740> make<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.010> real<00:01:30.310> easy<00:01:30.430> let's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
let's say let's make it real easy let's

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.360 
let's say let's make it real easy let's
say<00:01:30.910> it's<00:01:31.090> 200<00:01:31.630> pounds<00:01:32.020> right<00:01:32.230> and<00:01:32.650> you<00:01:32.740> do<00:01:32.920> 200

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
say it's 200 pounds right and you do 200

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.180 
say it's 200 pounds right and you do 200
pounds<00:01:33.790> for<00:01:34.330> 9<00:01:34.510> 10<00:01:34.810> reps<00:01:35.050> maybe<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:36.010> get<00:01:36.130> a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
pounds for 9 10 reps maybe you get a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.180 
pounds for 9 10 reps maybe you get a
couple<00:01:36.520> forced<00:01:36.790> reps<00:01:37.090> with<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.330> spot<00:01:37.630> or<00:01:37.660> okay

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
couple forced reps with a spot or okay

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.870 
couple forced reps with a spot or okay
but<00:01:39.190> you're<00:01:39.310> not<00:01:39.370> going<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.610> be<00:01:39.670> able<00:01:39.700> to

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
but you're not going to be able to

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.440 
but you're not going to be able to
sustain<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.600> strength<00:01:41.140> over<00:01:41.890> 10<00:01:42.100> sets<00:01:42.460> just

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
sustain that strength over 10 sets just

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.090 
sustain that strength over 10 sets just
not<00:01:43.600> going<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.840> happen<00:01:43.900> however<00:01:44.440> if<00:01:44.830> you<00:01:44.920> take

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
not going to happen however if you take

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.680 
not going to happen however if you take
that<00:01:45.250> same<00:01:45.460> weight<00:01:45.730> and<00:01:45.910> reduce<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.660> by

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
that same weight and reduce it by

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.260 
that same weight and reduce it by
twenty-five<00:01:47.290> percent<00:01:47.880> making<00:01:48.880> that<00:01:49.030> weight

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
twenty-five percent making that weight

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.740 
twenty-five percent making that weight
150<00:01:50.140> pounds<00:01:50.530> in<00:01:50.680> all<00:01:51.520> likelihood<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:52.480> will<00:01:52.510> be

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
150 pounds in all likelihood you will be

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.110 
150 pounds in all likelihood you will be
able<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:53.020> do<00:01:53.230> 10<00:01:53.650> sets<00:01:53.980> of<00:01:54.159> 10<00:01:54.430> with<00:01:54.940> that

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
able to do 10 sets of 10 with that

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.750 
able to do 10 sets of 10 with that
weight<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:55.830> again<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:56.980> theory<00:01:57.340> behind<00:01:57.430> this

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
weight and again the theory behind this

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.990 
weight and again the theory behind this
is<00:01:58.030> that<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:58.390> has<00:01:58.690> more<00:01:59.200> overall<00:02:00.190> impact<00:02:00.730> on

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
is that this has more overall impact on

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.969 
is that this has more overall impact on
our<00:02:01.630> size<00:02:02.020> on<00:02:02.530> our<00:02:03.460> pump<00:02:04.210> on<00:02:04.480> the<00:02:05.260> swelling

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
our size on our pump on the swelling

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.240 
our size on our pump on the swelling
effect<00:02:06.760> of<00:02:07.000> lifting<00:02:07.840> weights<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.379> the<00:02:09.099> end

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
effect of lifting weights and the end

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.540 
effect of lifting weights and the end
result<00:02:09.610> is<00:02:09.789> workload<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.629> volume<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.769> quite

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
result is workload and volume is quite

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.759 
result is workload and volume is quite
high<00:02:12.730> okay<00:02:13.480> because<00:02:14.019> when<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.560> math

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
high okay because when you do the math

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.099 
high okay because when you do the math
the<00:02:15.459> weights<00:02:15.700> actually<00:02:16.209> add<00:02:16.360> up<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.810> far<00:02:17.079> more

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
the weights actually add up to far more
