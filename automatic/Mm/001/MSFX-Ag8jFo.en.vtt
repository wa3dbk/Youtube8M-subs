00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.230
 sites if you have work with your 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.150
 desk and it looks like the one 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.210
 living in this picture you have papers 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.980

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.650
 documents and different items on top 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.140

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.140
 work caps once you need 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.910
 an address or an email or 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.519
 important information that you have in 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.379
 some of those papers and you spend a lot 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.690
 time giving it until finally the 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.199

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.280
 really everything works better 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.800
 let me tell you I'm safe and maybe 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.930
 I'm getting to know you a little more in the 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.370
 I sense that I know you do not have much 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.260
 time to organize your desk 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.900
 because I'm working on a project 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.210
 very urgent then today I will share 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.760
 with you a trick in which you're not going to 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.700
 need virtually no time 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.160
 to be more productive and organize 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.040
 better in your workplace what 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.630
 you must do is leave everything on the ground to 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.729
 what do I mean with everything remove 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.090
 absolutely everything you have in your 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.070
 desk and leave it on the floor 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.810
 or if you have another table that you do not 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.689
 have visibility while you're 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.429
 working with what there if you work in 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.270
 the computer will only leave the 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.979
 computer 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.960
 if you need some documents leave 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.600
 only the documents you need 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.310
 but throw all the rest 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.900
 does not literally have birth and not 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.500
 simply put all the mess 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.119
 out of your sight because it's proven 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.880
 that when you have a desk 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.009
 clean not necessarily clean of 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.560
 town but aesthetically is 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.259
 clean and free of distractions and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.110
 clutter your mind concentrates much more 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.490
 more on the things that they have to do if 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.380
 you are working at a given moment 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.990
 on your computer and you see some paper 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.970
 surely you will be remembering 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.090
 things that distract you from the work in the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.480
 that you're spending instead when 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.450
 You can remove or remove all your 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.400
 papers and remove them from your sight your mind 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.620
 you can focus and you can concentrate 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.090
 only in the work that interests you 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.340
 what are you doing in this 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.830
 moment transforms your desktop should 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.230
 look something like this woman 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.400
 which is in the photograph totally 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.530
