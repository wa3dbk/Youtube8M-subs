00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.170
 it's gone for the guy who's attractive 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.830
 makeup that I really do the most 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.179
 often right now I see it when the 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.819
 morning I have no aspirations it's this 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:24.560
 that I do so first I take the 

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:29.329
 BenoÃ®t mate it's not a boot the 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:33.230
 from mac who is funny like that who 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.970
 is really super nice and I'll bah 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.830
 put it on my eyelid it's going to me 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.930
 to serve as a base in fact so it happens to me 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.700
 sometimes also to just put that 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.760
 because it is true that he is very very 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.940
 pretty and that for the hurried mornings they 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.120
 can really be self-sufficient 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.079
 see it really gives a small effect 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.900
 makeup without really being 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.940
 so yeah when really in the morning I 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:05.059
 am on the wane what happened to me 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:08.119
 sometimes I think of the person who 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:12.189
 will watch who broadcasts who are working 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:16.549
 with me and who will know what I'm talking about 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:18.350
 you made kisses I'm late 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.990
 lately I'm making efforts 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.609
 I took things in my hand for a brief 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.740
 That's what happens 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.209
 so that's it's really I'm ready 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.600
 of failures but just that my trait of 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:34.069
 liner and then it's good but when I do not 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.609
 am not too tired and I try to 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.939
 make up 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:41.780
 I put that and then I use my 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.920
 little duo from fred farrugia who 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.990
 looks like that you have a 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.340
 how much a Belgian a little supported and a 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:57.539
 brown is the number 19 years this little 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.539
 duo is just what I do 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.929
 is that I take the beige and that 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:14.170
 I put it on my eyelid all 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:17.459
 I just tap I do not see at all 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.459
 what I do if you put me to dream 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.950
 I type it is actually mostly my 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.270
 firefighters all for my eyelid all to 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:42.860
 phuket or there by cons 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:47.580
 ok all over my eyelid quite simply 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.020
 I come a little bit a master really 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.370
 an internal collar 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.370
 I do not necessarily want to 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.340
 illuminate it because that's what this is 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.370
 it gives and then I even remember 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:06.420
 makes a jump or a sharp brush 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:08.100
 like that I take the brown and I come 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.970
 to tap at external coi all 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.830
 just to intensify it's 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.240
 really very complicated it's really 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.560
 there the basis what except that these two 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.330
 colors are really very very pretty and 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.060
 that suddenly it makes very very good 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.990
 make my good in the hollow I do 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.990
 well a tip 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.890
 I share and on the other hand 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:04:00.520
 so that's what it gives me a little bit of 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:04:03.630
 flow very well and I'm going dimmed but 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.630
 this was this committee 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:31.370
 here we are a little old so the 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:35.780
 health it gives within so that's it 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.690
 give that one time that fade that 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:46.580
 I'm doing is that I'm going a little bit of 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:47.780
 marans in the lining to stay in 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.280
 times change so that the black one 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:57.590
 measure if a little too much so I put some 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:00.530
 funny when I want a makeup that 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:05.620
 is intense months never too 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.620
 brown as a line of better liner 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.660
 we have the share and on the other hand nothing 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:54.249
 and that's it's done then I want 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:56.199
 have him show liner as usual 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.309
 like that I'm going to cut you off 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.639
 know how I 'm doing I made a 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:59.559
 video 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.490
 I wanted to put Paris girl back if 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:00.999
 you want to see how I do my 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.759
 line of liner 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:05.139
 so here's the live here is better 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.919
 equipped chapel 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.509
 I will put my mascara so it's 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.219
 the kiko i'm not really fan going 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:15.389
 in the end I found that it is not seen 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:18.490
 a lot on the lashes of the outer corner 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.409
 game but this one in addition over a 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.219
 device I pass you step I think 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:27.759

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:29.199

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:35.860

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:41.009
 what number 3 I know more where they 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.009
 come but it's neutral so 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.879
 Well, here is a Belgian like that 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.599
