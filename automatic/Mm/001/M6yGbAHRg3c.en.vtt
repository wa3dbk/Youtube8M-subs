00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.580
 the evolution of ferrari f 138 from 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.640
 debut in maranello at the first race 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.980
 here we see the old aileron with i 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.710
 flaps that have been modified with 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.170
 flaps near the bulkhead bulkheads also 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.390
 if here we see the old solution that 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.090
 has been profoundly modified with 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.610
 the introduction of a small slot and it 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.950
 we see now in detail in the part 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.370
 external solution that was not so far 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.560
 no other new single-seater too 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.870
 this little running nolder 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.960
 longitudinally on the snout 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.510
 but the big news is under the see 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.360
 mouth like that of a shark of a 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.460
 shark that brings air into the area 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.649
 inside the frame and then to 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.149
 improve the flow in the part 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.420
 lower of the car 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.879
 let's see now taking the nose off 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.420
 which is formed in the part 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.979
 bottom of the frame and goes to cool 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.729
 inside the control units 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.729
 electronic 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.619
 the discharge area has also been modified 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.750
 greatly lowered we see it now 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.700
 in the passage compared to the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.880
 presentation to improve the effect 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.479
 blowing towards the canal area 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.270
 side of the blowing diffuser that is 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.180
 also improved by the very shape 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.760
 sophisticated brake vents 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.280
 and then the novelty of the faired axle shaft 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.710
 look at that long wing profile that 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.140
 hull is the triangles of the suspension 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.490
 that the axle shaft 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.790
 also the solution of the wing is unpublished 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.970
 back with these two blow for 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.850
 all the height of the side bulkheads 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.490
 the diffuser has two flaps in the edge 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.310
 output but there are other changes there 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.700
 we see these vertical school fins 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.700
 red bull
