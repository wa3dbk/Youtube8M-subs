00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
ip67 I believe water-resistant and

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:06.490 
ip67 I believe water-resistant and
there's<00:02:58.829> a<00:02:58.920> ton<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.280> plastic<00:02:59.819> still<00:03:00.150> on<00:03:00.269> here

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
28 hundred million battery here your SIM

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.280 
28 hundred million battery here your SIM
card<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:11.970> then<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.150> can<00:03:12.299> put<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.569> 128

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
gigabyte SD card in here which I have

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.330 
gigabyte SD card in here which I have
once<00:03:15.659> i'll<00:03:15.810> probably<00:03:16.049> put<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.379> in<00:03:16.500> there<00:03:16.680> it's

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
once i'll probably put it in there it's

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.689 
once i'll probably put it in there it's
in<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.760> other<00:03:18.000> s5<00:03:18.449> right<00:03:18.690> now<00:03:18.840> um<00:03:19.560> camera<00:03:20.519> does

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
in the other s5 right now um camera does

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.319 
in the other s5 right now um camera does
do<00:03:20.940> for<00:03:21.209> gay<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:22.069> it<00:03:23.069> think<00:03:23.819> it<00:03:23.940> does<00:03:24.209> like

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
do for gay and it think it does like

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.509 
do for gay and it think it does like
five<00:03:24.569> minutes<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:24.930> but<00:03:25.139> when<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.069> was<00:03:26.190> testing

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
five minutes so but when I was testing

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.300 
five minutes so but when I was testing
it<00:03:26.639> a<00:03:26.790> minute<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.449> half<00:03:27.480> did<00:03:27.989> like<00:03:28.310> 500

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
it a minute and a half did like 500

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.569 
it a minute and a half did like 500
megabytes<00:03:29.699> so<00:03:29.879> it<00:03:30.000> takes<00:03:30.659> up<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.900> lot<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.049> space

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
megabytes so it takes up a lot of space

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.580 
megabytes so it takes up a lot of space
just<00:03:32.579> boot<00:03:32.909> it<00:03:33.030> up<00:03:35.599> here<00:03:36.599> we<00:03:36.780> have<00:03:36.959> powered<00:03:37.470> by

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
just boot it up here we have powered by

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.520 
just boot it up here we have powered by
android<00:03:38.010> galaxy<00:03:38.190> s5<00:03:39.079> so<00:03:40.079> we've<00:03:40.199> some<00:03:40.379> of<00:03:40.440> this
