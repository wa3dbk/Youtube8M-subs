snail<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.470> did<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.340> lot<00:01:50.520> easier<00:01:50.909> if

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
snail like we did it's a lot easier if

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.670 
snail like we did it's a lot easier if

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
that into light animation by having it

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.070 
that into light animation by having it
move<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:23.010> little<00:02:23.160> bit<00:02:23.370> what<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.300> can<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.599> is<00:02:24.750> you

actually take a step and then draw
yourself<00:02:27.870> again<00:02:28.470> for<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.040> next<00:02:29.310> frame<00:02:29.489> take

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
yourself again for the next frame take

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.520 
yourself again for the next frame take
another<00:02:29.940> step<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.360> draw<00:02:30.629> yourself<00:02:30.690> again<00:02:31.349> and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
another step and draw yourself again and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.830 
another step and draw yourself again and
so<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:32.910> will<00:02:33.599> be<00:02:33.720> the

so on and so on and that will be the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.930 
so on and so on and that will be the
beginning<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.379> light<00:02:34.650> animation<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.730> when

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
beginning of light animation so when

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.300 
beginning of light animation so when
you're<00:02:36.060> finished<00:02:36.239> doing<00:02:36.780> your<00:02:37.200> animation<00:02:37.920> you

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
you're finished doing your animation you

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.860 
you're finished doing your animation you
can<00:02:38.340> look<00:02:38.849> right<00:02:39.150> on<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.390> back<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.569> your

digital camera and flick through it and

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.059 
digital camera and flick through it and
see<00:02:42.330> your<00:02:42.510> animation<00:02:43.110> actually<00:02:43.290> work<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.950> can

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
see your animation actually work you can

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.790 
see your animation actually work you can
see<00:02:44.280> if<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.580> made<00:02:44.790> mistakes<00:02:45.319> but<00:02:46.319> don't<00:02:46.560> worry

you're<00:02:51.900> gonna<00:02:51.989> see<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:53.069> individual

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
you're gonna see that the individual

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.540 
you're gonna see that the individual
frames<00:02:54.209> go<00:02:54.569> by<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:55.080> quickly<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:56.069> small

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
frames go by so quickly that small

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.119 
frames go by so quickly that small
little<00:02:56.730> mistakes<00:02:57.209> don't<00:02:57.480> show<00:02:57.780> up<00:02:58.069> okay<00:02:59.069> so

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
little mistakes don't show up okay so

you do 10 frames per second you have to

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.820 
you do 10 frames per second you have to
draw<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.400> lot<00:03:26.670> more<00:03:26.909> frames<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:28.470> Corel

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
draw a lot more frames so Corel

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.949 
draw a lot more frames so Corel
VideoStudio<00:03:29.310> software<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.450> really<00:03:30.659> cool

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
because it has a lot of video filters to

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.899 
because it has a lot of video filters to
do<00:03:34.290> different<00:03:34.680> things<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:35.069> your<00:03:35.310> animation
