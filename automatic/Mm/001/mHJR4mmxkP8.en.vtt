films of ever to show then some things

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.110 
films of ever to show then some things
were<00:03:52.870> idea<00:03:53.680> that<00:03:54.040> started<00:03:54.460> with<00:03:54.580> one<00:03:54.850> throw

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
were idea that started with one throw

were idea that started with one throw
and<00:03:55.170> we<00:03:56.170> could<00:03:56.380> stretch<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.710> through<00:03:57.640> two<00:03:57.820> or

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
and we could stretch it through two or

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.520 
and we could stretch it through two or
three<00:03:58.240> weeks<00:03:59.580> with<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.730> same<00:04:01.350> general<00:04:02.350> idea

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
three weeks with the same general idea

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.230 
three weeks with the same general idea
of<00:04:02.800> the<00:04:02.890> same<00:04:03.160> setting<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:05.100> bodiless<00:04:06.100> head

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
of the same setting the bodiless head

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.470 
of the same setting the bodiless head
was<00:04:07.240> a<00:04:07.410> strictly<00:04:08.670> magician's<00:04:09.670> trick<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.390> they

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
was a strictly magician's trick and they

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.120 
was a strictly magician's trick and they
was<00:04:10.630> done<00:04:10.780> with<00:04:10.990> mirrors<00:04:11.290> underneath<00:04:11.650> the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
was done with mirrors underneath the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.400 
was done with mirrors underneath the
table<00:04:12.310> there<00:04:12.850> was<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.030> formula<00:04:13.720> for<00:04:13.750> doing<00:04:14.260> that

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
table there was a formula for doing that

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.479 
table there was a formula for doing that
so<00:04:15.400> that<00:04:16.270> it<00:04:16.600> worked<00:04:16.989> out<00:04:17.230> like<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:18.130> could<00:04:18.310> see

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
so that it worked out like you could see

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.300 
so that it worked out like you could see
underneath<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.630> table<00:04:19.900> legs<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:20.920> there<00:04:21.130> was

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
underneath the table legs and there was

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.280 
underneath the table legs and there was
the<00:04:21.460> head<00:04:21.700> on<00:04:21.970> that<00:04:22.270> team<00:04:22.450> today<00:04:22.810> that's<00:04:23.080> done

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
the head on that team today that's done

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.530 
the head on that team today that's done
so<00:04:23.500> easily<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:24.160> special<00:04:24.580> effects<00:04:24.910> but<00:04:25.450> in

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
so easily the special effects but in

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.230 
so easily the special effects but in
those<00:04:25.630> days<00:04:25.870> we<00:04:26.080> didn't<00:04:26.350> have<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:27.240> special

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
those days we didn't have the special

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.020 
those days we didn't have the special
effects<00:04:28.510> we<00:04:28.750> have<00:04:28.960> today<00:04:29.170> and<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.430> was<00:04:30.490> much

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
effects we have today and so it was much

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.600 
effects we have today and so it was much
difficult
