 toledo another king you will ask yourselves 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.670
 if in that time Spain still 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.790
 it did not exist and there were many different 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.190
 kingdoms in each one there were men like 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.769
 Christians and other Muslims because 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.230
 will very often fight against 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.230
 we 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.200
 that's how I say we sing fighting 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.180

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.360

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.390

 he says with his tizona sword 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.819
 in another of them I did the same with another 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.450
 opponent disarm him and meditate with his 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.250
 sword since then always I 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.560
 accompany 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.540
 our life was very different from that of 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.330
 a family today because my 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.700
 husband steve was spending most of 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.710
 of time away from home fighting almost 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.000
 always at the service of the king 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.940
 but you know what 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.350
 that a 9 that I was very envious said 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.350
 that I had left with the money of 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.780
 kingdom and king alfonso sector me 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.460
 banished from my land and I had to 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.040
 leave far from my family 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.900
 do not remind me, my husband, how badly 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.740
 we went there in cardeña until 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.410
 final we all meet in Valencia 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.280
 it was in those years when more battle 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.280
 Karen most famous for cancer 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.020
 true was such his fame that many 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.510
 minstrels decided to sing their story 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:34.050
 for all peoples and as everyone 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:37.660
 told a different story a forgiveness 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.060
 a conjugate the expected call decided 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.489
 show your story and write it in 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.680
 This is how the origin of the 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.600
 The first cd of Cesc is written in 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.920
 Castilian and we all know the 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.940
 singing sends you truths first 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.940
 but you know what 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.060
 because that is Spanish and if 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.730
 that is the origin of our language that 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.920
 we speak today would not understand the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.819
 words 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.489
 why today some singing books 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.880
 are written in current Spanish for 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.480
 that children can read and learn 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.480
 things about me 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.229
 to 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.240
 plus 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.159
 no no
