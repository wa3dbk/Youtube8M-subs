00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.399
 here we have two rear airplanes of a formula one quite different are by 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:05.900
 one side we have the case 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.500
 we know the cofetel 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.319
 of maximum load in Samoa and in Tonga than we have to have more 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:13.829
 in addition force more were made notice that this 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:17.220
 and then we have the spokesperson 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.090
 monthly has very little angle and is a spoiler that is designed to 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.999
 get the maximum speed 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.880
 with this defeat 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.210
 we get top speed of more than 340 kilometers per hour 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.730
 we remember long races of more than a kilometer that's what we need 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.560
 and then Monaco 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.560
 circuit very well all buzzard of little grip 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.340
 A lot of grip curves a lot of aerodynamic load so that the car is not 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.370
 in the curves 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.820
 independently really 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.330
 the speed that is achieved 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
 with this one we are not going to do more than 300 meters 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.730
 but that's not better 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.380
 it matters is that lanÃºs 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.140
 do not be massive 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.830
 juppe against asphalt with maximum possible force 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.250
 although this difference to main percent and quite apparent is the flange 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.330
 that in attack not from its use of the Monaco spoiler we have the flange 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.220
 maximum of maximum in chur to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.430
 the one that also generates more load although all the aerodynamic load that is 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.600
 generate 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.299
 for your crib penalty that is more precious the spoiler is like a 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.890
 parachute the bottom and also makes the car slow down in straight and for 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.710
 that's because the government tried this spoiler makes the car much more 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.710
 slow about 30 to 35 kilometers per hour slower than this one 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.720
 because it will be more expensive dynamic but also generates more in accordance with 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.410
 that same resistance 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.110
 On the other hand, the angle of attack 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.990
 it's much smaller in this 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.930
 a spoiler of a single plane espn2 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.360
 even though there is a slot they sucre states 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.740
 the air also passed through here generates more load 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.729
 one of the reasons why a rear spoiler could formulate 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.190
 constantando to 0 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.210
 it's mostly because of these two pieces he claimed to be meek these are the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.500
 pylons formerly did not exist but either way to get that spoiler 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.350
 be as light as possible 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.150
 think before you have created these pillars that are the ones that really convey the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.219
 force the chassis without wolf charges 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:09.189
 It is more of the same 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:10.639
 think that said 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.569
 does not weigh more than five kilos 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.299
 and will generate 200 kilometers per hour because more than 300 kilos of 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.509
 of this dynamic freighter 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.159
 so 3 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.899
 because it is a vital piece 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:26.899
 and it is the most important thing above all is that the whole idea that comes to him 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.859
 be as clean as possible so that it pushes against the ground more commas 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:33.729
 maximum force possible
