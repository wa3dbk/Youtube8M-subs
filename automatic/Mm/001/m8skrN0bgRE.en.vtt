stars<00:05:02.300> it's<00:05:02.810> because<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.560> throttle<00:05:03.979> response

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
stars it's because the throttle response

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.590 
stars it's because the throttle response
to<00:05:04.430> these<00:05:04.520> things<00:05:04.729> are<00:05:04.910> like<00:05:05.060> a<00:05:05.120> two-stroke

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
to these things are like a two-stroke

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.719 
to these things are like a two-stroke
motorcycle<00:05:06.260> if<00:05:06.889> you<00:05:07.039> had<00:05:07.130> all<00:05:07.250> that<00:05:07.370> stuff<00:05:07.580> on

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
motorcycle if you had all that stuff on

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.040 
motorcycle if you had all that stuff on
there<00:05:07.850> it<00:05:08.060> would<00:05:08.150> slow<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.600> engine<00:05:08.870> speed

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
there it would slow the engine speed

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.730 
there it would slow the engine speed
down<00:05:09.320> in<00:05:09.530> some<00:05:09.889> of<00:05:09.919> these<00:05:10.039> corner<00:05:10.400> speeds

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
down in some of these corner speeds

down in some of these corner speeds
45,000<00:05:12.740> fans<00:05:12.919> and<00:05:13.220> that's<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.520> early

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
45,000 fans and that's the early

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.550 
45,000 fans and that's the early
estimate<00:05:14.630> I<00:05:14.750> think<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.020> person<00:05:15.289> it'll<00:05:15.410> go

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
estimate I think the person it'll go

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.129
