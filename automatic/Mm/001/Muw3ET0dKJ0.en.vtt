00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello to all athletes so everything 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.020
 first I wanted to apologize for the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.059
 lack of videos on the channel because 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.800
 I had small physical problems 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.870
 and then to little in the family so I 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.280
 apologize for the sale to and if not the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.680
 next video will be based on 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.910
 train on a bed so can in 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.439
 the facts the acquisition and all that is 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.779
 never repeated several shots of 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.910
 feet plus a punch for for 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.240
 he must first know that he 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.580
 has a single pvc clan very hard he can 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.660
 fill yourself with water or sand if 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.820
 what was there to replace that two on one 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.160
 hundred pounds and it can go up 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.930
 up to 130 kg so it's up to you 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.670
 so it's really a good 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.920
 investment we really see the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.379
 details of the self- character of the clothes 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.700
 of water in the arms or in 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.260
 the thighs we can really work 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.270
 accuracy and speed 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.730
 so it's really a material of 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.570
 Training here in terms of the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.000
 presentation of small sums 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.070
 and if not then we will work all 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.480
 the different kicks with the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.160
 click and do not forget a coat 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.160
 to warm up okay 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.909
 yes I warm up with my slippers and 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.070
 so what does he want but not that 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:40.350
 of a point to get a little into 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:41.610
 the atmosphere of engines or small road 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.409
 quite different any of the wishes for 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.979
 see about to listen to it we can 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.979
 to train either 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.120
 is that they cash very well I 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.140
 you'll even train with 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.140
 cuts which is much more powerful 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.709
 good I was also showing three 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.700
 examples of fists that already ensures subway 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.700
 which convoys to the antilles 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:14.959
 ruler in height and you can ride 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:35.610
 still great as you want and do 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:36.900
 needs a lot higher and 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.120
 so much more drive the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.230
 flexibility and manage it that's it bah and 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.459
 mostly benefited actually you have 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.769
 really a model he works well 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.290
 sign to really learn to aim 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.480
 the precise points the jaw is waiting for him 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.549
 the terror of the nose to break from the first 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.110
 it's not a bag or a simple 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.880
 bouquet bought at the inter-market or 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.410
 bricomarchÃ© why hear enjoy 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.110
 that they are really drawn for 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.319
 learn to type we do not do the job 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.430
 Levrat good to see the jaw day 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:11.310
 okay Japan uses a lot 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:13.079
 jaw and cine jaw this is same 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.489
 if but it's fast we still see 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.930
 that she have two impacts are really 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.609
 different we see what I want 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.410
 aiming is for example the person that 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.239
 I want to throw hung jaw we are going 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.270
 try to make them move back the jaw 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.610
 and just after the dislocate this is it 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.210
 it gives this movement and we turn tip 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.210
 is jaw 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.660
 that's it if you're aiming for the second one here 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.639
 can do a direct tourniquet and learn 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.530
 same for the elder the devil at the level 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:46.389
 of the nose and we end up with a forehand 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:48.730
 in the quick quick wall us after that and 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.560
 hid with your pussy and throw 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.200
 stronger right in the same place the same 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.120
 for now the small tents fast 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:05.560
 and hop doing the gully we're going 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:07.419
 look for the strength to ask it that's it 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.060
 that's what precision is about 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.000
 is then train yourself the messrs that 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.040
 his face you precise place chin and 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:39.190
 amp and you excel movement 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:40.479
 progression here you speak at the level 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.270
 plastron let use 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:46.030
 correctly the plexus the belt 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.529
 abdominal the chopper bar what did you do 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.839
 like a nag 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.639
 tonight you have the advantage that it is 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:53.649
 really drawn the used really 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:57.129
 this capacity there so we forget about it 

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:59.649
 aims lexus my chef the hook in the 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.949
 listening is ready for the comic in the 

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:02.469
 ribs 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:04.899
 do not forget the protection station if 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:07.299
 we throw left the forehand it is in 

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:07.599
 similar protection for the right nantes 

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:09.249
 ap 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:14.099
 it tastes and unprotected and we 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:16.629
 turns like bust for the plexus 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:30.969
 arms well finger with a big rex 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:35.259
 in that you train yourself be rehabilitated 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:37.089
 and especially on the precision and for 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.819
 finish like each of the video fans 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:42.129
 we will try to practice making 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:43.869
 cut circular jump you know if 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:45.579
 we put a bottle of the head like 

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:47.379
 try to hit what I am 

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:49.209
 actually advises if you first enter 

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:52.199
 once or twice late and that's to pass 

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:52.199
 the cleach of my card 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.440
 do not hesitate to leave yourself a 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:04.270
 little margin above and you 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.230
 feel that I typed soft take all 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.460
 a brick of orange juice 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.050
 if you ever feel uncomfortable 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.440
 we take a big drop and a 2 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.840
 liters called a very close friend that 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.550
 you like and all that is no longer done 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.690
 you trust and everything from a judge happens 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.050
 to overtake with 85 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:22.930
 I was confident you put the 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:25.630
 little brick above and fish 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.180
 with the workout with the video that 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.520
 I made you can not miss 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.980
 put energy tessy the power that 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.130
 will leave but it's impressive 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.130
 an example 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.680
 sometimes it does not work she is
