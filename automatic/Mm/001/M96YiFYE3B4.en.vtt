00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
up to it see and I notice this is the

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.250 
up to it see and I notice this is the
dated<00:00:22.480> view<00:00:22.600> but<00:00:22.689> that<00:00:22.810> was<00:00:22.900> using<00:00:23.170> the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
dated view but that was using the

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.929 
dated view but that was using the
trailer<00:00:23.560> for<00:00:23.800> this<00:00:23.920> game<00:00:24.189> because<00:00:24.369> it's<00:00:24.550> signs

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
trailer for this game because it's signs

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.660 
trailer for this game because it's signs
are<00:00:25.150> broken<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.920> my<00:00:26.950> question<00:00:27.460> is<00:00:27.550> this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
are broken but my question is this

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.950 
are broken but my question is this
supposed<00:00:27.910> to<00:00:27.939> be<00:00:28.030> like<00:00:28.180> an<00:00:28.300> old<00:00:28.510> version<00:00:28.930> of

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
supposed to be like an old version of

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.080 
supposed to be like an old version of
the<00:00:29.050> daily<00:00:29.289> paper<00:00:29.470> like<00:00:29.680> it's<00:00:29.830> condemned<00:00:30.280> or

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
the daily paper like it's condemned or

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.880 
the daily paper like it's condemned or
something<00:00:31.510> and<00:00:31.990> that's<00:00:32.169> why<00:00:32.290> the<00:00:32.349> sign<00:00:32.680> is

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
something and that's why the sign is

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.410 
something and that's why the sign is
broken<00:00:33.220> or<00:00:33.910> was<00:00:34.720> that<00:00:34.900> like<00:00:35.170> a<00:00:36.030> test<00:00:37.030> run<00:00:37.239> for

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
broken or was that like a test run for

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.260 
broken or was that like a test run for
the<00:00:37.720> trailer<00:00:38.020> or<00:00:38.320> like<00:00:38.970> whatever<00:00:39.970> it<00:00:40.030> is<00:00:40.120> you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270
