with water pop it right in its place and

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.840 
with water pop it right in its place and
it<00:01:54.659> becomes<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.049> water<00:01:55.229> blaster<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.729> have

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it becomes a water blaster so you have

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.850 
it becomes a water blaster so you have
all<00:01:56.880> three<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.390> those<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.750> one<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.590> do<00:01:58.740> the

sits<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:28.770> tripod<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.610> have<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
sits on this tripod so you have the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.240 
sits on this tripod so you have the
ultimate<00:02:29.910> stability<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.930> accuracy<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.709> it

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
ultimate stability and accuracy and it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.020 
ultimate stability and accuracy and it
fires<00:02:32.989> like<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.739> if<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.400> think<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.730> is

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
fires like so and if you think that is

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.000 
fires like so and if you think that is
cool<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.510> gets<00:02:36.989> even<00:02:37.200> cooler<00:02:37.500> because<00:02:37.800> all<00:02:37.980> I

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
cool it gets even cooler because all I

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.220 
cool it gets even cooler because all I
have<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.250> do<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.459> pick<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.790> up<00:02:39.000> tripod<00:02:39.900> folds

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
have to do is pick this up tripod folds

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.110 
have to do is pick this up tripod folds
into<00:02:40.380> itself<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:41.220> we<00:02:41.370> can<00:02:41.519> take<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.819> on<00:02:42.000> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
into itself and we can take this on the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.320 
into itself and we can take this on the
go<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.790> available<00:02:45.569> right<00:02:45.840> now<00:02:47.330> pops

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
go this is available right now pops

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.600 
go this is available right now pops
right<00:02:48.510> back<00:02:48.690> down<00:02:48.900> we<00:02:49.680> did<00:02:49.799> a<00:02:49.830> ton<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.160> research

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
right back down we did a ton of research

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.850 
right back down we did a ton of research
and<00:02:51.060> we<00:02:51.420> talk<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.900> boys<00:02:52.140> all<00:02:52.380> around<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.739> world

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
and we talk to boys all around the world

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.340 
and we talk to boys all around the world
and<00:02:53.190> we<00:02:53.250> asked<00:02:53.430> them<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:54.390> they<00:02:54.569> wish<00:02:55.110> they

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
and we asked them what they wish they

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.380 
and we asked them what they wish they
could<00:02:55.380> do<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:56.040> improve<00:02:56.160> their<00:02:56.610> blasters<00:02:57.150> and

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
could do to improve their blasters and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.600 
could do to improve their blasters and
the<00:02:58.080> overwhelming<00:02:58.410> response<00:02:58.739> was<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.459> they

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
the overwhelming response was that they

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.430 
the overwhelming response was that they
wish<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.819> they<00:02:59.970> could<00:03:00.090> add<00:03:00.360> accessories<00:03:01.200> and

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
wish that they could add accessories and

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.509 
wish that they could add accessories and
tactical<00:03:01.950> gear<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.760> our<00:03:03.540> solution<00:03:04.049> is<00:03:04.590> modulus

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
tactical gear so our solution is modulus

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.599 
tactical gear so our solution is modulus
so<00:03:06.060> with<00:03:06.209> modulus<00:03:06.690> there<00:03:06.930> are<00:03:07.080> over<00:03:07.609> 1000

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
so with modulus there are over 1000

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.660 
so with modulus there are over 1000
unique<00:03:09.170> combinations<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.799> customize<00:03:11.430> your

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
unique combinations to customize your

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.060 
unique combinations to customize your
blaster<00:03:12.180> we're<00:03:12.660> starting<00:03:12.959> with<00:03:13.350> over<00:03:13.799> here

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
blaster we're starting with over here

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.840 
blaster we're starting with over here
the<00:03:14.640> core<00:03:14.940> blaster<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:16.200> modulus<00:03:16.739> ecs<00:03:17.519> 10

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
the core blaster it's the modulus ecs 10

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.180 
the core blaster it's the modulus ecs 10
this<00:03:18.450> alone<00:03:18.870> will<00:03:19.230> give<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.530> 30<00:03:19.890> different

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
this alone will give you 30 different

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.490 
this alone will give you 30 different
combinations<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.239> customize<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.989> then<00:03:22.380> we

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
combinations to customize and then we

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.190 
combinations to customize and then we
have<00:03:22.650> four<00:03:23.100> different<00:03:23.549> upgrade<00:03:24.239> kits<00:03:24.540> that
