00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello everyone Bender and today I 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.330
 keep telling about mods please 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.330
 friends forgiveness for not having me 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.340
 so here I am so sorry and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.320
 now everything will be fine 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.360
 going out videos will try like 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.350
 you can often be even two videos in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.570
 day if I have time 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.390
 so put a like on this video and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.100
 it will stimulate me as much as possible 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.140
 in general let's start telling 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.560
 today fashion is enough today 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.789
 cool and he adds mikroft new 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.460
 interface as you may have noticed 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.530
 the place of the standard socket was 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.899
 earlier it is just a few windows 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.350
 which are visible with your items which 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.930
 you have hearts and these units 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.300
 hunger now you have the whole panel there 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.890
 which looks interesting enough 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.079
 let's get started in order first thing 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.210
 dress armor here I will prepare a diamond 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.239
 armor and let's sell it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.190
 and voila we dressed her completely and how 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.340
 see it is displayed on is displayed 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.910
 what armor are you wearing in the very left 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.000
 the corner of this new strip can not strip 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.710
 and the gift panel said and accordingly there 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.799
 you can see how much you have left 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.090
 units of strength of this armor that in my opinion 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.369
 cool to be honest 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.590
 further what we have goes as they could understand 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.810
 probably this is what is where the number 20 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.210
 socket this is our health let's 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.549
 check it come here your come here you 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.799
 will you drink me attack me 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.960
 in a strange slide he doesn't want to beat me 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.970
 that you are not sorry okay let 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.400
 zombies to sleep 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.130
 here or not accurate and so let's go right away 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 take the sword and take here the egg spawn 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.370
 zombies are all prepared for high 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.970
 and you fool you will not enter my stock 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.310
 even 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.190
 yes this guy is determined does not want to go 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.380
 on me but okay, take this word 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.600
 really health further strip 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.060
 under health is brown hunger but 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.180
 if you go down here 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.800
 this is what you have oxygen which is how are you 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.840
 understand will end soon or 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.940
 late so here let's go watch 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.220
 what else is shown by 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.440
 This panel strength of items like 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.929
 see here strength is shown and 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.530
 sword for example strength 1562 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.080
 Here 's what's cool in my opinion in this 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.840
 year further we look even lower we have 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.240
 experience bar now we have 5 units 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.680
 experience from 17 let's kill more from not 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.360
 only 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.670
 animal layers i mean i will see 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.750
 how much do we have and now we have 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.840
 14 and 17 already 16 and 17 of 17 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.080
 we finished off and see with us appeared 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.640
 number 1 is our level in our first 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.370
 protection level can enchant things 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.690
 on the first level as far as I know 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.430
 level one cannot be enchanted 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.709
 choose by the way in the comments you can or 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.019
 I can not speak with saying I do not know further in 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.239
 This mode has built-in indicators 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.090
 over it is a compass which is already built in you 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.920
 see it further this watch here with us 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.200
 the sun goes down sacking samsung bar 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.670
 comes in 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.860
 indicator arrows here and so his feet 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.390
 shelling for example and voila with us 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.380
 shows that we have sixty four 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.720
 arrows of all 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.390
 which is very cool in my opinion 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.370
 last 541 many long could either 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.250
 think what is the time in minecraft is not 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.860
 this is not the time in mykraft this time 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.120
 which is installed on your computer 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.920
 In my opinion this is a very useful thing. 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.930
 because sometimes you can forget and 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.150
 for example get lost in time how much 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.610
 you are already playing and you can be late somewhere 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.709
 and being late is not cool so here 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.110
 so here it is convenient enough watch 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.140
 and don't ask me why i'm writing 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.310
 videos 6 am okay by the way let's 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.950
 let's test this theory like me 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.739
 they didn't attack me because I didn't 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.420
 in creative mode, on the contrary, I'm in creative 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.880
 mode and now so they me 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.680
 in fact it doesn't attack but in 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.959
 principle actually i'm totally you 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.790
 talked about this fashion so I think that 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.530
 you can like to subscribe to 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.540

 You can also write in the comments 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.700

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.830
