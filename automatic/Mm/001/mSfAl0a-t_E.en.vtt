 is a Mexican blend 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:09.909
 so I used chili powder 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.409
 garlic powder from cumin persia and a 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.560
 little pepper 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.509
 chili powder is composed of 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.570
 different victims whose ingredient 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.930
 main and the lighthouse chili which is a 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.909
 comptonales from mexican cuisine 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.670
 for even more freshness to your 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.920
 fai pts add lime juice 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.170
 freshly squeezed and a little bit of 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.200
 fresh coriander is going to be very very 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:41.740
 tasty two of the mixtures is a 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:47.979
 Spanish mixture justice and we find 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.780
 patrick's saffron had to break through and 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.539
 pepper 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.249
 I used saffron filaments that 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.530
 I soaked in a liquid 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:59.799
 hot just to spread 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.429
 its color and then I add them to 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.170
 my saffron rice preparation if you 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.179
 did not know the thick one that the most 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.840
 dear to the world and that's the reason for 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.000
 which is nicknamed red 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.690
 three lives mix which is a mixture a 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.350
 does that live at 1 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:26.790
 decarie g20 the curcuma curry mix 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:30.640
 coriander cumin and a little pepper 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.100
 the curry at the base the Indian cuisine 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.570
 is a mixture of different types and 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.520
 it's not a spice in itself 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.880
 really a mixture that counts one of 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.100
 15 to 20 depending on the region and 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.990
 depending on the use also 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:50.680
 wants to make it the fourth is the angel and 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.280
 to the Moroccan mixes you will see a 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.570
 little more udders for the mix so 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:02.230
 we have the cumin turmeric 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:06.790
 coriander the paprika and I add 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.040
 cinnamon cloves ginger the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.560
 turmeric in the respects contains the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.239
 curcumin which is recognized for its 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.620
 antioxidant properties 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.320
 but also properties 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.720
 anti-inflammatories and would propose us 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.019
 when some camps do for 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.790
 promote the absorption of curcumin 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.850
 added ground pepper to your 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.390
 simply preparing the last 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.690
 mix is ​​a Thai mix I 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.870
 preserved cumin coriander the 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:42.100
 ginger and I add a few points 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.440
 again some garlic powder on 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.170
 ginger powder summer compared to May 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.510
 the other food we use 100 grams 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.640
 of ginger powder and we compared 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.709
 their antioxidant properties 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.820
 still ginger is that the fairy 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.290
 or third row by cons small flat 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.079
 it's far from what we will use in 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.780
 a usual preparation that places 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.820
 around 2 g versus the instant g which 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.310
 was used for comparison 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.070
 so we used it advantage because 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.760
 that it will bring an oriental touch 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.859
 our mix of bad, so here is the 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.470
 5 th blend of international spices that 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.799
 I was proposing myself today I you 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.270
 suggest you go 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.659
 and in the kitchen and create your own 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.449
 mixes that will make your taste buds and 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:33.039
 on this I wish you good appetite and to 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.039
