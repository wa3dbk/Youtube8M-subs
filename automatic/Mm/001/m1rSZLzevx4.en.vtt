press<00:01:40.049> down<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.320> these<00:01:40.590> two<00:01:40.860> things<00:01:41.040> at<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
press down on these two things at the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.389 
press down on these two things at the
same<00:01:41.430> time<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.750> takes<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.110> lot<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.470> force<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
same time it takes a lot of force and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.499 
same time it takes a lot of force and
those<00:01:45.030> those<00:01:46.189> leg<00:01:47.189> holders<00:01:47.610> will<00:01:47.820> fall<00:01:48.090> open

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
those those leg holders will fall open

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.950 
those those leg holders will fall open
and<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.689> animal<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.229> escape<00:01:53.180> sometimes<00:01:54.180> it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
and the animal can escape sometimes it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.310 
and the animal can escape sometimes it
helps<00:01:55.229> maybe<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.890> stand<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.549> them<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:58.170> can

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
helps maybe if you stand on them you can

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.370 
helps maybe if you stand on them you can
also<00:01:58.469> stand<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.159> them<00:01:59.869> but<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.049> going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.290> be

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
also stand on them but it's going to be

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.399 
also stand on them but it's going to be
really<00:02:01.619> hard<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.810> when<00:02:03.810> there's<00:02:04.020> an<00:02:04.170> animal

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
really hard to do when there's an animal

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.800 
really hard to do when there's an animal
in<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:07.129> but<00:02:08.129> that's<00:02:08.310> how<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.670> release<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
in there but that's how you release the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.869 
in there but that's how you release the
tension<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.440> most<00:02:10.739> pinchers<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
tension on most pinchers so that the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.150 
tension on most pinchers so that the
animal<00:02:12.180> can<00:02:12.360> be<00:02:12.540> free

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
animal can be free

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.690 
animal can be free
if<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.640> animal<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.120> freaking<00:02:14.720> out<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:16.040> suggest

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
if the animal is freaking out I suggest

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.360 
if the animal is freaking out I suggest
you<00:02:16.790> cover<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.240> with<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.450> blanket<00:02:18.020> or<00:02:18.200> maybe<00:02:19.010> if

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
you cover it with a blanket or maybe if

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.850 
you cover it with a blanket or maybe if
there's<00:02:19.580> loose<00:02:19.820> straw<00:02:20.240> or<00:02:20.540> something<00:02:21.050> to

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
there's loose straw or something to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.450 
there's loose straw or something to
