00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 3 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.800
 let's see this report you have to 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.230
 see a lot with self-rescue technique 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.999
 for the newborn boys and up 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.519
 the 4 years has to do a lot with 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:17.400
 to be able to save their lives before some 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.580
 accident in a pool in a pool 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.100
 that is why these techniques are applied 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.620
 and they practice they train the boys 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.500
 from newborns with their parents 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.490
 they are self rescue techniques that serve 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.490
 to save lives 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.720
 or not 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.110
 ah 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.110
 do not 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.350
 two 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.610
 and water gives them pleasure is a means of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.520
 recreation but an accident in the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.040
 pool can be deadly run to look 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.710
 the ball falling suddenly and not having 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.600
 learned a special technique can be 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.270
 the origin of the worst tragedy that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.060
 go through a family in this report 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.130
 what to do and how to provide our children 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.130
 of a self rescue method 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.210
 it's a US method 45 years ago 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.710
 that exist and the objective is precisely 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.850
 in Murcia is the prevention of 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.810
 child drowning in Argentina 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.870
 drowning is the first cause of 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.570
 accidental death in children from 1 to 4 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.700
 years every year 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.100
 it means that more children die 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.500
 drowned than in traffic accidents 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.260
 but also what is good to be able to 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.750
 disseminate are the previous tools of 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.880
 prevention or when the baby uses this 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.780
 it's because other things failed that 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.940
 they have to be before 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.280
 Ideally, the baby should never arrive 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.640
 only to water but good we know that 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.100
 happens and if it happens that each child has this 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.900
 tool at your fingertips to 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.540
 to respond and react 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.090
 concrete way the experience with children 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.340
 who had already learned this technique is 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.590
 who manage to survive a fall to the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.770
 pool without parental supervision 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.720
 The first prevention barriers are 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.110
 always number one the supervision of the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.930
 adult especially while near or in the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.970
 water around or in the water any 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.030
 in the little one and little one I mean 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.050
 under 67 years old up to 8 who are in 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.120
 the water has to be constantly 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.519
 supervised by an adult so 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.620
 direct we can not risk 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.739
 answer a phone or go to have the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.750
 door or to bring the milk if the child is 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.910
 in the water 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.620
 what happens is that an adult can not 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.480
 be 24 hours looking at a baby 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.100
 then they usually escape from 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.710
 our supervision when they are playing 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.450
 in watching TV when the baby 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.000
 he escapes he has to always find 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.950
 a perimeter fence around the 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.959
 four sides of the sink as 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.380
 we also know that the kids are 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.690
 experts in escape and in ideas of way 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.190
 to achieve what they want is the last 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.610
 self rescue tool when 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.440
 they managed to climb the fence or the door 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.540
 It was opened because the adult forgot 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.230
 close it that has a tool for 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.230
 save yourself 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.730
 the figures alarm or according to the ministry 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.980
 of the nation's health the drowning and 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.379
 accidental submersion are the main 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.250
 External causes of infant mortality 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:00.319
 In our country, the gate goes through looking for 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.319
 ball went down when I left I was already 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.970
 outside and by the splash of the water the 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.849
 boy had fallen in the middle of the 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.319
 I sink dress approaches such as 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.489
 suit make the last day of the course 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.829
 dressed in booties with and told me to bring it 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.199
 dressed as it is usually changed 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.060
 let's say when he plays and that's how he 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.470
 dropped the ice water was because the 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.230
 First cold day of May 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.510
 and good is amazing because intact 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.140
 He swallowed a drop of water and left 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.120
 alone 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.070
 when I went outside there were two 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.880
 minutes because the brother told me I had 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.590
 that sort of amusement totally the 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.810
 parents take this practice as a 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.000
 safety mechanic some what 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.390
 compare to wearing the belt above 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.340
 the vehicles and asked me nati piller and 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.380
 when he was coming, it was baby crying because 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.750
 I made the little plate that he did not like 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.460
 make the little plate and float and cry and 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.050
 suppresses at the beginning I was distressed 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.730
 then for me a tranquility 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.230
 terrible because they always say is 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.400
 like putting the seat belt 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.650
 self that knows how to float 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.540
 it is one more element of prevention despite 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.490
 that the sink has a resca is a 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.040
 more prevention element than one has 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.920
 from 6 months, babies can 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.650
 learn to turn and float from 6 to 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.750
 12 months what the baby learns 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.340
 When you enter the water, turn and float 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.560
 face up as we said doing the 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.980
 Planchita to breathe and rest 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.200
 until adult help arrives 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.580
 at the beginning of the year and up to 6 years 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.470
 It generally has to do with 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.120
 motor skills of walking when a baby is 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.040
 move on land you can also do it 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.930
 in the water what they learn is 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.060
 swim with your head below the water and 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.490
 open eyes rotate in the same way 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.020
 to float breathe and rest and 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.520
 turn around and keep swimming and 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.780
 repeat this sequence until they can 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.780
 get to the stairs a love 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.009
 a baby does not have the capacity to survive 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.469
 in a pool that has few 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.909
 centimeters the child of a few months 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.949
 He has strength in his arms to 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.449
 get up because you can not turn your 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.189
 body not because it has no strength to 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.229
 get up then is a newborn baby 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.629
 born two three four months will be left 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:09.360
 under water even if I have this little bit 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:11.849
 of water the children in seven weeks as 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.159
 maximum they manage to discover the technique for 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.289
 float we are lucky to live at 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.689
 side of the river and well consider in 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.639
 primordial family that learned the 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:23.520
 technique before learning to crawl or 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:26.189
 walk like mom does not live 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.189
 principle is always trusting in the 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:31.529
 instructor but she also what 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:33.479
 enjoy think that she cries she does it with 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:35.189
 you want comes comes wind told them that 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:38.099
 come to see classes and finish 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:40.199
 parents what is what I as a mother do 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:42.479
 when I'm interested in something that I'm not 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.189
 sure of all and above all 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.899
 I recommend that is if you have and you are in 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:47.620
 your house or the grandparents of your children 

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:50.029
 they have 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.879
 important and fundamental to give this 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:54.620
 tools because it's better to come all 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:58.249
 the days or hear them cry a little 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.919
 a while something happens that will 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:03.199
 regret acquiring confidence and 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:08.199
 skill within the water is a 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:08.199
 lifeguard 365 days a year
