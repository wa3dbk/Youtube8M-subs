00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
hold it away from them to the left to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310 
hold it away from them to the left to
the<00:01:56.369> right<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.479> want<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:57.840> circle

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the right if you want to like circle

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.069 
the right if you want to like circle
them<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.680> kind<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.119> held<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.810> towards<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
them I kind of I held it towards the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.240 
them I kind of I held it towards the
walls<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.409> don't<00:02:01.560> know<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.860> circled<00:02:02.189> or

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
walls I don't know if I circled or

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.100 
walls I don't know if I circled or
anything<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:03.000> yeah<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.630> do<00:02:03.719> that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
anything but yeah you can do that

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.859 
anything but yeah you can do that
and<00:02:06.110> then<00:02:06.260> you<00:02:06.380> can<00:02:06.500> just<00:02:06.620> follow<00:02:06.740> up<00:02:07.869> the

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
and then you can just follow up the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:09.910 
and then you can just follow up the
great<00:02:09.020> thing<00:02:09.170> about<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:09.470> movie<00:02:09.679> is<00:02:09.830> that

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
great thing about this movie is that

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.860 
great thing about this movie is that
it's<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.310> follow<00:02:10.580> up<00:02:10.670> move<00:02:10.970> without<00:02:11.420> actually

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
it's a follow up move without actually

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.460 
it's a follow up move without actually
using<00:02:12.230> any<00:02:12.560> stamina<00:02:13.630> which<00:02:14.630> is<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:15.110> me<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
using any stamina which is to me the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.130 
using any stamina which is to me the
best<00:02:15.500> part<00:02:15.950> about<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.310> move<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.510> yeah<00:02:20.660> with

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
best part about the move so yeah with

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.230 
best part about the move so yeah with
this<00:02:21.459> what<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:22.490> do<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:23.950> usually<00:02:24.950> if<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.880> use<00:02:26.060> it

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
this what I do is usually if I use it

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.630 
this what I do is usually if I use it
and<00:02:26.480> I'm<00:02:26.959> far<00:02:27.170> away<00:02:27.410> I'll<00:02:27.680> use<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.370> get<00:02:28.459> in

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
and I'm far away I'll use it to get in

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.980 
and I'm far away I'll use it to get in
and<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:29.000> can<00:02:29.150> even<00:02:29.240> come<00:02:29.540> up<00:02:29.570> with<00:02:29.780> it

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
and I can even come up with it

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.780 
and I can even come up with it
afterwards<00:02:30.459> I<00:02:32.260> really<00:02:33.260> only<00:02:33.440> use<00:02:33.560> use<00:02:34.490> this

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
afterwards I really only use use this

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.890 
afterwards I really only use use this
after<00:02:35.390> one<00:02:35.930> certain<00:02:36.650> set<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:37.120> combos<00:02:38.120> if<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.780> go

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
after one certain set of combos if I go

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.510 
after one certain set of combos if I go
to<00:02:38.959> my<00:02:39.140> combo<00:02:39.560> list<00:02:39.770> it's<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.250> one<00:02:40.400> with

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
to my combo list it's just the one with

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.300 
to my combo list it's just the one with
all<00:02:40.730> triangles<00:02:41.090> for<00:02:41.959> Xbox<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.680> believe<00:02:43.070> that's

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
all triangles for Xbox I believe that's

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.640 
all triangles for Xbox I believe that's
why<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.300> have<00:02:44.840> no<00:02:44.989> idea<00:02:45.260> what<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.470> would<00:02:45.530> it

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
why and I have no idea what it would it

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.870 
why and I have no idea what it would it
be<00:02:45.709> on<00:02:45.800> PC<00:02:46.160> but<00:02:46.340> as<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:48.530> threw<00:02:49.340> up<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.610> common

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
be on PC but as I threw up the common

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.420 
be on PC but as I threw up the common
list<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.300> can<00:02:50.450> see<00:02:50.660> for<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:51.830> what<00:02:52.100> that<00:02:52.250> comma

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
list you can see for you what that comma

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.270 
list you can see for you what that comma
would<00:02:52.610> be<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.390> if<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.350> just<00:02:54.530> press<00:02:54.770> triangle<00:02:55.130> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
would be so if I just press triangle the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.570 
would be so if I just press triangle the
whole<00:02:55.430> time<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.970> get<00:02:56.780> this<00:02:56.900> combo<00:02:57.170> rare<00:02:57.580> which

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
whole time I get this combo rare which

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.479 
whole time I get this combo rare which
fires<00:02:58.820> them<00:02:59.060> straight<00:02:59.360> back<00:03:00.370> there<00:03:01.370> is

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
fires them straight back there is

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.630 
fires them straight back there is
another<00:03:01.790> one<00:03:02.080> where<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:03.380> press<00:03:03.590> square<00:03:03.980> four

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
another one where you press square four

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.430 
another one where you press square four
times<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.300> triangle<00:03:05.690> three<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.230> that

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
times and triangle three and that

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.470 
times and triangle three and that
launches<00:03:06.709> them<00:03:06.860> straight<00:03:07.070> up<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.430> found<00:03:08.030> that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
launches them straight up I found that

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.509 
launches them straight up I found that
on<00:03:08.690> smaller<00:03:09.140> people<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.920> doesn't<00:03:10.190> really<00:03:10.340> work

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
on smaller people it doesn't really work

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.789 
on smaller people it doesn't really work
I<00:03:10.730> think<00:03:10.850> would<00:03:11.090> work<00:03:11.120> on<00:03:11.360> Broly<00:03:11.780> but<00:03:12.470> if<00:03:12.620> I'm

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
I think would work on Broly but if I'm

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.890 
I think would work on Broly but if I'm
fighting<00:03:13.160> like<00:03:13.310> goats<00:03:13.549> in<00:03:13.790> or<00:03:14.030> like<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.600> really

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
fighting like goats in or like a really

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.720 
fighting like goats in or like a really
small<00:03:15.110> person<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.590> don't<00:03:15.799> think<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.190> works<00:03:16.519> well

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
small person I don't think it works well

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.600 
small person I don't think it works well
on<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:18.110> use<00:03:18.890> it<00:03:18.920> after<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.310> combo

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
on that so I use it after that combo

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.500 
on that so I use it after that combo
this<00:03:20.090> does<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:21.410> do<00:03:21.530> me<00:03:21.709> quite<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.670> bit<00:03:22.820> of

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
this does you do me quite a bit of

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.750 
this does you do me quite a bit of
timing<00:03:24.080> before<00:03:24.350> you<00:03:24.890> can<00:03:25.040> hit<00:03:25.220> this<00:03:25.430> without

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
timing before you can hit this without

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.570 
timing before you can hit this without
them<00:03:26.120> rolling<00:03:27.110> out<00:03:27.410> of<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:28.280> if<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.430> press

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
them rolling out of it so if I press

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.449 
them rolling out of it so if I press
triangle<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:30.170> whole<00:03:30.260> time<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:31.100> got<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.370> kind

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
triangle the whole time you got to kind

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.759 
triangle the whole time you got to kind
of<00:03:31.610> type<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:31.880> right<00:03:32.060> after<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:32.480> lacet<00:03:32.870> see

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
of type it right after that lacet see

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.630 
of type it right after that lacet see
you<00:03:33.829> like<00:03:33.950> right<00:03:34.100> there<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.280> missed<00:03:34.549> but<00:03:36.640> you

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
you like right there I missed but you

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.600 
you like right there I missed but you
can<00:03:37.820> get<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.709> right<00:03:39.709> there<00:03:39.980> before<00:03:40.370> he<00:03:40.489> could

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
can get it right there before he could

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.339 
can get it right there before he could
roll<00:03:40.790> out<00:03:40.820> of<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:42.380> works

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.819 

so<00:03:45.950> as<00:03:46.280> you<00:03:46.939> see<00:03:47.689> there<00:03:47.840> I<00:03:48.049> just<00:03:48.349> vanished

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
so as you see there I just vanished

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.410 
so as you see there I just vanished
but<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.280> first<00:03:49.519> time<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:51.290> pretty<00:03:52.219> much<00:03:52.420> the

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
tactic I don't think there's any other

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.170 
tactic I don't think there's any other
file<00:04:27.500> what<00:04:27.680> moves<00:04:27.949> like<00:04:28.280> this<00:04:28.520> in<00:04:28.789> the<00:04:28.970> game

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
file what moves like this in the game

file what moves like this in the game
which<00:04:30.169> kind<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.440> sucks<00:04:30.710> but<00:04:31.900> yeah<00:04:32.900> so<00:04:33.169> these

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
which kind of sucks but yeah so these

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.310 
which kind of sucks but yeah so these
moves<00:04:33.710> are<00:04:33.949> only<00:04:34.220> for<00:04:34.490> these<00:04:34.639> classes<00:04:35.320> other

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
moves are only for these classes other

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.469 
moves are only for these classes other
than<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.770> that's<00:04:36.979> pretty<00:04:37.220> much<00:04:37.460> it<00:04:37.699> uh<00:04:37.910> uh

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
than that that's pretty much it uh uh

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.969 
than that that's pretty much it uh uh
the<00:04:39.169> other<00:04:39.229> thing<00:04:39.349> I<00:04:39.530> wanted<00:04:39.710> to<00:04:39.770> talk<00:04:39.949> about

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
the other thing I wanted to talk about

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.180 
the other thing I wanted to talk about
is<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.400> if<00:04:40.610> you<00:04:40.789> don't<00:04:41.289> do<00:04:42.289> that<00:04:42.470> if<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:43.009> just

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
is that if you don't do that if you just

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.879 
is that if you don't do that if you just
jump<00:04:43.490> in<00:04:43.639> you<00:04:43.759> can't<00:04:44.000> -<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:45.169> uh<00:04:45.199> you<00:04:45.590> can't

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
jump in you can't - you uh you can't

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.230 
jump in you can't - you uh you can't
cancel<00:04:46.099> it<00:04:46.280> at<00:04:46.400> all<00:04:46.550> that's<00:04:46.849> what<00:04:47.000> I<00:04:47.030> found

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
cancel it at all that's what I found

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.870 
cancel it at all that's what I found
maybe<00:04:47.479> it's<00:04:47.690> just<00:04:47.930> me<00:04:48.199> but<00:04:49.099> I<00:04:49.160> found<00:04:49.460> no<00:04:49.699> way

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
maybe it's just me but I found no way

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.649 
maybe it's just me but I found no way
the<00:04:50.180> kiss<00:04:50.360> of<00:04:50.449> that<00:04:50.570> move<00:04:52.030> SHINee<00:04:53.030> /<00:04:53.180> also

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659 
the kiss of that move SHINee / also

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.990 
the kiss of that move SHINee / also
works<00:04:53.900> good<00:04:54.199> with<00:04:54.380> other<00:04:54.620> other<00:04:55.370> Meili<00:04:55.699> moves

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
works good with other other Meili moves

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.330

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.570 
up I got 17 seconds see if I can do it
so<00:05:19.370> what<00:05:20.270> a<00:05:20.300> shining<00:05:20.539> slash<00:05:21.220> forward<00:05:22.220> cancel

so what a shining slash forward cancel

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.430 
so what a shining slash forward cancel
just<00:05:22.729> a<00:05:22.849> combination<00:05:23.030> right<00:05:23.599> there<00:05:23.810> perfect

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440

follow up for anything

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.930 
follow up for anything
and<00:05:26.840> I<00:05:27.320> think<00:05:27.409> this<00:05:28.039> moves<00:05:28.340> is<00:05:28.610> one<00:05:28.789> of<00:05:28.880> the

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
and I think this moves is one of the

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.610 
and I think this moves is one of the
best<00:05:29.150> in<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:29.539> game<00:05:29.719> for<00:05:29.990> that<00:05:30.110> reason<00:05:30.469> that

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
best in the game for that reason that

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.580 
best in the game for that reason that
follows<00:05:31.070> up<00:05:31.280> very<00:05:31.669> well<00:05:32.050> but<00:05:33.050> other<00:05:33.349> than<00:05:33.469> that

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
follows up very well but other than that

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.920 
follows up very well but other than that
