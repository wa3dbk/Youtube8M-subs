00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
you noticed I mounted it at an angle I

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.020 
you noticed I mounted it at an angle I
found<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.769> mount<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:32.520> an<00:00:32.610> angle

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
found that if you mount it at an angle

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.680 
found that if you mount it at an angle
that<00:00:33.930> birds<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.340> squirrels<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.149> mice<00:00:36.390> they

that birds and squirrels and mice they

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.369 
that birds and squirrels and mice they
don't<00:00:36.870> want<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> build<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.350> nest<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.070> and

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
don't want to build a nest on it and

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.500 
don't want to build a nest on it and
also<00:00:40.379> I've<00:00:40.680> added<00:00:41.690> some<00:00:42.690> screen<00:00:43.500> wire<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
also I've added some screen wire to it

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.090 
also I've added some screen wire to it
because<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.750> spiders<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.289> stuff<00:00:46.530> will<00:00:46.860> crawl

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
because of spiders and stuff will crawl

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.220 
because of spiders and stuff will crawl
inside<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.730> thing<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.510> makes<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.899> slight

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
inside the thing it makes a slight

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.450 
inside the thing it makes a slight
little<00:00:49.590> humming<00:00:49.920> noise<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:53.070> seems<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
little humming noise and it seems to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.959 
little humming noise and it seems to
attract<00:00:53.850> bugs<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.480> some<00:00:54.660> reason<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:56.430> my

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
attract bugs for some reason and my

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.830 
attract bugs for some reason and my
charge<00:00:57.239> controller<00:00:58.489> is<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> Coleman<00:01:00.120> air<00:01:00.329> it

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
charge controller is a Coleman air it

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.910 
charge controller is a Coleman air it
has<00:01:01.050> these<00:01:01.199> little<00:01:01.410> lights<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.190> blink

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
has these little lights that blink

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.440 
has these little lights that blink
depending<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.010> how<00:01:05.189> many<00:01:05.250> times<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.909> blinks<00:01:06.299> is

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
depending on how many times it blinks is

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.929 
depending on how many times it blinks is
the<00:01:06.600> charge<00:01:06.869> level<00:01:07.369> of<00:01:08.369> your<00:01:08.549> battery<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the charge level of your battery and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.030 
the charge level of your battery and
again<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> mounted<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:10.080> an<00:01:10.200> angle<00:01:10.650> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
again I mounted it at an angle so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.649 
again I mounted it at an angle so
nothing<00:01:11.580> would<00:01:11.700> build<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.030> nest<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:12.510> anything

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
nothing would build a nest or anything

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.190 
nothing would build a nest or anything
on<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.140> got<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.010> my<00:01:14.280> barn<00:01:15.020> this<00:01:16.020> is

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
on it I got this out of my barn this is

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.899 
on it I got this out of my barn this is
the<00:01:16.350> positive<00:01:16.560> wire<00:01:17.100> coming<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.640> from<00:01:17.790> my

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the positive wire coming in from my

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.660 
the positive wire coming in from my
solar<00:01:18.180> array<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.810> only<00:01:18.930> about<00:01:19.110> 300<00:01:19.770> watts<00:01:19.979> it

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
solar array it's only about 300 watts it

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.530 
solar array it's only about 300 watts it
will<00:01:21.270> hook<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:23.189> far<00:01:23.820> left<00:01:23.850> terminal

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
will hook in to the far left terminal

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.490 
will hook in to the far left terminal
here<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:27.150> negative<00:01:27.420> will<00:01:28.020> go<00:01:28.200> straight

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
here and the negative will go straight

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
here and the negative will go straight
to<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.860> battery<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.700> then<00:01:29.970> another<00:01:30.240> negative

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to the battery and then another negative

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.740 
to the battery and then another negative
will<00:01:30.960> run<00:01:31.170> over<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.340> terminal<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.150> then

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
will run over to this terminal and then

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.499 
will run over to this terminal and then
a<00:01:33.810> positive<00:01:34.079> comes<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.040> here<00:01:35.430> over<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
a positive comes out of here over to the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.069 
a positive comes out of here over to the
positive<00:01:37.020> side<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.600> add<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
positive side and you have to add this

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.469 
positive side and you have to add this
little<00:01:40.140> jumper<00:01:40.920> wire<00:01:41.159> when<00:01:42.030> you're<00:01:42.180> doing

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
little jumper wire when you're doing

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.340 
little jumper wire when you're doing
this<00:01:42.600> system<00:01:44.060> don't<00:01:45.060> freak<00:01:45.420> out<00:01:45.600> about<00:01:46.049> not

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
this system don't freak out about not

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.510 
this system don't freak out about not
following<00:01:46.560> along<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.520> when<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.970> buy<00:01:48.380> the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
following along because when you buy the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.950 
following along because when you buy the
inverter<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.000> buy<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.240> charge

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
inverter and you buy the charge

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.480 
inverter and you buy the charge
controller<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.590> will<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.920> its<00:01:53.130> wine

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
controller it will have its wine

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.719 
controller it will have its wine
schematics<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.630> pretty<00:01:54.899> simple<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.729> now

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
schematics it's pretty simple to do now

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.450 
schematics it's pretty simple to do now
I<00:01:56.759> got<00:01:56.939> two<00:01:57.149> 12-volt<00:01:57.719> batteries<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.770> want<00:01:59.399> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
I got two 12-volt batteries so I want to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.170 
I got two 12-volt batteries so I want to
wire<00:01:59.640> these<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.329> parallel<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.700> series

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
wire these in parallel and not in series

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.380 
wire these in parallel and not in series
so<00:02:03.479> we're<00:02:03.689> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> take<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.409> jumper<00:02:05.219> wire<00:02:05.390> and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
so we're going to take a jumper wire and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.249 
so we're going to take a jumper wire and
we're<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> run<00:02:06.960> from<00:02:07.849> positive<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.259> to

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
we're going to run from positive here to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.660 
we're going to run from positive here to
positive<00:02:10.860> over<00:02:11.099> here<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.610> then

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
positive over here and then

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.320 
positive over here and then
positive<00:02:13.600> here<00:02:13.900> we'll<00:02:14.080> go<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:15.330> charge

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
positive here we'll go to the charge

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.870 
positive here we'll go to the charge
controller<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:16.990> up<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.830> positive<00:02:18.160> on<00:02:18.700> the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.360 
controller and up to the positive on the
inverter<00:02:19.209> it's<00:02:19.630> pretty<00:02:19.870> simple<00:02:20.230> if<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.220> was<00:02:21.340> a

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
inverter it's pretty simple if it was a

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.699 
inverter it's pretty simple if it was a
24<00:02:22.000> volt<00:02:22.030> system<00:02:22.750> then<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.140> would<00:02:23.290> go<00:02:23.500> from

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
24 volt system then you would go from

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.190 
24 volt system then you would go from
positive<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.370> negative<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:25.300> then<00:02:26.020> from

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
positive to negative and then from

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.000 
positive to negative and then from
positive<00:02:27.569> up<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.959> charge<00:02:29.350> controlling<00:02:29.890> it

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
positive up to the charge controlling it

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.270 
positive up to the charge controlling it

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
windmill you have to have what's called

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.860 
windmill you have to have what's called
a<00:03:07.570> dump<00:03:07.840> load<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.030> windmill<00:03:10.390> always

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
a dump load so that the windmill always

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.940 
a dump load so that the windmill always
has<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.170> load<00:03:11.470> on<00:03:11.500> it
