00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.100
 call me to see 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.860
 this ram with random access memory is the main vendor of the 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.839
 computer 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.689
 randomly because it is possible to directly access any cell in memory 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.529
 as long as you know the row and column that cross that cell 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.029
 memory is stuck on the motherboard and what is the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.909
 programs that are being used at the time similar to the microprocessor 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:32.800
 the memory chips is an integrated circuit made up of millions of 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.170
 transistors and capacitors 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.820
 the most common form of computer memory the access memory comb 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.930
 random manicure border a transistor and a pink helmet are 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.810
 banned to create a memory cell representing the single bit 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.760
 cities the helmet or lover in a bit of information the 0 gold 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.110
 another view we talk about that allows the control circuit of the 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.640
 memory chips neiro capacitors the khodair its state the capacitors like 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.710
 a small bucket capable of storing meters 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.320
 Imagine a bucket filled with water to store the contents of the 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.340
 memory buzz and has been with electrodes to store 1 0 flex announced 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.990
 the problem with buckets and capacitors is that it has a kind of leak 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.740
 in a matter of a few thousandths of seconds the bucket that was full is 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.400
 so empty for dynamic memory to work the processor or controller 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.030
 of memory I have to carry all the capacitors keeping with the public 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.950
 before they download 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.530
 memory controller to read memory then make a new 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.900
 recording 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.140
 this update operation called refresh happens that such tomÃ¡s 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.740
 cabense thousands of times a second or the race went to explain how it works 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.080
 the ram 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.350
 to know more watch the second part of this report
