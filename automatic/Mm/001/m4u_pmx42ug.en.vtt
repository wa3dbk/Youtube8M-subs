00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
 He shoots on us no matter what 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.360
 are you dead and 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.600
 hey ho minecraft friends welcome 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.460
 back to the hero I 'm alone today 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.340
 on the way and we go there directly 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.650
 on the server up and it has this time 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.750
 For the first time, a man folded 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.890
 miracles apparently that's happened 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.869
 Suddenly a sander and sheep go 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.590
 are on it so we are here 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.540
 stopped 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.579
 I just have an inventory 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.190
 Little cleaned up in the last episode 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.590
 that was actually really good 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.769
 because now we can say that faster 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.980
 I clean start again in the day 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:49.969
 I'll take that food with how many 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.410
 dependent but crass just blatantly so 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.769
 I need time we level I've 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.749
 made and therefore I would 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.249
 Let's suggest a dungeon 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:00.679
 but where do we find in your environment 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:03.199
 again a dungeon that is so, the 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.550
 question of the day will mean and 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.730
 I also want to be honest 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:12.500
 Do not go too far out 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:15.350
 I was once you can just sleep 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.020
 because if if there if that would work 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.149
 then we can do it nicely by day 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:26.869
 because that's known in Bonn 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:34.490
 the dungeons are less monster so zander 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:36.369
 not okay, no matter does not matter 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.000
 long since we just go on like this 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.119
 we minimal 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.670
 a because I had with n easy 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.890
 deactivated so we'll see what 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.820
 We want to go where I was 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.590
 was not here anymore 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.970
 The direction I actually had 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.970
 thought you might be back there 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.190
 towards the three big ones then shot 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.020
 Never begin to fly in Vienna always 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.000
 the direction and let's see if we 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.990
 For something so look at this is the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.990
 direction Iran 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.290
 yes I do not think so on the tree 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.330
 the wand that just awesome 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:18.760
 so yes the direction then determines 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.820
 Let's go here for a little flight, yes 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.290
 so here is the captain speaking welcome 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.590
 here in flight a390 please make yours 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.830
 mobile phones because we do not want any 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.080
 crash landing apropos mobile phones 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.989
 mobile phones age for me on twitter 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.450
 followed and no I'm on twitter 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.290

 abbreviated come psion t there is one 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.010
 God that's really incredible 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.310
 twitter gibson or read aloud diamonds 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.080
 on twitter there is a hd capable of 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.180
 highschool hd on twitter and has 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.330
 Just 4000 followers 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.549
 that's so blatant in comparison I have 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.820
 6000 and that really a fan like that 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:07.570
 many yes, as many as that is called so many 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.799
 follower gets that's awesome why so 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.750
 that you can not have the flowers that I have 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.220
 wanted and even more diamonds age 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.820
 how much diamond can be found here about 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:20.739
 even so of diamonds one has 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.630
 in any case, not too little not here 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.570
 alpha again changes when you go there 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.380
 diamonds found that was blatant that 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.870
 has made the whole thing more exciting 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.299
 So we just do not go the airport 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.590
 if you believe the wand of a 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.410
 Hand holds then you get general 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.420
 no harm or no cool case 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.310
 and how the pigs are fine texture 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.410
 yes all packed again I understand it 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.440
 sometimes people sometimes do not do it 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.580
 not so okay, we can indeed times 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.800
 continue 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.990
 the skeleton bob yes we can times 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.880
 attack how exactly are distances 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.680
 or bow does a good job 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.250
 but it does not matter to us anyway 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.540
 are you dead 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.670
 and yes fast there and fast 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.060
 the sound is because what we have here 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.890
 nice we what is that for a 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.780
 beautiful breastplate times directly after 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:25.260
 Look up there diamonds again 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.660
 meteorites chefs play protection 291 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.960
 So with that you can again and the desg 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.340
 I'm waiting times does he do it better the 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.090
 even weaker I take that 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.120
 broker not with where do I get the times 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.620
 take it or tell me please 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.990
 what am I supposed to do in him? 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.160
 take what you take for here which 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.870
 I should take displays 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:52.230
 this is how the diamonds once again prove 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:54.000
 get advertised so far no so 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.340
 diamond in which direction we want 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.440
 because now there is a little euro of it 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.950
 tower apparently comes very well 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.040
 oh yes, there is more to it 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:15.140
 certainly 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:17.150
 oh no no, I had that one 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.670
 magic wand in hand then we are the same 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:25.900
 if it does not get your case 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.900
 seriously faster nn title screen damn 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:34.300
 damn no, what's going on? 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:39.800
 the good thing is the tank is not loaded 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:42.800
 and as such must there also disappear 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.150
 I do not mean me though I'm not sure 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.470
 know how it is when there's now 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.920
 player on it we are creating ourselves 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.920
 different 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.290
 no latest what's up 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.610
 who are and will be so many diamonds 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.160
 actually before violent things here 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.610
 but you can quickly repeat that 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.870
 but still I can mist it I can 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.220
 if not someone 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:11.780
 of course, reviving could be complete 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.590
 Great but I think I can 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.370
 nobody save 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.910
 nee people next we will be me 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.700
 may dawn highland but i will 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:25.400
 I'll just try it 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.510
 to bring back the items by myself 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.640
 Just fly back because of that 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.110
 he will not be loaded and the cupboard 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.690
 items will not disappear then 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:36.580
 that is theoretically the 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:40.460
 there are all the leagues hopefully 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.950
 hopefully human beings what kind of a 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.420
 short consequence was that please that is 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:48.200
 really blatantly I would but at the 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.990
 Just say yes, what do you say?
