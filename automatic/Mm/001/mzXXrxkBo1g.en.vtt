00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
of two days of practice on an actual

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.080 
of two days of practice on an actual
skateboard<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.380> not<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.130> penny<00:02:00.310> board<00:02:00.580> let's

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
skateboard and not a penny board let's

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:30.410 
skateboard and not a penny board let's
do<00:02:01.240> this

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.110 

I've<00:02:31.420> been<00:02:31.569> practicing<00:02:32.049> with<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:33.120> first

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
I've been practicing with and first

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.089 
I've been practicing with and first
observations<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.680> lot<00:02:35.950> to

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
observations that this is it a lot to

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.430 
observations that this is it a lot to
smooth<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.430> ride<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.299> it's<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.049> lot<00:02:38.170> smaller

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
smooth the ride and it's a lot smaller

00:02:38.440 --> 00:03:06.690 
smooth the ride and it's a lot smaller
and<00:02:38.680> easier<00:02:38.799> I<00:02:40.410> personally<00:02:41.410> think<00:03:05.700> so

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
and easier I personally think so

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.369 
and easier I personally think so
obviously<00:03:07.299> I've<00:03:07.510> never<00:03:07.540> had<00:03:07.930> an<00:03:08.200> actual

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
obviously I've never had an actual

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.300 
obviously I've never had an actual
before<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:10.209> is<00:03:10.590> quality<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.980> would<00:03:12.129> say

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
before this is quality and I would say

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.250 
before this is quality and I would say
if<00:03:12.489> I<00:03:12.549> had<00:03:12.700> one<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.060> probably<00:03:13.299> say<00:03:13.510> compares<00:03:13.930> I

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
if I had one I probably say compares I

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.229 
if I had one I probably say compares I
don't<00:03:14.799> have<00:03:14.890> one<00:03:15.069> so<00:03:15.099> I'm<00:03:15.819> just<00:03:15.879> using<00:03:16.090> my

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
don't have one so I'm just using my

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:28.330 
don't have one so I'm just using my
judgment

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.130 

so<00:03:29.340> obviously<00:03:29.939> this<00:03:30.180> opinion<00:03:30.569> is<00:03:30.689> only<00:03:30.900> after

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
so obviously this opinion is only after

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.130 
so obviously this opinion is only after
me<00:03:31.620> having<00:03:31.799> it<00:03:31.980> for<00:03:32.159> couple<00:03:32.909> minutes<00:03:33.480> maybe

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
me having it for couple minutes maybe

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.330 
me having it for couple minutes maybe
but<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.129> do<00:03:36.000> really<00:03:36.120> like<00:03:36.299> this<00:03:36.480> it's<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:37.709> would

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
but I do really like this it's I would

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.220 
but I do really like this it's I would
say<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.609> really<00:03:38.939> great<00:03:39.090> investment<00:03:39.329> if<00:03:40.049> you

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
say a really great investment if you

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.679 
say a really great investment if you
