00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.379
 Hello, I want to make a small 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.309
 quick update on the stated 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.960
 hardness steel HPP 189 on this here 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.650
 to mostly on the same from william henry 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.230
 I will remind you that the stated hardness is here 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.039
 sixty seven rockwell units 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.689
 it is very very high hardness and 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.349
 after this knife came to me in 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.489
 hands i'm such a whole day with him 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.950
 played and at some point called me 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.350
 my friend Roma and stayed naturally 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.489
 to share with them experiences but this 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.340
 here's a new one and told him about solid 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.500
 became him almost immediately he told me 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.780
 listening to such hardness 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.559
 steel should cut glass just like 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.520
 some kind of glass cutter and really i remembered 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.300
 that more than once i saw how 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:08.070
 demonstrated this is so creepy 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:10.740
 hardness of steel on scratch glass and on 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.010
 such hardness but the truth scratches 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.530
 glass well that's real as a glass cutter 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.979
 so I just grabbed an old bottle 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.729
 the blame 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.549
 which came to hand and started it 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.280
 scratch means try now 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.979
 demonstrate catch these tricks 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:38.640
 here I think scratches right here 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:43.020
 see these scratches well honestly 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.740
 saying i must confess that it is not 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.930
 absolutely those scratches which I expected 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.820
 there was absolutely no one here 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.159
 crunch that's just breaking glass 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.520
 as it happens usually yes i agree 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:03.030
 that in those videos that I saw 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.159
 usually this procedure was performed 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.550
 stupid billet that is there just 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.679
 such is the verge of degrees under 90 and people 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.760
 here 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.280
 flogged on the glass here of course 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:23.880
 mixing is far more delicate 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:26.510
 but still the result was not so 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.590
 so predictable and at the moment I 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.209
 quite surprised and moreover 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.000
 one interesting thing i want 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.640
 demonstrate don't know if 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.630
 work out but let's see means 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.600
 show the tip will see the very edge 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.640
 the tip he broke off during this one 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.650
 here are the procedures there here are the chips on on 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.100
 cutting edge this here is the chip which 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.700
 was i see this knife rule 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.630
 previous owners 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.550
 but here 's his break off and the tip I 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.290
 completely not expected and even if 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.810
 look closer I do not know how it will be 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.920
 seen on camera but he is so very 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.730
 ugly 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:18.150
 uneven chip straight right on the tip now 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.430
 visible and it happened exactly at that 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.190
 the moment I tried with the tip here 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.660
 I heard a little bottle 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.420
 just such an unpleasant dry such class 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.880
 and this little piece of donut he 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.030
 broke off 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.150
 Now I want to look at the camera a little 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:44.220
 scratch a bottle here i'll take in clean 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:47.630
 the parties will try to do it so that 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.810
 was seen mean 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.290
 the end so here's how I 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.730
 I understand this laminate and zdp goes here 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.130
 here here on the cutting edge that is on 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.280
 the tip we have clean zdp sixty seven 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.280
 units 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:16.760
 left a scratch on a stony one you don't know 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:23.330
 will it be seen now she is huge 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:31.630
 the effort I am making can just be scratched 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:31.630
 a bottle but I still expected more 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:41.560
 there it is possible and true with very strong 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.560
 pressure 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:50.330
 Well, here it turned out well apparently 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.900
 and really because of such a pretty 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.710
 fine information well and keep this knife 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:01.070
 not very comfortable but still 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:05.060
 contrived, I ok so pissed 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:10.730
 a bottle of course some 30 or 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.080
 other conventional steel with 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.910
 standard hardening 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.940
 I could not have done it 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:23.080
 just like that 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.120
 food for thought is already getting dark 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.730
 I'm glad I managed to shoot this small 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.680
 video now go fight this 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.460
 flock and peretachivat it 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.090
 for further tests all hope you 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.590
 it was interesting thanks for watching and 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.260
 please share with me 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.060
 impressions if you spent such 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.960
 here is the experience and the scratching of the glass 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.760
 tell me how well he is 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:55.070
 scratched this bottle here so he 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:58.610
 as far as 67 units 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.470
 as far as I know it is possible and bottled 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.230
 Glass is not quite the same as a glass 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.750
 window so on well in general in the comments 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:12.040
 leave this information I think a lot 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:12.040
 it will be interesting to everyone bye bye
