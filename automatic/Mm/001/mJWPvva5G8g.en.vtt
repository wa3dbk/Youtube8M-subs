00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.669
 in this video it's going to be about food 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.669
 China 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.710
 in Korea as in other countries can 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:36.460
 order meals by him by phone 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.010
 as usa and usa order pizza here 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.620
 they can order these burgers but 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.910
 normally people like to order 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.550
 Chinese food but it's not it 's not food 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.920
 China as you know it is not 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.110
 Chinese food like the Chinese do not 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.800
 know why the Korean food is Chinese 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.610
 the Korean china is neither nor does it exist 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:05.140
 here or there is in my opinion food 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:08.679
 Korean so there are three things that 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.670
 they like to eat one is called shampoo and 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.670
 you know like a soup 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.600
 I do not know about seafood sea food and 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.290
 like to it it stings a little but it does not itch 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.840
 so much because 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.740
 to Korean food does not apply as much 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:31.450
 there's also a truck and that's like the ones 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:35.439
 they use light and they come like moons like 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.780
 made of beans are black beans and 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.799
 high I will teach also so siok 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.130
 siok is the one I like taxi that is how 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.100
 power with phyto is fine said also 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.020
 comes as in doses in Spanish but it's 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.329
 again and again like a sauce 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.670
 as it stings a little but at the same 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.520
 Time is very 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.240
 sugary says how to explain why 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.250
 do not 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.760
 I hardly speak Spanish these days but 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.180
 come 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.210
 Now I have a story 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.430
 some time ago I took my girlfriend to a 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.909
 chinese restaurant 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.760
 but she wanted to eat Chinese food 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:21.519
 Korean like that but that restaurant did not have 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.950
 his food so he started to mothers 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.620
 because he is saying here is score a 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.739
 They must have Chinese food they should not have 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.780
 Korean food by brugada but I 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.189
 I said this is a Chinese restaurant 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.549
 authentic do not have any of their 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.980
 mothers here so that was the last 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.500
 Once he took her to a Chinese restaurant 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.200
 really because she likes her food 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.930
 Korean Chinese and I do not know about you but 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.909
 Many Koreans do not like to try 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.340
 new things I do not think generalize but 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.230
 that's how many of them you still have in 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.849
 my mouth nor will it be because of my Korean friend 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.000
 and he likes to cook 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.970
 but most of them do not 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.250
 so cheer up 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.260
 and also here the Koreans like it 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.510
 eat this food when you change the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.520
 apartment I know that when I changed 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.860
 or not change this new apartment that 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.980
 I will not teach it to my girlfriend wanted 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.319
 donate Chinese food and yes that is very 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.370
 delicious 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.430
 so now we're going to order it and 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.629
 let's show them what food is like 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.629
 and now they like it 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.600
 life 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.599
 d 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.250
 here is our food and I take as 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.920
 about 6 or 7 minutes 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.900
 I wanted to put my goat outside so that 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.780
 they were taught when they arrived 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.209
 but in that time I was moving 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.980
 the camera arrived and here is all the 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:03.200
 food 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.060
 we have danciu that is the fried body and 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.780
 comes with these birds that is like very 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.370
 sweet 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.240
 and with a little bit not so much but it gets and 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.950
 champions 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:20.510
 is the seafood soup with hard and 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:23.420
 also and me that I like to eat a lot and 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.340
 always comes with they were called use 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.840
 as 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.669
 as campsites 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.110
 and always come fritz actions 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.699
 complementary always comes free 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.699
 but there it is 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.419
 is public and I would tell you how he knows everything 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.689
 but I'm very hungry so I do not 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:26.199
 I'm going to do 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:28.000
 one thing I wanted to tell you is that if 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.190
 you can notice 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.370
 These factors are not disposable 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.780
 and it's because they are real dishes and 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.420
 finish the meal 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.720
 at the time of throwing away all the garbage you can 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.780
 Take everything even if you have food and put 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.730
 the dishes outside and then in time 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.330
 the person who came out leaves the community 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:54.880
 also pick up dishes and garbage 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.919
 so it's very convenient but the 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.750
 Sunday is already the least you can do 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:02.410
 for you 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:05.830
 after giving them all this food that 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.840
 although it is rich it is probably the 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.570
 worst thing they can put inside their 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.570
 body besides the mind
