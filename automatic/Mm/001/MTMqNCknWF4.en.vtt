00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
as a distraction we speak for a little

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.289 
as a distraction we speak for a little
bit<00:01:48.439> there<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> decided<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.850> build<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
bit there we go so I decided to build a

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:59.780 
bit there we go so I decided to build a
few<00:01:51.770> fake<00:01:52.770> void<00:01:53.399> rays<00:01:55.969> just<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.090> few<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:59.610> is

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
few fake void rays just a few this is

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.179 
few fake void rays just a few this is
relatively<00:02:00.329> early<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.590> game<00:02:01.619> these

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
relatively early on in the game these

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.310 
relatively early on in the game these
games<00:02:02.460> usually<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.509> fighting<00:02:03.869> takes<00:02:04.079> place

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
games usually the fighting takes place

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.010 
games usually the fighting takes place
around<00:02:04.579> 15<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.610> 20<00:02:06.119> minutes<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.780> only

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
around 15 to 20 minutes it's only

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.380 
around 15 to 20 minutes it's only
thirteen<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.560> half<00:02:07.590> minutes<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.310> game

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
thirteen and a half minutes of the game

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.550 
thirteen and a half minutes of the game
it<00:02:09.390> would<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.629> difficult<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.110> get<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.440> this

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
it would be difficult to get to this

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.970 
it would be difficult to get to this
kind<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.890> an<00:02:11.039> army

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
kind of an army

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.910
