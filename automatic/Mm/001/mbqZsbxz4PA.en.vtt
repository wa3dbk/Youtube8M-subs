00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello everyone today as promised and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.150
 to the joy of all the girls we will 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.519
 talk about Megan Fox's nutrition system 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.510
 guys want to congratulate you too because 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.940
 what is megan fox 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.340
 in my opinion unanimously exclusively 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.170
 attractive girl I'm now 28 years old 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.150
 she has long been removed in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.070
 cinema and always amazed by its 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.859
 miniature such slender forms 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.960
 at the same time she has a small growth 163 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.000
 centimeters that is if here on victoria 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.130
 look at her 175 centimeters I 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.140
 imagine that megan fox when 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.230
 bring on the same physique 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.880
 well below that is she weighs I don't 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.290
 found information how much it weighs on i 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.440
 I think that 40 with something 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.410
 maybe 45th century think that 49 maybe 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.329
 be 43 and who knows who chavez tmoll and I 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.460
 I am sure that many girls would like to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.440
 have the same shape as her 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.420
 therefore it will be useful to make out how she is 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.219
 feeds her time she stuck 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.860
 vegan diet and today I will give you this 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.230
 I will state a diet in details 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.289
 but before we get to that part 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.080
 of our narrative, I suggest 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.909
 celebrating the summer back to the long-forgotten 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.060
 the theme of last summer and cook 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.430
 ice cream but not as ice cream as it was 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.150
 that year and protein ice cream on 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.810
 this time friends recipe is so simple 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.540
 the only thing you need of course 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.710
 cooking device 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.840
 ice cream but the ingredient is only three 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.910
 this mango will be used this 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.460
 almond milk which we are with you 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.860
 time already used it can be found and 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.950
 3 scoops of whey protein 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.680
 all three ingredients of that 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.540
 it will turn out we will look and we will know very much 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.729
 soon i hope you believe me i 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.470
 I'll tell you how tasty it is or not 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.229
 very generally how edible and 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.229
 so first of all we mix it up 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.050
 so mixed is such a homogeneous 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:09.950
 the mass turned out 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:13.190
 I'm pouring it on the ice cream maker right now 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.540
 many will say denis why is it 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.310
 freeze when you can just eat 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.860
 really tasty manga this is one of those 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.330
 fruit in which there is fiber 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.560
 fiber is known for digestion 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.790
 general super raspberry and strawberry too 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.670
 contains a large amount of fiber 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.230
 it is very important for digestion and what 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.270
 it saves the most interesting 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.080
 naturally the amount of carbohydrates which 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.630
 we consume 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.510
 because despite the sweetness in the same 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.430
 raspberries there is a real amount of fructose 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.530
 and those carbohydrates that the body can 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.930
 use it enough little but it 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.850
 by the way now let's move on to the analysis of the diet 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.470
 or Megan Fox Power Systems 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.850
 as i said she stuck 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.190
 vegan diet 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.430
 but directors oddly often 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.380
 were unhappy with her too thin 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.360
 physique and more than once asked her to 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.830
 part of the preparation for the shoot a little 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.200
 gain weight at least a few 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.420
 kilograms so over the years Megan Fox 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.610
 gone from vegan diet and now in 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.470
 recent years have changed a little 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.450
 outlines but today we will examine exactly 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.080
 smith vegan diet 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.030
 infox because girls dream in summer 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.700
 just one thing about harmony 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.730
 about elegant forms so let's go breakfast 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.070
 75 grams of oatmeal and 100 grams 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.220
 strawberries in time for our conversation 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.010
 snack in the morning 4 tablespoons of blueberries 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.230
 lunch 75 grams of brown rice with 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.209
 mushrooms 60 grams of lettuce leaves 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.970
 1 tablespoon olive oil 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.610
 daytime snack 4 if you are already two 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.950
 Tomatoes 30 grams of spinach 30 grams 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.570
 salad 2 tablespoons of salt 2 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.870
 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.120
 1 piece 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.150
 whole grain bread is an example of a diet 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.540
 one of the days in the week but megan fox 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.480
 about every day 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.250
 same quantities vary in order 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.110
 most creating some variety but 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.000
 this day is typical to 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.890
 get an idea of â€‹â€‹what 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.909
 products in such quantities are included in her 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.130
 diet say nothing here food extremely 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.190
 I do not immediately remember the diet 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.800
 victoria beckham and rule 5 handfuls and 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.870
 so on it seems to me that megan fox on 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.729
 the same rails are approximately from the point 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.400
 view of food that i'm victoria beckham 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.440
 and that they are fun to look at 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.490
 physique on the camera in thin times 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.460
 Megan Fox 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.039
 they look very similar now guys 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.010
 what is happening here as far as 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.520
 as due to low temperature mass 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.180
 behind 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.740
 freezes harder it turns into 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.169
 ice cream but you can stop a little 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.389
 earlier processes and get either 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.160
 frozen yogurt or sorbet but also 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.780
 Further, but we are almost at the stage. 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.139
 ice cream so I suggest 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.139
 to try 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:07.050
 take out well, that's not ice cream of course 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:12.930
 the article was called gold gold 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:15.510
 gold is gold is gold on 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.400
 small story small portion 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.400
 to a large creature 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.040
 now I thought not even tasty without 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.250
 doubt now I think just like 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:35.150
 this ice cream but yesterday is delicious as dessert 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.070
 in summer, you taste the proteins, I feel 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.190
 I feel a little friends but I tell you so 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:43.250
 I can say that check 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:47.180
 empirically this ice cream passes i 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.390
 I recommend here with us practically around 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.220
 either now I will recommend or not 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.690
 we did not plan it turned out the most 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.570
 the main thing is the amount of protein fat and 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.570
 carbohydrates guys 60 protein 30 carbohydrates 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.270
 normal ice cream 2 grams of fat 30 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.930
 carbohydrate 60 protein 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.930
 give me another portion 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.629
 On this all and continue today 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:14.009
 train and eat delicious and 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:15.539
 plentifully how to carry it all on 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.340
 friends keep training today 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:20.900
 and we will see you literally through 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.900
 few days again bye
