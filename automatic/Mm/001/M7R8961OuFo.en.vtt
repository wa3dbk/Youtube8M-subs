00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.100
 this type of ammunition is the same start 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.690
 of direct impact is worth the difference 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.420
 what is it that the public in 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.030
 general does not know does not know is that 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.770
 while the ball is a projectile that 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.539
 due to being a spherical ball something 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.519
 round never has a trajectory 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.939
 fixed therefore it is a trajectory 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.429
 erratic unknown where will it end 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.410
 here is a munition that does have a 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:34.160
 fixed trajectory as we see it is only one 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.510
 Rubber to rubber tips is worth but not this 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.400
 it is a direct impact that the only thing that 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.770
 does it's a bruise we're going without 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.360
 individual who is going to knock him down 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.920
 it really is a marker what 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.470
 we look with these apart from doing the 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.260
 damage mark know who is in the 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.870
 station for example the instigator the 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.789
 orange and blue are 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.680
 means that apart from doing the damage what 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.890
 What they do is carry a small capsule 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.800
 well of oce well efe s / a of definitive 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.899
 of a gas that bothers and therefore 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.729
 apart have the effect of the impact is going 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.259
 to produce a chemical reaction of 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.050
 agreement and the blacks are from 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.990
 training and we have two instances 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.060
 we have the silver ones that indicate us 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.340
 which is the short term of one meter and 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.860
 medium to 25 meters away the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.570
 blacks that are 10 to 70 meters from 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.520
 reach distance that ammo of 40 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.770
 millimeters with a proper launcher 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.960
 that has a ballistic trajectory by 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.329
 so I get within your range of 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.170
 use with you to have aim 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:37.299
 worth here the range of use gives us 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.210
 we give it two factors is not the scope 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.950
 maximum where the ammunition arrives we 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.950
 dan is where the ammunition is effective or 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.929
 where does it hurt the person to the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.990
 that I want to impact to get that 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.689
 that person then stop in an attack 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.430
 let's control it let's say like that and seconds 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:59.090
 where it does not cause an injury 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.090
 How are you 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.450
 right now we see that bad press 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.250
 they are having that kind of ammunition 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.910
 afflicted with a lady losing or not etc 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.620
 behind 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.710
 the policeman has to be previously 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.390
 trained to use it properly 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.570
 when using it where in the masses 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.150
 muscle of our legs 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.560
 producing the impact of this rubber on 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.800
 our leg in our muscle mass 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.230
 what it does is a muscular shock like 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.830
 a lot in the abdomen area for 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.840
 shoot these areas I do not have to why 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.210
 take out an eye to any citizen and 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.220
 I can not justify how we did with the 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.170
 ball of I do not know where it's going to end 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.800
 the ball here we know where it's going to 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.800
 finish this 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.780
 ah
