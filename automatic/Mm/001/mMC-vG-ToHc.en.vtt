00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.800
 Euro 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.759
 then cowboy and indian are played 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.619
 then overpopulate and thus is resistant to house 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.189
 come then, the friend of mine 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.599
 You said I have the new one 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.739
 sound recordings have listened to us and 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.890
 I was simply smooth afterwards 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.439
 I was just speechless afterwards 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.489
 his parents out then then just 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.690
 said that I need a complete 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.280
 from there and the Brandenburg 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.020
 concert is not that there are six of them 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.899
 There was love at first 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.210
 look and through much diligence and above all 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.640
 heart blood is reinhold friedrich one 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.679
 the best trumpeter thrown worldwide 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.170
 Nevertheless, his musical home is 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:52.199
 the college of music karlsruhe 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.589
 the professorship is my central one 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.809
 Central place where I also where I am 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.120
 I see there is not a single one 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.780
 solo concert and no orchestra concert 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.489
 what me something in the ranking of the personal 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.170
 perception would be more important than this 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.960
 calls if one of my students 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.820
 call and say reinhold i have that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.920
 rehearsal play won the students out 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.080
 All over the world appreciate his kindness 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.530
 and feel in the classroom 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.630
 well 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.480
 Similar experiences also have 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.010
 pianist eco taxi sarah made the 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.230
 reinhold friedrich for years 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.840
 Concerts and accompanying lessons 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.450
 what he teaches is that 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.780
 not just these thoughts and ideas 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.270
 but he his feeling and his bible 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.090
 so to say to students this 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.570
 18 years 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.620
 no wonder light bored me 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.030
 but it was always really one 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.010
 nice experience 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.210
 he says something in the field right away how to do it 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.340
 that has to be implemented by quite a few 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.360
 other professors not so he is 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.360
 friendly it is fun 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.830
 it is not that he is then 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.149
 somehow we are hiding the flower 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.430
 and then at the check merck button 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.130
 No, it's easy 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.320
 he makes it all come across well, though 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.960
 not that unfriendly somehow 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.130
 is or simply means is simply a 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.990
 great homogeneous team that to me 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.510
 do the luxuries just the people 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.310
 to take a role for me 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.570
 play because that is part of my 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.890
 life I I give her I with 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.360
 That's why I take it 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.890
 not for every student so me 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.110
 do not decide convulsively 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.720
 performance but I am always concerned 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.340
 the people 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.200
 he does not just think about it 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.030
 his students also trumpet 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.620
 repertoire is close to his heart 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.050
 Reinhold Friedrich would like to have more 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.150
 compositions for his instrument for 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.310
 For example, he would bach or brahms 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.620
 Immediately bribe with a bottle of wine 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.440
 if it should be synonymous with two or 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.650
 three to me the composer so far 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.780
 would that say okay you get a 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.269
 trumpet concert you get a sonata 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.060
 you get a solo piece then everything 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.489
 carpenter 1 1 one of a solo piece 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.650
 by bernd alois it would be a dream though 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.989
 he is currently taking care of the reality 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.030
 he has to deal with his student simon he has 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.010
 the great honor with his teacher on the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.610
 schleswig holstein music festival too 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.170
 play 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.360
 that's a pretty big deal for simon 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.380
 challenge this is madness me 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.510
 do not know how to do it 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.459
 at all with the reinhold then on the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.200
 stand to stand with you land this 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.500
 It's going to be a concert 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.500
 great experience 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.129
 Reinhold peacefully elicits his 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.780
 trumpet an unusually soft but 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.030
 also do powerful 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.799
 that is certainly a reason to be that 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.159
 Diaries often from all seams 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.590
 bursts lessons concerts recordings and 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.760
 Master Courses requires to be coordinated 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.189
 a lot of endurance 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.530
 all the more surprising that he still 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.959
 I never feel tired and exhausted 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.870
 admire the navi he can still be fit 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.060
 when he comes from nations 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.129
 until three o'clock at night and facilities for 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.290
 19 a secondary school is sitting again 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:15.669
 Above all, I could not do that 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.380
 consistently that not only once and 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.840
 But that is still every time he gives 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.699
 100 percent if I do something then do it 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.410
 I do it with all passion and with 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:28.960
 whole soul and that does not have a bit 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.150
 on the contrary, the fire is burning 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.280
 The older I get, the more you know 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.910
 that the lights are always the limits 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.910
 become less
