sort<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.550> theory<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:30.240> obviously<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.560> is

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
sort of theory now obviously this is

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.290 
sort of theory now obviously this is
something<00:00:31.980> that's<00:00:32.160> pretty<00:00:32.430> much<00:00:32.640> completely

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
something that's pretty much completely

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.810 
something that's pretty much completely
ripped<00:00:33.750> off<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.170> dragon<00:00:34.890> ball<00:00:35.340> multiverse

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
ripped off of dragon ball multiverse

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.600 
ripped off of dragon ball multiverse
which<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.570> fan-made<00:00:36.899> manga<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> it's

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
which is a fan-made manga and it's

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.060 
which is a fan-made manga and it's
actually<00:00:39.059> pretty<00:00:39.270> cool<00:00:39.600> now<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.770> seems

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
actually pretty cool now here it seems

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.850 
actually pretty cool now here it seems
like<00:00:41.280> they<00:00:41.460> either<00:00:41.850> may<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.540> somewhat<00:00:43.350> having

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
like they either may be somewhat having

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.740 
like they either may be somewhat having
this<00:00:44.040> idea<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:44.879> they're<00:00:45.180> doing<00:00:45.510> something

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
this idea or they're doing something

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.380 
this idea or they're doing something
very<00:00:46.020> similar<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.739> only<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.940> this

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
very similar to it only because of this

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.229 
very similar to it only because of this
alternate<00:00:49.050> beerus<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.680> alternate<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.910> switch

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
alternate beerus and alternate we switch

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.150 
alternate beerus and alternate we switch
up<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.570> guess<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.899> could<00:00:52.020> say<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> waste<00:00:52.949> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
up not guess you could say is a waste of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.760 
up not guess you could say is a waste of
a<00:00:53.309> different<00:00:53.969> gender<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> fat<00:00:55.260> beerus

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
a different gender and then a fat beerus

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.529 
a different gender and then a fat beerus
seems<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.489> there's<00:00:56.730> something<00:00:57.030> along<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
seems like there's something along the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.119 
seems like there's something along the
lines<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.989> multiverse<00:00:58.469> thing<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:59.039> on

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
lines of a multiverse thing going on

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.920 
lines of a multiverse thing going on
here<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.609> there's<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.840> be

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
here that there's this is going to be

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.209 
here that there's this is going to be
the<00:01:01.050> beerus<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.590> lease<00:01:01.770> from<00:01:01.949> another

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the beerus and lease from another

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.219 
the beerus and lease from another
universe<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:03.750> there's<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
universe and then there's going to be a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.539 
universe and then there's going to be a
bunch<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.559> different<00:01:04.710> variants<00:01:05.280> maybe<00:01:05.460> if

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
bunch of different variants maybe if

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
story and make things extremely

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.700 
story and make things extremely
different<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.900> thought<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.590> know

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
different and I thought that you know

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.899 
different and I thought that you know
this<00:01:31.890> would<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> nice<00:01:32.369> there<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.700> talk<00:01:32.850> about

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
this would be a nice there to talk about

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.999 
this would be a nice there to talk about
only<00:01:33.329> because<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.200> saving<00:01:34.470> what<00:01:34.590> dragon

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
only because this is saving what dragon

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.950 
only because this is saving what dragon
ball<00:01:35.130> super<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.549> kind<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.850> leaning<00:01:36.180> towards<00:01:36.210> so

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
ball super is kind of leaning towards so

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.469 
ball super is kind of leaning towards so
uh<00:01:37.409> yeah<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.310> where<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.579> guys<00:01:38.909> today<00:01:39.119> let's

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.550 
with Bierce as well but really we have
no<00:02:40.190> idea<00:02:40.430> what<00:02:40.520> his<00:02:40.670> role<00:02:41.030> as<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.570> if<00:02:41.840> he<00:02:42.380> is<00:02:42.530> a

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
no idea what his role as a if he is a

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.230 
no idea what his role as a if he is a
God<00:02:42.980> which<00:02:43.250> most<00:02:43.520> likely<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.970> because

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
God which most likely is because

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.880 
God which most likely is because
apparently<00:02:44.600> quite<00:02:44.990> a<00:02:45.050> valve<00:02:45.260> God's<00:02:45.470> yet<00:02:45.680> but

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
apparently quite a valve God's yet but

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.850 
apparently quite a valve God's yet but
God<00:02:46.130> key<00:02:46.460> so<00:02:47.030> according<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.410> we<00:02:48.620> really

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
God key so according to that we really

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.840 
God key so according to that we really
have<00:02:48.980> no<00:02:49.130> idea<00:02:49.370> what<00:02:49.460> his<00:02:49.550> role<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.820> the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
universe is so we really don't know

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.110 
universe is so we really don't know
anything<00:02:51.650> about<00:02:51.770> his<00:02:52.070> Varian<00:02:52.520> in<00:02:52.790> terms<00:02:53.030> of

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
that beerus could have just a different

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.220 
that beerus could have just a different
variant<00:02:56.180> because<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.450> know<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:56.690> variant

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
variant because you know this variant

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.470

not<00:03:57.560> so<00:03:57.890> much<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.220> case<00:03:58.400> it's<00:03:58.640> seeming<00:03:58.880> like

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
not so much the case it's seeming like

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.490 
not so much the case it's seeming like
it's<00:03:59.030> gonna<00:03:59.210> be<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.540> lot<00:03:59.930> like<00:04:00.110> as<00:04:00.290> i<00:04:00.350> said

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500

that's<00:04:58.920> pretty<00:04:59.040> much<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.340> gist<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.120> dragon

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
that's pretty much the gist of dragon

that's pretty much the gist of dragon
ball<00:05:00.690> multiverse<00:05:01.050> or<00:05:01.380> at<00:05:01.440> least<00:05:01.590> most<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.340> it

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
ball multiverse or at least most of it

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.220 
ball multiverse or at least most of it
that<00:05:02.670> there<00:05:02.940> are<00:05:03.090> different<00:05:03.510> universes<00:05:04.080> each

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
that there are different universes each

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.140 
that there are different universes each
of<00:05:04.380> them<00:05:04.470> have<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.650> same<00:05:04.800> story<00:05:05.130> and<00:05:05.370> they

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
of them have the same story and they

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.790 
of them have the same story and they
have<00:05:06.330> slight<00:05:06.570> variance<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.050> each<00:05:07.200> of<00:05:07.350> them<00:05:07.470> so

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
have slight variance to each of them so

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.770 
have slight variance to each of them so
here<00:05:08.400> it<00:05:08.580> seems<00:05:08.820> like<00:05:08.970> this<00:05:09.150> could<00:05:09.210> be<00:05:09.420> some<00:05:09.690> of

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
here it seems like this could be some of

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.270 
here it seems like this could be some of
the<00:05:09.870> case<00:05:10.050> as<00:05:10.200> well<00:05:10.230> now<00:05:10.860> this<00:05:11.010> is<00:05:11.070> me<00:05:11.220> we're

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
the case as well now this is me we're

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.890 
the case as well now this is me we're
going<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.460> see<00:05:11.610> an<00:05:11.670> evil<00:05:11.910> Goku<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:12.480> kind<00:05:12.720> of<00:05:12.750> hope

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
going to see an evil Goku I kind of hope

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.060 
going to see an evil Goku I kind of hope
not<00:05:12.930> because<00:05:13.260> I<00:05:13.410> really<00:05:13.590> don't<00:05:13.710> want<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.890> see

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
not because I really don't want to see

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.340 
not because I really don't want to see
the<00:05:14.580> evil<00:05:15.060> Goku<00:05:15.690> kind<00:05:15.900> of<00:05:15.990> thing<00:05:16.170> because<00:05:16.320> it

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
the evil Goku kind of thing because it

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.040 
the evil Goku kind of thing because it
seems<00:05:17.010> a<00:05:17.070> little<00:05:17.130> bit<00:05:17.340> too<00:05:17.700> cliche<00:05:18.420> but<00:05:18.660> I<00:05:18.930> in

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
seems a little bit too cliche but I in

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.170 
seems a little bit too cliche but I in
cliche<00:05:19.470> just<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.950> seems<00:05:20.130> too<00:05:20.280> predictable<00:05:20.820> and

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
cliche just it seems too predictable and

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.700 
cliche just it seems too predictable and
usually<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.540> character<00:05:21.930> i'm<00:05:22.110> at<00:05:22.230> these<00:05:22.440> moments

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
completely predictable i mean obviously

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.220 
completely predictable i mean obviously
with<00:05:26.850> designs<00:05:27.240> and<00:05:27.480> on<00:05:27.570> stuff<00:05:27.840> he<00:05:27.990> really

trying to say that he's gonna do so an
evil<00:05:56.820> Goku<00:05:57.180> personally<00:05:57.660> my<00:05:57.780> opinion<00:05:58.110> would

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
evil Goku personally my opinion would

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.720 
evil Goku personally my opinion would
not<00:05:58.440> work<00:05:58.620> out<00:05:58.770> or<00:05:58.980> at<00:05:59.100> least<00:05:59.220> I<00:05:59.370> wouldn't<00:05:59.640> like

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
not work out or at least I wouldn't like

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.430 
not work out or at least I wouldn't like
it<00:05:59.880> as<00:05:59.970> much<00:06:00.000> it<00:06:00.600> would<00:06:00.810> be<00:06:00.960> kind<00:06:01.140> of<00:06:01.200> cool<00:06:01.380> to

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
it as much it would be kind of cool to

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.920 
it as much it would be kind of cool to
see<00:06:01.710> how<00:06:01.890> an<00:06:02.160> opposite<00:06:02.910> version<00:06:03.270> of<00:06:03.570> Goku

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
see how an opposite version of Goku

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.450
