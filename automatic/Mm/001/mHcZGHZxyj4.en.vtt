00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:13.349
 Duck puncher or subtitles you chose me to say that I bought two of the tripod this time tripod What 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.150
 It's a really cheap guy 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.800
 If you are a camera beginner, you may not be very helpful if you like cameras 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.259
 The something is for those who are video posted on YouTube 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.539
 The second floor of a personal computer that Tteyuu Prying plus buy this tripod is might be products that can be recommended 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:33.280
 It is for video recording at the desk 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:38.379
 I'm this now captured that room does not have the opposition Kedomo I'm on the third floor 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.790
 It is difficult to take pictures if it gets hotter from now on every time a tripod 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.030
 It is quite troublesome to move 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.810
 Especially the huge tripod is really becoming 11 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.530
 I bought these two this time 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.530
 I am 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.430
 goo 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.490
 From now on to shoot twice 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.250
 I bought a mini tripod and a desk tripod . 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:07.540
 So I think that I want to in detail 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:14.470
 Today's introduction is the King photo pro di gi 204 white 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:19.510
 Belbon ex right s This is a table-top tripod and this is a mini-tripod tripod. 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:23.240
 There is a reason for the high thing to be high even if you say that there is no Kiri if you look at the top in the pinkeri 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:27.439
 There are also reasons for cheap navigation to cheap ones 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.530
 Material durability operability or mobility etc which you are buying 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:35.899
 It is useless to expect too much for such cheap models 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:39.079
 By the way, the tripod I'm using in the main now is cheap, but I'll fix it firmly 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.289
 There is also a slight shift or rattling with a little touch 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.230
 Depending on the type of shooting this may be fatal 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:48.060
 For my own use 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:54.800
 If you do not select a class, there may be a chain of repurchases or replacements 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.800
 But these were animals of the fall until now even with a small What about my applications 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.570
 There are only two patterns of this desktop viewpoint that we are taking now 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:09.970
 If the tripod Why can fix the mirror-less single lens 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:15.350
 Material Trends Mobility There is no particular problem at the same school or cheap ones 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:20.240
 This time we put it on the second floor living room, so it's as compact and especially cheap as possible 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:26.870
 That's why I think it 's a little longer to put in front so I would like to open it 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:31.510
 First of all, the appearance of the photopro tripod di gi 204 white box looks like this 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.510
 Explanation of tripod is written on the side 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:42.060
 When I take it out of the box, I feel like I was in the special case from the beginning 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.060
 Yes we go in it by saver of a 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.290
 Some version customers are fresh white 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:56.579
 It looks like this when folded 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:58.200
 The material is aluminum, so the size in this state is 38 cm and the weight is 570 g and quite light 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:05.440
 Is compact 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:07.560
 However the first step with this one touch lock lever from at least 39 cm 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.640
 2nd tier 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.640
 Third row 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.920
 And 4 bullets Yes you know this 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:23.240
 It will be so long 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:26.780
 You can extend up to 120 cm at maximum by loosening this and extending the center pipe 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.810
 I think it will grow quite small when carrying 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.530
 Yeah live is a quick shoe mechanism 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:39.110
 There is also a handle on the back side , so this quick shoe 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.920
 There are good and bad depending on the application, but I would like to talk about it for another occasion 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.970
 I will 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:48.450
 I also equipped with a spirit level 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.450
 The rudder 3 way tilt and pan adjust the lever loose 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:59.439
 It takes a lock when it is closed, but it is easy with this 1 lever 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.439
 It can be said that either tilt or pan can not be fixed independently 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:07.410
 It may be difficult to shoot a video of a residence like Toukai 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:12.960
 Also supports vertical position shooting 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:16.140
 The maximum load is 1.5km and I think that it may be enough for shooting with a fixed view point indoors 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.670
 I bought White this time 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:26.900
 Karabari also offers cancer meta is a black and Amazon's limited color 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.900
 By the way, the current price today is whopping 1,827 yen 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.020
 The link is put down below if you're worried about it 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.430
 Please check it 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:44.930
 Yes then it is the next tabletop tripod Belbon ex right s 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.930
 An explanation of the appearance of the box is written on the outside box like this 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.290
 Nice contents will go Now had also entered into a special case Yose 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.230
 I feel bigger than I thought honestly 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:09.570
 The appearance in the folded state looks like this 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:14.190
 It's like this when you open your feet, it's like this when you open up here further 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:17.880
 This seems to be a low mode at least 19cm in this state 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:21.600
 It feels like this when you stretch the second step 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.990
 The best 41.7 cm 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.470
 Yes i feel like this 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.280
 The rudder is 2 ways of pan and tilt 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:34.540
 Can be locked independently 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.750
 There is a screwdriver on the back and it is not a quick shoe 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:40.810
 I think that I will use it like this from now on 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:46.150
 I feel a little big for the desk tripod 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.590
 But if you think that it is the best or 41 points 7 cm in this size, depending on the application, there is a sufficient trade-off 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.300
 I think it is enough 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:54.550
 By the way , the price at Amazon today 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.550
 Is 1809 yen 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:04.510
 It's really simple but I think it's high enough 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.139
 Actually, when I bought it, it was sold out with amazon and it was a little more expensive 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.120
 is 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:15.830
 I'll put a link below, so if you are concerned please check it out and buy this time 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:19.700
 There is no sense of luxury to say that I felt that Cospa was quite high when I tried to touch the two tripods 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:24.140
 It's ok but I think my application will meet my needs 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:29.090
 This tabletop tripod I used so far is a slick mini tripod 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:34.100
 Reach out and until the people of here high position in some circumstances even in compact Come here wins 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:35.820
 However , I was really satisfied with these 3 sets, but in fact this is my fault 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.270
 The price is rising 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.270
 Masu Tei 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:47.110
 Before about two years was about 1200 yen when I bought this 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:48.340
 Why did I really want this one more and I liked it pretty much everywhere 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.810
 It was good 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.770
 That Tripod has added two buy for this youtube videos taken with the fact that 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.580
 It was a video 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.840
 Yes See you also Thank you very much for seeing to the last today subtitle 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.030

 re item par 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.860
