00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.300
 Today, more and more Ukrainians 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.400
 think about minibuses and 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.590
 commercial and cars the reason is simple 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.810
 such cars allow and family with 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.850
 comfort and place yourself 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.039
 to transport goods and building materials 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.509
 and in the case of force majeure commercial 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.229
 cars can also earn 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.019
 money that is to feed the family externally 

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:40.339
 new traffic has changed dramatically since 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.769
 all angles 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:45.559
 and even expanded range of colors from 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.989
 conservatively gray to poisonous 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.299
 green novelty is available in different 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.100
 body versions in our case 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:57.109
 longest base and 9 seats cab traffic 2015 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.030
 turned out stylistic changes and 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.739
 all sorts of options are available for 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.350
 passenger cars 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.480
 new multimedia dashboard 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.880
 median in system with navigation 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.190
 keyless access to the interior camera 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.160
 rear view all you can have in 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.590
 traffic but the customer himself can choose what 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.780
 he needs and what is not plus is that 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.990
 the buyer is offered a flexible scheme 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.510
 equipping the car without being imposed 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.080
 options so we don't have access without 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.720
 key 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.710
 instead of advanced multimedia, the usual 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.710
 audio system 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.780
 but with under the steering in new 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.070
 traffic you sit at the level with passengers 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.100
 bus Bogdan 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.920
 very high glass huge mirrors 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.650
 almost like a wagon so with visibility 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.170
 all well pleased with the new tidy 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.570
 digital speed indication allows 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.520
 quickly read the information so to speak 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.130
 not too distracted from the road 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.189
 Also on the panel appeared recommendations on 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.829
 transition to low or high 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.619
 transfer to the pluses can be attributed and 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.079
 several yusbi inputs on the radio 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.079
 and top torpedo for charging the phone 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:09.229
 there are coasters connectors for coins and 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.599
 many branches with a total volume of 90 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.230
 liters even with all decomposed 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.420
 the seats 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.510
 luggage compartment novelty 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.569
 makes one thousand 800 liters 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.390
 if you fold the back row leaving five 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.049
 seats in the trunk can be conditional 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.060
 pour 4 thousand 100 liters if desired 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.540
 you can stick out the middle row and back 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.000
 sofa 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.730
 this can be done only together they 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.250
 heavy to remove the seat you need 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.650
 put your feet on the retainers and rip off 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.079
 their bonds will eventually get 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.530
 full load compartment with smooth 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.450
 by sex 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.959
 where you can easily place 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.160
 refrigerator door or set 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.590
 construction materials facilitates loading 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.639
 rear flaps that can be flung open 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.790
 90 or 180 degrees in length and height 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:01.220
 space for cargo is more than enough 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.079
 but the passengers are especially tall 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.170
 headspace can 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.639
 seem a little but they have their 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.769
 system control panel 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.560
 air conditioning and individual 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.109
 air ducts are provided for legs 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.870
 passengers added to the back of the sofa 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.799
 fold back you can move it 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.870
 to the middle row 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.920
 to get to the gallery you need 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.620
 tilt back 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.260
 but even in this state, prolazit back 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.340
 not very convenient passage is obtained 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.340
 too narrow for them 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.220
 if this is dropped on any place in 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.290
 new traffic places abound themselves 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.970
 Seats are traditionally flat for both 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.870
 commercial bus however pretty 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.389
 convenient in Ukraine for traffic 2015 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.190
 2 1 and 6 liter diesel engines available 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.400
 115 power 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.720
 or 140 horsepower provided 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.480
 okuma system 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.060
 here allowing according to the manufacturer 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.310
 save up to ten percent on fuel 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.050
 practice and and it is advisable to include when 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.480
 driving on a highway with constant 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.850
 speed in the city when you do not want 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.840
 annoy colleagues with her slow pace 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.020
 efficiency 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.570
 0 the reason is simple is stronger 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.820
 put pressure on the gas and spin the engine to 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.000
 the word test grasshopper overgrown 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.130
 equipped with 115 strong motor it 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.760
 power with an empty body in principle 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.280
 enough 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.740
 if you sit down your whole family or 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.380
 load the machine to the eyeballs can 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.830
 seem not enough but this is not megan 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.170
 rs 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.890
 so we won't be fooled to want traction 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.730
 140 is not enough on bottoms 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.400
 strong motor 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.560
 he is in theory more fun as for 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.460
 saving the French did not lie calling 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.430
 new traffic 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.280
 one of the most economical in class on 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.350
 track in the combined cycle of 6 7 liters this 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.140
 very pleasant expense given the size 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.690
 and sail the car in the city 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.300
 real indicator of the order of 8 liters 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.400
 Pleased and soundproofing front 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.410
 parts of the salon except 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.760
 aerodynamic noise nothing 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.430
 annoying up to a hundred and twenty 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.710
 kilometers per hour with this car 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.450
 remains manageable last 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.180
 turn thanks to balanced 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:14.030
 suspension even an empty car is quite good 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.850
 dampens bumps and rear shock absorbers 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.070
 what's important is change stiffness 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.350
 on the degree of loading of the car from 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.750
 bonuses recoil system which 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.940
 makes starting easier uphill especially when 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.070
 a loaded car is also available 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.380
 system and sleep last generation with 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.940
 adaptive load control which 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.030
 allows the car to hold 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.160
 trajectory keeping its stability in 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.140
 availability of a system to improve grip 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.320
 expensive on difficult surfaces such as 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.150
 snow is wet or sand besides 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.919
 active systems new traffic 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.289
 has a decent passive level 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.569
 security 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.159
 three point seat belts 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.050
 driver and passenger 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:55.689
 The installation of the side 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.240
 airbags and curtain airbags 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:01.059
 The initial price of new traffic is comparable to 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.309
 much smaller volkswagen caddy and cheaper 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:05.559
 than ford tourneo custom 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:07.899
 but ford has his 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:10.029
 advantages over early therefore if 

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:12.520
 look after a car of this format 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:17.490
 recommend watching our video reviews 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.490
