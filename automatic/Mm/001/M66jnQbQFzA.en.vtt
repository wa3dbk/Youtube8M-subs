Ambrose<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.770> Roman<00:02:01.860> reigns<00:02:02.159> really<00:02:03.090> get

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
Ambrose and Roman reigns really get

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.660 
Ambrose and Roman reigns really get
revenge<00:02:03.689> for<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:05.100> know<00:02:05.189> Seth<00:02:05.490> Rollins

breaking<00:02:06.299> up<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> shield<00:02:06.780> we<00:02:07.020> never<00:02:07.229> saw<00:02:07.469> that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
breaking up the shield we never saw that

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.090 
breaking up the shield we never saw that
happen<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.399> we

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
happen so we

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.820 
happen so we
think<00:02:09.460> that<00:02:10.120> reigns<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.900> Ambrose<00:02:11.230> still<00:02:11.530> hate

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
think that reigns and Ambrose still hate

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.350 
think that reigns and Ambrose still hate
Rollins<00:02:12.370> so<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.760> doesn't<00:02:13.030> really<00:02:13.060> make<00:02:13.300> a

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
Rollins so that doesn't really make a

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.940 
Rollins so that doesn't really make a
lot<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.600> sense<00:02:13.740> why<00:02:14.740> would<00:02:15.240> Undertaker<00:02:16.240> Kane

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
lot of sense why would Undertaker Kane

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.830 
lot of sense why would Undertaker Kane
why<00:02:17.950> would<00:02:18.190> they<00:02:18.340> want<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.700> help<00:02:18.880> Rollins<00:02:19.690> I

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
why would they want to help Rollins I

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.970 
why would they want to help Rollins I
know<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.140> they<00:02:20.260> don't<00:02:20.350> really<00:02:20.590> have<00:02:20.740> their

undertaker<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.780> kane<00:02:40.810> match<00:02:41.200> i<00:02:41.500> did<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:42.160> goes

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
undertaker and kane match i did it goes

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.740 
undertaker and kane match i did it goes
back<00:02:42.460> to<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.670> beginning<00:02:42.790> i<00:02:43.090> don't<00:02:43.270> see<00:02:43.540> how<00:02:43.570> a

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
back to the beginning i don't see how a

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.110 
back to the beginning i don't see how a
shield<00:02:44.230> comes<00:02:44.920> together<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:45.520> this<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.880> match

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
