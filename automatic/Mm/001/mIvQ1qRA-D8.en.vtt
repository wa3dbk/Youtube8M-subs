00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
coaches here to work with them I think

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.150 
coaches here to work with them I think
that's<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.170> best<00:04:29.380> thing<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:29.740> could<00:04:30.040> happen

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
that's the best thing that could happen

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.330 
that's the best thing that could happen
to<00:04:30.430> my<00:04:30.850> son<00:04:31.090> he<00:04:31.870> he<00:04:32.680> definitely<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.250> gonna

to my son he he definitely is gonna
learn<00:04:33.610> a<00:04:33.640> lot<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.630> he's<00:04:34.930> not<00:04:35.110> only<00:04:35.200> going<00:04:35.380> to

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.630 
learn a lot and he's not only going to
learn<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.770> here<00:04:35.950> he's<00:04:36.070> gonna<00:04:36.160> take<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.520> back

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.700 
back all the things that he learned and
I<00:04:40.780> think<00:04:40.810> that's<00:04:41.200> an<00:04:41.350> excellent<00:04:41.650> way<00:04:42.280> of

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
I think that's an excellent way of

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.140 
I think that's an excellent way of
presenting<00:04:44.710> this<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.310> kids<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:45.910> then<00:04:46.030> the

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
presenting this to the kids and then the

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.180 
presenting this to the kids and then the
third<00:04:46.360> piece<00:04:46.600> is<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.380> international<00:04:47.890> trip

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
third piece is the international trip

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.140 
third piece is the international trip
which<00:04:49.030> then<00:04:50.250> addresses<00:04:51.250> a<00:04:51.280> smaller<00:04:51.700> number<00:04:51.970> of

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
which then addresses a smaller number of

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.200 
which then addresses a smaller number of
these<00:04:52.420> kids<00:04:52.780> but<00:04:53.350> it<00:04:53.500> gives<00:04:53.800> that<00:04:53.980> 18<00:04:54.820> an

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
these kids but it gives that 18 an

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.030 
these kids but it gives that 18 an
opportunity<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:56.020> be<00:04:56.140> able<00:04:56.260> to<00:04:56.440> go<00:04:56.620> over<00:04:56.650> and
