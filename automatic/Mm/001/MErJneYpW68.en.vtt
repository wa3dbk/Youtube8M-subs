00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
well the new 2011 imac performs against

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.180 
well the new 2011 imac performs against
it<00:00:44.370> when<00:00:44.579> i'm<00:00:44.700> exporting<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.559> video<00:00:46.559> clip<00:00:46.770> from

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the desktop on both computers and let's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.520 
the desktop on both computers and let's
go<00:01:10.590> ahead<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.100> started<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:13.159> 321<00:01:15.530> so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
go ahead and get this started in 321 so

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.620 
go ahead and get this started in 321 so
there<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.920> go<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.280> starting<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> export<00:01:18.540> on

there we go it's starting to export on

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.469 
there we go it's starting to export on
both<00:01:18.750> computers<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.890> imac<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.060> bit<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
both computers the imac is in a bit of a

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.170 
both computers the imac is in a bit of a
lead<00:01:21.630> already<00:01:22.310> if<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.580> want<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> look<00:01:23.939> at<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
lead already if you want to look at the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.590 
lead already if you want to look at the
black<00:01:24.420> bar<00:01:24.720> right<00:01:24.960> here<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> bottom<00:01:26.600> once

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
black bar right here on the bottom once

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.510 
black bar right here on the bottom once
that<00:01:27.810> disappears<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.530> means<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> export

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that disappears that means the export

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.640 
that disappears that means the export
has<00:01:29.640> finished<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.570> i'll<00:01:30.990> go<00:01:31.140> ahead<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.320> speed

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
has finished so i'll go ahead and speed

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.590 
has finished so i'll go ahead and speed
this<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.369> guys<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.790> see<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:33.299> one

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
this up and you guys can see which one

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.620 
this up and you guys can see which one
wins

ok guys so as you saw right there my

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.520 
ok guys so as you saw right there my
imac<00:02:06.549> blew<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.570> macbook<00:02:07.960> air<00:02:08.140> out<00:02:08.319> of<00:02:08.349> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
imac blew the macbook air out of the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.220 
imac blew the macbook air out of the
water<00:02:09.179> obviously<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.300> imac<00:02:10.569> is<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.750> much<00:02:11.019> more

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
water obviously the imac is a much more

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.509 
water obviously the imac is a much more
powerful<00:02:11.410> machine<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.069> has<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.190> quad-core

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
powerful machine it has a quad-core

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.250 
powerful machine it has a quad-core
processor<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.050> top-of-the-line

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
processor and it is the top-of-the-line

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.430 
processor and it is the top-of-the-line
processor<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.720> wanted<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.019> get<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.170> test

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
processor I just wanted to get that test

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.080 
processor I just wanted to get that test
out<00:02:17.650> there<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.950> show<00:02:18.129> you<00:02:18.220> guys<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
out there to show you guys the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.839 
out there to show you guys the
difference<00:02:19.420> between<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:20.410> two<00:02:20.650> machines<00:02:21.040> so

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
difference between the two machines so

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.460 
difference between the two machines so
if<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.030> guys<00:02:22.150> have<00:02:22.390> any<00:02:22.510> more<00:02:22.780> tests<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.290> want

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
if you guys have any more tests you want

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.009 
if you guys have any more tests you want
to<00:02:23.530> see<00:02:23.709> between<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.190> new<00:02:24.340> 2011<00:02:25.090> macbook<00:02:25.780> air

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
to see between the new 2011 macbook air

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.350
