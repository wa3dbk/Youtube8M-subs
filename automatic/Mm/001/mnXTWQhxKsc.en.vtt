like<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:10.840> have<00:02:10.960> been<00:02:11.080> slain<00:02:11.500> all<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:12.010> kind

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
like you have been slain all that kind

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.730 
like you have been slain all that kind
of<00:02:12.250> stuff<00:02:12.310> very<00:02:12.970> very<00:02:13.090> cool<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.470> then<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.620> can

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
of stuff very very cool and then you can

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.230 
of stuff very very cool and then you can
see<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.100> it's<00:02:15.220> like<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.580> couple<00:02:15.820> things

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
see that it's like a couple things

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.940 
see that it's like a couple things
change<00:02:16.600> like<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.990> ice<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.290> stuff<00:02:17.440> these

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
change like the ice and stuff these

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.160 
change like the ice and stuff these
turrets<00:02:18.310> will<00:02:18.430> shoot<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.850> by<00:02:19.540> using<00:02:19.750> wither

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
turrets will shoot you by using wither

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.080 
turrets will shoot you by using wither
and<00:02:22.110> very<00:02:23.110> cool<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:23.800> this<00:02:24.220> would<00:02:24.460> lead<00:02:24.760> off<00:02:24.790> to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
and very cool so this would lead off to

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.370 
and very cool so this would lead off to
the<00:02:25.210> enemy<00:02:25.450> side<00:02:25.660> but<00:02:25.900> we're<00:02:26.020> just<00:02:26.170> kind<00:02:26.350> of

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
the enemy side but we're just kind of

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.070 
the enemy side but we're just kind of
working<00:02:26.590> on<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.920> here<00:02:27.450> over<00:02:28.450> here<00:02:28.870> we<00:02:29.050> have

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
working on it here over here we have

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.480 
working on it here over here we have
some<00:02:29.940> jungle<00:02:30.940> camps<00:02:31.800> not<00:02:32.800> fully<00:02:33.040> working<00:02:33.280> you

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
some jungle camps not fully working you

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.370 
some jungle camps not fully working you
see<00:02:33.640> one<00:02:33.760> go<00:02:33.880> ahead<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.150> spawn<00:02:34.390> basically

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
see one go ahead and spawn basically

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.790 
see one go ahead and spawn basically
these<00:02:35.830> are<00:02:35.890> rates<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:38.290> can<00:02:38.440> kill<00:02:38.650> them

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
these are rates and you can kill them

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.550 
these are rates and you can kill them
and<00:02:38.980> get<00:02:39.640> XP<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.390> level<00:02:40.660> up<00:02:40.810> if<00:02:41.260> Federer

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
and get XP and level up if Federer

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.000 
and get XP and level up if Federer
bilities<00:02:42.030> it'll<00:02:43.030> be<00:02:43.150> very<00:02:43.620> complicated<00:02:44.620> this

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
bilities it'll be very complicated this

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.650 
bilities it'll be very complicated this
redstone<00:02:45.460> will<00:02:45.700> be<00:02:45.820> most<00:02:46.330> complicated

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
redstone will be most complicated

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.700 
redstone will be most complicated
project<00:02:47.170> I've<00:02:47.290> done<00:02:47.530> for<00:02:47.800> redstone<00:02:48.510> probably

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
project I've done for redstone probably

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.170 
project I've done for redstone probably
twice<00:02:50.710> as<00:02:50.770> complicated<00:02:51.130> as<00:02:51.550> ghost<00:02:51.760> town<00:02:51.970> which

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
twice as complicated as ghost town which

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.910 
twice as complicated as ghost town which
if<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:52.480> don't<00:02:52.780> know<00:02:53.080> that<00:02:53.170> was<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.740> was<00:02:53.890> a

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
if you don't know that was it was a

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.800 
if you don't know that was it was a
minigame<00:02:54.490> which<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.180> actually<00:02:55.330> made<00:02:55.570> into<00:02:55.780> a

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
minigame which I actually made into a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.450 
minigame which I actually made into a
server<00:02:56.080> for<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.380> couple<00:02:56.650> months<00:02:56.770> it<00:02:57.010> was<00:02:57.100> very

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
server for a couple months it was very

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.500 
server for a couple months it was very
very<00:02:57.640> complicated<00:02:58.300> um<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.670> yeah<00:03:01.000> here's<00:03:01.240> more

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
very complicated um so yeah here's more

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.000 
very complicated um so yeah here's more
the<00:03:01.630> jungle<00:03:01.930> over<00:03:02.140> here<00:03:04.020> these<00:03:05.020> it'll<00:03:05.710> be

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
the jungle over here these it'll be

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.400 
the jungle over here these it'll be
permanently<00:03:06.490> night<00:03:06.790> just<00:03:07.060> by<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.840> way<00:03:07.960> I'll

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
permanently night just by the way I'll

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.800 
permanently night just by the way I'll
but<00:03:08.709> these<00:03:08.890> won't<00:03:09.190> actually<00:03:09.400> be<00:03:09.670> like<00:03:10.300> that<00:03:10.540> I

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
but these won't actually be like that I

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.270 
but these won't actually be like that I
just<00:03:11.080> have<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.410> do<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.620> because<00:03:11.770> without

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
just have to do it because without

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.690 
just have to do it because without
MCEdit<00:03:13.320> they<00:03:14.320> will<00:03:14.530> decay<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.190> just<00:03:15.370> I'll

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
MCEdit they will decay so I just I'll

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.550 
MCEdit they will decay so I just I'll
just<00:03:16.080> show<00:03:17.080> you<00:03:17.880> they<00:03:18.880> will<00:03:19.030> look<00:03:19.270> like<00:03:19.420> this

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
just show you they will look like this

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.010 
just show you they will look like this
but<00:03:20.560> these<00:03:20.860> are<00:03:20.980> going<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.190> decay<00:03:21.610> see<00:03:22.480> one

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
but these are going to decay see one

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.600 
but these are going to decay see one
just<00:03:23.230> decay<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:24.640> we<00:03:25.120> can't<00:03:25.360> have<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:26.610> but

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
just decay so we can't have that but

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.550 
just decay so we can't have that but
yeah<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.000> I'm<00:03:28.120> CNN<00:03:28.450> I'll<00:03:28.540> fix<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:28.989> won't<00:03:29.140> DK

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
yeah and I'm CNN I'll fix it it won't DK

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.449 
yeah and I'm CNN I'll fix it it won't DK
so<00:03:30.160> it'll<00:03:30.340> be<00:03:30.430> all<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.760> same<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:32.130> it's<00:03:33.130> very

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
so it'll be all the same and it's very

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.690 
so it'll be all the same and it's very
cool<00:03:33.670> be<00:03:34.030> camp<00:03:34.360> there<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.380> camp<00:03:35.680> there<00:03:36.100> or<00:03:36.610> you

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
cool be camp there the camp there or you

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.090 
cool be camp there the camp there or you
can<00:03:36.820> jungle<00:03:37.300> then<00:03:37.930> here's<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.350> three<00:03:38.860> lanes

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
can jungle then here's the three lanes

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.820 
can jungle then here's the three lanes
and<00:03:39.489> then<00:03:39.670> there's<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:40.000> lane<00:03:40.209> right<00:03:40.360> there<00:03:40.830> set

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
and then there's a lane right there set

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.740 
and then there's a lane right there set
it<00:03:41.920> today<00:03:42.190> now<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:45.250> yeah<00:03:45.580> it's<00:03:46.060> very<00:03:46.330> very<00:03:46.510> cool

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
it today now so yeah it's very very cool

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.729 
it today now so yeah it's very very cool
um<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:48.430> then<00:03:48.610> this<00:03:49.000> is<00:03:49.090> called<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.360> Nexus<00:03:49.810> to

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
um and then this is called the Nexus to

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.580 
um and then this is called the Nexus to
spawn<00:03:51.070> turrets<00:03:51.400> we've<00:03:51.520> got<00:03:51.670> three<00:03:51.880> inhibitors

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
spawn turrets we've got three inhibitors

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.930 
spawn turrets we've got three inhibitors
three<00:03:53.590> turrets<00:03:53.800> guarding<00:03:54.190> those<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.730> this<00:03:54.850> is

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
three turrets guarding those and this is

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.380 
three turrets guarding those and this is
the<00:03:55.060> entire<00:03:55.360> spawn<00:03:55.900> then<00:03:56.820> we've<00:03:57.820> gotten<00:03:58.180> about

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
the entire spawn then we've gotten about

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.070 
the entire spawn then we've gotten about
this<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.830> hear<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.880> might<00:04:01.120> go<00:04:01.300> out<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.840> boat

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
this to hear it might go out to boat

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.170 
this to hear it might go out to boat
from<00:04:02.530> here<00:04:02.920> might<00:04:03.130> go<00:04:03.280> out<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.489> about<00:04:03.550> here<00:04:04.000> and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
from here might go out to about here and

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.300 
from here might go out to about here and
then<00:04:04.600> from<00:04:05.080> that<00:04:05.170> point<00:04:05.320> it'll<00:04:05.890> be<00:04:06.130> just

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
then from that point it'll be just

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.920 
then from that point it'll be just
mirrored<00:04:06.760> on<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.030> other<00:04:07.209> side<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:07.750> we're<00:04:07.900> very

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
mirrored on the other side so we're very

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.979 
mirrored on the other side so we're very
close<00:04:08.670> not<00:04:09.670> really<00:04:09.850> very<00:04:10.000> close<00:04:10.300> but<00:04:10.570> probably

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
close not really very close but probably

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.610 
close not really very close but probably
about<00:04:11.200> three<00:04:12.130> fourths<00:04:12.550> maybe<00:04:13.120> two<00:04:14.110> thirds

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620
