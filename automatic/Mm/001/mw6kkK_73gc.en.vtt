00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.380
 well now let's explain how 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.350
 remove 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.469
 how is the process of erasing the shell 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.680
 jack for it we just need a 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.189
 little piece of albal paper that we have here 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.100
 as you can see a cotton that is 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.300
 impregnated in 100% acetone 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:32.590
 a piece of orange stick 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.770
 we proceed to the nail is painted 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.980
 we put on top of the painted cotton 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:47.400
 that is wet as I said the acetone 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:47.400
 pure and we wrap it up we turn the finger 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:57.010
 totally on albal paper 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:01.030
 now let's leave it like that for a while 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.030
 approximately 10 minutes 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.229
 and then 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.240
 we will repeat this same process in the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.240
 trace of the fingers of both hands 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.500
 good after 10 minutes 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:27.410
 as we said approximately what 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.410
 we do is remove all the wrap 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:36.649
 dragging the albal paper with the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:42.429
 cotton that as you can see drag the 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:46.250
 Most of the remaining glaze it 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:49.460
 we remove simply with a stick of 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.060
 orange tree in a simple way and 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.270
 leaving the nail completely impeccable and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:01.759
 as you can see without any kind of 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:05.240
 deterioration the process is super simple and 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.780
 as you can see the nail that was impeccable 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.740
 with all its layers 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.650
 it is now if we want the treatment 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.170
 to do as any normal day 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.620
 our normal moisturizer wash 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.020
 the hands because the nail was with the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.720
 acetone nothing a neuronal hole 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.750
 we want to moisturize it as we do 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.750
 daily
