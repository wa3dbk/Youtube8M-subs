here's a full shot for you guys to enjoy

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.690 
here's a full shot for you guys to enjoy
so<00:01:45.960> let<00:01:46.110> me<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.320> into<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> nitty-gritty<00:01:46.860> so

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
so let me get into the nitty-gritty so

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.120 
so let me get into the nitty-gritty so
right<00:01:47.880> here<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.600> tinted<00:01:49.140> windows<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
right here we have tinted windows the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.219 
right here we have tinted windows the
roof<00:01:50.340> was<00:01:50.610> stock<00:01:51.149> carbon<00:01:51.659> fiber<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.110> was

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
roof was stock carbon fiber so it was

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.600 
roof was stock carbon fiber so it was
already<00:01:52.409> carbon<00:01:52.799> fiber<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.070> did<00:01:53.250> nothing<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
already carbon fiber we did nothing to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.370 
already carbon fiber we did nothing to
this<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.390> bar<00:01:54.600> right<00:01:54.750> here<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.990> painted

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
this but this bar right here we painted

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.280 
this but this bar right here we painted
black<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.040> then<00:01:56.700> right<00:01:57.509> here<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.840> did<00:01:58.140> this

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
black and then right here we did this

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.530 
black and then right here we did this
obviously<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.829> gold<00:01:59.040> chrome<00:01:59.340> then<00:02:00.000> down<00:02:00.240> here

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
obviously in gold chrome then down here

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.679 
obviously in gold chrome then down here
we<00:02:01.110> did<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.290> side<00:02:01.560> view<00:02:01.770> mirrors<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:03.240> carbon

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
we did the side view mirrors in a carbon

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.709 
we did the side view mirrors in a carbon
fiber<00:02:03.990> which<00:02:04.560> looks<00:02:04.890> sick<00:02:05.250> then<00:02:06.000> even<00:02:06.420> these

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
fiber which looks sick then even these

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.499 
fiber which looks sick then even these
little<00:02:06.780> grilles<00:02:07.729> if<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:09.030> see<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.390> we

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
little grilles if you can see that we

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.630 
little grilles if you can see that we
did<00:02:09.690> these<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:10.020> carbon<00:02:10.349> fiber<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:10.860> well

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
did these in carbon fiber as well

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.230 
did these in carbon fiber as well
we<00:02:12.180> let<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> stingray<00:02:12.810> logo<00:02:13.110> black<00:02:13.410> as<00:02:13.680> is

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
we let the stingray logo black as is

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.360 
we let the stingray logo black as is
left<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.360> rims<00:02:15.600> powder<00:02:16.050> black<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:17.160> then<00:02:17.280> if

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
left the rims powder black but then if

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.520 
left the rims powder black but then if
we<00:02:17.490> come<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.700> here<00:02:17.820> we<00:02:18.060> tinted<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.630> headlights

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
we come up here we tinted the headlights

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.150 
we come up here we tinted the headlights
to<00:02:20.520> make<00:02:20.670> them<00:02:20.880> blacker<00:02:21.770> let's<00:02:22.770> get<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.980> nice

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
to make them blacker let's get a nice

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.550 
to make them blacker let's get a nice
wide<00:02:23.430> shot<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> front<00:02:24.000> view

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
wide shot of the front view

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.460 
wide shot of the front view
it's<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.710> blinding<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:27.300> if<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.350> guys

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
it's like blinding so if you guys

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.800 
it's like blinding so if you guys
remember<00:02:28.680> down<00:02:29.250> here<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.360> grille<00:02:30.600> there

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
remember down here in the grille there

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.240 
remember down here in the grille there
was<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.960> chrome<00:02:31.260> bar<00:02:31.560> right<00:02:31.770> there<00:02:31.980> well<00:02:32.130> we

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
was a chrome bar right there well we

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.720 
was a chrome bar right there well we
made<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.610> also<00:02:33.390> carbon<00:02:33.960> fiber<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.550> just

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
made that also carbon fiber so it's just

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.580 
made that also carbon fiber so it's just
not<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.270> tin<00:02:36.720> see<00:02:36.960> because<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.260> thought<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.500> was

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
not so tin see because I thought it was

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.130 
not so tin see because I thought it was
kind<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.860> cheap<00:02:38.160> looking<00:02:38.600> then<00:02:39.600> we<00:02:39.750> did<00:02:39.960> the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
kind of cheap looking then we did the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.040 
kind of cheap looking then we did the
scoop<00:02:40.500> all<00:02:41.190> carbon<00:02:41.880> fiber<00:02:41.910> oh<00:02:42.420> my<00:02:42.720> god<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.020> is

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
scoop all carbon fiber oh my god that is

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.890 
scoop all carbon fiber oh my god that is
blinding<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.240> little<00:02:45.450> grille<00:02:45.690> pieces

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
blinding so the little grille pieces

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.740 
blinding so the little grille pieces
here<00:02:46.410> were<00:02:47.070> each<00:02:47.370> individually<00:02:48.180> laid<00:02:48.360> carbon

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
here were each individually laid carbon

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.010 
here were each individually laid carbon
fiber<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.260> then<00:02:50.190> we<00:02:50.340> got<00:02:50.580> this<00:02:51.000> big<00:02:51.390> hood

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
fiber and then we got this big hood

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.130 
fiber and then we got this big hood
scoop<00:02:52.560> carbon<00:02:53.010> fiber<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.730> come<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.750> this<00:02:54.900> side

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
scoop carbon fiber and come to this side

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.260 
scoop carbon fiber and come to this side
and<00:02:55.320> it's<00:02:55.440> essentially<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.070> same<00:02:56.100> as<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
and it's essentially the same as the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.180 
and it's essentially the same as the
other<00:02:57.450> side<00:02:57.780> got<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.230> carbon<00:02:58.590> fiber<00:02:58.800> side

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
other side got the carbon fiber side

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.510 
other side got the carbon fiber side
mirror<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.959> know<00:03:01.050> beautiful<00:03:01.500> gold<00:03:01.770> chrome
