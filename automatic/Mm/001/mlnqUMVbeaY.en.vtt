00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hi 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.189
 In this video I show you how to do it 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.530
 with less than 20 euros a saddle pad 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.830
 can design yourself that is the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.200
 finished saddlebag has made tight 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.600
 I advise you against the Schabracken 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.920
 to take himself the unfavorable fooled 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.540
 can link new returns or interfere 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.910
 In addition, you get mixed baking from ten 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.910
 euro on ebay or any 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.180
 sent 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.880
 That's what my saddleback looked like before 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.520
 have them there at 416 euros for triggers 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.660
 and now I'll show you what I mean 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.510
 created own saddle pad 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.220
 Step 1 What a powerful language 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.080
 I have decided for it 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.379
 that I have a bordeaux colored 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.620
 Saddlebag wants to have a white one 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.330
 and golden cord and the logo do 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.629
 I also golden step two peck 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.960
 we need a saddle cloth 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.979
 which we want to stick for our logo 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.020
 the decorative cords and fleeces line 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.810
 two-sided the drawstring should be at least 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 be three meters long and the fabrics so 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.850
 big as your logo should be 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.160
 with the other objects we 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.550
 I'm assuming that 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.039
 Every household at home has it all 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.009
 Items except this question got 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.509
 in every nails or on the internet 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.690
 Step 3 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.600
 Preparing the saddlebag if 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.520
 your saddlebag has animal cords on it 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.950
 Can you do this if you like the color 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.750
 Do not remove it 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.090
 I'm lucky enough to have one of the four 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.610
 I like to draw the color 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.380
 and that's why I'm removing 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.380
 only the peephole 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.830
 let's get to step 4 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.440
 in step 1 we have already 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.630
 thought about it like our logo 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.190
 should look like 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.380
 Here are some examples for 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.390
 please be careful that you 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.970
 cut out with scissors at any time 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.300
 can and that they are not too complicated 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.390
 are 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.890
 I designed my logo myself if 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.810
 you are interested in how I did that 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.370
 have me write a comment 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.050
 and maybe I'll do a video then 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.820
 for you how to own a logo 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.290
 create 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.430
 if you chose a logo 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.380
 you just have to print it out 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.450
 The logo should not be too big 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.150
 otherwise it could leaf from the saddle 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.500
 to be covered is the logo 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.530
 We come to the step 5 we printed 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.810
 take our logo put it on ours 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.120
 fabric and cut out the outlines 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.010
 this is better a little too much 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.560
 as too little substance 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.390
 and now comes our tile line 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.610
 two-sided for use 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.069
 In case you are not sure we know this 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.829
 line should just ask in 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.349
 your negative after i could do this 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.480
 line before that, of course, crop that 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.940
 It's a lot easier than me 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.310
 did it and then you take yours 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.069
 iron and iron the whole 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.739
 tidy but watch out for that 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.689
 not unconnected whole important is that 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.700
 put your iron on level 2 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.709
 then take your logo back to hand 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.750
 and cut that with about one 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.750
 centimeter edge off 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.569
 then you grab the widest 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:50.970
 transparent tape what we find 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.970
 can and sticks to the whole thing 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.400
 and now we come to the hardest 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.220
 part of the whole story 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.739
 cutting it out like I did before 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.560
 said put very strong 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.360
 which logo you have my logo is already 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.549
 pretty hard so I have to go all the way 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.539
 Lettering with a thick scissors 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.239
 cut out 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.400
 It did work but it did 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.960
 took a long time and if i had one 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.190
 error would have done, I would have times 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.190
 have to start from the beginning 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.190
 when you're done with the cut 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.130
 are removed her from both sides, the 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.229
 slides and puts the logo exactly the same way 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.229
 as want ironing later on 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.520
 give yourself to lie down especially 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.710
 trouble because there is no more 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.870
 possibility more around the logo on any 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.910
 to change a fashion style 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.389
 because we will open the picture right away 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.389
 iron 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.860
 Now we take our iron again 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:28.430
 often set it 2 and consider it for 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.340
 A maximum of 80 customers on the saddle pad and 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.740
 Press properly to please no longer 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.510
 because otherwise you have states logo and 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.540
 burn spot and thus is step five 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.990
 ended our logo is churned and 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.360
 ready and then we come already 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.570
 for our last step that 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.550
 take up the cords as already said 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.950
 I'm lucky that a cord 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.840
 On it is that means I just have to 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.840
 still accept the golden cord 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.819
 this can be done either by hand or with 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.509
 make the sewing machine 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:06.620
 originally i wanted it with the 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.749
 make sewing machine 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.430
 but that has just when I start 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:13.129
 wanted to give up the ghost 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.589
 So I've done it by hand 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:17.419
 that you draw properly because 

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:20.150
 if you are not properly booming because 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:24.050
 the cord may be the cord 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.550
 is too loose and thereby falls because 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.729
 it by hand then a bit 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.020
 takes longer than with the sewing machine 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.029
 By the way, I have a movie 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.749
 do not let it run that way 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.749
 boring that 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:07:00.729
 and when you're done with it you have 

00:06:56.089 --> 00:07:00.729
 your own self created saddle pad 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.389
 and now it's your turn to be creative and 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.280
 make your own shadow and me 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:11.590
 I would be very happy if you give me one 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.490
 few pictures by e-mail or facebook 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.229
 would send 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:20.550
 and if you have ideas for improvement 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:23.199
 always with it in the comment box 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:27.479
 Thanks for watching and until the 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:27.479
 next time at rider tutorials
