00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
can make now a marginal whereas the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.300 
can make now a marginal whereas the
other<00:02:01.140> guys<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.409> had<00:02:01.500> bigger<00:02:01.740> leaps<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.159> make

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
other guys have had bigger leaps to make

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.620 
other guys have had bigger leaps to make
throughout<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> course<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> season<00:02:03.240> what

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
throughout the course of the season what

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.240 
throughout the course of the season what
do<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.110> put<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.290> down<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.920> think<00:02:05.040> that's

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
do you put that down to I think that's

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.740 
do you put that down to I think that's
deceptive<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:05.969> think<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.329> go<00:02:06.479> all

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
deceptive because I think if you go all

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.089 
deceptive because I think if you go all
the<00:02:06.840> way<00:02:06.869> back<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.290> Melbourne<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.799> know<00:02:07.920> we've

you've<00:02:42.150> got<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.390> believe<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.780> but<00:02:43.020> we're

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
you've got to believe in it but we're

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.230 
you've got to believe in it but we're
really<00:02:43.680> stake<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.160> think<00:02:44.430> at<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.640> moment<00:02:44.670> we're

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
really stake I think at the moment we're

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.510 
really stake I think at the moment we're
just<00:02:45.270> trying<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.630> win<00:02:45.750> some<00:02:45.960> races<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.560> we

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
just trying to win some races and we

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.250 
just trying to win some races and we
can't<00:02:47.790> control<00:02:48.120> what<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.390> good<00:02:48.600> job<00:02:48.870> Red<00:02:49.080> Bull

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
can't control what a good job Red Bull

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.630 
can't control what a good job Red Bull
are<00:02:49.380> doing<00:02:49.560> for<00:02:49.710> instance<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.490> got

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
are doing for instance so we just got

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.550 
are doing for instance so we just got
try<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:50.880> do<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> best<00:02:51.090> job<00:02:51.300> we<00:02:51.570> can<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:52.410> can

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
try and do the best job we can we can

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.500 
try and do the best job we can we can
win<00:02:52.710> some<00:02:52.740> races<00:02:53.040> right<00:02:53.550> if<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.090> we

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
win some races right if that we

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.180 
win some races right if that we
accumulate<00:02:54.900> enough<00:02:55.080> points<00:02:55.110> but<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:56.100> the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
accumulate enough points but at the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.340 
accumulate enough points but at the
moment<00:02:56.340> there's<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.820> fearsome<00:02:57.240> lead<00:02:57.420> that's<00:02:57.750> my

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350

talking<00:03:17.880> about<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:19.580> mean<00:03:20.580> it's<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.790> track<00:03:21.000> that

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
talking about I mean it's a track that

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.750 
talking about I mean it's a track that
doesn't<00:03:21.510> play<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.900> our<00:03:22.260> key<00:03:22.530> strengths<00:03:23.100> it's

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
doesn't play to our key strengths it's

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.850 
doesn't play to our key strengths it's
very<00:03:23.880> horsepower<00:03:24.360> defended<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.080> sectors<00:03:25.470> 1<00:03:25.680> &amp;

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860
