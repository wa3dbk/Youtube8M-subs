00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 the lapse everything with you our subject of 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.309
 today are three pictures 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.099
 who already bought a square and arrived in 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.870
 all happy house with new tool 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.710
 discovered the square was not on the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.710
 squad raises the hand 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.060
 ever happened to me okay then I will show 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.279
 for you in this video how to solve this 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.260
 problem with mitigating this situation and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.900
 with make sure the pictures you 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.380
 really stands in the frames at an angle 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.380
 90 degrees 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.410
 good to make a good purchase of a 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.390
 square frames or hurt you if 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.280
 make sure the frames are good 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.110
 there are two ways the first one is to pick up 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.050
 an already reliable square 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.030
 in the case of a square is 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.270
 architecture a square and very good 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.089
 trust the quadrants and do it here 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.680
 due to the measurement another way 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.020
 because sometimes you do not have a frame 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.800
 I see that it is simpler to take a part 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.490
 of wood near mdf that is 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.990
 one side really right Aden 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.700
 and make a visor and do 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.440
 two scratches so we'll do it here 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.830
 I will put a little better position on this 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.830
 camera 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:36.460
 We got here, we support the time. 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:41.140
 Something well stayed on the court. 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:46.900
 we spent a line and saw the square 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.390
 once again we take a risk 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.140
 here it is not even foreseen that you can 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.010
 realize that our picture is outside the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.420
 square 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.420
 in these blocks is very bad 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.960
 plus a very close parallel line 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.600
 I'll show you here I do not know if 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.160
 will give to see in the video but the line 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.660
 April up here in relation to the team 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.760
 below 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.100
 before the man we can give much 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.940
 well here I did a show not to do 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.230
 confusion 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.880
 this picture that was difficult is so 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.209
 I need to do another and when I want 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.209
 I'll show you how it was done. 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.620
 others the line will run away 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.620
 you can make a parallel line or 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.540
 a line really on top of the other 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:55.340
 the two parallel pathways that visually 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:58.489
 easier on the video, I do not know either 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.069
 if it will be possible to see but you can have the 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:05.290
 idea with my pictures is in line 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:08.000
 perfectly parallel to one another 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.250
 indicating that my picture really is 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.989
 in school then my squared 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.260
 What I did is better than space. 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.430
 bought in a store in June the brand is 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.390
 Famous in Brazil 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.220
 But that's okay, so this is the tip of 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.790
 today for you and I hope you like it 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.790
 and help you there to make sure that 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.010
 Your school really is 90 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.420
 degrees of correct angle and prevent 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.950
 you make that property that arrives in the 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.900
 end you do not understand why the property 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.330
 is out of the square and you stay 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.340
 thinking that the guilt was rising cut 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.920
 wrong and actually can be 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.030
 simply its measuring tool 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.160
 Ok guys, I hope you have 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.329
 liked the tip today with a hug to 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.329
 all and until the next video
