benefit<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.800> individual<00:00:46.800> spec<00:00:47.220> so<00:00:48.180> I

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
benefit your individual spec so I

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.200

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
wouldn't analyzed it and I came up with

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.760 
wouldn't analyzed it and I came up with
the<00:00:51.330> best<00:00:51.480> stat<00:00:51.780> priority<00:00:52.020> possible

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the best stat priority possible

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.830 
the best stat priority possible
protection<00:00:53.280> where's<00:00:53.880> batch<00:00:54.240> 555<00:00:56.540> okay<00:00:57.540> first

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
protection where's batch 555 okay first

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.180 
protection where's batch 555 okay first
we're<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> start<00:00:58.290> off<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.590> hit<00:00:59.010> and
