00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.679 
snapped open these are built for this so
when<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:02.549> pop<00:03:03.549> out<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.819> lens<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:07.090> paper<00:03:07.359> will

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
when you pop out a lens the paper will

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.619 
when you pop out a lens the paper will
probably<00:03:08.109> shatter<00:03:08.739> already<00:03:09.129> right<00:03:09.400> here<00:03:09.629> the

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
probably shatter already right here the

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:18.179 
probably shatter already right here the
plastic<00:03:11.079> will<00:03:11.200> crack

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.630 

so<00:03:19.189> look<00:03:19.519> for<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.760> also<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.489> the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
so look for that also and this is the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.069 
so look for that also and this is the
big<00:03:22.909> tip<00:03:23.390> right<00:03:23.689> here<00:03:23.719> the<00:03:24.500> big<00:03:24.709> tipper<00:03:26.079> when

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
big tip right here the big tipper when

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.130 
big tip right here the big tipper when
you<00:03:27.170> close<00:03:27.469> your<00:03:27.500> glasses<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.750> when<00:03:29.989> you're

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
you close your glasses and when you're

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.580 
you close your glasses and when you're
opening<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.590> up<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:32.510> fake<00:03:32.750> ones<00:03:33.019> don't<00:03:33.230> snap

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
opening it up the fake ones don't snap

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.800 
opening it up the fake ones don't snap
back<00:03:34.720> only<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:36.620> real<00:03:36.890> ones<00:03:37.159> snap<00:03:37.489> back<00:03:37.810> all

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
back only the real ones snap back all

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.849 
back only the real ones snap back all
right<00:03:39.579> here<00:03:40.579> we<00:03:40.760> go<00:03:41.200> when<00:03:42.200> you're<00:03:42.379> moving<00:03:42.620> it

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
right here we go when you're moving it

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:48.300 
right here we go when you're moving it
this<00:03:43.069> far<00:03:43.400> right<00:03:44.530> here<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.739> will<00:03:45.829> snap<00:03:46.159> back

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.319 

solve<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.489> then<00:03:50.420> we<00:03:50.629> go<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.200> other<00:03:51.319> one

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
solve that then we go to the other one

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:59.229 
solve that then we go to the other one
right<00:03:53.329> here<00:03:53.650> it'll<00:03:54.650> snap<00:03:54.950> back<00:03:57.970> fake<00:03:58.970> ones

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
right here it'll snap back fake ones

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:06.080 
right here it'll snap back fake ones
don't<00:03:59.480> do<00:03:59.659> that<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:01.370> there<00:04:01.609> you<00:04:01.700> go

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090
