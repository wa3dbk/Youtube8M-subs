message we're going to save that message
persistently<00:01:43.700> in<00:01:43.789> a<00:01:43.850> database<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.630> then

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
persistently in a database and then

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.959 
persistently in a database and then
retrieve<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.740> back<00:01:45.920> out<00:01:46.250> when<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.789> app<00:01:46.939> starts

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969
