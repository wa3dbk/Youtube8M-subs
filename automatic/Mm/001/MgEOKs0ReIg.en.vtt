of it yes so so one of the biggest
questions<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:09.940> get<00:01:10.000> about<00:01:10.300> this<00:01:10.659> pattern<00:01:11.050> and

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
questions I get about this pattern and

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.800 
questions I get about this pattern and
other<00:01:11.350> patterns<00:01:11.770> is<00:01:12.060> how<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.120> resize<00:01:13.570> like

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
other patterns is how to resize like

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.180 
other patterns is how to resize like
what<00:01:13.960> if<00:01:14.049> my<00:01:14.170> foot<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.440> bigger<00:01:14.590> what<00:01:14.950> if<00:01:15.040> my

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
what if my foot is bigger what if my

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.800 
what if my foot is bigger what if my
foot<00:01:15.370> is<00:01:15.460> smaller<00:01:15.790> it<00:01:16.210> is<00:01:16.270> originally

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
foot is smaller it is originally

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.360 
foot is smaller it is originally
published<00:01:16.990> just<00:01:17.260> in<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.500> one<00:01:17.650> size<00:01:17.860> right<00:01:18.159> I

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
published just in the one size right I

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.020 
published just in the one size right I
mean<00:01:18.580> one<00:01:18.790> size<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:20.080> in<00:01:20.230> this<00:01:20.350> sock<00:01:20.620> it's<00:01:21.100> a<00:01:21.340> 64

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
mean one size so in this sock it's a 64

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.470 
mean one size so in this sock it's a 64
stitch<00:01:22.300> sock<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.200> has<00:01:23.530> four<00:01:23.770> repeats<00:01:24.190> of<00:01:24.580> the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
stitch sock it has four repeats of the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.750 
stitch sock it has four repeats of the
type<00:01:25.930> pattern<00:01:26.200> okay<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.250> easiest<00:01:27.520> way<00:01:27.700> to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
type pattern okay and the easiest way to

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.720 
type pattern okay and the easiest way to
make<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:27.940> bigger<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.930> knit<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.170> with<00:01:29.950> bigger

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
make it bigger is to knit it with bigger

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.460 
make it bigger is to knit it with bigger
needles<00:01:31.150> and<00:01:31.420> a<00:01:31.450> thicker<00:01:31.630> yarn<00:01:31.720> which<00:01:32.200> is<00:01:32.320> what

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
needles and a thicker yarn which is what

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.680 
needles and a thicker yarn which is what
I<00:01:32.500> did<00:01:32.560> here<00:01:32.950> okay<00:01:33.430> but<00:01:33.790> sometimes<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.600> know

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
I did here okay but sometimes you know

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.360 
I did here okay but sometimes you know
thicker<00:01:34.960> yarn<00:01:35.050> isn't<00:01:35.530> very<00:01:35.740> comfortable<00:01:35.890> I

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
thicker yarn isn't very comfortable I

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.220 
thicker yarn isn't very comfortable I
have<00:01:36.580> very<00:01:36.670> wide<00:01:36.880> feet<00:01:37.150> so<00:01:37.390> it's<00:01:37.720> hard<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.050> fit

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
have very wide feet so it's hard to fit

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.890 
have very wide feet so it's hard to fit
thick<00:01:38.440> yarn<00:01:38.620> in<00:01:38.980> my<00:01:39.220> shoes<00:01:39.580> right<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:40.570> what<00:01:40.870> I

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
thick yarn in my shoes right so what I

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.470 
thick yarn in my shoes right so what I
do<00:01:41.650> if<00:01:42.160> I<00:01:42.280> wanted<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.550> have<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:42.940> bigger<00:01:43.210> sock

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
do if I wanted to have a bigger sock

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.380 
do if I wanted to have a bigger sock
what<00:01:43.720> I<00:01:43.750> might<00:01:43.930> do<00:01:44.110> is<00:01:44.140> use<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.500> thinner<00:01:44.860> yarn

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
what I might do is use a thinner yarn

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.940 
what I might do is use a thinner yarn
that's<00:01:46.390> you<00:01:46.810> know<00:01:46.930> very<00:01:47.230> nice<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:47.560> will<00:01:47.770> wear

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
that's you know very nice and will wear

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.690 
that's you know very nice and will wear
well<00:01:48.160> and<00:01:48.790> it<00:01:48.940> at<00:01:49.120> a<00:01:49.150> much<00:01:49.600> tighter<00:01:50.160> gauge<00:01:51.160> but

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
well and it at a much tighter gauge but

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.640 
well and it at a much tighter gauge but
then<00:01:51.850> change<00:01:52.180> modify<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.840> actual<00:01:53.440> stitch

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
then change modify the actual stitch

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.910 
then change modify the actual stitch
pattern<00:01:54.040> so<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.340> each<00:01:55.180> repeat<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:55.990> wider<00:01:56.350> so
