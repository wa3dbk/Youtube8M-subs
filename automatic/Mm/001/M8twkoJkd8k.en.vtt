00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600

one I think it's really my biggest
school<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.409> top<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.829> maintaining

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
school and on top of that maintaining

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.710

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640

so i think i really i think both are my
big<00:01:38.939> goals<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.720> i<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:39.869> that's<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.229> me

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
