00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
lower part of your body you can do it

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.130 
lower part of your body you can do it
two<00:02:00.270> different<00:02:00.299> ways

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
two different ways

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.289 
two different ways
I<00:02:01.170> went<00:02:01.649> ahead<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.860> left<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> comb<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.909> and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
I went ahead and left the comb on and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.630 
I went ahead and left the comb on and
cleaned<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.960> up<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.290> way<00:02:04.560> sometimes<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.460> can

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
cleaned it up that way sometimes you can

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.100 
cleaned it up that way sometimes you can
clip<00:02:05.880> those<00:02:06.090> same<00:02:06.329> areas<00:02:06.750> down<00:02:06.930> they're<00:02:07.079> a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
clip those same areas down they're a

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.779 
clip those same areas down they're a
little<00:02:07.320> bit<00:02:07.500> tighter<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> bigger<00:02:08.399> older

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
little bit tighter on the bigger older

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.279 
little bit tighter on the bigger older
hogs<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.420> we're<00:02:09.509> going<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> market<00:02:10.170> hug

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
hogs that we're going to the market hug

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.110 
hogs that we're going to the market hug
shows<00:02:10.500> or<00:02:10.709> breeding<00:02:10.890> shows<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.730> typically

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
shows or breeding shows we typically

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.290 
shows or breeding shows we typically
will<00:02:12.239> clip<00:02:12.510> them<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> little

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
will clip them a little

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.520 
will clip them a little
titer<00:02:13.600> down<00:02:13.960> there<00:02:14.110> because<00:02:14.200> they<00:02:14.380> have<00:02:14.500> a

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
titer down there because they have a

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.020 
titer down there because they have a
little<00:02:14.770> coarser<00:02:15.370> hair<00:02:15.400> at<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.730> particular

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
little coarser hair at that particular

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.450 
little coarser hair at that particular
point<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.620> little<00:02:17.890> ones<00:02:18.040> will<00:02:18.160> leave<00:02:18.340> the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
point so the little ones will leave the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.670 
point so the little ones will leave the
guards<00:02:18.820> on<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.180> older<00:02:19.480> ones<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:20.080> market<00:02:20.500> hogs

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
guards on the older ones the market hogs

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.080 
guards on the older ones the market hogs
will<00:02:20.920> bring<00:02:21.070> you<00:02:21.220> else<00:02:21.310> will<00:02:21.460> take<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:21.820> off

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
will bring you else will take it on off

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.690 
will bring you else will take it on off

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
the Clippers from the standpoint of wear

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.520 
the Clippers from the standpoint of wear
that<00:03:03.490> face<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.150> wear<00:03:04.240> that<00:03:04.270> new<00:03:04.570> line<00:03:04.990> or<00:03:05.350> the

that face and wear that new line or the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.900 
that face and wear that new line or the
line<00:03:05.770> would<00:03:06.040> typically<00:03:06.460> be<00:03:06.580> where<00:03:06.790> there's

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
line would typically be where there's

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.760 
line would typically be where there's
hair<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.750> there's<00:03:07.960> a<00:03:08.020> little<00:03:08.260> less<00:03:08.440> hair<00:03:08.680> and

hair and there's a little less hair and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.560 
hair and there's a little less hair and
we'll<00:03:08.860> pull<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.190> through<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.760> area<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.240> it

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
we'll pull that through that area and it

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.000 
we'll pull that through that area and it
actually<00:03:10.720> blends<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.320> together<00:03:11.680> very<00:03:11.950> well

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
actually blends that together very well

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.400 
actually blends that together very well
then<00:03:12.700> we'll<00:03:12.790> put<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.030> guard<00:03:13.240> back<00:03:13.480> on<00:03:13.720> we'll

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
in if it helps kind of bring our final

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.300 
in if it helps kind of bring our final
results<00:03:46.630> out<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:47.290> also<00:03:47.500> helps<00:03:47.920> us<00:03:48.010> bring<00:03:48.220> a

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
results out that also helps us bring a

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.880 
results out that also helps us bring a
little<00:03:48.550> bit<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:49.540> few<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.350> those<00:03:50.410> hairs<00:03:50.709> that

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
little bit of a few of those hairs that

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.160 
little bit of a few of those hairs that
maybe<00:03:51.130> also<00:03:51.580> straggling<00:03:52.060> again<00:03:52.390> brings<00:03:52.959> them

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
maybe also straggling again brings them

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.240 
maybe also straggling again brings them
out<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.530> front<00:03:53.770> so<00:03:53.890> we<00:03:53.980> can<00:03:54.130> finish

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
out to the front so we can finish

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.520 
out to the front so we can finish
clipping<00:03:54.820> him<00:03:54.910> up<00:03:55.090> but<00:03:55.540> this<00:03:55.870> really<00:03:56.140> helps<00:03:56.470> to

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
clipping him up but this really helps to

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.620 
clipping him up but this really helps to
the<00:03:56.680> skin<00:03:56.980> in<00:03:57.100> health<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.520> hair<00:03:57.700> care<00:03:57.910> as<00:03:58.120> you
