00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello there is a psycho arthur today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.040
 there will be a video on indian-panzer and I recently 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.769
 did one vidosik on this tank 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.130
 or then not explained what the general brain and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.430
 doing in this fight lost a little bit 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.539
 clarify the situation once I decided you 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.260
 buy a panther 2 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.500
 because I water and came well 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.220
 not bad ride drove it raised 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.340
 statistics raised the average damage there was 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.380
 so normal in general and then I realized that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.280
 scrap i don't arrange a completely cannon 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.570
 panther 2 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.210
 that is, this eighty-eight 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.100
 millimeters to me like breaking through in 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.770
 a barrel and rob us and gold and not 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.270
 like and precision mixing 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.180
 that is, I can not say that there is a car 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.079
 not playable but still would like to 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.520
 better to 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.510
 and then suddenly apay indian-panzer africa 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.899
 remembering that i'm on it when 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.899
 pumped over kept 2,000 average damage 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.539
 I remember a bunch of naked combat so we are not 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.400
 but the type was not the only type 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:11.159
 which i was up to thing 4 level there 83 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.260
 percent in 1 1 I planted it for gold 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.860
 perry has trained or our own 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.320
 pump the moment when we spend 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.030
 This bout of light bulbs I have not had and 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.880
 now you look fraught for 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.530
 me 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.110
 the situation got out in general I right now we arrow 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.810
 such a palm tree and think what was the first 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.440
 masking but no masking is not the same 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.299
 awesome 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.100
 why I suddenly thought that I did not 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.229
 lit up in from the moment because 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.030
 fucking lines and didn't even look at 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.369
 my side that is usually me 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.050
 I am guided by the trunks and arms and tanks 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.210
 last we look at you at least 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.770
 turn around which way does that mean 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.430
 that the light bulb is on fire and usually not 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.950
 manages to go even before the light bulb 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.950
 I will appear on the screen 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.740
 same delay in three seconds and just me 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.780
 did not take into account the fact that this dude with 300 mi 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.210
 efficiency must not simply substitute for 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.220
 nothing to the parties and so good 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.500
 cut off the accumulator from the su-152 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.989
 but nevertheless I did not lose it 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.930
 continue to fight already normal mode 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.180
 let's say so that's why i generally 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.940
 like this tanchik 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.610
 when he was pumped it is awesome in 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.510
 that is, I am just a person who is not 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.570
 used to tanks with a good jew and 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.750
 sometimes rode for one armor he's me 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.750
 just shocked how comfortable it is 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.620
 that is, I certainly promote the gameplay 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.709
 on tanks with not very good angles 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.870
 sort of 121 343 and nothing 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.209
 there is no bad there but when you sit on 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.340
 indian-panzer and especially after how he would 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.689
 such a tank with little you 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.540
 you start to feel just why people 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.390
 still love emirs why vivat tanks 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.860
 prem from the corner 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.900
 because many positions open 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.670
 just with a new share of such comfort 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.280
 convenience bushes anywhere there too 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.010
 successfully become caused by the tower and always 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.769
 quietly fire that is on this 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.989
 map in the most important direction I think 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.879
 this zero line here is usually a hassle 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.450
 tyazhe and since I have two in the review 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:21.480
 heavy tank truth is not so alone 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.900
 heavy and walking little idea often not immediately 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.299
 hurry and many say well now 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.530
 already used in kobe ​​there everyones 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.829
 eSports events 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.069
 then he is better well, I'm in this drastically 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:38.609
 I do not agree with dodge of course I'm good 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.769
 got a good car can show 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.730
 excellent results but compared to 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.430
 indian-panzer am 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.790
 he is less adapted to play at random 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.840
 because you have ideas your tools 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.180
 it's better in terms of dpm 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.859
 mobility is better than pershing 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.829
 slightly less speaks and and rarity as a whole 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.620
 there is a feeling of maneuverability on 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.669
 first did not give them yet fast and yet 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.160
 inferior turkey that's it in 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.329
 mobility and it greatly influences the field 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.579
 combat especially in random 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.010
 many say that there is a Pershing 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.900
 awesome armored tower with a turn 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.209
 disguised as weapons 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.359
 in practice, how many have not met 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.219
 pershing 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.580
 I've never had such a situation 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:25.960
 that I could not break straight and the tower about 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.659
 turkey basically at the moment 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.490
 I just appeared on the server 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.770
 at first I was completely horrified I thought well 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.159
 it's all a killer type 59 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.560
 i.e. just takes out their pdp but when 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.810
 it also has an armored arm for that 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.360
 real moment met in a fight on so and 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.919
 could not normally punch but with 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.080
 time realized that in fact the car 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.629
 quite cardboard although very often 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.870
 she fights back a number and when you don't 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:54.789
 expect vld at good angles bushes 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.099
 sometimes you can tank in the party 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.310
 armored not bad though they are down there 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:02.800
 slightly less armored than the top but 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.830
 this does not exclude the chance to talk this 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.919
 form be a house in this situation i 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.110
 here is a good already shot taxied 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.210
 let's say the direction of heavy and decided 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.439
 revenge t-43 which is wrong 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:20.979
 shot down the board and now make the fatal 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:23.669
 a mistake literally fatal here 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:27.150
 attempted to tankan tank which 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.529
 is on top and structure to me 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.039
 Of course, deservedly sends 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.419
 shell in the board at such an angle rather 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.080
 all he even on the roof of my dreams 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.539
 threw 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.460
 I am successfully going to the hangar but thoughts 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.770
 you already do not solve anything and the team 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.210
 dragging in my absence let's say so 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.219
 thanks for watching 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.900
 soon wait some more 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.150
 vidos so tank which I 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.060
 I'll tell you more about the tactics of application 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.770
 until the bugs have space on the maps 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.020
 whom I went to successfully applied 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.610
 this car and by the way still kept for 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.610
 average he is all good luck
