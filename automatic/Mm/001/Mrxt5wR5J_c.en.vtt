00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.109 
invisible barrier which was found by me
so<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.979> really<00:01:32.159> good<00:01:32.250> spot<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.729> i<00:01:32.759> really

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
so it's a really good spot and i really

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.690 
so it's a really good spot and i really
recommend<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.630> try<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.990> out<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.040> next

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
recommend you try that out so the next

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.490 
recommend you try that out so the next
spot<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> map<00:01:36.479> fallen<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
spot is on the map fallen you have to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.679 
spot is on the map fallen you have to
jump<00:01:37.829> from<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.400> railing<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.540> this

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
jump from the railing on to this

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.410 
jump from the railing on to this
lamppost<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.130> go<00:01:41.700> back<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:42.030> far<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.329> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
lamppost and then go back as far as you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.700 
lamppost and then go back as far as you
can<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.630> when<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.960> buy<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.290> you're<00:01:43.470> pretty

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
can and when you buy here you're pretty

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.130 
can and when you buy here you're pretty
much<00:01:43.770> invincible<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.720> long<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:45.960> you're

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
much invincible as long as you're

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.810 
much invincible as long as you're
looking<00:01:46.409> straight<00:01:46.770> towards<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> railing<00:01:47.700> so

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
looking straight towards the railing so

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.980 
looking straight towards the railing so
it<00:01:47.880> will<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.270> able<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.479> get<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.659> from<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
stairs by jumping and knifing at you so

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.359 
stairs by jumping and knifing at you so
it's<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.049> really<00:01:52.259> good<00:01:52.350> spot<00:01:52.619> I'm<00:01:52.829> surprised

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369

I've seen a few people use it but it's a

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.139 
I've seen a few people use it but it's a
really<00:01:58.380> easy<00:01:58.469> spot<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.219> into<00:01:59.460> guys<00:01:59.670> and
