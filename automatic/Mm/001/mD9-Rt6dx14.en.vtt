to be contend with it it was certainly
not<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.170> best<00:01:40.500> writing<00:01:40.770> I've<00:01:41.100> ever

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
not the best writing I've ever

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.110

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
demonstrated and conditions too I mean

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.210 
demonstrated and conditions too I mean
probably<00:01:45.540> really<00:01:46.170> good<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.680> line<00:01:46.860> but

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
probably really good for the line but

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.360 
probably really good for the line but
perfect<00:01:47.640> snow<00:01:47.850> no<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.830> mean<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.920> lower<00:01:50.100> half

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
perfect snow no I mean the lower half

line<00:01:54.480> is<00:01:54.720> exceptionally<00:01:55.350> hard<00:01:55.550> but<00:01:56.550> I'll<00:01:56.670> go

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
line is exceptionally hard but I'll go

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.960 
line is exceptionally hard but I'll go
back<00:01:57.090> I'll<00:01:57.840> keep<00:01:58.140> doing<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.470> again<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.070> I'll

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
back I'll keep doing it again and I'll

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.030 
back I'll keep doing it again and I'll
keep<00:02:00.180> going<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.720> looking<00:02:01.230> for<00:02:01.440> places<00:02:01.650> like

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
keep going and looking for places like

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.450 
keep going and looking for places like
that<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.810> grab<00:02:03.810> me<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.410> force<00:02:04.980> me<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.220> be

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
engaged at that precise moment where

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.090 
engaged at that precise moment where
nothing<00:02:11.370> else<00:02:11.550> matters<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.980> like<00:02:13.980> the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
nothing else matters I like the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.870 
nothing else matters I like the
consequence

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
consequence

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.930 
consequence
I<00:02:15.060> like<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.540> risk<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:16.460> like<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.640> fact<00:02:17.850> that

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
I like the risk I like the fact that

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.640 
I like the risk I like the fact that
you're<00:02:18.120> forced<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.600> there<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.290> can't<00:02:19.560> be

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
you're forced to be there it can't be

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.380 
you're forced to be there it can't be
anywhere<00:02:20.010> else

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.110 

why<00:02:24.390> would<00:02:24.570> keep<00:02:24.750> doing<00:02:24.780> it
