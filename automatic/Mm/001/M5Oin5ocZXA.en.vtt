eyelashes and these look like very good
quality<00:06:04.800> like<00:06:05.070> math<00:06:05.430> eyelashes<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:06.570> I<00:06:06.630> want

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
quality like math eyelashes and I want

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.630 
quality like math eyelashes and I want
to<00:06:06.870> give<00:06:06.990> them<00:06:07.110> a<00:06:07.170> try<00:06:07.380> they<00:06:07.620> were<00:06:07.710> only<00:06:07.950> $4.99

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
to give them a try they were only $4.99

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.940 
to give them a try they were only $4.99
and<00:06:09.000> it<00:06:09.270> comes<00:06:09.480> with<00:06:09.690> their<00:06:10.200> own<00:06:10.230> set<00:06:10.650> of<00:06:10.680> glue

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
and it comes with their own set of glue

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.310 
and it comes with their own set of glue
and<00:06:11.250> eyelash<00:06:11.670> case<00:06:12.090> so<00:06:12.660> I'm<00:06:12.750> guessing<00:06:13.110> you<00:06:13.170> can

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
and eyelash case so I'm guessing you can

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.690 
and eyelash case so I'm guessing you can
hold<00:06:13.530> onto<00:06:13.680> these<00:06:13.920> eyelashes<00:06:14.340> you<00:06:14.400> don't<00:06:14.550> just

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
hold onto these eyelashes you don't just

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.310 
hold onto these eyelashes you don't just
have<00:06:14.820> to<00:06:14.880> use<00:06:15.060> them<00:06:15.180> once<00:06:15.390> because<00:06:16.050> it<00:06:16.170> comes

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
have to use them once because it comes

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.830 
have to use them once because it comes
in<00:06:16.440> a<00:06:16.500> case<00:06:16.710> and<00:06:17.040> they<00:06:17.640> look<00:06:17.880> like<00:06:18.120> they<00:06:18.660> would

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
in a case and they look like they would

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.990 
in a case and they look like they would
fit<00:06:19.080> my<00:06:19.230> eye<00:06:19.260> size<00:06:19.770> so<00:06:20.160> I'm<00:06:20.670> gonna<00:06:20.760> try<00:06:20.940> these
