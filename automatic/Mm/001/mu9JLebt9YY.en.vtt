things<00:02:02.399> will<00:02:02.520> probably<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.149> 1499<00:02:04.140> so

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
things will probably be like 1499 so

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.609 
things will probably be like 1499 so
there's<00:02:04.920> five<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.130> them<00:02:05.310> $75<00:02:06.299> plus<00:02:06.479> tax<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.469> I'm

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
there's five of them $75 plus tax so I'm

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.770
