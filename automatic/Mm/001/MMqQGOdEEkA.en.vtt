00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
really bad for Mettenberger being a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.600 
really bad for Mettenberger being a
quarterback<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.320> could<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.890> imagine<00:01:05.189> how<00:01:05.549> it

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
quarterback I could just imagine how it

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.219

would<00:01:05.729> feel<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.479> happen<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
would feel to have that happen to have a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.460 
would feel to have that happen to have a
team<00:01:08.150> dropped<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.299> new<00:01:09.450> guy<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.049> highly<00:01:10.320> tell

really<00:02:07.350> good<00:02:07.650> at<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:07.979> very<00:02:08.399> very<00:02:08.610> accurate<00:02:09.209> and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
really good at a very very accurate and

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.390 
really good at a very very accurate and
just<00:02:09.630> like<00:02:09.750> using<00:02:09.899> real<00:02:10.170> life<00:02:10.380> he's<00:02:10.770> quick<00:02:11.220> he

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.380 
has 94 speed I good acceleration I think
his<00:02:14.250> throat<00:02:14.490> deep<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.790> pretty<00:02:15.000> good<00:02:15.090> too<00:02:15.150> but

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
much time there radio two fumbles but he

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.810 
much time there radio two fumbles but he
was<00:05:10.080> just<00:05:10.110> throwing<00:05:10.740> people<00:05:11.220> off<00:05:11.340> of<00:05:11.400> them<00:05:11.639> so

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
was just throwing people off of them so

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.000 
was just throwing people off of them so
if<00:05:11.940> you<00:05:11.970> I<00:05:12.300> say<00:05:13.080> Winston<00:05:13.410> would<00:05:13.680> be<00:05:13.830> almost

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
if you I say Winston would be almost

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.800 
if you I say Winston would be almost
just<00:05:14.580> as<00:05:14.729> good<00:05:14.910> as<00:05:15.060> Mariota<00:05:15.389> I<00:05:15.479> just<00:05:15.690> don't

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
just as good as Mariota I just don't

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.000 
just as good as Mariota I just don't
like<00:05:15.900> them<00:05:16.020> because<00:05:16.139> obviously<00:05:16.350> I'm<00:05:16.650> a<00:05:16.710> Titan

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
like them because obviously I'm a Titan

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.100 
like them because obviously I'm a Titan
span<00:05:17.190> on<00:05:17.310> be<00:05:17.490> using<00:05:17.790> Mariota<00:05:18.330> and<00:05:18.479> I<00:05:18.900> think

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
span on be using Mariota and I think

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.780 
span on be using Mariota and I think
Winston's<00:05:19.530> a<00:05:19.560> little<00:05:19.710> bit<00:05:19.830> cheaper<00:05:20.160> so<00:05:20.400> you

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
Winston's a little bit cheaper so you

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.219 
Winston's a little bit cheaper so you
can<00:05:20.940> definitely<00:05:21.270> go<00:05:21.360> with<00:05:21.389> Winston<00:05:21.840> not<00:05:22.020> high

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
can definitely go with Winston not high

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.430 
can definitely go with Winston not high
and<00:05:22.530> just<00:05:23.070> have<00:05:23.639> fun<00:05:23.669> like<00:05:24.090> it's<00:05:24.270> a<00:05:24.419> fun<00:05:25.229> time
