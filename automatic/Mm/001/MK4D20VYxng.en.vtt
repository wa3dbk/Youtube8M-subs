 You'll need a needle one. 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.420
 bad thing cotton something 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.400
 you put the balls of the bearing 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:31.830
 later swab a bit to protect 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.989

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.989
 tec tec tool 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.440
 if you prefer a pocketknife 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.040
 so let's get started 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:57.430
 first you pull from the outside 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.430
 placing the moment the needle grass 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.530

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.330
 painted 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.990
 we already took h pine at the moment with risk 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.560
 besides because otherwise it would be very 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.560
 Crazy 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:38.960

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.960
 remove the hood from behind the bearing 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.380
 put the piece and pushing 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.380
 then it's just a passion 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.040
 now is the part you have to take 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.350
 careful not to lose fat 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.150
 of the bearing 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:05.190
 you take a knife there you have it 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.190
 to fix the balls like this 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.180
 all in one part of the year so you 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:25.909
 take something to put the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:31.000
 balls that fasten in the middle of the year 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:31.000
 all the marbles there will not work 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:43.150
 then you pick up all the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:43.150
 home pieces to understand 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.740

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.070

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.800
