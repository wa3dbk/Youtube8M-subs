you

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.500 

so<00:00:42.290> LG<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.670> other<00:00:43.850> treatment<00:00:44.270> that<00:00:44.300> we're

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
so LG the other treatment that we're

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.390 
so LG the other treatment that we're
working<00:00:44.630> on<00:00:44.930> to<00:00:45.380> develop<00:00:45.800> is<00:00:45.980> called

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
working on to develop is called

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.100 
working on to develop is called
transcranial<00:00:46.790> magnetic<00:00:47.030> stimulation<00:00:47.840> and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
transcranial magnetic stimulation and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.010 
transcranial magnetic stimulation and
that's<00:00:48.470> this<00:00:48.680> device<00:00:48.950> here<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:50.020> essentially

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
that's this device here and essentially

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.410 
that's this device here and essentially
what<00:00:51.560> allows<00:00:51.800> me<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.100> do<00:00:52.250> is<00:00:52.430> stimulate<00:00:53.300> your

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
what allows me to do is stimulate your

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.330 
what allows me to do is stimulate your
brain<00:00:53.600> or<00:00:53.930> anyone's<00:00:54.320> brain<00:00:54.560> using<00:00:55.280> a

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
brain or anyone's brain using a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.830 
brain or anyone's brain using a
non-invasive<00:00:55.760> technique<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:56.510> using<00:00:56.750> a

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
non-invasive technique and using a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.220 
non-invasive technique and using a
magnetic<00:00:57.140> field<00:00:57.440> when<00:00:58.070> I<00:00:58.100> put<00:00:58.400> the<00:00:58.490> coil<00:00:58.760> on

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
magnetic field when I put the coil on

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.660 
magnetic field when I put the coil on
the<00:01:00.230> brain<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:00.680> pulse<00:01:00.920> will<00:01:01.130> transcend

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
the brain the pulse will transcend

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.700 
the brain the pulse will transcend
through<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.150> coil<00:01:02.420> into<00:01:02.690> my<00:01:02.990> through<00:01:03.560> my

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
through the coil into my through my

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.670 
through the coil into my through my
scalp<00:01:03.980> into<00:01:04.400> my<00:01:04.550> brain<00:01:04.850> and<00:01:05.150> then<00:01:05.380> the<00:01:06.380> nature

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
scalp into my brain and then the nature

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.990 
scalp into my brain and then the nature
of<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.800> brain<00:01:06.890> tissue<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.400> such<00:01:07.550> that<00:01:07.760> it<00:01:07.880> will

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
of the brain tissue is such that it will

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.940 
of the brain tissue is such that it will
reverse<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.600> direction<00:01:08.750> of<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:09.500> current<00:01:09.710> and

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
reverse the direction of the current and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.680 
reverse the direction of the current and
that's<00:01:10.250> what<00:01:10.490> creates<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.000> magnetic<00:01:11.120> field

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
that's what creates the magnetic field

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.410 
that's what creates the magnetic field
actually<00:01:11.900> and<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.160> when<00:01:13.369> I<00:01:13.400> put<00:01:13.640> this<00:01:13.760> on<00:01:13.910> what

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
actually and so when I put this on what

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.090 
actually and so when I put this on what
I'm<00:01:14.570> doing<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:14.960> I'm<00:01:15.110> altering<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.770> action

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
I'm doing is I'm altering the action

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.710 
I'm doing is I'm altering the action
potential<00:01:16.580> of<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.729> neuron<00:01:16.940> that's<00:01:17.270> underneath

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
potential of a neuron that's underneath

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.680 
potential of a neuron that's underneath
the<00:01:17.930> coil<00:01:18.380> okay<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:19.670> in<00:01:19.820> theory<00:01:20.119> what

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
the coil okay and so in theory what

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.550 
the coil okay and so in theory what
we're<00:01:20.869> doing<00:01:21.170> is<00:01:21.290> I<00:01:22.060> developed<00:01:23.060> or<00:01:23.720> I<00:01:23.780> adapted

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
we're doing is I developed or I adapted

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.590 
we're doing is I developed or I adapted
a<00:01:24.710> protocol<00:01:25.220> for<00:01:25.910> this<00:01:26.060> patient<00:01:26.479> population

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
a protocol for this patient population

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.719 
a protocol for this patient population
of<00:01:27.140> persons<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:27.740> vegetative<00:01:28.130> state

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
of persons in the vegetative state

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.320 
of persons in the vegetative state
so<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:29.570> we<00:01:29.720> could<00:01:30.190> safely<00:01:31.190> or<00:01:31.700> what<00:01:32.030> I<00:01:32.060> think

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
so that we could safely or what I think

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.450 
so that we could safely or what I think
is<00:01:32.450> safely<00:01:32.840> provide<00:01:33.590> stimulation<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.340> their

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
is safely provide stimulation to their

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.190 
is safely provide stimulation to their
brain<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:35.270> can<00:01:35.510> activate<00:01:35.840> those

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
brain so that we can activate those

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.600 
brain so that we can activate those
neurons<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:36.740> have<00:01:36.800> been<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.460> have

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
neurons that have been that have

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.430 
neurons that have been that have
survived<00:01:38.000> or<00:01:38.360> maybe<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:39.020> were<00:01:39.110> previously

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
survived or maybe that were previously

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.560 
survived or maybe that were previously
dormant<00:01:39.800> and<00:01:40.190> then<00:01:40.400> we<00:01:40.490> can<00:01:40.640> activate<00:01:41.060> now<00:01:41.270> and

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
dormant and then we can activate now and

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.320 
dormant and then we can activate now and
if<00:01:42.110> I<00:01:42.200> give<00:01:42.380> them<00:01:42.500> enough<00:01:42.800> sessions<00:01:43.250> my<00:01:43.910> theory

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
if I give them enough sessions my theory

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.540 
if I give them enough sessions my theory
is<00:01:44.420> is<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:44.810> we<00:01:45.200> would<00:01:45.350> then<00:01:45.530> eventually<00:01:46.370> over

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
is is that we would then eventually over

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.030 
is is that we would then eventually over
time<00:01:46.580> be<00:01:47.000> able<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.240> take<00:01:47.420> one<00:01:47.780> neuron<00:01:48.040> located

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
time be able to take one neuron located

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.710 
time be able to take one neuron located
close<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.520> where<00:01:49.670> I'm<00:01:49.730> stimulating<00:01:50.390> to

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
close to where I'm stimulating to

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.300 
close to where I'm stimulating to
eventually<00:01:51.320> talk<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.710> neuron<00:01:52.100> that's

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
eventually talk to a neuron that's

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.550 
eventually talk to a neuron that's
fairly<00:01:52.670> far<00:01:52.970> away<00:01:53.240> or<00:01:53.480> remote<00:01:53.960> from<00:01:54.230> the<00:01:54.260> site

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
fairly far away or remote from the site

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.560 
fairly far away or remote from the site
of<00:01:54.590> stimulation<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:55.760> when<00:01:55.910> I<00:01:55.940> stimulate<00:01:56.450> the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
of stimulation so when I stimulate the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.930 
of stimulation so when I stimulate the
brain<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:57.020> put<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.440> coil<00:01:58.070> on<00:01:58.370> a<00:01:58.400> patient's

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
brain and put the coil on a patient's

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.990 
brain and put the coil on a patient's
brain<00:01:59.480> I'm<00:01:59.810> putting<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.680> in<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:01.790> certain

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
brain I'm putting it in a certain

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.610 
brain I'm putting it in a certain
orienting<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.750> coil<00:02:02.990> in<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.170> certain<00:02:03.440> way

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
orienting the coil in a certain way

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.710 
orienting the coil in a certain way
because<00:02:04.130> I'm<00:02:04.400> trying<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.730> target<00:02:05.210> certain

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
because I'm trying to target certain

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.020 
because I'm trying to target certain
fiber<00:02:06.080> tracts<00:02:06.470> in<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.830> brain<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.820> fiber

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
fiber tracts in the brain and the fiber

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.969 
fiber tracts in the brain and the fiber
tracts<00:02:08.390> are<00:02:08.780> actually<00:02:09.290> sorted<00:02:09.590> they<00:02:09.679> sort<00:02:09.920> of

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
tracts are actually sorted they sort of

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.009 
tracts are actually sorted they sort of
run<00:02:10.160> at<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.489> angle<00:02:10.760> okay<00:02:11.269> and<00:02:11.660> so<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:11.900> don't

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
run at this angle okay and so I don't

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.750 
run at this angle okay and so I don't
want<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.350> hold<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.650> coil<00:02:12.860> like<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.459> want

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
want to hold the coil like this I want

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.979 
want to hold the coil like this I want
to<00:02:13.790> hold<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.060> at<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.300> angle<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.780> fiber

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
to hold it at the angle of the fiber

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.009 
to hold it at the angle of the fiber
track<00:02:15.350> so<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:16.250> way<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.640> have<00:02:16.820> better<00:02:17.450> odds<00:02:17.690> of

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
track so that way I have better odds of

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.570 
track so that way I have better odds of
having<00:02:18.320> this<00:02:18.470> neuron<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.100> hopefully<00:02:19.370> have

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
having this neuron that I hopefully have

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.790 
having this neuron that I hopefully have
activate<00:02:20.180> communicate<00:02:21.019> with<00:02:21.140> another<00:02:21.440> neuron

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
activate communicate with another neuron

activate communicate with another neuron
along<00:02:22.130> this<00:02:22.340> fiber<00:02:22.700> track<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.239> we're

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
along this fiber track and we're

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.000 
along this fiber track and we're
targeting<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:24.019> fiber<00:02:24.290> tract<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:24.769> part

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
targeting that fiber tract in part

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.320 
targeting that fiber tract in part
because<00:02:25.340> there<00:02:25.519> are<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.700> lot<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:25.940> rich

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
because there are a lot of rich

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330 
because there are a lot of rich
connections<00:02:26.900> with<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.230> brain<00:02:27.410> stem<00:02:27.739> which

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
connections with the brain stem which

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.300 
connections with the brain stem which
was<00:02:28.580> has<00:02:29.299> a<00:02:29.330> very<00:02:29.900> heavy<00:02:30.320> influence<00:02:30.890> on<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> rose

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
was has a very heavy influence on a rose

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.220 
was has a very heavy influence on a rose
or<00:02:31.610> wakefulness<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:32.810> we're<00:02:32.900> trying<00:02:33.140> to

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
or wakefulness and so we're trying to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.170 
or wakefulness and so we're trying to
target<00:02:33.560> this<00:02:33.709> area<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.549> it<00:02:34.640> descends<00:02:35.000> down

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
target this area so it descends down

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.910 
target this area so it descends down
ultimately<00:02:35.420> eventually<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.350> brain<00:02:36.620> stem

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
ultimately eventually to the brain stem

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.470 
ultimately eventually to the brain stem
and<00:02:37.100> then<00:02:37.519> we'd<00:02:37.640> like<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.940> see<00:02:38.090> if<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.269> kicks

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
and then we'd like to see if it kicks

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.270 
and then we'd like to see if it kicks
back<00:02:38.540> up<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.140> what<00:02:39.560> I'm<00:02:39.680> showing<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.010> now<00:02:40.250> is

back up and what I'm showing you now is

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.360 
back up and what I'm showing you now is
one<00:02:40.820> way<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.390> help<00:02:42.019> to<00:02:42.140> inform<00:02:42.920> how<00:02:43.190> we're

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
one way that we help to inform how we're

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.570 
one way that we help to inform how we're
developing<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:44.480> TMS<00:02:45.049> treatment<00:02:45.500> you'll<00:02:46.400> need

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
to first see a healthy brain so that you

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.670 
to first see a healthy brain so that you

the hemispheres the blue imply tracks
that<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> send<00:03:09.540> from<00:03:09.810> bottom<00:03:10.200> up<00:03:10.319> or<00:03:10.889> they<00:03:11.040> may

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
that a send from bottom up or they may

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.059 
that a send from bottom up or they may
fan<00:03:11.519> out<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.420> here<00:03:12.959> we<00:03:13.139> have<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.349> young<00:03:13.620> man<00:03:13.650> with

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
fan out so here we have a young man with

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.129 
fan out so here we have a young man with
a<00:03:14.099> severely<00:03:14.519> injured<00:03:14.879> brain<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.329> on<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.930> left

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
a severely injured brain and on the left

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.209 
a severely injured brain and on the left
here<00:03:16.379> what<00:03:16.560> we<00:03:16.650> see<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:16.950> black<00:03:17.129> hole

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:17.219 
here what we see this black hole

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.429 
here what we see this black hole
reflects<00:03:17.819> his<00:03:18.000> shunt<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.450> all<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.139> is<00:03:19.319> an

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
reflects his shunt and all that is is an

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.770 
reflects his shunt and all that is is an
MRI<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:20.280> signal<00:03:20.609> drops<00:03:20.819> out<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:21.510> it's<00:03:21.659> not

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
MRI the signal drops out and so it's not

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.449 
MRI the signal drops out and so it's not
lack<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.230> brain<00:03:22.439> tissue<00:03:22.620> it's<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:23.219> that<00:03:23.370> his

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
lack of brain tissue it's just that his

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.399 
lack of brain tissue it's just that his
shunt<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.909> there<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.749> shunt<00:03:24.959> helps<00:03:25.200> drain

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
shunt is there and the shunt helps drain

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.199 
shunt is there and the shunt helps drain
is<00:03:25.590> fluid<00:03:25.919> in<00:03:26.010> his<00:03:26.159> brain<00:03:26.430> whereas<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.120> the

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
is fluid in his brain whereas on the

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.360 
is fluid in his brain whereas on the
right<00:03:27.389> side<00:03:27.629> of<00:03:27.810> his<00:03:27.900> brain<00:03:28.069> what<00:03:29.069> you<00:03:29.189> see

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
right side of his brain what you see

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.890 
right side of his brain what you see
here<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.609> black<00:03:29.760> hair<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.090> lack<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.299> residual

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
here the black hair is lack of residual

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.409 
here the black hair is lack of residual
tissue<00:03:31.139> so<00:03:31.709> he<00:03:31.950> has<00:03:32.159> had<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:32.849> much<00:03:33.000> neuronal

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
tissue so he has had so much neuronal

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.990 
tissue so he has had so much neuronal
loss<00:03:33.689> that<00:03:33.989> there<00:03:34.169> isn't<00:03:34.349> any<00:03:34.769> tissue<00:03:35.430> in<00:03:35.730> here

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
loss that there isn't any tissue in here

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.449 
loss that there isn't any tissue in here
and<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:37.139> what<00:03:37.349> happened<00:03:37.680> here<00:03:37.829> then<00:03:37.919> after<00:03:38.159> we

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
and so what happened here then after we

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.580 
and so what happened here then after we
provided<00:03:38.849> him<00:03:38.969> with<00:03:39.000> 12<00:03:39.389> treatments<00:03:39.989> these

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
provided him with 12 treatments these

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.920 
provided him with 12 treatments these
fibers<00:03:41.189> that<00:03:41.310> connect<00:03:41.730> right<00:03:42.209> from<00:03:42.599> front<00:03:42.870> to

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
fibers that connect right from front to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.349 
fibers that connect right from front to
back<00:03:43.019> up<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.859> down<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.519> across<00:03:44.699> hemispheres

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
back up and down and across hemispheres

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.509 
back up and down and across hemispheres
we<00:03:45.510> see<00:03:45.719> growth<00:03:46.019> in<00:03:46.230> these<00:03:46.349> fibers<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:46.949> so

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
we see growth in these fibers and so

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.649 
we see growth in these fibers and so
essentially<00:03:47.909> we're<00:03:48.150> starting<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.629> see

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
essentially we're starting to see

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.839 
essentially we're starting to see
changes<00:03:49.230> even<00:03:49.500> on<00:03:49.769> this<00:03:49.889> incredibly<00:03:50.400> damaged

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
changes even on this incredibly damaged

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.759 
changes even on this incredibly damaged
right<00:03:51.090> side<00:03:51.359> we<00:03:51.480> see<00:03:51.689> more<00:03:51.930> fiber<00:03:52.230> tracts<00:03:52.590> here

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
right side we see more fiber tracts here

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.709 
right side we see more fiber tracts here
in<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:52.949> front<00:03:53.219> area<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.609> brain<00:03:53.849> as<00:03:54.060> well

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:54.719 
in the front area of the brain as well

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.479 
in the front area of the brain as well
as<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.169> cortical<00:03:55.530> spinal<00:03:55.739> tract<00:03:56.069> is<00:03:56.219> starting

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.890 
as the cortical spinal tract is starting
to<00:03:56.549> fill<00:03:56.699> in<00:03:56.849> and<00:03:57.030> we<00:03:57.299> actually<00:03:57.329> have<00:03:57.719> some

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
to fill in and we actually have some

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.270 
to fill in and we actually have some
fibers<00:03:58.199> starting<00:03:58.469> to<00:03:58.560> grow<00:03:58.680> on<00:03:58.799> his<00:03:58.859> temporal

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
fibers starting to grow on his temporal

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.520 
fibers starting to grow on his temporal
region<00:03:59.579> as<00:03:59.729> well<00:03:59.879> and<00:04:00.180> then<00:04:00.900> on<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.169> left<00:04:01.379> we

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
region as well and then on the left we

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.899 
region as well and then on the left we
also<00:04:01.680> see<00:04:01.979> some<00:04:02.159> growth<00:04:02.340> up<00:04:02.519> there<00:04:02.729> in<00:04:02.819> the

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
also see some growth up there in the

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.869 
also see some growth up there in the
frontal<00:04:03.239> regions<00:04:03.930> so<00:04:04.560> this<00:04:05.459> evidence

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
frontal regions so this evidence

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.909 
frontal regions so this evidence
indicates<00:04:06.569> dust<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:07.079> TMS<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.620> clearly

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
indicates dust that TMS is clearly

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.679 
indicates dust that TMS is clearly
having<00:04:08.250> an<00:04:08.370> impact<00:04:08.669> and<00:04:09.000> we're<00:04:09.269> getting<00:04:09.419> the

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
having an impact and we're getting the

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.379 
having an impact and we're getting the
neurons<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.229> connect<00:04:10.590> somehow<00:04:11.009> and<00:04:11.280> we<00:04:12.209> have<00:04:12.359> a

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
neurons to connect somehow and we have a

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.439 
neurons to connect somehow and we have a
lot<00:04:12.599> to<00:04:12.780> learn<00:04:12.900> about<00:04:13.169> it<00:04:13.349> but<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.769> certainly

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
lot to learn about it but it certainly

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.999 
lot to learn about it but it certainly
holds<00:04:15.449> promise<00:04:15.780> we<00:04:16.530> are<00:04:16.560> certainly<00:04:16.949> seeing

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
holds promise we are certainly seeing

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.800 
holds promise we are certainly seeing
changes<00:04:17.699> at<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:17.970> level<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.419> white<00:04:18.570> fibers

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
changes at the level of the white fibers

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.870 
changes at the level of the white fibers
in<00:04:19.169> this<00:04:19.889> gentleman<00:04:20.340> as<00:04:20.489> well<00:04:20.639> as<00:04:20.729> our<00:04:20.849> other

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
in this gentleman as well as our other

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.060 
in this gentleman as well as our other
two<00:04:21.209> subjects<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.840> behaviorally<00:04:22.800> we<00:04:22.949> also

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
two subjects and behaviorally we also

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.740 
two subjects and behaviorally we also
saw<00:04:23.400> gains<00:04:23.699> that<00:04:23.909> correspond<00:04:24.389> with<00:04:24.509> these

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
saw gains that correspond with these

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.540 
saw gains that correspond with these
changes<00:04:25.199> in<00:04:25.349> structural<00:04:25.770> integrity<00:04:26.070> of<00:04:26.370> our

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
changes in structural integrity of our

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.670 
changes in structural integrity of our
white<00:04:26.699> fibers<00:04:27.090> all<00:04:27.690> right<00:04:27.870> dr.<00:04:28.169> Pape<00:04:28.380> thank

you so much for sharing your the work
that<00:04:31.050> you're<00:04:31.169> doing<00:04:31.199> and<00:04:31.669> that<00:04:32.669> concludes<00:04:33.270> our

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
that you're doing and that concludes our

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.580 
that you're doing and that concludes our
segment<00:04:33.750> you've<00:04:34.110> learned<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.409> lot<00:04:34.530> of

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
segment you've learned a lot of

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.040 
segment you've learned a lot of
information<00:04:35.150> that's<00:04:36.150> a<00:04:36.270> wrap<00:04:36.419> for<00:04:36.690> neuro<00:04:36.840> wrap

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
information that's a wrap for neuro wrap

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:44.260 
information that's a wrap for neuro wrap
see<00:04:37.469> you<00:04:37.530> next<00:04:37.710> time

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:05:10.100 

you

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110
