00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.890 
that kind of stuff so say you play one
playthrough<00:03:42.720> 40<00:03:43.380> set<00:03:43.590> or<00:03:43.769> 47<00:03:44.430> times<00:03:44.850> 2<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.120> 94

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
playthrough 40 set or 47 times 2 is 94

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.680 
playthrough 40 set or 47 times 2 is 94
then<00:03:46.440> times<00:03:46.860> that<00:03:47.250> by<00:03:47.280> 4<00:03:48.000> because<00:03:48.420> there's

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
then times that by 4 because there's

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.870 
then times that by 4 because there's
four<00:03:48.930> characters<00:03:49.549> that's<00:03:51.920> 376<00:03:52.920> hours<00:03:53.610> of

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
four characters that's 376 hours of

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.160 
four characters that's 376 hours of
gameplay<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:55.530> means<00:03:55.890> if<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.930> divide<00:03:57.930> that

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
gameplay that means if you divide that

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.280 
gameplay that means if you divide that
by<00:03:58.590> 24<00:03:59.549> hours<00:03:59.970> like<00:04:00.390> if<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.570> played<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.750> 24<00:04:01.140> hour

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
by 24 hours like if you played a 24 hour

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.320 
by 24 hours like if you played a 24 hour
straight<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.680> would<00:04:01.769> take<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:02.010> 60<00:04:02.489> almost<00:04:02.850> 16

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
straight it would take you 60 almost 16

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.470 
straight it would take you 60 almost 16
days<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:04.410> beat<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.799> game<00:04:04.980> like<00:04:05.760> hour<00:04:06.120> to

aspect so I mean there's a lot a lot to

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.620 
aspect so I mean there's a lot a lot to
this<00:04:49.139> game<00:04:49.410> so<00:04:49.889> if<00:04:50.010> you<00:04:50.190> guys<00:04:50.370> can<00:04:50.730> only<00:04:51.000> buy
