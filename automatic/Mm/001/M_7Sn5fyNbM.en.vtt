00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.290
 hello I was at dm yesterday and have 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.060
 a few things with me from the new ls 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.650
 i just wanted it back in when 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.439
 I have my tripod but that was it 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.970
 not on saturday and yes me 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.980
 absolutely wanted to turn off and that's why 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.210
 as the last man without tripod I hope 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.279
 it was not too much 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.770
 then I start with the gorilla gaming 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:36.079
 I've got this one from essence 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.790
 nail brother calls in pink and that 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.170
 argue if the nails so that the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.000
 be diligent 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.340
 and I found it a cool idea and I 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.900
 that else from any company 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.570
 That's why I have that too 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.790
 smaller reasons so I can find it 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.800
 cool , very short and we have 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.320
 bought the matching brush I had 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.250
 I believe that there is always that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.930
 this effect industry has the city bus 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.100
 with the erector because that was there on the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.450
 can do best with 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.939
 and here's a little one too 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.180
 instructions on the boxes how to do it 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.700
 the brush and yes I have no 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.140
 cranberry because of that or has 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.500
 I can give you the box page of 19 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:21.820
 no prices say yes then I have from 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:24.620
 p2 for the time being none discovered 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.010
 and there I have a way with the 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.560
 looks like it 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:34.370
 yes, I'll take it out with it 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.000
 obviously there is so much in it 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.860
 in there 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.740
 and yes I think it's very convenient for 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.659
 on the way if you do not foundation 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.940
 brush and want to lug the stuff 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.950
 And yes , every bag fits and 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.229
 is really very cool because if you are 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.030
 I want to brush up on it 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.310
 the color 0 10 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.150
 grace politically that he is 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.190
 what was there 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.960
 is almost a little tick too 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.190
 dark for me but now comes the 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.670
 summer and I hope I'm going to 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.100
 a bit greener and then I have 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.260
 me with a nail polish that looks like that 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.939
 from and I found the color so cool white 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.700
 not if you pull that shimmers like that 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.290
 easy that now and pearl effect and 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.909
 I did not have his color yet 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.129
 that's why I immediately with and 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.959
 would like to join the others 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.990
 who was so with color I'm still here 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.620
 such a small piece on the nail from the test 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.940
 and invite 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.230
 he was very nice too 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.880
 but I thought I already did 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.680
 Many said and now I have to go for it 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.410
 decide one and then I have me 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.720
 I have something here with him 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.390
 totally cool is from the it and that 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.520
 this eyebrow powder pen so 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.500
 He looked like that and he has 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:45.170
 here in front of such an applicator in there 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.110
 is also eye then brother then turn 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.910
 and the pen is so good of mine 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.620
 God I have those easily at home 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.870
 tried or in the country 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.180
 already and it worked so well that he did 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.220
 so good and the color is great 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.580
 to me and that was the finishing touch 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.010
 of it receives and was there and of dark 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.750
 there was only one left to go 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.430
 apparently good and thus on the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.650
 other side so cool so wax 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.020
 that color or brother too 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.530
 lasts longer and that's cool too 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.120
 and absolutely cool product and have there 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.020
 I think the same without thinking 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.070
 took 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.570
 I would like to have it now 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.390
 second bought times I'll look 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.410
 sometime in the second find so very cool 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.880
 then I have the p2p let's rock it yet 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.790
 discovered and I got through it 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.980
 by chance this lipstick with at my 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.120
 Doctor said the media certainly good 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.610
 although I would actually stand 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.459
 no pen and I wear the color 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.959
 At first I did not think it was that pretty 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.530
 show you sometimes like looks that has 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.410
 here in front like such a Eddingstift cock 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.709
 and looks pretty orange I have 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.620
 it also chatted here 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.540
 but it is on my lips do not 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.519
 orange a bright red and it stands 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.620
 I'm really super good and that's why I am 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.989
 Glad I'm with the off and the color 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.940
 really lasts from morning till night 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.519
 that this has to refresh me once and 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.080
 yes very great product and behind he has 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.459
 still such a care stick doing this for 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.580
 me too very important as i am very 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.080
 have dry lips and yes together 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.180
 really great for me 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.160
 then I have one more from the lg 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.990
 nail polish with the looks like this 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.120
 and actually we just go because 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.280
 the bottle looks so cute and me 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.360
 I found these pastel colors wonderful 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.180
 I really did not want a nail 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.689
 Buy anger but he's just so 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.849
 nice and that's why 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:38.069
 I still agree with and yes it is easy 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.110
 super beautiful tone and very sweet the 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:44.309
 That's why it should still be made 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:47.809
 I discovered one with it 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:51.239
 looks like this with coco nectarines and 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:53.189
 that smells so good oh god that is now 

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:55.169
 already my favorite fragrance because I love 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:57.059
 nectarines for you and i love coco 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.339
 and that just smells really good 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:01.309
 So not necessarily in the deo and that 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:03.779
 the same is now available as a shower gel 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:05.639
 not as delicious and I have 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:09.599
 I am very happy the two things 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:13.889
 then took a mask in front 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:16.439
 barea with strawberry this just good 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.110
 and I think that will smell good 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:20.759
 and that's why I bought myself then 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.789
 The last two things and once 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:27.839
 I wanted to control appetite 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.789
 encapsulate or do I have the 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:33.149
 Seen from stevens I believe it means 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:35.459
 yes because i have real problems 

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:37.189
 real problems with cravings then 

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:39.839
 I could not stuff everything 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:43.229
 and I thought I'd try it now 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:45.179
 times those should be purely vegetable and 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.119
 yes, the damage has ten euros 

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:51.340
 tasted and the 5 and then there was still 

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:55.660
 why small 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:58.010
 bags there was how you go there 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.430
 God says so in truth 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:04.460
 closer to such a matched consistency 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.380
 stuff in it in such small packaging and 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.970
 they cost 15 euros, I know 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.460
 not exactly what is the difference 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.970
 not advised but it was 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.950
 nobody could have advised me 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.380
 and yes, try it with the and 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.760
 Try the others, I'm curious 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.690
 whether the use something 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.520
 So it says that the against 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.070
 are cravings and that shape me 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.150
 should take food 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:32.810
 then it takes longer to get back 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.310
 gets hungry and that one then 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.960
 even less is three times faster says 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.050
 is and I really hope that the 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.400
 help somehow yes who experiences 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.440
 I can handle it once 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.540
 write or what the difference 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.270
 is between danes and the damage it yes 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.390
 that was really cool and it did 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:53.870
 I take my hair color with me and yes 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:56.180
 the color is 316 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.600
 Eggplant and I looked so cool 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.660
 out 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.650
 Here I imagined I would have to 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.820
 have questions aubergine hair and 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.680
 that's why i still have them with me 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.390
 have never used my friends there 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.270
 As I said, that is pretty good and 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.930
 very little harmful to the hair and 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.640
 yes I bought them with this 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.200
 okay that's it for watching and thank you 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.860
 I'm looking forward to seeing you at my 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.860
 next video
