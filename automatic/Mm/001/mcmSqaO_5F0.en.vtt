00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:21.369
 this is a skiff 02 sw is the same prime 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.310
 similar to old bucky strider 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:28.130
 supply well if this is x walk like 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.119
 usually total length 220 millimeters length 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.690
 blade 100 blade thickness we have 4 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:40.280
 millimeter on one side as usual 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.710
 even 10 other we have a clip 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:50.239
 stonvosh he and very tight look 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:51.649
 weighs one hundred seventy one gram very 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.030
 It seems like the peasant will build 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.129
 I am entering a new such number is not the pods 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.170
 different but also a wedge a little more 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.339
 elegant not well executed 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.350
 the only thing that noticed 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.770
 edge on the blade here a little bit 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.670
 lick here it is clearly expressed 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.359
 water 100ml did something else climbed a 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.779
 also very worthy amongst him 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:26.899
 Of course , I would not like the contour 

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:31.189
 let's say but weâ€™ll finish it 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:35.229
 many are standard 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.849
 8 13 sea we have a stubborn bank 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.009
 the knife is in principle very simple to parse 

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:44.240
 present for use 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.310
 Stabilizer Hender flex clip 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.270
 deep landing that is seen until here 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:54.200
 this part of the handle is awesome like 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.499
 a notch just trudge in my hand very 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.499
 comfortable 

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:01.370
 the balance is clearly in the middle of the fingers 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.520
 notches 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:09.200
 well 10 loose well and pockets not tear 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.369
 will be the same time that vata opens 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.000
 on basically you can get used 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.970
 I did not find enough elevators here 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.660
 pretty good like a knife 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.350
 build some time strong under 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.350
 finger and you are very comfortable for them 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.350
 hold 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:37.700
 budget option so generally very 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:43.460
 very good construction projects Linochka what 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:46.840
 I need these disputes photos show further 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.840
 let's see his macron 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.750
 such photos turned out again 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.700
 borrowed them from the site ex gera what 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.020
 thanks guys 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.020
 actually like the legs I took from them 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.560
 what I was talking about here is more vivid 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.680
 pronounced face here it is a little bit like 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.830
 would be zamylen and something in principle no matter what 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:51.910
 Absolutely no effect on point I can 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:57.400
 frame in principle is standard for one 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.590
 a third comes shiba metal clips 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.070
 we have a stonewash for it is very tight on 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.020
 pocket 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:09.340
 It is sitting very cool all collected on the attack 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.510
 T-shirts design through the jar 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.390
 also sufficient 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.100
 I did not find any diameter of elevators 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.100
 everything is very very good 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.509
 slightly walks under here in principle this 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.710
 also not fatal for the money that can 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:38.509
 worth about 30 1st dollar is already something 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.280
 supernatural require when 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.539
 setting a $ 150 hole true 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.539
 walk here 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.340
 not bad this is a rabbit principle very very 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.830
 a very successful handle at the Scythian is obtained 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.800
 I just trudge that is thought out 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:09.199
 Well done guys are they up to 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:11.050
 Why do not want to achieve smarties 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:17.060
 shoot 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:20.060
 tight from a little bit and here you lead the departure 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.970
 it does not want so but the frame principle 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.590
 tight wedge with us here as you 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.889
 see in the center but honestly could 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.930
 would add a couple of millimeters 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.669
 we would be more interesting blade and so in general 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.370
 I love it when knives fold like 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.099
 way when he doesn't stick out know how u 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.160
 sing there are mountains what a huge here 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:46.250
 this no wedge built in clearly 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:50.780
 hiding in the hilt there begins here 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:53.300
 such is also a man from inexpensive by the way 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:06:01.400
 design is very interesting concisely 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:02.840
 just the same time very beautiful music 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.060
 Scythians produced in China 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.370
 Ukrainians which is division by how much I 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.860
 I understand the company and without weapons 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.750

 I have the opportunity to look at these legs 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:33.370
 let's look 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:34.530
 as he cuts somewhere something clings to 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:54.610
 principle 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:56.860
 hair shave without problems it is 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.300
 price of this kind by the way as far as I am 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.740
 I understand the rest of the face will be 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.340
 consist of their knives so if all 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.590
 it will turn out we take a video let's see what 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:09.729
 will provide the guys how they will be 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.620
