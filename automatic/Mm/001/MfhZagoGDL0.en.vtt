00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
came from the old Dell laptop battery

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.330 
came from the old Dell laptop battery
pack<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.759> took<00:02:08.970> apart<00:02:09.830> there's<00:02:10.830> 6<00:02:11.099> cells

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
pack that I took apart there's 6 cells

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.620 
pack that I took apart there's 6 cells
inside<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.910> them

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
inside of them

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.650 
inside of them
these<00:02:12.960> two<00:02:13.200> right<00:02:13.470> here<00:02:14.060> test<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.240> out<00:02:15.330> bad

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
these two right here test it out bad

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.780 
these two right here test it out bad
they<00:02:15.930> were<00:02:15.990> bad<00:02:16.320> these<00:02:16.920> other<00:02:17.160> four<00:02:17.550> are

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
they were bad these other four are

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.700 
they were bad these other four are
perfectly<00:02:18.540> good<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.140> they're<00:02:19.290> rated<00:02:19.560> for

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
perfectly good and they're rated for

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.060 
perfectly good and they're rated for
1600<00:02:20.520> milliamp<00:02:21.000> hours<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.920> will

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
1600 milliamp hours so this will

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.210 
1600 milliamp hours so this will
probably<00:02:23.220> recharge<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:24.500> cell<00:02:25.500> phone<00:02:25.710> two<00:02:26.100> or

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
probably recharge a cell phone two or

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.860 
probably recharge a cell phone two or
three<00:02:26.460> times<00:02:26.670> easily<00:02:27.270> before<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.630> need<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
three times easily before I need to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.040 
three times easily before I need to
recharge<00:02:28.200> if<00:02:28.530> not<00:02:28.710> for<00:02:29.330> now<00:02:30.330> just<00:02:30.600> show<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:30.960> the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
recharge if not for now just show on the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.300 
recharge if not for now just show on the
screen<00:02:31.350> itself<00:02:31.620> let's<00:02:31.920> turn<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.160> back<00:02:32.280> on

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
screen itself let's turn it back on

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.550 
screen itself let's turn it back on
again<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:33.090> has<00:02:33.270> an<00:02:33.390> auto<00:02:33.600> off<00:02:33.840> feature<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:34.440> it's

this<00:02:59.550> one<00:02:59.820> I'm<00:03:00.630> going<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.900> plug<00:03:01.110> right<00:03:01.260> into

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
this one I'm going to plug right into

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.050 
this one I'm going to plug right into
the<00:03:01.530> back<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:03.440> neatly<00:03:04.440> turn<00:03:04.710> it<00:03:04.860> around

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
the back of it neatly turn it around

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.360 
the back of it neatly turn it around
it's<00:03:06.060> going<00:03:06.210> to<00:03:06.300> power<00:03:06.450> on<00:03:07.040> give<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.160> your

it's going to power on give you your

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.910 
it's going to power on give you your
fourth<00:03:08.610> battery<00:03:09.030> displays<00:03:09.480> your<00:03:10.230> two<00:03:10.410> USBs

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
fourth battery displays your two USBs

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.710 
fourth battery displays your two USBs
and<00:03:11.190> now<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.520> shows<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.910> is<00:03:12.000> plugged<00:03:12.240> in<00:03:12.480> and

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
and now it shows that is plugged in and

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.480 
and now it shows that is plugged in and
it's<00:03:13.440> showing<00:03:13.590> its<00:03:13.800> going<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> top<00:03:14.160> them<00:03:14.370> off

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
it's showing its going to top them off

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.920 
it's showing its going to top them off
right<00:03:14.790> now<00:03:14.940> because<00:03:15.210> they<00:03:15.600> are<00:03:15.630> basically

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
right now because they are basically

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.810 
right now because they are basically
charged<00:03:16.500> it's<00:03:16.980> going<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.280> test<00:03:17.430> them<00:03:17.580> out<00:03:17.640> real

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
charged it's going to test them out real

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.150 
charged it's going to test them out real
quick<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.090> see<00:03:18.210> where<00:03:18.510> they<00:03:18.720> are<00:03:19.010> since<00:03:20.010> it's

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
quick and see where they are since it's

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.860 
quick and see where they are since it's
almost<00:03:20.400> done<00:03:20.820> charging<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.330> batteries<00:03:21.690> now

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
almost done charging the batteries now

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.600 
almost done charging the batteries now
let's<00:03:22.410> see<00:03:22.530> what<00:03:22.710> voltage<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.250> actually

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
let's see what voltage is actually

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:35.560 
let's see what voltage is actually
setting<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.940> Matt<00:03:24.120> on<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.840> multimeter<00:03:34.430> for

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
setting a Matt on the multimeter for

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:51.500 
setting a Matt on the multimeter for
2419<00:03:39.470> for<00:03:40.470> 19<00:03:44.270> for<00:03:45.270> 18

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.860 

for<00:03:52.110> 18<00:03:52.379> for<00:03:52.620> 17<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:54.120> this<00:03:54.300> is<00:03:54.360> very<00:03:54.510> good<00:03:54.720> job

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
for 18 for 17 so this is very good job

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.940 
for 18 for 17 so this is very good job
of<00:03:54.900> charging<00:03:55.379> them<00:03:55.500> up<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.799> doesn't

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
of charging them up it doesn't

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.490 
of charging them up it doesn't
overcharge<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.670> middle<00:03:56.909> and<00:03:57.260> you<00:03:58.260> can<00:03:58.379> see

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
overcharge the middle and you can see

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.920 
overcharge the middle and you can see
it's<00:03:58.650> just<00:03:59.069> topping<00:03:59.519> off<00:03:59.700> the<00:04:00.060> one<00:04:00.540> here<00:04:00.750> just

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
it's just topping off the one here just

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.440 
it's just topping off the one here just
a<00:04:00.989> little<00:04:01.110> bit<00:04:01.230> here<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.590> there<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:02.640> it's<00:04:03.269> a

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
a little bit here and there so it's a

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.740 
a little bit here and there so it's a
very<00:04:03.900> good<00:04:04.409> quality<00:04:04.620> charger<00:04:05.510> so<00:04:06.510> there<00:04:06.659> you

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
very good quality charger so there you

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.800 
very good quality charger so there you
go<00:04:06.930> for<00:04:07.379> twenty<00:04:07.799> dollars<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.190> get<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.610> nice<00:04:09.060> USB
