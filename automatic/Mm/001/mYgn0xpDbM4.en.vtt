00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
whether or not this is a pistol so I can

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.369 
whether or not this is a pistol so I can
use<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> story<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.090> pistol<00:00:54.420> round<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.930> then

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
use the story to pistol round and then

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
use the story to pistol round and then
if<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> next<00:00:55.980> round<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.460> free-for-all<00:00:57.270> I

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
if the next round is a free-for-all I

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.349 
if the next round is a free-for-all I
can<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.020> walk<00:00:58.440> over<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:58.980> truck<00:00:59.359> screw

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
can just walk over to my truck screw

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.150

this<00:01:00.539> thing<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.829> have

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
this thing on here and now I have

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.990 
this thing on here and now I have
basically<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.899> pump<00:01:03.899> bow<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.920> sorts<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.850> you

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
basically a pump bow of sorts if you

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.670 
basically a pump bow of sorts if you
didn't<00:01:06.150> think<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.540> any<00:01:06.750> better<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.229> does

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
didn't think I get any better it does

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.429 
didn't think I get any better it does
the<00:01:08.479> original<00:01:09.479> plunger<00:01:09.869> rod<00:01:10.020> was<00:01:10.200> made<00:01:10.350> of

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the original plunger rod was made of

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.679 
the original plunger rod was made of
Delrin<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.159> snap<00:01:11.640> because<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.479> he

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
Delrin in that snap because I think he

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.780 
Delrin in that snap because I think he
cut<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.260> little<00:01:13.290> too<00:01:13.680> low<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> catch

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
cut just a little too low for the catch

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.390 
cut just a little too low for the catch
area<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.869> he<00:01:16.049> replaced<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.560> an<00:01:16.770> aluminum

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
area so he replaced it with an aluminum

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.429 
area so he replaced it with an aluminum
plunger<00:01:17.939> rod<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.390> will<00:01:18.540> basically<00:01:18.930> never

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
plunger rod that will basically never

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.760 
plunger rod that will basically never

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
break unless I take a grinder or some

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.210 
break unless I take a grinder or some

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
bunch of metal dremel bits to it and of

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.240 
bunch of metal dremel bits to it and of
course<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.939> handle<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.659> pink<00:01:28.530> because<00:01:29.009> pink

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.330 
usually we use 1.5 but I have a lot of
these<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.790> yeah<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.659> they're<00:01:57.810> also<00:01:58.070> more<00:01:59.070> than

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
these so yeah and they're also more than

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.399 
these so yeah and they're also more than
push-fit<00:01:59.700> they're<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> twist<00:02:00.689> push<00:02:01.079> and

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
push-fit they're like a twist push and

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.200 
push-fit they're like a twist push and
then<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:02.040> squashes<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.820> little<00:02:02.939> bit<00:02:03.090> so

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
then it squashes up a little bit so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:14.949 
then it squashes up a little bit so
they're<00:02:03.360> pretty<00:02:03.509> tight<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.500> let's<00:02:05.009> begin

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.920 

all<00:02:15.959> right<00:02:16.610> all<00:02:17.610> right<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.940> have<00:02:18.090> my<00:02:18.120> pump<00:02:18.660> sheet

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
all right all right I have my pump sheet

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.840 
all right all right I have my pump sheet
on<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.560> have<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.890> six-inch<00:02:20.340> barrel<00:02:20.610> could

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
on I have a six-inch barrel could

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.900 
on I have a six-inch barrel could
probably<00:02:21.120> use<00:02:21.360> seven<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.560> five-round<00:02:23.459> hop

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
probably use seven and a five-round hop

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.559 
probably use seven and a five-round hop
around<00:02:24.209> here<00:02:24.390> here<00:02:25.020> we<00:02:25.080> go<00:02:29.030> all<00:02:30.030> right<00:02:30.060> there

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
around here here we go all right there

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.690 
around here here we go all right there
we<00:02:30.660> go<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.959> actually<00:02:31.290> got<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.560> really<00:02:32.310> nice

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
we go and actually got a really nice

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.970 
we go and actually got a really nice
grouping<00:02:33.569> going<00:02:33.900> I'm<00:02:34.020> really<00:02:34.260> surprised<00:02:34.680> and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
grouping going I'm really surprised and

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.870 
grouping going I'm really surprised and
here<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.910> your<00:02:36.150> overall<00:02:37.340> aftermath<00:02:38.340> pretty

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
here is your overall aftermath pretty

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.780 
here is your overall aftermath pretty
damn<00:02:39.780> powerful<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:41.040> now<00:02:41.190> let's<00:02:41.400> shoot<00:02:41.580> this

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
damn powerful and now let's shoot this

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.640 
damn powerful and now let's shoot this
thing<00:02:41.850> through<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> chronograph<00:02:43.170> I'm<00:02:43.440> going<00:02:43.590> to

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
thing through a chronograph I'm going to

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.949 
thing through a chronograph I'm going to
do<00:02:43.709> five<00:02:43.920> shots<00:02:44.250> with<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.209> speed<00:02:45.450> loader<00:02:45.720> and

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
do five shots with the speed loader and

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.530 
do five shots with the speed loader and
then<00:02:46.380> empty<00:02:46.769> out<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.160> five-round<00:02:48.090> hopper<00:02:48.510> right

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
then empty out a five-round hopper right

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.900 
then empty out a five-round hopper right
so<00:02:48.750> let's<00:02:48.989> get<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.590> started<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.670> speed

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910
