00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
pieces from how to set up the programs

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.880 
pieces from how to set up the programs
like<00:00:18.830> roboform<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.449> physics<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.840> how<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.590> be

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
like roboform and physics and how to be

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.910 
like roboform and physics and how to be
credited<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.580> all<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.019> offers<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.050> surveys

right guys this is going to be the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.779 
right guys this is going to be the
installation<00:00:43.770> process<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> physics

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
installation process for the physics

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.750 
installation process for the physics
point<00:00:45.149> gainer<00:00:45.680> witching<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.489> after

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
point gainer witching and do is after

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.819 
point gainer witching and do is after
you<00:00:47.969> install<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> files<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.500> go<00:00:49.649> up

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you install the files you have to go up

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.060 
you install the files you have to go up
to<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:51.059> need<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.539> ring<00:00:51.840> rar<00:00:52.110> archive<00:00:52.800> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
to it you need this ring rar archive to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.069 
to it you need this ring rar archive to
lens<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.000> after<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.899> that

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
lens if it's so after you have that

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.569 
lens if it's so after you have that
installed<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.620> everything<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:56.280> want<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.489> do

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
installed and everything we want to do

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.910
