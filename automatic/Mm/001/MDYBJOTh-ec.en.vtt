hummingbird 1199 so what I'm going to do

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.169 
hummingbird 1199 so what I'm going to do
is<00:00:19.749> use<00:00:20.320> my<00:00:20.349> aqua<00:00:20.859> view<00:00:21.039> mini<00:00:21.339> DVR<00:00:21.820> camera

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:22.179 
is use my aqua view mini DVR camera

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:23.999 
is use my aqua view mini DVR camera
system<00:00:22.539> to<00:00:22.689> confirm<00:00:23.109> the<00:00:23.320> identity<00:00:23.769> of<00:00:23.800> these

mini DVR system confirms that these are

mini DVR system confirms that these are
not<00:01:37.159> walleyes<00:01:37.670> these<00:01:38.420> are<00:01:38.600> in<00:01:38.689> fact<00:01:38.899> sheephead

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
not walleyes these are in fact sheephead

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.560 
not walleyes these are in fact sheephead
these<00:01:40.340> are<00:01:40.520> fish<00:01:40.700> that<00:01:40.880> look<00:01:41.119> good<00:01:41.270> on<00:01:41.420> the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
these are fish that look good on the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.660 
these are fish that look good on the
graph<00:01:41.780> but<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.649> only<00:01:42.920> reason<00:01:43.250> that<00:01:43.280> we<00:01:43.520> know

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
graph but the only reason that we know

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.399 
graph but the only reason that we know
that<00:01:43.700> they're<00:01:43.970> sheephead<00:01:44.390> is<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:45.170> we<00:01:45.259> can

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
that they're sheephead is that we can

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.520 
that they're sheephead is that we can
see<00:01:45.649> them<00:01:45.860> with<00:01:46.100> incredible<00:01:46.630> clarity<00:01:47.630> on<00:01:47.810> our

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
see them with incredible clarity on our

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.139 
see them with incredible clarity on our
aqua<00:01:48.860> view<00:01:49.039> system<00:01:49.429> and<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:49.670> these<00:01:49.789> are<00:01:49.970> fish

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149

that<00:01:50.179> we're<00:01:50.450> not<00:01:50.509> going<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.780> waste<00:01:50.929> our<00:01:51.110> time

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
that we're not going to waste our time

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.109

and try to find some walleyes someplace

00:01:54.709 --> 00:02:00.490 
and try to find some walleyes someplace
else<00:01:57.009> well<00:01:58.009> now<00:01:58.190> we've<00:01:58.929> pulled<00:01:59.929> into<00:02:00.259> another

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
area that has lots of baitfish around it

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.960

and<00:02:04.330> inside<00:02:05.330> imaging<00:02:06.020> we<00:02:06.170> had<00:02:06.819> really<00:02:07.819> nice

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
and inside imaging we had really nice

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.670 
and inside imaging we had really nice
collection<00:02:08.269> of<00:02:09.340> returns<00:02:11.019> cut<00:02:12.019> in<00:02:12.200> along<00:02:12.500> this

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
collection of returns cut in along this

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.610 
collection of returns cut in along this
rocky<00:02:12.920> bottom<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:15.230> now<00:02:15.380> we're<00:02:15.590> just

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
to identify fish with our aqua view

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.440 
to identify fish with our aqua view
camera<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.470> fish<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.980> fish<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.970> we<00:02:50.120> wanted

rough fish and it just provided for us

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:03.090 
rough fish and it just provided for us
our<00:02:55.100> first<00:02:55.280> open<00:02:55.700> water<00:02:55.910> walleye<00:02:56.210> of<00:02:56.510> 2014

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.520 

really<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.130> great<00:03:04.370> example<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.350> how<00:03:06.350> we<00:03:06.410> can

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
really a great example of how we can

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.380 
really a great example of how we can
find<00:03:07.040> fish<00:03:07.340> initially<00:03:07.880> with<00:03:08.000> our<00:03:08.150> hummingbird

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
find fish initially with our hummingbird

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.650 
find fish initially with our hummingbird
system<00:03:09.430> come<00:03:10.430> back<00:03:10.610> and<00:03:10.850> chase<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.270> fish<00:03:11.450> we

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
system come back and chase the fish we

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.040 
system come back and chase the fish we
want<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:12.050> catch<00:03:12.230> using<00:03:13.010> our<00:03:13.100> aqua<00:03:13.430> view<00:03:13.580> camera

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
want to catch using our aqua view camera

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.590 
want to catch using our aqua view camera
use<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.290> combination<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:15.980> your<00:03:16.130> advantage

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
so you can go out and catch your first

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.170 
so you can go out and catch your first
walleye<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.310> 2014<00:03:20.210> as<00:03:20.360> well
