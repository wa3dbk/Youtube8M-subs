genocide but we haven't decided to end
it<00:05:13.950> and<00:05:14.220> I<00:05:14.760> think<00:05:14.850> that's<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.270> critical

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
it and I think that's the critical

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.630 
it and I think that's the critical
missing<00:05:16.289> ingredient<00:05:16.680> and<00:05:16.770> as<00:05:16.890> a<00:05:16.919> taxpayer
