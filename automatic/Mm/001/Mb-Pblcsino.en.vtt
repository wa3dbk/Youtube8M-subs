like<00:01:22.500> there<00:01:22.619> was<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> branch<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> died<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
like there was a branch but it died it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.249 
like there was a branch but it died it
broke<00:01:24.600> or<00:01:24.990> dried<00:01:25.619> out<00:01:26.000> anyways<00:01:29.509> arrange<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
broke or dried out anyways arrange and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.730 
broke or dried out anyways arrange and
clean<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.650> tomorrow<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.619> has

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
clean up tomorrow and for this so it has

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.100 
clean up tomorrow and for this so it has
two<00:01:34.979> spikes<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.890> this<00:01:37.890> one<00:01:38.130> here<00:01:38.430> also<00:01:38.640> has<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.820 

stem<00:01:43.110> there

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.440 

well<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:48.670> think<00:01:50.470> it's<00:01:51.470> very<00:01:51.530> small<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:52.760> there's

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
well I think it's very small but there's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.960 
well I think it's very small but there's
also<00:01:53.660> another<00:01:54.190> node<00:01:55.190> there<00:01:55.550> as<00:01:55.700> well<00:01:55.940> that

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
also another node there as well that

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.510 
also another node there as well that
looks<00:01:56.510> like<00:01:56.720> it's<00:01:57.290> going<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.650> produce<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:58.250> stem

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
looks like it's going to produce a stem

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.200 
looks like it's going to produce a stem
so<00:01:59.390> that's<00:01:59.630> very<00:01:59.810> exciting<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:01.520> it's<00:02:01.880> such<00:02:02.060> an

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210
