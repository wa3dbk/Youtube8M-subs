00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
yes guys thought we got the monocle to

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.480 
yes guys thought we got the monocle to
take<00:00:02.790> care<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.060> today<00:00:03.980> let's<00:00:04.980> go<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.339> learn

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
take care of today let's go and learn

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.700 
take care of today let's go and learn
them<00:00:05.759> but<00:00:05.940> before<00:00:06.569> we<00:00:06.690> go<00:00:06.839> just<00:00:07.080> like<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.470> share

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
them but before we go just like to share

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.770 
them but before we go just like to share
that<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.250> it's<00:00:08.760> not<00:00:08.880> like<00:00:09.059> just<00:00:09.360> because<00:00:09.630> they

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
that so it's not like just because they

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.129 
that so it's not like just because they
said<00:00:10.110> they<00:00:10.139> are<00:00:10.830> less<00:00:11.599> important<00:00:12.599> they're

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
said they are less important they're

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.320 
said they are less important they're
actually<00:00:13.620> very<00:00:13.650> important<00:00:14.340> they<00:00:14.519> are<00:00:14.700> used<00:00:15.030> in

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
actually very important they are used in

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.710 
actually very important they are used in
many<00:00:15.570> many<00:00:15.780> songs<00:00:16.460> even<00:00:17.460> happy<00:00:17.970> sounds<00:00:18.480> and

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
many many songs even happy sounds and

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.920 
many many songs even happy sounds and
just<00:00:19.470> go<00:00:19.619> I've<00:00:19.890> got<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.789> specific<00:00:21.119> sound<00:00:21.660> that

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
just go I've got a specific sound that

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.580 
just go I've got a specific sound that
we<00:00:22.080> should<00:00:22.890> learn<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.460> recognize<00:00:24.449> any<00:00:25.260> way

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
we should learn to recognize any way

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.170 
we should learn to recognize any way
let's<00:00:26.010> gonna<00:00:26.220> have<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> look<00:00:26.640> at<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> first

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
let's gonna have a look at the first

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.290 
let's gonna have a look at the first
shapes<00:00:27.420> because<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.680> are<00:00:28.830> focusing<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.730> open

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
shapes because we are focusing on open

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.160 
shapes because we are focusing on open
chords<00:00:30.949> only<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:32.969> only<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.719> few<00:00:34.050> of

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
chords only we can have only a few of

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.500 
chords only we can have only a few of
them<00:00:34.380> because<00:00:34.829> not<00:00:35.160> all<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.850> model<00:00:36.270> codes

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
them because not all the model codes

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.709 
them because not all the model codes
make<00:00:36.899> use<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.170> open<00:00:37.739> strings<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.510> first

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
make use of open strings so the first

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.790 
make use of open strings so the first
one<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.930> we've<00:00:40.230> got<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.860> actually<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.910> minor

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
one that we've got is actually a minor

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.470 
one that we've got is actually a minor
now<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.860> way<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.550> play<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.300> your

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
now the way that we play it is like your

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.529 
now the way that we play it is like your
E<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:46.289> moved<00:00:46.620> one<00:00:47.460> string<00:00:47.879> everything<00:00:48.300> down

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
E but moved one string everything down

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.150 
E but moved one string everything down
just<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.590> play<00:00:49.800> from<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
just like that and you play from the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.900 
just like that and you play from the
fourth<00:00:50.460> string

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.210 

then<00:00:53.780> your<00:00:54.590> D<00:00:55.520> minor<00:00:55.850> will<00:00:56.780> be<00:00:56.830> like<00:00:57.830> your<00:00:58.040> D

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
then your D minor will be like your D

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.430 
then your D minor will be like your D
but<00:00:58.550> that<00:00:58.730> not<00:00:58.910> goes<00:00:59.239> back<00:00:59.510> so<00:00:59.930> you<00:01:00.050> just<00:01:00.290> will

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
but that not goes back so you just will

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.479 
but that not goes back so you just will
have<00:01:00.559> to<00:01:00.710> referring<00:01:01.100> every<00:01:02.090> finger<00:01:02.360> it<00:01:02.480> and

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
have to referring every finger it and

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.800 
have to referring every finger it and
maybe<00:01:04.489> you<00:01:04.640> can<00:01:04.760> use<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.000> pinky<00:01:05.449> instead<00:01:05.720> of

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
maybe you can use the pinky instead of

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.410 
maybe you can use the pinky instead of
that<00:01:06.020> or<00:01:06.410> as<00:01:07.130> one<00:01:07.310> of<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.460> two<00:01:07.640> again<00:01:08.030> from<00:01:08.300> the

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
that or as one of the two again from the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.280 
that or as one of the two again from the
fourth<00:01:08.660> string<00:01:08.900> down<00:01:10.240> make<00:01:11.240> sure<00:01:11.290> it's

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
fourth string down make sure it's

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.550 
fourth string down make sure it's
properly<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:12.800> then<00:01:13.490> got<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.570> manner<00:01:14.930> which<00:01:15.290> is

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
properly and then got a manner which is

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.490 
properly and then got a manner which is
like<00:01:15.770> you're<00:01:16.010> normal<00:01:16.520> e<00:01:16.700> but<00:01:17.150> you<00:01:17.270> take<00:01:17.500> that

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
like you're normal e but you take that

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.180 
like you're normal e but you take that
finger<00:01:18.890> out

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.550 

to<00:01:22.340> view<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.700> E<00:01:22.790> minor<00:01:22.820> but<00:01:23.660> we<00:01:23.990> would<00:01:24.170> like<00:01:24.320> to

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
play the E minor like that then move the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.900 
play the E minor like that then move the
whole<00:02:47.960> thing<00:02:48.140> down<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.590> put<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.980> finger<00:02:49.400> D<00:02:49.550> so

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
whole thing down and put the finger D so

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.800 
whole thing down and put the finger D so
that's<00:02:50.420> an<00:02:50.540> option<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.730> next<00:02:53.150> exercise<00:02:53.360> is

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
that's an option the next exercise is

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.390 
that's an option the next exercise is
between<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.650> minor

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
between a minor

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.949 
between a minor
and<00:02:56.670> d<00:02:57.239> minor<00:02:58.549> so<00:02:59.549> again<00:02:59.939> try<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.599> see<00:03:00.780> which

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
and d minor so again try and see which

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.619 
and d minor so again try and see which
movements<00:03:01.590> are<00:03:01.739> similar<00:03:02.459> what<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.180> just<00:03:03.420> need

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
movements are similar what you just need

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.619 
movements are similar what you just need
to<00:03:03.750> move<00:03:03.900> your<00:03:04.370> first<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.610> second<00:03:06.299> finger

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
to move your first and second finger

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.220 
to move your first and second finger
down<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.370> then<00:03:08.370> put<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:08.970> pinky<00:03:09.299> day<00:03:09.450> or<00:03:09.689> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
down and then put the pinky day or the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.250 
down and then put the pinky day or the
third<00:03:10.439> finger<00:03:10.709> day<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.390> quite<00:03:12.720> this

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
third finger day so it is quite this

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.410 
third finger day so it is quite this
there<00:03:13.620> are<00:03:13.650> some<00:03:13.920> similarities<00:03:14.370> try<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.329> look

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
there are some similarities try and look

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.149 
there are some similarities try and look
for<00:03:15.480> them<00:03:15.780> when<00:03:16.019> you<00:03:16.650> want<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.099> change<00:03:17.689> 3<00:03:18.689> m<00:03:18.930> 4

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
consider again is to go on time change

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.199 
consider again is to go on time change
