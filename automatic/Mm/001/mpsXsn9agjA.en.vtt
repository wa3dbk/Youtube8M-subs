00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.660
 hello everyone here is the tutorial on how 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.660
 counts rg and of our must with variator 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:14.820
 then first of all we make a mark 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.719
 on the clutch pin and one on the design 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.719
 correspondence 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.609
 then let's do the same thing 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:34.669
 on our pivot that will go into the wheel 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.669
 rear sign here is sign on the face 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:48.260
 ok let's go out a little better here 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:57.960
 ok perfect after that we're going to shoot 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.480
 the pin bending many times up to 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.820
 let our sign not make a turn 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.180
 complete with returns at 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.180
 the cast iron one and we count the turns then 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:23.820
 1 2 3 4 5 and how he could see ours 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.320
 beautiful of course turns and this sign 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:36.440
 must return to 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:40.900
 the cast iron one therefore 5 6 7 8 9 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:56.270
 let's see where we are getting closer 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:02:06.410
 10 there is almost ten and a half we try 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:09.100
 first with 10 and a half but ten and a half ok 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:14.870
 so our no our moved a 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:17.680
 10.5 rpm that is a red that we 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.190
 exploit it for the relationships to be long 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.020
 so when we have less laps 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.470
 of the clutch shaft to make it do 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.230
 one complete turn with wheel spindle 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:34.100
 the pivot wheel we will have reports from 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.160
 long while when we have so many laps 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.370
 then for example 13 or even 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.239
 15 we would have shorter reports then 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.239
 excellent for shooting
