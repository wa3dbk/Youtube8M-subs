00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
back your head and I think the bridge

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.330 
back your head and I think the bridge
just<00:02:33.510> give<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.780> an<00:02:33.900> extra<00:02:34.019> do<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.680> then<00:02:35.160> it

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
just give it an extra do and then it

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.280 
just give it an extra do and then it
just<00:02:35.370> add<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.940> hairball<00:02:36.569> because<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.019> think<00:02:37.170> it

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
just add a hairball because I think it

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.080 
just add a hairball because I think it
just<00:02:37.319> makes<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.709> look<00:02:37.769> so<00:02:37.890> much<00:02:38.220> care<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.670> I

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
just makes it look so much care and I

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.910 
just makes it look so much care and I
just<00:02:39.299> pin<00:02:39.599> this<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.110> back<00:02:40.319> where<00:02:40.349> they

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
just pin this to the back where they

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.520 
just pin this to the back where they
both<00:02:41.220> meet<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.299> that<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.989> finished<00:02:43.290> third

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
broods to the main section of hair once

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.089 
broods to the main section of hair once
you're<00:03:06.110> happy<00:03:06.230> with<00:03:06.379> it<00:03:06.620> you're<00:03:06.769> just<00:03:06.950> going

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
you're happy with it you're just going

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.640 
you're happy with it you're just going
to<00:03:07.190> get<00:03:07.340> another<00:03:07.610> elastic<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.510> tie<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.989> all<00:03:09.319> up

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
to get another elastic and tie it all up

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.520 
to get another elastic and tie it all up
so<00:03:10.069> that<00:03:10.700> is<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.269> finish<00:03:11.390> hairstyle<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:12.319> think

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
so that is the finish hairstyle I think

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.020 
so that is the finish hairstyle I think
this<00:03:12.650> just<00:03:12.890> gives<00:03:13.069> that<00:03:13.159> extra<00:03:13.250> edge<00:03:13.700> than

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
this just gives that extra edge than

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.030 
this just gives that extra edge than
just<00:03:14.209> having<00:03:14.329> a<00:03:14.420> normal<00:03:14.569> plane<00:03:14.959> ponytail<00:03:15.530> but

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
just having a normal plane ponytail but

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.440 
just having a normal plane ponytail but
