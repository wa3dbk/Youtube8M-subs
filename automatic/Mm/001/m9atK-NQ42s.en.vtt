if<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.850> lifting<00:00:33.149> up<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:34.320> doesn't<00:00:34.649> count<00:00:34.800> I

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
if I'm lifting up that doesn't count I

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.040 
if I'm lifting up that doesn't count I
can<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.520> there<00:00:35.730> see<00:00:36.450> how<00:00:36.540> I'm<00:00:36.600> coming<00:00:36.870> off<00:00:36.930> the

can get there see how I'm coming off the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.780 
can get there see how I'm coming off the
ground<00:00:37.260> now<00:00:37.649> we<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.460> able<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.670> say

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
ground now we have to be able to say

fingers<00:00:39.180> down<00:00:39.710> into<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> rotate<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.270> I'm<00:00:42.420> about

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
fingers down into a rotate so I'm about

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.920 
fingers down into a rotate so I'm about
right<00:00:42.809> there<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.710> keep<00:00:43.829> my<00:00:44.010> fingers<00:00:44.489> flat

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
right there I can keep my fingers flat

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.840 
right there I can keep my fingers flat
underneath<00:00:45.930> me<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.410> my<00:00:46.500> shoulder<00:00:46.920> until<00:00:47.190> I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
underneath me and my shoulder until I

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.869 
underneath me and my shoulder until I
get<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.120> hear<00:00:48.329> most<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.469> will<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.520> about<00:00:50.730> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
get to hear most of you will be about of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.470 
get to hear most of you will be about of
here<00:00:51.110> okay<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.520> about<00:00:53.640> zero<00:00:54.059> degrees

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
here okay so this is about zero degrees

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.229 
here okay so this is about zero degrees
into<00:00:55.050> rotation<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.610> you're<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> start

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
into rotation so you're going to start

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.240 
into rotation so you're going to start
to<00:00:57.480> feel<00:00:57.930> probably<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.410> lot<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.829> right<00:00:59.070> out

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
to feel probably a lot of you right out

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.360 
to feel probably a lot of you right out
here<00:00:59.280> you're<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> lose<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:01.070> we<00:01:02.070> want<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
here you're going to lose it we want to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.619 
here you're going to lose it we want to
be<00:01:02.430> able<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:02.910> how<00:01:02.969> far<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.449> get

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
be able to get to see how far we can get

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.109 
be able to get to see how far we can get
down<00:01:03.899> until<00:01:04.680> our<00:01:04.799> fingers<00:01:05.070> come<00:01:05.220> off<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.460> right

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
down until our fingers come off I right

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.859 
down until our fingers come off I right
here<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.990> my<00:01:07.710> good<00:01:07.920> side<00:01:08.420> can<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.720> right

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
here on my good side can get to right

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.570 
here on my good side can get to right
about<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.220> see<00:01:11.250> I'm<00:01:11.430> still

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
about here so you can see I'm still

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.330 
about here so you can see I'm still
lacking<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.420> position<00:01:12.900> I'm<00:01:13.140> still<00:01:13.770> 2

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
lacking in this position I'm still 2

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.370 
lacking in this position I'm still 2
plus<00:01:14.880> maybe<00:01:15.150> three<00:01:15.479> fifths<00:01:15.780> off<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> ground

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
plus maybe three fifths off the ground

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.810 
plus maybe three fifths off the ground
let's<00:01:17.040> see<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.310> want<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.549> able<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.729> get

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
let's see if you want to be able to get

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.760 
let's see if you want to be able to get
to<00:01:17.909> at<00:01:18.000> least<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.630> fist<00:01:19.140> off<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> ground

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to at least one fist off the ground

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.160 
to at least one fist off the ground
optimal<00:01:20.490> two<00:01:21.119> fists<00:01:21.570> would<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.750> pretty<00:01:21.990> good

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
optimal two fists would be pretty good

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.440 
optimal two fists would be pretty good
fingers<00:01:23.070> underneath<00:01:23.340> keeping<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> pressure

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
fingers underneath keeping the pressure

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.080 
fingers underneath keeping the pressure
on<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.920> start<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.490> lose<00:01:26.640> finger

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
on it right here I start to lose finger

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.300 
on it right here I start to lose finger
pressure<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.259> my<00:01:28.409> internal<00:01:28.979> rotation

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
pressure that is my internal rotation

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.289 
pressure that is my internal rotation
okay<00:01:30.530> we're<00:01:31.530> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> compare<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.100> left<00:01:32.700> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
okay we're going to compare that left to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.319 
okay we're going to compare that left to
right<00:01:33.509> side<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.560> main<00:01:34.860> thing<00:01:35.030> looking<00:01:36.030> at<00:01:36.180> is
