00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hi friends and friends today I'm going to 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.280
 teach how to make a portal mouse 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.000
 toothbrushes that's what we're going 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:17.430
 to use me here I used to have a tube 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.770
 a tube cut it this and used one of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.150
 halves half has more or less 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.410
 high 11 centimeters high and here goes 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.200
 to go 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.900
 the toothbrush this is a brush 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.660
 that I have to do crafts 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.059
 for the toothbrush down here I 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.610
 with silicone I passed silicone and left the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.949
 holes just so that it 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.350
 Drain the water with this ready 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:50.629
 let's move on to the armed face 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.500
 this little mouse we're going to need 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.500
 we are going to need 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.730
 in a circle of 13 centimeters half 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.440
 half if a half circle of 13 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:10.600
 centimeters half and what are we going to do 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:14.830
 let's say for example that this is half 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.610
 this is half we are going to join here we are going 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.460
 to pass a backstitch and in this part 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.230
 let's make the whole snail point 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.340
 around and let's stretch and fill 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.400
 Once I have that, I'm going to stay 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.280
 this like the zero point and the stitching and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 let's make the traditional face 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.070
 if the traditional face the only 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.810
 difference is that we 're going to mark let's 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.360
 sinking your nose and is marking the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.070
 snout for example I do it with color 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.180
 they will go there to the mouth and they will go 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.400
 put here in the nose and they will come out here 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.350
 and they're going to stretch a bit and they're going to sink 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.510
 this part 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.990
 and it will be 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.600
 so let's do let's make it 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.149
