00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.320 
score for me was that it was the most
performance<00:02:15.840> oriented<00:02:16.379> group<00:02:16.530> score<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.700> we

had<00:02:18.480> lived<00:02:18.810> with<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.110> idea<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.560> my<00:02:19.680> demos<00:02:20.099> for

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
had lived with this idea in my demos for

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.039 
had lived with this idea in my demos for
a<00:02:20.340> long<00:02:20.489> time<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.000> virtual<00:02:21.390> score<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.989> the

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
a long time and virtual score and the

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.780 
a long time and virtual score and the
computers<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.829> Santa's<00:02:23.220> for<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.430> long<00:02:23.579> time

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
computers in the Santa's for a long time

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.759 
computers in the Santa's for a long time
and<00:02:24.150> then<00:02:24.480> when<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.840> was<00:02:24.870> performed<00:02:25.500> it

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
and then when it was performed it

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.410 
and then when it was performed it
changed<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.579> way<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.849> no<00:02:26.970> other<00:02:27.000> score

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
changed in a way that no other score

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.150 
changed in a way that no other score
I've<00:02:27.540> ever<00:02:27.720> done<00:02:27.900> has<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.530> Hillary<00:02:28.799> brought<00:02:29.129> a

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
I've ever done has and Hillary brought a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.460 
I've ever done has and Hillary brought a
lot<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.879> us<00:02:29.970> she<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.360> she<00:02:30.989> elevated

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
lot of that to us she just she elevated

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.710 
lot of that to us she just she elevated
it<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.739> completely<00:02:32.250> unexpected<00:02:32.549> level<00:02:33.360> for

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
it to a completely unexpected level for

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.500 
it to a completely unexpected level for
me<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:35.220> was<00:02:35.370> transformational<00:02:35.790> moment

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
me and that was transformational moment

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.360 
me and that was transformational moment
for<00:02:36.629> me<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.959> mean<00:02:37.079> that<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.829> I<00:02:37.920> think<00:02:38.099> for<00:02:38.220> night

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
for me I mean that and I think for night

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.920 
for me I mean that and I think for night
too<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.849> think<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.209> regard<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.629> score

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
too and I think in that regard the score

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.259 
too and I think in that regard the score
is<00:02:40.079> is<00:02:40.319> unique<00:02:40.680> for<00:02:40.890> us<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.280> really<00:02:41.910> think<00:02:42.150> this

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
is is unique for us I really think this

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.270 
is is unique for us I really think this
is<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.480> best<00:02:42.720> score<00:02:43.079> that<00:02:43.709> he's<00:02:43.859> ever<00:02:44.069> done

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
is the best score that he's ever done

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.150 
is the best score that he's ever done
it's<00:02:44.519> so<00:02:44.760> emotional<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.650> know<00:02:46.769> there's

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
it's so emotional and you know there's

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.890 
it's so emotional and you know there's
no<00:02:47.310> way<00:02:47.489> we'll<00:02:47.670> be<00:02:47.700> able<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:48.000> top<00:02:48.209> this<00:02:48.239> this<00:02:48.720> is

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
no way we'll be able to top this this is

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.229 
no way we'll be able to top this this is
just<00:02:49.079> too<00:02:49.260> good<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.190> feeling<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.819> and

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
just too good and that feeling of and

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.000 
just too good and that feeling of and
you<00:02:51.329> hear<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.629> score<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.019> that<00:02:52.140> happens<00:02:52.530> it's

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
you hear the score and that happens it's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.700 
you hear the score and that happens it's
a<00:02:53.069> nice<00:02:53.280> feeling
