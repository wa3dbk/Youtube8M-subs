00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.540 

now<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:04.050> make<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.619> easier<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:05.369> first

now to make it easier when you're first
practicing<00:01:06.300> what<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.259> would<00:01:07.440> recommend<00:01:07.890> is

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
practicing what I would recommend is

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.070 
practicing what I would recommend is
instead<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.360> straight<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:10.050> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
instead of just going straight for the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.340 
instead of just going straight for the
shoot<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:11.060> would<00:01:12.060> tighten<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.840> chips<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.259> a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
shoot I would tighten the chips up a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.830 
shoot I would tighten the chips up a
little<00:01:13.530> bit<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.600> finger

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
little bit like this so this finger

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.460 
little bit like this so this finger
comes<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:17.250> kind<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.899> gets<00:01:18.899> a<00:01:18.990> nice<00:01:19.140> tight

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
comes and just kind of gets a nice tight

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.440 
comes and just kind of gets a nice tight
little<00:01:19.800> tight<00:01:20.310> little<00:01:20.460> hold<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
without having to do that where they

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.870

just roll down to start with four is

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.040 
just roll down to start with four is
really<00:01:58.970> difficult<00:01:59.270> what<00:01:59.600> I<00:01:59.630> would<00:01:59.810> do<00:01:59.900> is<00:01:59.990> I

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
really difficult what I would do is I

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.110 
really difficult what I would do is I
would<00:02:00.080> start<00:02:00.290> with<00:02:00.560> three<00:02:00.800> and<00:02:01.610> I<00:02:01.820> would<00:02:01.940> start

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
would start with three and I would start

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.850 
would start with three and I would start
with<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.360> chips<00:02:02.570> in<00:02:02.720> this<00:02:02.870> position<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:03.740> your

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
with the chips in this position so your

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.760 
with the chips in this position so your
hand<00:02:04.160> flat<00:02:04.780> your<00:02:05.780> middle<00:02:05.990> finger<00:02:06.290> comes<00:02:06.530> up<00:02:06.680> a

chips<00:02:23.350> four<00:02:24.350> chips<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:25.310> lot<00:02:25.850> harder<00:02:26.090> this

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
chips four chips is a lot harder this

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.290 
chips four chips is a lot harder this
last<00:02:27.260> coin<00:02:27.590> just<00:02:27.890> doesn't<00:02:28.700> want<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:28.910> catch<00:02:29.090> in

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
last coin just doesn't want to catch in

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.080 
last coin just doesn't want to catch in
between<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.690> fingers<00:02:29.990> it<00:02:30.170> took<00:02:30.380> me<00:02:30.850> months<00:02:31.850> of

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
between the fingers it took me months of

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.900 
between the fingers it took me months of
practice<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.720> be<00:02:32.840> able<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.050> get<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.320> one<00:02:33.910> so

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
practice to be able to get this one so

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.910 
practice to be able to get this one so
don't<00:02:35.240> give<00:02:35.450> up<00:02:35.630> you'll<00:02:36.200> eventually<00:02:36.500> be<00:02:36.860> able

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
don't give up you'll eventually be able

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.280 
don't give up you'll eventually be able
to<00:02:37.100> do<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:37.520> let's<00:02:37.700> start<00:02:37.940> let's<00:02:38.840> start<00:02:38.990> one

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
to do it so let's start let's start one

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.230 
to do it so let's start let's start one
more<00:02:39.410> time<00:02:39.590> it's<00:02:40.340> gonna<00:02:40.520> kind<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.060> look<00:02:41.180> like

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
more time it's gonna kind of look like

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.770 
more time it's gonna kind of look like
this

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
this

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.820 
this
so<00:02:42.500> your<00:02:42.650> hand<00:02:42.860> flat<00:02:43.300> corners<00:02:44.300> like<00:02:44.450> this

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
so your hand flat corners like this

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.370 
so your hand flat corners like this
thumb<00:02:45.830> pulls<00:02:46.250> up<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.610> first<00:02:46.850> chip<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:48.230> other

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
thumb pulls up the first chip the other

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.300 
thumb pulls up the first chip the other
to<00:02:48.620> fall<00:02:48.920> down<00:02:49.160> grip<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:51.560> pull<00:02:52.040> back<00:02:52.250> up

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
to fall down grip and you pull back up

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.699 
to fall down grip and you pull back up
just<00:02:52.790> like<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.110> it's<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.140> lot<00:02:54.320> harder<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.590> do

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
just like that it's a lot harder to do

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.370 
just like that it's a lot harder to do
it<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:54.920> slow<00:02:55.040> motion<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.640> fast<00:02:55.820> motion<00:02:56.140> as<00:02:57.140> far

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
it in slow motion and fast motion as far

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.050 
it in slow motion and fast motion as far
as<00:02:57.530> starting<00:02:58.370> I<00:02:58.459> would<00:02:58.610> definitely<00:02:58.970> recommend

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
as starting I would definitely recommend

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.620 
as starting I would definitely recommend
with<00:02:59.450> three<00:02:59.660> one<00:02:59.810> more<00:02:59.900> time<00:03:00.110> start<00:03:00.950> like<00:03:01.100> this

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
with three one more time start like this

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.199 
with three one more time start like this
thumb<00:03:02.630> pulls<00:03:02.989> up<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.290> first<00:03:03.530> chip<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.100> that

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
thumb pulls up the first chip and that

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.520 
thumb pulls up the first chip and that
last<00:03:05.209> chip<00:03:05.450> just<00:03:05.660> rolls<00:03:06.050> down<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.380> got<00:03:06.500> to

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
last chip just rolls down you got to

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.560 
last chip just rolls down you got to
catch<00:03:06.800> it<00:03:06.860> in<00:03:07.190> between<00:03:07.340> your<00:03:07.519> fingers<00:03:07.970> when

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
catch it in between your fingers when

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.330 
catch it in between your fingers when
you're<00:03:08.690> first<00:03:08.900> starting<00:03:09.380> it's<00:03:09.980> going<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.250> be

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
you're first starting it's going to be

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.280 
you're first starting it's going to be
very<00:03:10.550> difficult<00:03:10.880> for<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.630> catch<00:03:11.989> that

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
very difficult for you to catch that

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.500 
very difficult for you to catch that
third<00:03:12.590> coin<00:03:12.980> it's<00:03:13.640> going<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:13.850> be<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.360> can

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
third coin it's going to be you can

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.390 
third coin it's going to be you can
catch<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.870> but<00:03:15.019> to<00:03:15.170> bring<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.530> like<00:03:15.800> this<00:03:16.040> in<00:03:16.310> a

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
catch it but to bring it like this in a

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.800 
catch it but to bring it like this in a
position<00:03:16.700> where<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.090> can<00:03:17.209> hold<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.510> like<00:03:17.540> that

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
position where you can hold it like that

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.259 
position where you can hold it like that
it's<00:03:18.050> going<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.230> be<00:03:18.350> difficult<00:03:18.560> your<00:03:19.430> hand<00:03:20.120> is

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
it's going to be difficult your hand is

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.380 
it's going to be difficult your hand is
not<00:03:20.300> used<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.080> natural<00:03:21.380> stretch<00:03:22.070> so<00:03:22.970> I

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
not used to that natural stretch so I

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.120 
not used to that natural stretch so I
would<00:03:23.660> also<00:03:23.810> recommend<00:03:24.050> maybe<00:03:24.470> just<00:03:24.769> putting

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
would also recommend maybe just putting

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.280 
would also recommend maybe just putting
the<00:03:25.250> chips<00:03:25.489> there<00:03:25.730> just<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.720> stretch<00:03:27.080> your

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
the chips there just to stretch your

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.810 
the chips there just to stretch your
finger<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:27.920> when<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.130> finally<00:03:28.370> get<00:03:28.670> the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
finger so that when you finally get the

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.270 
finger so that when you finally get the
motion<00:03:29.030> down<00:03:29.239> your<00:03:30.050> fingers<00:03:30.530> are<00:03:30.680> used<00:03:31.100> to

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
motion down your fingers are used to

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.620 
motion down your fingers are used to
that<00:03:31.400> stretch<00:03:31.760> because<00:03:31.970> your<00:03:32.180> fingers<00:03:32.420> don't

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
that stretch because your fingers don't

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.720 
that stretch because your fingers don't
tend<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.140> stress<00:03:33.470> like<00:03:33.650> that<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.430> put<00:03:34.640> the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
tend to stress like that so put the

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.000 
tend to stress like that so put the
chips<00:03:34.940> down<00:03:35.120> stretch<00:03:35.630> your<00:03:35.810> fingers<00:03:36.170> start

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
chips down stretch your fingers start

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.070 
chips down stretch your fingers start
with<00:03:37.190> three<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:37.760> eventually<00:03:38.690> you'll<00:03:38.870> work

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
with three and eventually you'll work

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.860 
with three and eventually you'll work
your<00:03:39.260> way<00:03:39.380> down<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:40.870> four<00:03:41.870> chips

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
your way down to four chips

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.680 
your way down to four chips
and<00:03:44.349> that's<00:03:44.680> what<00:03:44.830> it<00:03:44.920> should<00:03:44.950> look<00:03:45.160> like<00:03:45.690> like

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
and that's what it should look like like

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.900 
and that's what it should look like like
that
