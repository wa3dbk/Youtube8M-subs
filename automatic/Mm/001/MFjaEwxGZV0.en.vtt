going<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.730> any<00:01:00.910> shows<00:01:01.149> yet<00:01:01.420> wishing<00:01:01.989> now<00:01:02.520> crack

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
going to any shows yet wishing now crack

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.420 
going to any shows yet wishing now crack
on<00:01:03.730> get<00:01:04.239> a<00:01:04.269> jump<00:01:04.600> enough<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.920> her<00:01:06.009> out<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.189> get

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
on get a jump enough get her out and get

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.279 
on get a jump enough get her out and get
her<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.670> some<00:01:06.820> shows<00:01:07.090> you<00:01:07.959> know<00:01:08.079> she's<00:01:08.259> a

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
her to some shows you know she's a

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:10.199 
her to some shows you know she's a
really<00:01:08.590> nice<00:01:08.770> sport<00:01:09.189> type<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:09.909> what<00:01:10.060> I<00:01:10.090> would

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:10.209 
really nice sport type so what I would

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:14.760 
really nice sport type so what I would
say<00:01:10.569> is<00:01:11.399> she's<00:01:12.399> she's<00:01:12.850> she's<00:01:13.499> blood<00:01:14.499> enough

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
say is she's she's she's blood enough

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.690 
say is she's she's she's blood enough
that<00:01:15.280> she<00:01:15.609> could<00:01:15.819> she<00:01:16.810> could<00:01:16.840> do<00:01:17.139> I<00:01:17.170> this<00:01:17.700> event

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
that she could she could do I this event

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.620 
that she could she could do I this event
also<00:01:19.209> jump<00:01:19.539> so<00:01:19.899> I<00:01:20.490> mean<00:01:21.490> basically<00:01:21.670> this<00:01:22.179> stage

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
also jump so I mean basically this stage

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.820 
also jump so I mean basically this stage
of<00:01:22.659> production<00:01:23.049> is<00:01:23.499> very<00:01:23.529> similar

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
of production is very similar

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.700 
of production is very similar
so<00:01:25.400> basically<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.990> know<00:01:27.110> doing<00:01:27.410> all<00:01:27.500> the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
so basically you know doing all the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.400 
so basically you know doing all the
correct<00:01:28.370> flatwork<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:29.030> get<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.540> get<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.870> PM

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
correct flatwork to get to get the PM

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.830 
correct flatwork to get to get the PM
distinct<00:01:30.890> enough<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.220> carry<00:01:31.490> themselves<00:01:31.840> you

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
distinct enough to carry themselves you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.690 
distinct enough to carry themselves you
know<00:01:32.930> she<00:01:32.990> shows<00:01:33.380> she's<00:01:34.220> always<00:01:34.430> showed<00:01:34.670> a

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
know she shows she's always showed a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.830 
know she shows she's always showed a
nice<00:01:35.000> neat<00:01:35.360> jump<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.850> apart<00:01:38.360> from<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:38.600> it's

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
nice neat jump so apart from that it's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.030 
nice neat jump so apart from that it's
just<00:01:38.870> time<00:01:39.230> and<00:01:39.500> giving<00:01:39.710> her<00:01:39.800> time<00:01:39.980> to

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
just time and giving her time to

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.040 
just time and giving her time to
strengthen<00:01:40.400> up<00:01:40.670> there<00:01:41.000> nice<00:01:41.270> walk<00:01:41.540> she<00:01:41.840> walked

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
strengthen up there nice walk she walked

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.450 
strengthen up there nice walk she walked
out<00:01:42.260> for<00:01:42.470> her<00:01:42.530> shoulders

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.620 

nothing<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.550> walk<00:01:46.760> something<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.240> can<00:01:47.420> judge

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
nothing to walk something you can judge

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.510 
nothing to walk something you can judge
quite<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:47.960> lot<00:01:48.170> she<00:01:48.350> stepped<00:01:48.650> up<00:01:48.830> nicely<00:01:49.250> behind

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
quite a lot she stepped up nicely behind

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.150 
quite a lot she stepped up nicely behind
in<00:01:49.760> wards<00:01:50.290> was<00:01:51.290> her<00:01:51.470> hind<00:01:52.250> leg<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:54.470> mother<00:01:54.920> was

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
in wards was her hind leg the mother was

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.900 
in wards was her hind leg the mother was
really<00:01:55.430> long<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.860> we<00:01:57.860> could<00:01:58.100> have<00:01:58.190> said<00:01:58.490> her

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
really long and we could have said her

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.050 
really long and we could have said her
hat<00:01:59.090> she<00:01:59.590> looks<00:02:00.590> at<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:00.920> stage<00:02:02.410> a<00:02:04.060> little

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
hat she looks at this stage a little

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.940 
hat she looks at this stage a little
long<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:05.870> just<00:02:06.140> said<00:02:06.290> that<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:06.710> know<00:02:06.800> when

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
long but I just said that you know when

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.650 
long but I just said that you know when
our<00:02:07.070> back<00:02:07.250> muscles<00:02:07.730> up<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:07.880> stuff<00:02:08.390> how<00:02:08.630> much

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
our back muscles up and stuff how much

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.110 
our back muscles up and stuff how much
you<00:02:08.990> start<00:02:09.230> to<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:10.250> look<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.550> lot<00:02:10.700> more<00:02:10.940> in

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
you start to to look a lot more in

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.580 
you start to to look a lot more in
proportion<00:02:11.270> you<00:02:11.870> know<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.140> find<00:02:12.380> it's<00:02:12.560> very

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
proportion you know you find it's very

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.710 
proportion you know you find it's very
interesting<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.370> look<00:02:13.460> at<00:02:13.610> these<00:02:13.760> when

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
interesting to look at these when

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.690 
interesting to look at these when
