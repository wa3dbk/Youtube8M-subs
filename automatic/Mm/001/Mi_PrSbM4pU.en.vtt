00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.630
 I could turn it off 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.650
 and Werner does not have a wish 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.860
 fulfill 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.560
 but step by step so the eagle 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.670
 the adapter is the inspiration from the 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.590
 nature and that one has now 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.840
 evolved and step by step 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.240
 step there was the kink in the wing and 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.720
 At some point this is still evolving 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.310
 been 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.520
 in so far right here so one 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.920
 spiral structure and now we come to 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.710
 The ventilator fan is made if 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.430
 so you want many little wings and 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.860
 they have been optimized according to the model 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.250
 of the eagle and thus come here like this 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.170
 loop out wings and bernard has 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.860
 quite right there are lots of things 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.720
 Fan 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.760
 Just think about the whole computer 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.589
 to the whole data centers or the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.470
 bigger fan not only for computer 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.690
 for tekken if you only consider how 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.720
 so much energy comes together when 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.479
 you could optimize a fan by 30 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.140
 percent then you could be here in europe 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.270
 save in about two power plants and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.040
 that's exactly what you tried and that with 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.350
 this device here a so-called 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.579
 acoustic camera that's right 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.530
 funny here you can see 36 microphones in 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.500
 the middle of a camera and during the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.299
 I talk, you can see here a red that 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.789
 means where it is in the way 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.920
 deep red is there is more noise where 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:33.009
 it is less red than less noise 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.840
 So you can find out exactly where are 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.240
 you put that and you did it with 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.130
 the conventional fan and with the 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.179
 bionic fan and look at it 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.700
 result 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.399
 on the left the conventional many red 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.939
 Say a lot of turbulence and so too 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.219
 loud and right the bionic fan of the 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.109
 much quieter is the big advantage 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.939
 Of course, less turbulence means as well 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:58.899
 less power consumption 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:02.020
 So far so glad it is the 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.609
 Fans and you should never have the courage 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.100
 give up thinking too big 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:09.190
 take a look at that 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.130
 windmills in big who knows in the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.540
 In the future there will be the big ones 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.610
 bionic wind wheels even better 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.610
 convert wind into electricity
