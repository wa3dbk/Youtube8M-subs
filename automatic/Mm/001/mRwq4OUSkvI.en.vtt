00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
Valero is a really really famous piece

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.870 
Valero is a really really famous piece
of<00:00:27.720> music<00:00:28.080> very<00:00:28.620> well<00:00:28.740> known<00:00:29.100> all<00:00:29.460> around<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
of music very well known all around the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.260 
of music very well known all around the
world<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.360> and<00:00:30.810> very<00:00:32.270> often

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
world I think and very often

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.700 
world I think and very often
choreographed<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.960> music<00:00:34.080> and<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.650> think

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
choreographed to music and I think

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.680 
choreographed to music and I think
there's<00:00:35.280> several<00:00:35.700> really<00:00:36.180> well-known

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
there's several really well-known

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.610 
there's several really well-known
ballets<00:00:38.360> already<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.720> but<00:00:40.080> I<00:00:40.110> think<00:00:40.320> it's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
ballets already on it but I think it's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.430 
ballets already on it but I think it's
important<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.450> any<00:00:42.450> major<00:00:42.720> company<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.320> have

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
important for any major company to have

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.670 
important for any major company to have
their<00:00:43.590> own<00:00:43.710> version<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.130> bolero<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.790> such<00:00:44.970> a

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
their own version of bolero it's such a

it's such great music and really

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.690 
it's such great music and really
inspiring<00:00:49.080> and<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:50.040> lends<00:00:50.280> itself<00:00:50.400> really

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
inspiring and it lends itself really

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:05.700 
inspiring and it lends itself really
well<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.150> dance

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
Christophe approached it and explained

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.640 
Christophe approached it and explained
it<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.060> us<00:01:11.360> because<00:01:12.080> there<00:01:12.200> are<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:12.530> many

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
it to us because there are so many

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.710 
it to us because there are so many
versions<00:01:13.220> of<00:01:13.460> bolero<00:01:13.790> already<00:01:14.240> out<00:01:14.480> there

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
versions of bolero already out there

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.630 
versions of bolero already out there
that<00:01:14.990> he<00:01:15.650> didn't<00:01:15.890> want<00:01:16.040> it<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.250> be<00:01:16.400> too

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
that he didn't want it to be too

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.500 
that he didn't want it to be too
expected<00:01:17.710> or<00:01:18.710> like<00:01:19.640> overdone<00:01:20.150> or<00:01:20.330> anything

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
expected or like overdone or anything

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.570 
expected or like overdone or anything
like<00:01:20.780> that<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.050> he<00:01:21.440> wanted<00:01:21.740> he<00:01:22.040> didn't<00:01:22.280> come<00:01:22.460> in

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
like that so he wanted he didn't come in

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.840 
like that so he wanted he didn't come in
with<00:01:22.700> any<00:01:22.850> preconceived<00:01:23.420> ideas<00:01:23.900> about<00:01:23.960> how<00:01:24.380> we

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
with any preconceived ideas about how we

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.890 
with any preconceived ideas about how we
were<00:01:25.850> gonna<00:01:26.030> make<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.990> valley<00:01:27.170> he<00:01:27.680> wanted<00:01:28.010> to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
were gonna make the valley he wanted to

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.130 
were gonna make the valley he wanted to
work<00:01:29.900> with<00:01:29.930> us<00:01:30.910> one<00:01:31.910> on<00:01:31.940> one<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.600> just<00:01:32.810> see<00:01:33.110> how

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
work with us one on one and just see how

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.700 
work with us one on one and just see how
it<00:01:33.290> developed<00:01:33.860> without<00:01:34.250> really<00:01:35.440> telling<00:01:36.440> us

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
it developed without really telling us

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.800 
it developed without really telling us
how<00:01:37.160> it<00:01:37.340> should<00:01:37.550> be<00:01:37.700> or<00:01:38.000> this<00:01:38.300> is<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.570> feeling

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
how it should be or this is the feeling

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.540 
how it should be or this is the feeling
or<00:01:39.110> anything<00:01:39.260> like<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:39.920> he<00:01:40.130> didn't<00:01:40.370> want

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
or anything like that and he didn't want

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.580 
or anything like that and he didn't want
it<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.700> be<00:01:41.000> expected<00:01:41.720> because<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.020> music<00:01:42.470> is

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
it to be expected because the music is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.650 
it to be expected because the music is
small<00:01:42.980> at<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.580> beginning<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.150> builds<00:01:44.360> and

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
small at the beginning and it builds and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.620 
small at the beginning and it builds and
builds<00:01:44.690> and<00:01:44.960> builds<00:01:45.160> until<00:01:46.160> it's

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
builds and builds until it's

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.540 
builds and builds until it's
overpowering<00:01:47.630> at<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.170> end<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.680> he<00:01:49.280> didn't

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
overpowering at the end and he didn't

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.680 
overpowering at the end and he didn't
want<00:01:49.700> that<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:49.940> be<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.240> same<00:01:50.450> with<00:01:50.600> the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
want that to be the same with the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.990 
want that to be the same with the
dancers<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.530> instead<00:01:52.400> of<00:01:52.460> having<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.850> few

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
dancers so instead of having a few

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.750 
dancers so instead of having a few
dancers<00:01:53.390> on<00:01:53.540> stage<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.080> building<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.760> the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
dancers on stage and building to the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.790 
dancers on stage and building to the
whole<00:01:55.970> group<00:01:56.150> we<00:01:57.080> start<00:01:57.410> with<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.650> whole

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
whole group we start with the whole

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.420 
whole group we start with the whole
group<00:01:57.979> on<00:01:58.220> stage<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:59.740> you<00:02:00.740> know<00:02:00.860> we<00:02:01.010> started

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
group on stage and you know we started

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.850 
group on stage and you know we started
like<00:02:01.550> that<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:02.030> unexpected<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:02.990> Sasha<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.800> I

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
like that and unexpected and Sasha and I

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.340 
like that and unexpected and Sasha and I
are<00:02:04.300> sort<00:02:05.300> of<00:02:05.420> in<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.630> middle<00:02:05.840> of<00:02:05.990> them<00:02:06.140> and

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
are sort of in the middle of them and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:19.750 
are sort of in the middle of them and
then<00:02:06.440> we<00:02:06.530> emerge<00:02:07.490> from<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.850> group

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.100 

the<00:02:20.720> music<00:02:21.170> was<00:02:21.410> actually<00:02:22.780> inspired<00:02:23.780> by

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
the music was actually inspired by

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.790 
the music was actually inspired by
machinery<00:02:25.120> but<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.780> has<00:02:27.019> this<00:02:27.260> very<00:02:29.709> sort<00:02:30.709> of

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
machinery but it has this very sort of

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.770 
machinery but it has this very sort of
carnal<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.430> sexual<00:02:33.400> like<00:02:34.540> connotations<00:02:35.540> with

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
carnal and sexual like connotations with

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.490 
carnal and sexual like connotations with
it<00:02:36.110> which<00:02:36.680> everybody<00:02:37.099> sort<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.489> thinks<00:02:38.500> of

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
it which everybody sort of thinks of

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.050 
it which everybody sort of thinks of
when<00:02:39.650> they<00:02:39.709> hear<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.099> music<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.580> he<00:02:40.760> didn't

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
when they hear the music and he didn't

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.210 
when they hear the music and he didn't
specifically<00:02:41.989> want<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.470> be<00:02:42.590> sexual<00:02:43.069> or

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
specifically want it to be sexual or

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.920 
specifically want it to be sexual or
anything<00:02:43.430> like<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:44.120> he<00:02:44.269> never<00:02:44.420> mentioned

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
anything like that so he never mentioned

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.710 
anything like that so he never mentioned
that<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.080> us<00:02:45.970> it's<00:02:46.970> just<00:02:47.360> sort<00:02:47.569> of<00:02:47.660> something

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
that to us it's just sort of something

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.220 
that to us it's just sort of something
that<00:02:48.489> developed<00:02:49.489> when<00:02:49.910> we<00:02:50.060> were<00:02:50.180> working<00:02:50.690> the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
that developed when we were working the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.699 
that developed when we were working the
relationship<00:02:51.920> between<00:02:52.069> Sasha<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.700> myself

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
relationship between Sasha and myself

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:10.670 
relationship between Sasha and myself
what<00:02:54.709> came<00:02:54.950> out<00:02:55.099> of<00:02:55.280> us

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.800 

today<00:03:11.680> we<00:03:11.830> did<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.100> first<00:03:12.390> run-through<00:03:13.390> with

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
today we did the first run-through with

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.500 
today we did the first run-through with
everybody<00:03:14.670> because<00:03:15.670> usually<00:03:15.820> Sasha<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.450> I

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
everybody because usually Sasha and I

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.380 
everybody because usually Sasha and I
rehearse<00:03:16.660> by<00:03:16.960> ourselves<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.180> feels

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
rehearse by ourselves and so it feels

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.590 
rehearse by ourselves and so it feels
more<00:03:19.630> just<00:03:19.900> like<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.050> potted<00:03:20.320> us<00:03:20.530> separately<00:03:21.600> so

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
more just like a potted us separately so

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.630 
more just like a potted us separately so
today<00:03:22.900> we<00:03:23.020> put<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.290> with<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.500> 14<00:03:23.890> men<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.220> 14

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
today we put it with the 14 men and 14

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.530 
today we put it with the 14 men and 14
women<00:03:25.000> all<00:03:25.240> together<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:27.000> yeah<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.030> think<00:03:28.210> it's

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
women all together and yeah I think it's

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.200 
women all together and yeah I think it's
it's<00:03:28.810> hard<00:03:29.020> for<00:03:29.230> me<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.560> tell<00:03:29.740> because

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
it's hard for me to tell because

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.490 
it's hard for me to tell because
whenever<00:03:31.210> I'm<00:03:31.390> doing<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.810> I'm<00:03:31.960> in<00:03:32.140> it<00:03:32.290> I'm

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
whenever I'm doing it I'm in it I'm

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.260 
whenever I'm doing it I'm in it I'm
dancing<00:03:32.920> with<00:03:33.070> Sasha<00:03:33.280> I'm<00:03:33.700> looking<00:03:34.030> at<00:03:34.120> her

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
dancing with Sasha I'm looking at her

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.920 
dancing with Sasha I'm looking at her
and<00:03:34.570> I'm<00:03:35.290> slightly<00:03:35.770> aware<00:03:36.160> of<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.520> people

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
and I'm slightly aware of the people

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.690 
and I'm slightly aware of the people
coming<00:03:37.930> in<00:03:37.990> and<00:03:38.080> out<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.440> background<00:03:38.860> but

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
coming in and out of the background but

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.210 
coming in and out of the background but
I<00:03:39.730> think<00:03:40.060> it's<00:03:40.440> it's<00:03:41.440> coming<00:03:41.680> together<00:03:41.860> really

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
I think it's it's coming together really

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.690 
I think it's it's coming together really
well<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:43.740> think<00:03:44.740> that<00:03:45.040> once<00:03:45.400> we<00:03:45.580> go<00:03:45.670> to

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
well and I think that once we go to

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.240 
well and I think that once we go to
stage<00:03:46.060> it's<00:03:46.450> gonna<00:03:46.710> kick<00:03:47.710> it<00:03:47.830> up<00:03:47.920> another

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
stage it's gonna kick it up another

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.060 
stage it's gonna kick it up another
level<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:50.080> costumes<00:03:50.530> are<00:03:50.740> really

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
level and the costumes are really

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.920 
level and the costumes are really
beautiful<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:52.030> set<00:03:52.270> design<00:03:52.570> is<00:03:52.720> very

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
beautiful and the set design is very

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.070 
beautiful and the set design is very
cool<00:03:53.170> so<00:03:53.590> it's<00:03:54.000> it's<00:03:55.000> definitely<00:03:55.390> gonna<00:03:55.510> step

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
cool so it's it's definitely gonna step

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.590 
cool so it's it's definitely gonna step
it<00:03:56.200> up<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.380> notch<00:03:56.410> when<00:03:56.800> we<00:03:57.390> start<00:03:58.390> stage

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
it up a notch when we start stage

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.450 
it up a notch when we start stage
rehearsals<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.380> start<00:03:59.710> performing<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.400> I

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
rehearsals and start performing and I

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.690 
rehearsals and start performing and I
think<00:04:00.700> it's<00:04:00.820> hard<00:04:01.170> with<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:02.200> piece<00:04:02.440> like<00:04:02.590> this

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
think it's hard with a piece like this

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.820 
think it's hard with a piece like this
with<00:04:03.700> such<00:04:03.970> awesome<00:04:04.360> music<00:04:05.260> not<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.710> get

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
with such awesome music not to get

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.260 
with such awesome music not to get
carried<00:04:06.070> away<00:04:06.190> with<00:04:06.460> it<00:04:06.520> and<00:04:06.730> not<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.030> enjoy

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
carried away with it and not to enjoy

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.790 
carried away with it and not to enjoy
yourself<00:04:07.690> when<00:04:08.290> you're<00:04:08.440> doing<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:08.770> so

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
yourself when you're doing it so

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.160 
yourself when you're doing it so
hopefully<00:04:09.070> that<00:04:09.460> would<00:04:09.750> come<00:04:10.750> across<00:04:10.840> the

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
hopefully that would come across the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:20.030 
hopefully that would come across the
audience<00:04:11.560> from<00:04:11.680> we're<00:04:11.860> on<00:04:11.980> stage<00:04:12.220> performing

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.100
