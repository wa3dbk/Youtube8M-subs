00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.599
 hello girls today I come 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.830
 for a little tutorial make-up came out in 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.509
 made to my shirt 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.000
 I wanted to do in shades of green 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.779
 but not too much too clear and for 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.510
 this i used a base do this is 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:32.900
 only a mono from whom finally co 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.900
 if I can open it and here 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.480
 as usual I take my base to 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.430
 eyelids this time it's the turban 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.140
 docks and I put on the whole 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.260
 mobile eyelid as well as a little bit 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.920
 less sun then I catch my base 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.680
 this movie cult to actually draw 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.409
 the shape of the makeup that I want for 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.829
 following and to give more intensity 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.870
 to the lighthouse I had posed over 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.540
 so I shot a lot on the outside 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.299
 to do a little bit like an eye of 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.940
 cat and never a little bit in flush 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.160
 of lower lashes in the continuity in 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.410
 did the line and this gave me a 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.640
 look more elongated a little bit more and 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.700
 I then take a brush without 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.310
 no color on it just to come 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.470
 blur the entire upper edge of the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.850
 make-up to make it less clean and 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.850
 let it be nicer once I 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.069
 I'll put the lighthouse on top so I 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.280
 do not hesitate to insist 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:36.860
 until you like it then 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.530
 I catch my water and shadow of kiko 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.000
 I bought it from 0.1 balances that's the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.789
 number 2 111 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.729
 it is a glass that is very very pretty and 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.679
 bright is placed on a dark base 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.119
 you can see the reflections actually 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.770
 that he will give I love this 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.459
 association that for that I wanted 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.830
 show you this make up in fact so 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.599
 never really everywhere but I do not 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.940
 do not go beyond the part I blurred 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.619
 with the brush then with a small 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.950
 brush I do my eyelash 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.099
 lower people but on each side 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.489
 really all along the eye and 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.040
 I stretch out on the outside I take 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.099
 then my at the request of laura 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.180
 mercier a bottle of mineral water and 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.840
 I'm going the mullet a little bit 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.879
 to be able to pick it up with my 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.069
 brush to thank him I had bought the 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.230
 two sets in fact and I'm going to do 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.209
 a little bit of lightning size on 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.640
 my lower lashes 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.700
 so I do not put it in the lining 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.760
 but really in the implementation of 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.299
 eyelashes I do the same on my line of 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.269
 above 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.849
 so I pass by even below for 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.000
 really the master in the es6 and not 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:56.510
 so much in the very important opus this is 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.860
 no box has reunited his property tyco 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.830
 I share and on the other side 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.810
 gentlemen and for my car line I 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.510
 I'll take a flesh-colored pencil 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.360
 to still keep a good look 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:17.790
 open and I put in all my 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.989
 interests i then resume my minder 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.450
 cake since it can be used 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.550
 besides quite the baltic what 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.590
 I will do so I do not start 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.440
 really inside the eye but 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.299
 only from the first third to 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.890
 always given the impression of looking 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.890
 more been more before 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.370
 I do the same on the other side 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.030
 as usual I then have you 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.090
 saving 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.799
 the bus return step there and I pass 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.420
 directly squalls Arab 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.790
 I chose the 'big eyes' because I 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.400
 am testing it so with the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.079
 big bump I'm doing duet missiles with 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.269
 the little I'm doing my bottom eyelashes and I 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.950
 go through the future a little bit 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.660
 complete the signs that I could not 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.540
 catch with more force 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.610
 I then go to my eyebrows this 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.170
 once I take a pencil at make up 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.400
 academy 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.319
 it's not necessarily what I use 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.000
 most often but from time to time 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:27.289
 without bangs want to take a simple 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:30.440
 create next to pass in the face and rap 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.060
 maps and bonuses at maybelline all 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.990
 just because it's a baby 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.169
 cream that I like a lot 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.020
 so that's it then I'm going of course 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.580
 come and hide those naughty cern I sleep 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.560
 very very bad right now and that's right 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.120
 that I'm pretty scarred people 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.030
 take advantage to give a little more 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.030
 of light and legally occurred gesture 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.680
 have all this will make a little bit of 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.750
 time but the hist page is really very 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.070
 important and it helps to finish the 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.710
 eye makeup since I had 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.930
 really come in and shoot under the eye and 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.320
 thus redefine line 2 under the 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.320
 makeup 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.860
 all the edges I like to use my 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.340
 fingers to fade even more and 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.210
 then I take mars plouffe men 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.800
 kiko powder and I put it everywhere 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.690
 to warm a little bit of it all 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.530
 limited collection browser which 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.530
 this summer 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.650
 and do not forget to go down into the 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.110
 blow a blush from at famous cosmetics 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.910
 very flashy in the panel but not 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.730
 as much when we are we can of course 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.610
 the days so especially there do not forget 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.620
 the shading tables a little bit 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.440
 of dazzling highlighter thanks to who 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.420
 as always above the cheekbones 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.490
 a little bit on the net their costs and 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.160

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.810
 favored he colors viber of dior and 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.820
 I love this gloss that really gives a 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.820
 very very natural color honest 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.430
 that's what makes it barely 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.930
 I hope you have enjoyed
