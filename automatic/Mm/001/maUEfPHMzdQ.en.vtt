00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.530
 yes good a little bit a little bit of what 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.679
 same 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.870
 it's a more than hard moment for all the 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.750
 river people 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:23.070
 at the time when all this happened 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.810
 theme of the decline I think the best 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.710
 way to help was 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.230
 putting us under pressure from the club and good 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.680
 that was one of the ways to demonstrate 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.900
 our our love and our support 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.840
 upwards 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.090
 when he touched me and enter many 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.730
 feelings many feelings very 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.540
 nice people who had one left makes 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.730
 a lot of time and as I said to do I think 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.410
 what we have to think about here is 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:59.040
 make a strong group a united group 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.540
 start to meet us and throw all for 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.199
 the same side that's going to be the way 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.240
 to take a river out of the place it is 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.640
 that it is only clear that we 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.440
 deser 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.340
 I think a good part of our 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.700
 we did everything that was within reach 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.100
 to be able to reach the club the club 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.770
 as well 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.920
 he was up to the task he did everything 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.759
 I had to do and I think that's like 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.000
 just start and start trying 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.340
 do things well 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.310
 and that is the way that is the only 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.310
 way as they did just happened to us 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.860
 in difficult times because obviously 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.850
 that is not easy to get rid of 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.390
 of a team 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.369
 but good everything was done and today 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.990
 for today the important thing is that we are here 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.330
 to work to put the chest to 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.549
 this and as I said to get a river out of 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.330
 this place today was the first day that 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:05.140
 I'm with my colleagues and obviously 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:08.610
 today was a day of approach to enter 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.430
 a little bit in confidence to know us 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.550
 If I imagine there must be a lot 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.760
 difference when eye goes national to 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.220
 today 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.950
 I think with the trainings and with 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.159
 when parties go past them 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.569
 they are going to realize how 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.569
 it's the situation of national juana once 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.840
 I was dating when it was over 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.780
 The first thing I did was to tell my 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.739
 woman who wanted me to think if I came back 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.379
 she smiled and the truth is that 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.079
 from there I already had it clear 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.540
 I knew there were going to be many afterwards 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.870
 many things that were not going to be 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.540
 easy but the truth is that the people of 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.879
 valencia as I just said with people 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.829
 of river was up to the 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.099
 truth is that they behaved very well and 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.709
 they gave me the possibility to leave 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.840
 yielded so for that very gesture 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.500
 grateful 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.230
 we were also talking with fer in 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.120
 that moment we wrote to each other and 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.659
 and good and every time we give ourselves more 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.780
 more wins and it was already decided what 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.760
 happens is that afterwards there are many things that 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.269
 you have to wait, you can not say anything 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.489
 We believe that respect no no 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.769
 we are not the one to say that it is 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.840
 player and who has to come who does not 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.730
 I think the decisions are very 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.910
 personal also taking into account 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.050
 what 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.780
 it's not easy to bond with a club 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.700
 I think that today all the people and young people 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.150
 that young people who went through ribery and 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.770
 the people who are river fans I think 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.990
 must be predisposed to be able to give 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.150
 a hand but the situation may not be 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.790
 allows it 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.010
 Y 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.709
 our case was perhaps a little 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.599
 special but I think all of them all 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.819
 they want to help and want to be in this 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.359
 moment only the situation is nothing 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.849
 easy 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:14.230
 first of all more than grateful for 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:17.109
 the love that they show us and good for 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.690
 messages and for the people that on the street 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.850
 one crosses the most greets arrivals to 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.600
 familiar things that tell the truth that 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.820
 very grateful and well let's hope to give 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.889
 a joy to all those people and 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.449
 resign themselves to know that what we resign 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.790
 I think they know everything yes and it's a part 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.650
 economic that does not 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.680
 that today for us went through 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.150
 another side the decision then those in 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.370
 the same and progressive afterwards it 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.830
 said Augustine we are all with this 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:51.230
 commitment to doing things well 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.730
 we bring in all good a little bit of 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.610
 experience maybe because of the fact 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.150
 played out but when we're all 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.750
 together we are going to have to add and 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:07.160
 work like everyone else the truth is 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.980
 that we are seen in everything with desire 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.030
 to work 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.130
 trying to get through this bad time I think 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.260
 that's what's good and what's there 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.740
 rescue is that with much desire to 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.740
 to work 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.380
 well my case and some colleagues that 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.560
 they were very predisposed and 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:33.470
 that's always good I think that 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.530
 we return to the subject of what it is to form a 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.300
 group I think now we're going well 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.419
 now preseason and that's good 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.680
 so that we spend more time together and so 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:47.249
 let's gain confidence 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.049
 I think it's not easy 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:51.869
 go through the situation that they had to 

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:54.779
 pass but you have to turn the sheet 

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:56.899
 and they know they have to now look 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:06:01.799
 the city itself the same the green that 

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:03.119
 it is very difficult today to talk too much about 

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:07.110
 what we did inside because he is the 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:10.710
 first day but I think everything is the same 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.230
 did not change us did not change much and what 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.710
 important is the kind of people there 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.140
 inside and as Fernando said there are many 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.000
 friends that we left when we left and 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.450
 that feels because the truth that since 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.800
 that we entered gave us a great affection and 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.760
 we are very grateful for that 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.290
 I mean, as Fernando said one 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.690
 earns a lot in the experience I think it goes 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.060
 learning many things do not think about the 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.740
 same way as maybe when I was 22 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.460
 years 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:45.930
 and that is a very important factor 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:49.080
 so you are incorporating things in what 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.419
 footballing personally and as 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.729
 that helps you grow is very difficult 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:56.699
 say what kind of player I think 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:59.880
 you try to incorporate things but be 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:02.569
 always the player who was since 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.569
 he started playing
