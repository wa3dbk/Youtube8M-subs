00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.039
 Marty posted a comment 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.039
 2008 and that's the long program 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.079
 the 8 what everyone gets a program but Windows 7 has this feature of home 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.810
 and why did they say that as well as that at least? 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.809
 Garbage - 7 can go 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.940
 subscribe now 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.840
 Windows will do that under Windows Vista 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.610
 also shown 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.500
 theoretically there are also under Windows 7 police with under Windows Vista 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.170
 and on it will 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.360
 so I wanted someone that that 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.920
 at a request from him 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.030
 the sooner we already said so obviously more program the kids 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.130
 Windows 7 by default not 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.900
 and 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.799
 therefore 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.160
 Evening and indeed searched in the program 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.190
 and one found Vaillant for that is quite long 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.070
 the fist right as in the taz short as in the recovery 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.090
 and 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.210
 the whole thing is Volt Aperture defuses the tickets even more 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.070

 we have some here 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.510
 a small selection 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.720
 until 10 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.900
 which should still be empty with him 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.900
 and if you want to add pictures now 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 Galler should be click on break-injured

 that he so open Wanner dialogue 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.309
 if you want to select multiple images you do not have to go every 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.309
 individually click open next opponent are 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:21.429
 you can just 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:24.429
 Control 8 uses Markets that they do everything 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.719
 and then open on top of the round of top line arms yet he sees everyone 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:29.609

 was selected 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.459
 however, they can only 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.259
 Jack Black please stay DF 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.359
 and like Paella 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.459
 To add pictures 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.549
 Reuther over the Czech Republic Bechtle is the hair 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.139
 all if only 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.479
 this part formats the most unusual add 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.139
 besides Atli third she is here 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.529
 If you 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.859
 a place here and it works 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.419
 he buys can have single stylized store so the 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:02:59.659
 that this is not an issue 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.659
 Unanimously re-insert March 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.760
 as if they were standing here 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.769
 after on their hard drive 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.880
 After check back pictures is dedicated to pictures forming poison 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.079
 give for him 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.059
 among all supported pilgrims 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:19.259
 settle down on their internet chat world by looking out where they are 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.259
 handle calculator so you want to search 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:25.999
 is omitted if they take over the whole 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:27.849
 so handy 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.289
 the German duo just take 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.060
 stand at their animals starting price if they 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.629
 so here 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.709
 and if you want to enable the feature here that the whole 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.459
 Gellert will go for start and other animals 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.999
 in a regular 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:46.239
 at certain intervals thus form the ex-st 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.559
 under this cowardly 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:49.459
 can you do that 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.049
 a people their pictures 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.289
 but this is not mandatory nor is there any 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:55.399
 an option 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:57.769
 where they just go 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.549
 no arbitrary 1 off the program offers arbitrary searches 1 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.589
 out 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:04.939
 under the 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.229
 The pilots of the preview can see theirs 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.980
 Deiters 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.729
 the size of the picture 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:15.999
 Wilders 1029 from 208 also means paper here on ours but the double 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.419
 also the graphics settings thousands and thousands 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.579
 1029 more 200 should be 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.330
 and in Cologne they can do the 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.919
 in the roadmap chance the betrayal 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.800
 where she goes all the way 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.750
 In between, they can hide the whole here and Exit January the program 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.270
 and now we come to that 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.499
 convinced us that he will take the program 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:38.309
 Diop Schmitz 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:39.430
 there is a bunch here 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.860
 whether Schmitz 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.930
 unbiased album Oberkochen 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.660
 PET sda dapd that is 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.249
 audible fly 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.069
 We were wrong, Bez said all over India 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.169
 automatic state so want to move the startup 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.629
 as you would not if you just want to Kate 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.139
 Here we can cooperate with 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.460
 in a certain to 10 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.689
 Aachen 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.520
 but probably not 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.520
 here you can reach a desktop also four weeks 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.050
 and in states as needed push the whole thing too 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.469
 under just Jared 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:14.569
 Eichhorn 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.180
 because she is here 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.180
 own system beats 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.249
 you have our wallpapers here first 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.589
 Window cleaner over window in the window 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:29.919
 to stop the possibility 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.219
 the Paper Bird wolf-peter should be changed first 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.339
 the first edition is the hour, the time is the minute 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:40.909
 we have selected them the minute the review was done 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.180
 they still want to show 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.349
 if they take the hook and that off 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.249
 activate this plays every time you reboot the PC 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:50.710
 GM will 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.539
 the action and so carries 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.809
 Tack each time a day per pro you know the word speech ends 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:58.930
 changed 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.419
 and noise some reason why they can lay here 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:02.509
 Can you explain that 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.159
 knight 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.330
 accomplished 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.020
 when the minutes take place in Cannes 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.150
 and now the option here you perceive Nord Jan SchÃ¼ttes Queens Evas 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:16.729
 the last thing about it 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.389
 and that wanted or not changed when one 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.710
 Screensaver is up and running 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.620
 and here now have the opportunity to have misunderstood TuS 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.229
 WÃ¼llen he wanted to miss 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.229
 as in Hackney will activate either 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.819
 some picture here 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:36.909
 Triggers are not in order 

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:40.389
 but dealt with Siemens and that got the example 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:42.849
 de Niro and then take this one 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:46.199
 and then comes Iran again 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.240
 not different after 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.649
 a consequence 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:50.939
 and Jiegu fled 

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.669
 XIII are Holger Golisz 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.340
 if that does not work anymore which wins their list 

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:01.869
 So for example if you start the program on that and post with 

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:04.339
 There is no reason for the picture anymore 

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:07.339
 Percent automatically removes the image from the list 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.949
 OK 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:12.449
 we will be under 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.449
 You can adjust when you are 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.460
 Sign in 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.740
 is playing at just new stars 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.830
 changed 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.869
 or next to bar 

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:25.960
 just as her friend said 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.240
 When it came to Bonn it is not so important because we only here 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.780
