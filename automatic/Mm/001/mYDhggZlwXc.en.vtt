00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello to you all danil and now we 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.980
 heading to mission mud but if 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.080
 seriously then she is easy of rott i will 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.759
 As you know on Matiz will still be my 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.980
 friend on volkswagen passat who watched 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.359
 my previous videos have already understood what 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.900
 other composite in question and here we go 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.380
 drive up to this place he himself 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.380
 landing 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.170
 I'm mine and where is the road 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.530
 but where is the road I did not understand 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.130
 so we have small changes where we are 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.600
 wanted to drive flooded and KAMAZ leaves 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.090
 almost completely input wheel 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.799
 so we are now going to the detour but to 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.110
 that place we care anyway 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.350
 we'll get sorry for turning off the camera 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.970
 it's just a big thing 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.799
 matiz with wheel 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:32.280
 frightened us a little and here we are finally 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.280
 come to this place will go key 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.750
 So 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.520
 damn it seems to me that deep 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.000
 a drop 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.020
 fine 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.270
 but there is no other way 1 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.730
 he seems to be deep here 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.470
 dad ok 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.730

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.730

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.980
 our friend is still alive 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.980
 kind of pisyuna light the fact that they are with me 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.590
 Balin again puddle 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.890

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.890

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.190

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.970
 oh, my, and there we will not drive 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.860
 because there is already really a river 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.920
 but 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.820

 there now just arrived a tractor and 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:45.240
 water is about the wrong way here we try 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.240

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.680

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.580

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.280

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.280
