I've seen iPads are been to like right
here<00:00:23.810> so<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.840> mean<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.320> don't<00:00:25.380> know<00:00:25.529> what's<00:00:25.650> wrong

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
here so I mean I don't know what's wrong

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.170 
here so I mean I don't know what's wrong
with<00:00:25.829> their<00:00:26.070> tracks<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:26.610> they're<00:00:26.789> always

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
with their tracks but they're always

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:36.020 
with their tracks but they're always
bent<00:00:28.310> and<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> undercarriage<00:00:34.730> it's<00:00:35.730> kind

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
bent and on the undercarriage it's kind

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.960 
bent and on the undercarriage it's kind
of<00:00:36.150> a<00:00:36.239> high<00:00:36.390> Walker<00:00:36.750> now<00:00:37.140> I'm<00:00:37.320> looking<00:00:37.650> at<00:00:37.739> it

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
of a high Walker now I'm looking at it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.900 
of a high Walker now I'm looking at it
instead<00:00:38.970> of<00:00:39.650> being<00:00:40.650> kind<00:00:41.220> of<00:00:41.370> straight<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
instead of being kind of straight it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.030 
instead of being kind of straight it
slopes<00:00:42.269> down<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.780> obviously<00:00:43.170> they<00:00:43.409> they<00:00:43.920> got

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
slopes down so obviously they they got

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.520 
slopes down so obviously they they got
new<00:00:44.220> carriage<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:44.940> it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
new carriage for it

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.740 
new carriage for it
it's<00:00:47.130> not<00:00:47.310> the<00:00:47.430> normal<00:00:47.730> one<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:48.540> here's

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it's not the normal one and then here's

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.460 
it's not the normal one and then here's
your<00:00:48.900> hammer

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
your hammer

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.910 
your hammer
it's<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.580> v56<00:00:51.390> hammer<00:00:51.930> penny<00:00:52.410> I'm<00:00:52.560> not<00:00:52.710> familiar

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
it's a v56 hammer penny I'm not familiar

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.050 
it's a v56 hammer penny I'm not familiar
with<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:55.100> pretty<00:00:56.100> much<00:00:56.190> doesn't<00:00:56.700> have<00:00:56.910> one

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
with it but pretty much doesn't have one

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.250 
with it but pretty much doesn't have one
of<00:00:57.150> those<00:00:57.240> flat<00:00:57.600> heads<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.080> they're

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
of those flat heads but they're

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.530 
of those flat heads but they're
obviously<00:00:58.620> hammering<00:00:59.130> with<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.490> and<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.360> a

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
obviously hammering with it and it's a

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.040 
obviously hammering with it and it's a
it's<00:01:01.200> pretty<00:01:01.500> big<00:01:02.240> for<00:01:03.240> the<00:01:03.300> lines<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.990> a

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
it's pretty big for the lines in is a

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.280 
it's pretty big for the lines in is a
quickness<00:01:04.410> quick<00:01:04.920> coupler<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:06.290> there's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
quickness quick coupler on it there's

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.890 
quickness quick coupler on it there's
the<00:01:07.470> inside<00:01:09.500> here's<00:01:10.500> your<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.630> figure<00:01:12.630> that's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the inside here's your I figure that's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.600 
the inside here's your I figure that's
called<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.410> could<00:01:13.680> attach<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.130> stiff<00:01:14.400> arm

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
called but you could attach a stiff arm

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.510 
called but you could attach a stiff arm
to<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> grapple<00:01:16.230> or<00:01:16.350> anything<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:17.010> don't

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
to it for a grapple or anything I don't

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.820 
to it for a grapple or anything I don't
know<00:01:17.730> how<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.880> scrap<00:01:18.660> maybe<00:01:19.440> when<00:01:19.680> they<00:01:21.830> open

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
know how that scrap maybe when they open

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.800 
know how that scrap maybe when they open
it<00:01:22.860> scratched<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.150> there's<00:01:24.630> your

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
it scratched it and there's your

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.480 
it scratched it and there's your
auxiliaries<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.680> run<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.160> your<00:01:26.280> boom

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
auxiliaries that run on your boom

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.910 
auxiliaries that run on your boom
something<00:01:27.300> that<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.630> really<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.170> about<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
something that I really like about is

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.440 
something that I really like about is
the<00:01:29.100> auxiliary<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.910> runs<00:01:30.150> over<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
the auxiliary that runs over the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.920 
the auxiliary that runs over the
cylinder<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.110> actually<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> line<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.930> flexible

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
cylinder is actually a line a flexible

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.510 
cylinder is actually a line a flexible
it's<00:01:34.170> black<00:01:34.470> line<00:01:35.000> not<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:37.340> standard<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
it's black line not like a standard a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.390 
it's black line not like a standard a
stiff<00:01:38.850> line<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:40.500> could<00:01:40.650> call<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
stiff line you could call it that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.480 
stiff line you could call it that
and<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:42.630> heavier<00:01:43.229> dog<00:01:43.470> bone<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.979> your<00:01:44.070> linkage

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and the heavier dog bone in your linkage

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.910 
and the heavier dog bone in your linkage
and<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.600> lines<00:01:45.810> they<00:01:46.080> attach<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.560> here

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.640 

now<00:01:49.920> here's<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.310> side<00:01:50.550> of<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.760> hammer

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
now here's this side of the hammer

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.620 
now here's this side of the hammer
it's<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:53.310> there's<00:01:53.760> a<00:01:53.820> bunch<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.330> lines<00:01:54.480> like

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
it's a there's a bunch of the lines like

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.060 
it's a there's a bunch of the lines like
they<00:01:55.110> might<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.350> been<00:01:55.530> using<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.890> for

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
they might have been using this for

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.110 
they might have been using this for
compaction<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:57.020> sheet<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.230> Pilar<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.070> I'm<00:01:59.910> not

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
compaction a sheet of Pilar but I'm not

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.000 
compaction a sheet of Pilar but I'm not
sure<00:02:01.790> there's<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> other<00:02:03.060> side<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:04.800> hammer

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
sure there's the other side the hammer

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.530 
sure there's the other side the hammer
it's<00:02:05.280> pretty<00:02:05.490> cool<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.790> see<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.120> it<00:02:06.300> instead<00:02:06.480> of

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
it's pretty cool to see on it instead of

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.580 
it's pretty cool to see on it instead of
just<00:02:06.660> a<00:02:06.900> standard<00:02:07.260> bucket<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:09.470> gives<00:02:10.470> your

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
just a standard bucket and gives your

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.480 
just a standard bucket and gives your
lines<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.190> your<00:02:11.430> quick<00:02:11.640> coupler<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:13.490> lock

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
lines for your quick coupler that a lock

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.780 
lines for your quick coupler that a lock
in<00:02:14.670> your<00:02:14.820> pen<00:02:15.530> when<00:02:16.530> you're<00:02:16.800> attaching<00:02:17.430> new
