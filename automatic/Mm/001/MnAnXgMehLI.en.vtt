 The price is 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.940
 I 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:52.440
 I feel like it was around 8000 yen, but the price is not written here 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.090

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.390
 Hmm 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.290
 Street address 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.320
 You entered 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.320
 It comes out the body to the city 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:41.180
 It's supposed to be 3 points to come into simple 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.180
 Well here we will raise one black one 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:57.350
 My mer iodata Recent design has changed a little like this 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:06.310
 It becomes manners for usb 3.0 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:06.310
 Well here it's a power supply, so it's auto sound and it's a switch of 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.080
 Is it this time again? 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:20.580
 In about it is written Te hard disk Ior data 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:23.160
 When the lamp is usb 3.0, it seems blue and when it's 2.0 it glows green 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.220
 This is placed horizontally 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.200
 So if you put it like this , it's vertical 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.840
 Has become 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.330
 It becomes horizontal installation vertical installation both types 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.400

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.700
 Usb 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.700
 Street address 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.310
 3.2 If it can happen 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.720
 If you use an adapter 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.720
 It is a specification that can be used immediately 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.150
 Well N I 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.770
 That only about looks Hyun setter MaKon come with on an external hard disk 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.720
 I don't think it's a demon 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.770
 It's a bit dark in the north 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.920
 Well something this time, which came in very frustrated package-style package 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.030
 Well that's right this time 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.230
 It was chosen with the external sound hard disk by the type of external 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.280
 I bought an external 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.530
 The hard disk for photos is full, so I asked why I bought it 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.980
 In addition for reinforcement 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:34.510
 It is all cards, and it becomes 13.5 terabytes in total this time 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.510
 And it ends with the feeling that say 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:46.270
 It is supplement to one thing but it is hard disk inside 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.580
 Perhaps of Seagate students at the beginning with the later symbol stta that st 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:56.110
 It seems to be a hard disk 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:04:00.780
 Well too much can be expected in the life of a thing of a little early and the number of revolutions 7200rpm rotational speed 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.780
 No, but I would like to spend some money
