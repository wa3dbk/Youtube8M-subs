00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
now first things first a mistake that I

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.079 
now first things first a mistake that I
made<00:00:13.830> right<00:00:13.860> off<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.280> start<00:00:14.519> was<00:00:14.730> not<00:00:14.880> putting

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
made right off the start was not putting

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.060 
made right off the start was not putting
scavenger<00:00:15.719> Pro<00:00:15.900> as<00:00:16.109> my<00:00:16.230> first<00:00:16.470> perk<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.890> had

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
scavenger Pro as my first perk I had

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.710 
scavenger Pro as my first perk I had
sleight<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.369> hand<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.789> recommend<00:00:18.600> putting

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
sleight of hand I recommend putting

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.200 
sleight of hand I recommend putting
scavenger<00:00:19.439> Pro<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.910> maximum

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
scavenger Pro so you have the maximum

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.730 
scavenger Pro so you have the maximum
amount<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.570> ammo<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.050> start<00:00:22.410> off<00:00:22.529> with

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
amount of ammo you can start off with

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.900 
amount of ammo you can start off with
that<00:00:22.949> way<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.160> don't<00:00:23.369> need<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.609> move<00:00:23.730> around

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
that way you don't need to move around

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.509 
that way you don't need to move around
from<00:00:24.240> your<00:00:24.420> spot<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> lot<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.260> yes<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.430> guys

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
from your spot a lot and yes you guys

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.370 
from your spot a lot and yes you guys
can<00:00:26.760> probably<00:00:26.849> guess<00:00:27.269> by<00:00:27.480> me<00:00:27.660> saying<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.199> is

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
can probably guess by me saying that is

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.519 
can probably guess by me saying that is
that<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.789> really<00:00:30.359> slow<00:00:30.720> paced<00:00:31.050> Moab

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that this is a really slow paced Moab

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.610 
that this is a really slow paced Moab
and<00:00:32.149> pretty<00:00:33.149> campy<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.899> must<00:00:34.140> say<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.380> myself

and pretty campy if I must say so myself

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.100 
and pretty campy if I must say so myself

greatest sniper so I like to stick to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.350 
greatest sniper so I like to stick to
assault<00:01:09.540> rifles<00:01:09.960> or<00:01:10.200> LMGs<00:01:10.920> um<00:01:11.820> personally

myself<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> assault<00:01:13.530> rifles<00:01:14.040> such<00:01:14.340> as

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
myself I like the assault rifles such as

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.219 
myself I like the assault rifles such as
the<00:01:14.850> ACR<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.930> type<00:01:16.170> 95<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.130> m16<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the ACR the type 95 the m16 and the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.590 
the ACR the type 95 the m16 and the
scar-l<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.280> H<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.820> believe<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> scar<00:01:21.450> al

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
scar-l or H I believe it's a scar al

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.630 
scar-l or H I believe it's a scar al
yeah<00:01:22.009> those<00:01:23.009> are<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> guns

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
yeah those are the guns

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.719 
yeah those are the guns
I'd<00:01:23.759> recommend<00:01:24.600> sticking<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.560> other<00:01:26.189> weapons

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
I'd recommend sticking to other weapons

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.490 
I'd recommend sticking to other weapons
that<00:01:26.759> I've<00:01:26.909> also<00:01:27.090> tried<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.960> actually

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
that I've also tried it with is actually

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.190 
that I've also tried it with is actually
the<00:01:28.740> mp7<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.689> good<00:01:31.049> because

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the mp7 but you know it's good because

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.020 
the mp7 but you know it's good because
it<00:01:31.350> has<00:01:31.500> no<00:01:31.710> recoil<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.400> got<00:01:32.549> pretty<00:01:32.759> good

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
it has no recoil it's got pretty good

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.580 
it has no recoil it's got pretty good
range<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.840> fact<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.320> still<00:01:34.380> an

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
range but the fact that it's still an

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.380

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the wall right in front of me right in

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.819 
the wall right in front of me right in
behind<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.210> little<00:01:48.470> like<00:01:49.470> where<00:01:49.680> my

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
behind this like little like where my

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.910 
behind this like little like where my
gun<00:01:50.460> barrels<00:01:50.820> hanging<00:01:51.119> over<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.810> wall<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.439> you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
gun barrels hanging over the wall as you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.520 
gun barrels hanging over the wall as you
move<00:01:53.130> left<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:53.729> right<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.840> height<00:01:55.140> will

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
move left or right the height will

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.310 
move left or right the height will
increase<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.250> decrease<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.780> very<00:01:57.990> good

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
increase and decrease so it's very good

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.170 
increase and decrease so it's very good
so<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:58.950> someone<00:01:59.399> knows<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.909> you've<00:02:00.030> been

my mistake right off the start of the
game<00:03:40.350> like<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.650> said<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.250> didn't<00:03:41.489> have

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
game like I said is that I didn't have

game like I said is that I didn't have
scavenger<00:03:42.150> Pro<00:03:42.329> so<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:42.630> ran<00:03:42.870> an<00:03:43.019> ammo<00:03:43.410> pretty

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680

scavenger Pro so I ran an ammo pretty
fast<00:03:43.980> which<00:03:44.760> like<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.420> said<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:46.680> course<00:03:46.739> it's

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
fast which like I said of course it's

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.580 
fast which like I said of course it's
easy<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.430> go<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.060> get<00:03:48.329> some<00:03:48.930> scavenger<00:03:49.440> packs

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
easy to go and get some scavenger packs

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.319 
easy to go and get some scavenger packs
but<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:50.100> don't<00:03:50.370> like<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.730> move<00:03:50.910> from<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.269> spot

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
but I don't like to move from that spot

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.150 
but I don't like to move from that spot
and<00:03:51.900> that<00:03:51.930> sounds<00:03:52.319> like<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.560> biggest<00:03:52.799> bitch

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
and that sounds like the biggest bitch

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.650 
and that sounds like the biggest bitch
thing<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.579> say<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:54.090> know<00:03:54.150> it's<00:03:54.329> true

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
why move from a spot where the kills

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.819 
why move from a spot where the kills
just<00:03:56.760> comes<00:03:57.000> sorry<00:03:57.690> constantly<00:03:58.290> coming<00:03:58.650> back

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
could even rock an overkill and have a

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.500 
could even rock an overkill and have a
second<00:04:13.350> primary<00:04:14.040> weapon<00:04:14.370> because<00:04:15.030> just<00:04:15.389> in

case you run out of ammo sometimes it's

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.649 
case you run out of ammo sometimes it's
really<00:04:17.430> risky<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.820> run<00:04:18.030> up<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.419> little

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
really risky to run up to that little

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.599 
really risky to run up to that little
hill<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.200> pick<00:04:19.380> up<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.620> scavenger<00:04:20.099> pack<00:04:20.310> which

when<00:06:04.710> I<00:06:04.740> do<00:06:04.860> that<00:06:05.190> and<00:06:05.460> I've<00:06:06.210> gotten<00:06:06.600> about<00:06:06.690> two

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
when I do that and I've gotten about two

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.200 
when I do that and I've gotten about two
or<00:06:07.410> three<00:06:07.440> Moab's<00:06:08.070> sitting<00:06:08.490> at<00:06:08.610> that<00:06:08.760> spot<00:06:09.060> but

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
or three Moab's sitting at that spot but

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.090 
or three Moab's sitting at that spot but
I<00:06:09.390> don't<00:06:09.570> normally<00:06:09.750> run<00:06:10.140> specialist<00:06:10.830> on<00:06:11.070> a

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
I don't normally run specialist on a

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.520 
I don't normally run specialist on a
mission<00:06:11.880> I<00:06:12.030> hardly<00:06:12.330> ever<00:06:12.419> run<00:06:12.840> specialist<00:06:13.410> on

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
mission I hardly ever run specialist on

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.650 
mission I hardly ever run specialist on
mission<00:06:13.890> I<00:06:14.160> actually<00:06:14.790> mostly<00:06:15.120> stick<00:06:15.419> to<00:06:15.630> a

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
mission I actually mostly stick to a

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.380 
mission I actually mostly stick to a
salt<00:06:16.350> which<00:06:16.979> like<00:06:17.190> I<00:06:17.310> said<00:06:17.550> um<00:06:17.790> that's<00:06:18.210> the

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
salt which like I said um that's the

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.180 
salt which like I said um that's the
spot<00:06:18.660> works<00:06:18.930> for<00:06:19.169> more<00:06:19.260> than<00:06:19.470> just<00:06:19.500> specialist

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
spot works for more than just specialist

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.730 
spot works for more than just specialist
it<00:06:20.340> really<00:06:20.520> does<00:06:20.700> um<00:06:21.000> you<00:06:21.810> can<00:06:21.990> use<00:06:22.110> a<00:06:22.140> salt<00:06:22.530> or

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
it really does um you can use a salt or

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.800 
it really does um you can use a salt or
support<00:06:23.160> but<00:06:23.190> I<00:06:23.340> recommend<00:06:23.790> having<00:06:23.910> scavenger

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
support but I recommend having scavenger

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.290 
support but I recommend having scavenger
or<00:06:25.050> you<00:06:25.500> know<00:06:25.620> a<00:06:25.830> weapon<00:06:26.340> with<00:06:26.430> a<00:06:26.460> lot<00:06:26.790> of<00:06:26.970> ammo

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
or you know a weapon with a lot of ammo

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.670 
or you know a weapon with a lot of ammo
so<00:06:27.540> you<00:06:27.600> don't<00:06:27.810> have<00:06:27.900> to<00:06:27.990> keep<00:06:28.200> running<00:06:28.410> back

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
so you don't have to keep running back

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.620 
so you don't have to keep running back
to<00:06:28.830> that<00:06:28.950> spot<00:06:29.250> because<00:06:29.580> sometimes<00:06:30.419> they'll

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
to that spot because sometimes they'll

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.370 
to that spot because sometimes they'll
just<00:06:30.660> ATS<00:06:31.200> at<00:06:31.380> that<00:06:31.560> Hill<00:06:31.800> if<00:06:31.979> there

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
just ATS at that Hill if there

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.500 
just ATS at that Hill if there
playing<00:06:32.710> like<00:06:32.950> even<00:06:33.610> bigger<00:06:33.820> bitches<00:06:34.270> than<00:06:34.420> I

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
playing like even bigger bitches than I

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.940 
playing like even bigger bitches than I
am<00:06:34.720> and<00:06:34.990> I'll<00:06:35.110> just<00:06:35.290> wait<00:06:35.440> for<00:06:35.620> you<00:06:35.710> to<00:06:35.800> turn

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
really no need to push them to that

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.350 
really no need to push them to that

00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.200 
it also works in domination I'm not too

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.690 
it also works in domination I'm not too
sure<00:06:59.410> on<00:06:59.440> Kill<00:06:59.770> Confirmed<00:06:59.800> I'm<00:07:00.340> pretty<00:07:00.580> sure

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:00.700 
sure on Kill Confirmed I'm pretty sure

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.670 
sure on Kill Confirmed I'm pretty sure
the<00:07:00.820> spawns<00:07:01.060> will<00:07:01.300> flip<00:07:01.570> by<00:07:01.750> the<00:07:01.840> time<00:07:02.080> you<00:07:02.500> sit

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
the spawns will flip by the time you sit

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.860 
the spawns will flip by the time you sit
there<00:07:02.890> for<00:07:03.040> too<00:07:03.160> long<00:07:03.340> but<00:07:03.670> it<00:07:04.150> works<00:07:04.420> for<00:07:04.630> dom

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:04.870 
there for too long but it works for dom

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.150 
there for too long but it works for dom
and<00:07:05.080> dentals<00:07:05.410> long<00:07:05.590> as<00:07:05.680> you<00:07:05.740> don't<00:07:05.830> push<00:07:06.040> the

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 
and dentals long as you don't push the

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.070 
and dentals long as you don't push the
spawns<00:07:06.430> too<00:07:06.640> much<00:07:06.820> because<00:07:07.090> I<00:07:07.120> even<00:07:07.510> demo<00:07:07.810> they

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
spawns too much because I even demo they

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.470 
spawns too much because I even demo they
added<00:07:08.380> a<00:07:08.500> spawn<00:07:09.280> flipping<00:07:09.760> a<00:07:09.850> little<00:07:10.150> bit<00:07:10.300> to

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:10.480 
added a spawn flipping a little bit to

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.200 
added a spawn flipping a little bit to
it<00:07:10.630> like<00:07:10.810> some<00:07:10.960> alternate<00:07:11.410> spawns<00:07:11.680> but<00:07:12.210> you

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
it like some alternate spawns but you

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.050 
it like some alternate spawns but you
know<00:07:13.300> for<00:07:13.510> the<00:07:13.570> most<00:07:13.690> part<00:07:13.870> that<00:07:14.260> spot<00:07:14.590> is

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
know for the most part that spot is

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.070 
know for the most part that spot is
extremely<00:07:16.060> powerful<00:07:16.240> probably<00:07:16.810> one<00:07:16.930> of<00:07:16.990> the
