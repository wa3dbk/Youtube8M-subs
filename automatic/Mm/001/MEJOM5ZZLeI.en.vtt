it was a really difficult decision and
it's<00:01:58.400> really<00:01:58.670> uncomfortable<00:01:59.030> because<00:01:59.509> if<00:02:00.170> you

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
it's really uncomfortable because if you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.680 
it's really uncomfortable because if you
know<00:02:00.590> me<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:00.800> know<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.250> I<00:02:01.520> really<00:02:01.820> more<00:02:02.570> than

here so it's just a wonderful time and I

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.120 
here so it's just a wonderful time and I
was<00:02:13.070> really<00:02:13.400> really<00:02:13.730> torn<00:02:14.209> as<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.690> whether<00:02:15.590> I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
was really really torn as to whether I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.850 
was really really torn as to whether I
should<00:02:16.630> go<00:02:17.630> or<00:02:17.660> whether<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.380> should<00:02:18.530> be<00:02:18.800> smart

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
should go or whether I should be smart

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.910 
should go or whether I should be smart
and<00:02:19.520> make<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.330> right<00:02:20.570> decision<00:02:21.170> or<00:02:21.350> making<00:02:21.739> a

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
and make the right decision or making a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.070 
and make the right decision or making a
decision<00:02:22.280> based<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:22.850> my<00:02:23.030> heart<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.480> emotions

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
decision based on my heart and emotions

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.070 
decision based on my heart and emotions
and<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.890> wasn't<00:02:25.190> really<00:02:25.670> easy<00:02:25.880> decision<00:02:26.870> to

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
and it wasn't really easy decision to

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.310 
and it wasn't really easy decision to
come<00:02:27.440> up<00:02:27.650> with<00:02:27.920> but<00:02:28.720> unfortunately<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.750> think<00:02:29.930> I
