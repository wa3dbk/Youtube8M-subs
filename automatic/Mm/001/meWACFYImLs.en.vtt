00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:12.990
 Today is positive and negative arithmetic 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:17.670
 The problem of having a large number of offspring is mixed 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:22.529
 We are doing the calculations say so the order of the calculation of the four arithmetic operations 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.190
 As this is important, let's copy it to the notebook. 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.850
 Calculation first of all 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:31.360
 It is a power of power that I must have 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:37.200
 Such power from it or wind called the devastation 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:45.810
格 好 中 身 こ れ こ れ こ れ 最 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 こ れ 計算 計算 こ れ 計算 こ れ 計算 計算 こ れ 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 計算 最 こ れ 最 最 最 最 最 最 最 最 最 最 最 最 最 最 最 最 最 最Please calculate this first and foremost 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:49.290
 Next is the first to calculate the multiplication and division first, and the final subtraction and subtraction 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.350
 This is the order of the powers first to Jingshan 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:57.220
 And calculate multiplication division next 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.110
 Let's calculate in this order to calculate addition subtraction last 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.230
 The 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.440
 The best -9- 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.460
 Parenthesis -3 missing -2 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:15.090
 There is no more leaving in that there is a formula of Masuko 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.160
 What is the number one dressed like this because I'm some dressed has no need looking of contents is especially calculated here in 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.130
 It's just that there is nothing 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.680
 Multiplication division 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:26.710
 It is here to say where you are in the best place to calculate the 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.600
 Here is the multiplication- 3-2 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:35.350
 Please calculate this first, not in order from the left side 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.120
 If you calculate multiplication division so first 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:45.510
 -9 is just subtraction 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:49.080
 It will be in the negative to negative and positive 6 as it is and in such -22 multiplying -3 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:55.230
 Than there is only addition and subtraction is after 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:58.980
 This is-9-6 and the answer calculated is minus- 15 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:05.210
 This is the coolest answer This order 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:09.200
 Please do arithmetic calculation in this order of this parenthesis in parentheses one parenthesis 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.800
 In the No. 2 dressed - 3 multiplied by -20 4 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.160
 There is parenthesis- 3-2 power 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:23.629
 First was in the Rui on or brackets 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:25.080
 So do try to go and Rui on is in the No. 2 dress is here and here to there and I brother more than either 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:31.980
 It is a place, but here 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:38.190
 Is here more than on the outside of the dress was a fly in the immediate vicinity's not even about anything looking 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:44.070
 The difference in this calculation was in the class before, so I will easily go over here , but 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.130
 If it is calculated paying attention to the difference of whether it is a square of only two figures including numbers somehow 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.730
 I will 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:53.100
 Since the above only to number more than those who -3 of looking is not with negative san as it is 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.750
 Above 9 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:03.590
 Here are two articles, including E- minus in parentheses 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:08.599
 That will be + 9 because the -3 multiplied by -3 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:13.230
 It does not change at all after 4 times 4 subtraction to put on 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:17.129
 Only the part of the shape was calculated 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.150
 Doing so there is a multiplication in here and take a look at the formula 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:24.349
 If you calculate this multiplication first because it is multiplication 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.450
 Because it is a choice of -9 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:30.569
 -36 is and - 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.220
 Since the brackets + steep - 9 and made to 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:37.120
 -36 -9 is negative 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:42.960
 45 This is the answer to the second bracket 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.990
 Previously addition subtraction calculation to the next multiplication division last dressed I min or more is good 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.310
 The coolest 3rd style is 82 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:56.710
 It is confusing because it is 20 years 22 fair game, but first, 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:04:02.680
 There is no more than that, and here you have to calculate in parentheses 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:07.420
 0.6 -1.5 Let's calculate this as a good content first 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:11.260
 Then it will be this 1 + will not change 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:16.700
 Then it hangs -0.1 does not change here either 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:21.290
 If this content alone is calculated here , 0.6-1.5 is minus 0 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:24.830
 a I hurry I guess I calculated only in parentheses 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:30.170
 Still we are here that can be calculated in the parentheses in 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:33.230
 1 +-0.9 I can not calculate here 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.180
 First, remove the individual dressed 1- 0.9 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.330
 It is easy to calculate with 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.220
 Yes 1 compound 0.9 is 0.1 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:49.150
 Kake -0.1 This is always as it is 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:55.030
 So minus 0.1 multiplied to 0.1 calculate this 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:05:00.490
 Minus 0.01 This is the good 3rd answer 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.400
 It is good If there is a place that can be calculated by the contents of the cool first calculate from there 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.699
 a 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.950
 Please enter and it will be the last if it is surrounded 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:15.010
 Minute there with the contents of more than fair game, but this power is there full 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:19.690
 At first, I will start with the calculation of the power enclosed in red from k here 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:25.210
 You do not come and yes so-2 Article 3 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:27.220
 There is calling on the outside of the dress, but to say that -2 applied to the minus applied to the minus 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.940
 It is -8 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:34.210
 It is Article 3-2 9 and subtraction 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:38.740
 4 legal subtraction is 16 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:44.560
 Article after will be in such form as Fu of 25 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:45.220
 Look this out more than is no longer following the Na whether there is a place that can contents calculation of looking 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.210
 Go 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:53.690
 I can not calculate here, but 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:57.050
 Since this subtraction can be calculated, calculating the best content of this cow locker 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:02.650
 -8 as it is also subtraction remains the 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:08.949
 It will be -32 and to calculate the individual contents 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:12.039
 Since it is only subtraction after that, it changes to plus because it is minus 9 brackets and minus 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:15.070
 About -8 + 32 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:21.509
 The answer is 24 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:21.509
 Are you good? Calculate four rules in this order
