the clanging monkey in me so I didn't

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.590 
the clanging monkey in me so I didn't
know<00:00:50.679> of<00:00:50.829> course<00:00:51.069> what<00:00:51.460> would<00:00:51.909> happen<00:00:52.299> with<00:00:52.420> it

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
but you know I certainly felt I was

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.949 
but you know I certainly felt I was
going<00:00:55.989> to<00:00:56.170> act<00:00:56.469> somewhere<00:00:57.249> of<00:00:57.959> doing

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
essentially what it is the technical

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.840 
essentially what it is the technical
aspect<00:01:31.929> of<00:01:32.109> it<00:01:32.259> makes<00:01:32.469> it<00:01:32.649> different<00:01:33.189> that

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
spandex the spandex like material but

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.240 
spandex the spandex like material but
it's<00:01:38.679> a<00:01:38.770> very<00:01:39.149> tight<00:01:40.149> fitting<00:01:40.780> outfit<00:01:41.469> so<00:01:41.740> you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
it's a very tight fitting outfit so you

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.480 
it's a very tight fitting outfit so you
know<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.210> left<00:01:43.869> nothing<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.439> imagination

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
know the left nothing to the imagination

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.980 
know the left nothing to the imagination
let's<00:01:45.490> put<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.789> that<00:01:45.820> way<00:01:45.969> and<00:01:46.329> you<00:01:46.630> had<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.899> be

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
let's put it that way and you had to be

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.539 
let's put it that way and you had to be
careful<00:01:48.359> but<00:01:49.359> we<00:01:49.539> had<00:01:49.749> that<00:01:50.649> spandex<00:01:51.189> on<00:01:51.340> and

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
careful but we had that spandex on and

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.520 
careful but we had that spandex on and
even<00:01:51.729> our<00:01:51.939> feet<00:01:52.450> were<00:01:52.659> covered<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.229> then

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
even our feet were covered and then

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.700 
even our feet were covered and then
basically<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.399> have<00:01:54.729> little<00:01:55.210> tiny<00:01:55.710> almost

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
basically you have little tiny almost

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.499 
basically you have little tiny almost
look<00:01:57.130> like<00:01:57.159> metallic<00:01:57.880> but<00:01:58.179> they're<00:01:58.329> just

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
look like metallic but they're just

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.559 
look like metallic but they're just
reflective<00:01:59.259> tape<00:01:59.560> balls<00:02:00.249> that<00:02:00.969> cover<00:02:01.329> your

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
reflective tape balls that cover your

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.929 
reflective tape balls that cover your
entire<00:02:01.689> body<00:02:02.259> so<00:02:02.799> those<00:02:03.189> are<00:02:03.369> basically<00:02:03.579> the

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
entire body so those are basically the

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.239 
entire body so those are basically the
markers<00:02:04.539> that<00:02:04.749> the<00:02:05.140> cameras<00:02:05.649> in<00:02:05.859> the<00:02:05.979> studio

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:06.249 
markers that the cameras in the studio

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:09.060 
markers that the cameras in the studio
are<00:02:06.759> capturing<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.539> motion<00:02:07.960> of<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:08.890> that's

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
are capturing the motion of so that's

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.640 
are capturing the motion of so that's

is a big boost um it's it's been it

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.340

got this everything that has been coming

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.030 
got this everything that has been coming
my<00:04:40.310> way<00:04:40.340> has<00:04:40.940> just<00:04:40.970> been<00:04:41.360> I<00:04:41.480> think<00:04:41.780> through<00:04:42.110> you

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
my way has just been I think through you

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.540 
my way has just been I think through you
know<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:44.300> manager<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.110> all<00:04:45.440> of<00:04:45.860> that<00:04:45.890> there

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
know the manager and all of that there

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.850 
know the manager and all of that there
hasn't<00:04:46.760> been<00:04:46.970> a<00:04:47.180> direct<00:04:47.690> correlation<00:04:48.230> yet

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
hasn't been a direct correlation yet

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.970 
hasn't been a direct correlation yet
between<00:04:49.070> it<00:04:49.400> I<00:04:49.550> think<00:04:50.270> it's<00:04:50.650> simply<00:04:51.650> because

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
between it I think it's simply because

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.430 
between it I think it's simply because
it<00:04:52.430> might<00:04:52.700> it's<00:04:53.690> not<00:04:53.870> necessarily

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
it might it's not necessarily

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.290 
it might it's not necessarily
translating<00:04:55.130> as<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.280> performance<00:04:55.940> there<00:04:56.150> might

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
translating as a performance there might

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.690 
translating as a performance there might
be<00:04:56.330> certain<00:04:56.690> directors<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:58.460> know<00:04:58.550> the

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
be certain directors you know the

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.910 
be certain directors you know the
Aronofsky's<00:04:59.150> or<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.690> gamble<00:04:59.870> de<00:05:00.140> toros<00:05:00.590> or

that bridge hasn't been crossed really

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.920 
that bridge hasn't been crossed really
or<00:05:17.480> those<00:05:17.630> dots<00:05:17.930> haven't<00:05:18.320> been<00:05:18.470> connected<00:05:18.800> so

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
people say who knows we might be the

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.800 
people say who knows we might be the
bridge<00:05:42.200> for<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.560> next<00:05:42.800> generation<00:05:43.400> I<00:05:43.810> don't

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
bridge for the next generation I don't

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.750 
bridge for the next generation I don't
know<00:05:44.870> I<00:05:44.900> mean<00:05:45.110> Willem<00:05:45.410> Dafoe<00:05:45.740> again<00:05:46.370> has<00:05:46.550> sort

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
know I mean Willem Dafoe again has sort

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.120 
know I mean Willem Dafoe again has sort
of<00:05:46.820> he's<00:05:47.090> a<00:05:47.120> you<00:05:47.450> know<00:05:47.570> a<00:05:47.810> big<00:05:48.350> actor<00:05:48.800> saying

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
of he's a you know a big actor saying

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.320 
of he's a you know a big actor saying
it's<00:05:49.310> just<00:05:49.580> another<00:05:49.990> medium<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.200> act<00:05:51.380> in<00:05:51.710> and

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
it's just another medium to act in and

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.700 
it's just another medium to act in and
so<00:05:53.330> I<00:05:53.360> don't<00:05:53.630> know<00:05:53.750> if<00:05:53.840> we'll<00:05:54.050> be<00:05:54.230> that<00:05:54.470> bridge

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
so I don't know if we'll be that bridge

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.560 
so I don't know if we'll be that bridge
or<00:05:55.010> if<00:05:55.250> will<00:05:55.460> be<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.730> bridge<00:05:55.940> for<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.240> next

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
or if will be the bridge for the next

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.870 
or if will be the bridge for the next
generation<00:05:57.140> that<00:05:57.350> just<00:05:57.770> again<00:05:58.160> consider<00:05:58.730> it

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
generation that just again consider it

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.150 
generation that just again consider it
another<00:05:59.210> form<00:05:59.660> of<00:05:59.870> acting<00:06:00.320> I<00:06:00.500> don't<00:06:00.860> know<00:06:00.980> but
