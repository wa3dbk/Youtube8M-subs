the<00:00:15.540> use<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.139> tesseracts<00:00:16.890> both<00:00:17.220> liquid<00:00:17.789> item

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
the use of tesseracts both liquid item

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.439 
the use of tesseracts both liquid item
and<00:00:18.539> energy<00:00:19.640> now<00:00:20.640> I've<00:00:20.850> already<00:00:21.029> got<00:00:21.180> this

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
and energy now I've already got this

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.450 
and energy now I've already got this
lava<00:00:21.660> set<00:00:21.990> up<00:00:22.140> from<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> previous<00:00:22.769> video<00:00:23.100> you

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
lava set up from a previous video you

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.089 
lava set up from a previous video you
probably<00:00:23.789> have<00:00:23.970> seen<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.359> if<00:00:25.050> not<00:00:25.350> go<00:00:25.740> watch<00:00:25.890> it

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
probably have seen it if not go watch it

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.000 
probably have seen it if not go watch it
it's<00:00:26.250> cool<00:00:27.050> but<00:00:28.050> because<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.590> setup<00:00:28.769> I'm

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
it's cool but because it's setup I'm

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.929 
it's cool but because it's setup I'm
going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.279> using<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.730> for<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
going to be using this for the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.640 
going to be using this for the
demonstration<00:00:30.570> purposes<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> liquid

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
demonstration purposes for the liquid

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.479 
demonstration purposes for the liquid
tesseract<00:00:33.140> tesseracts<00:00:34.140> firstly<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:35.190> quite

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
tesseract tesseracts firstly have quite

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.819 
tesseract tesseracts firstly have quite
a<00:00:35.520> complicated<00:00:36.210> GUI<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:37.530> once<00:00:37.710> you

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
a complicated GUI but once you

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.290 
a complicated GUI but once you
understand<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.550> nice<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.940> simple<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
understand it it's nice and simple I

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.819 
understand it it's nice and simple I
will<00:00:39.360> explain<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.930> all<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
will explain it all to you in just a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.610 
will explain it all to you in just a
moment<00:00:40.950> now<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.480> pick<00:00:42.660> them<00:00:42.809> up<00:00:42.930> with

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
moment now you can pick them up with

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.310 
moment now you can pick them up with
pickaxe<00:00:44.340> without<00:00:45.180> doing<00:00:45.420> any<00:00:45.570> damage<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.989> them

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
pickaxe without doing any damage to them

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.920 
pickaxe without doing any damage to them
it<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.770> takes<00:00:47.190> time<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.149> much<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it just takes time so much like the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.930 
it just takes time so much like the
liquid<00:00:49.500> X<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> energy<00:00:50.399> conduit<00:00:50.730> from

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
liquid X and the energy conduit from

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000 
liquid X and the energy conduit from
thermal<00:00:51.239> expansion<00:00:51.809> they're<00:00:52.320> quite<00:00:52.590> robust

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
thermal expansion they're quite robust

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.279 
thermal expansion they're quite robust
or<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.210> right-click<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.260> a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
or you can just right-click with a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.580 
or you can just right-click with a
crescent<00:00:55.559> hammer<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:56.100> an<00:00:56.280> omni<00:00:56.579> tool<00:00:57.530> okay<00:00:58.530> so

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
crescent hammer or an omni tool okay so

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.349 
crescent hammer or an omni tool okay so
if<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:58.859> pop<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> liquid<00:00:59.399> test<00:00:59.609> rack<00:00:59.789> down<00:01:00.000> here

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
if we pop a liquid test rack down here

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.349 
if we pop a liquid test rack down here
now<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.440> lava<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:02.070> already<00:01:02.460> set<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.760> pump<00:01:03.120> out

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
now this lava is already set to pump out

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.690 
now this lava is already set to pump out
so<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.530> could<00:01:04.739> argue<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.339> pumping

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
so you could argue that it's pumping

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.179 
so you could argue that it's pumping
into<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> tesseract<00:01:06.479> already<00:01:06.950> but<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.040> need

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
into the tesseract already but we need

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.969 
into the tesseract already but we need
to<00:01:08.310> set<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.610> tesseract<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.439> now<00:01:10.439> if<00:01:10.680> you're

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to set this tesseract up now if you're

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.100 
to set this tesseract up now if you're
in<00:01:11.159> multiplayer<00:01:11.700> over<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> right

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
in multiplayer over here on the right

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.870 
in multiplayer over here on the right
you'll<00:01:13.350> want<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> change<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.460> owner<00:01:15.270> only

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
you'll want to change this to owner only

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.219 
you'll want to change this to owner only
otherwise<00:01:17.880> people<00:01:18.240> will<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.540> leeching<00:01:18.900> off<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
otherwise people will be leeching off of

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.740 
otherwise people will be leeching off of
your<00:01:19.500> supplies<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.850> course<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.390> you've<00:01:21.540> got<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
your supplies of course if you've got a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.560 
your supplies of course if you've got a
public<00:01:22.380> lava<00:01:23.009> pump<00:01:23.400> setup<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> nether<00:01:24.270> or

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
in a mist craft age leave it to public

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.120 
in a mist craft age leave it to public
access<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.630> single<00:01:28.320> player<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.710> really<00:01:29.009> not

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
access in single player it's really not

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.219 
access in single player it's really not
important<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.700> we'll<00:01:29.850> leave<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
important so we'll leave it to that and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.770 
important so we'll leave it to that and
on<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.860> tab<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.850> adjust<00:01:32.970> whether<00:01:33.570> it's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
on this tab you can adjust whether it's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.550 
on this tab you can adjust whether it's
send<00:01:34.290> receive<00:01:34.680> or<00:01:35.220> both<00:01:35.960> okay<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.380> one

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
send receive or both okay but this one

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.050 
send receive or both okay but this one
we<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.890> want<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.159> send<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.759> should<00:01:38.939> leave

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
we just want to send so we should leave

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.899 
we just want to send so we should leave
it<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.619> now<00:01:40.619> if<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:40.860> pick<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> frequency

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
it like that now if we pick a frequency

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.480 
it like that now if we pick a frequency
we'll<00:01:42.479> go<00:01:42.659> for<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.100> we'll<00:01:44.250> call<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
we'll go for one and then we'll call the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.800 
we'll go for one and then we'll call the
frequency<00:01:45.350> lava<00:01:46.790> now<00:01:47.790> we'll<00:01:48.360> save<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
frequency lava now we'll save the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.899 
frequency lava now we'll save the
frequency<00:01:49.470> which<00:01:50.100> saves<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
frequency which saves it in the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.300 
frequency which saves it in the
frequency<00:01:51.540> list<00:01:51.570> down<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:53.040> click

frequency list down here and then click

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.130 
frequency list down here and then click
set<00:01:53.640> frequency<00:01:53.939> now<00:01:54.689> you'll<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:54.990> it's

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
set frequency now you'll see it's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.450 
set frequency now you'll see it's
highlighted<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.890> means<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.280> this

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
highlighted that means that this

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.550 
highlighted that means that this
tesseract<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.540> now<00:01:57.659> operating<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.350> this

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
tesseract is now operating on this

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.709 
tesseract is now operating on this
frequency

so<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.899> should<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.560> able<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.100> pump<00:02:02.399> love<00:02:02.700> it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
so it should be able to pump love it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.569 
so it should be able to pump love it
quite<00:02:03.360> easily<00:02:03.649> now<00:02:04.649> if<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:04.890> put<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> second

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
quite easily now if we put a second

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.370 
quite easily now if we put a second
liquid<00:02:05.759> tester

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
liquid tester

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.979 
liquid tester
down<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:07.790> we<00:02:08.000> were<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.270> set<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:08.599> up<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.750> the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
down and we were to set it up to the

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.990 
down and we were to set it up to the
same<00:02:09.200> frequency<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:09.979> quite<00:02:10.220> simple<00:02:10.580> public

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
same frequency is quite simple public

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.540 
same frequency is quite simple public
access<00:02:11.620> but<00:02:12.620> we<00:02:12.709> do<00:02:12.860> with<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.069> want<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.340> one

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
access but we do with the want this one

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.900 
access but we do with the want this one
on<00:02:13.670> receive<00:02:14.060> only<00:02:14.890> then<00:02:15.890> if<00:02:16.010> we<00:02:16.160> choose<00:02:16.430> out<00:02:16.760> of

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
on receive only then if we choose out of

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.759 
on receive only then if we choose out of
our<00:02:17.060> frequency<00:02:17.569> list<00:02:17.750> therefore<00:02:18.170> lava<00:02:18.440> and

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
our frequency list therefore lava and

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.670 
our frequency list therefore lava and
then<00:02:19.280> set<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.700> frequency<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:21.170> will<00:02:21.349> now<00:02:21.470> be

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
then set the frequency that will now be

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.320 
then set the frequency that will now be
receiving<00:02:22.220> lava<00:02:22.459> obviously<00:02:23.120> it's<00:02:23.209> got

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
receiving lava obviously it's got

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.150 
receiving lava obviously it's got
nowhere<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.569> go<00:02:23.660> just<00:02:24.200> yet<00:02:24.410> but<00:02:24.620> we<00:02:24.769> can<00:02:24.890> soon

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
nowhere to go just yet but we can soon

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.309 
nowhere to go just yet but we can soon
fix<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.550> just<00:02:26.390> by<00:02:26.510> popping<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.900> liquid<00:02:27.200> duct

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
fix that just by popping a liquid duct

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.740 
fix that just by popping a liquid duct
down<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.830> there<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.640> go<00:02:28.819> it's<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.150> simple

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
down and there you go it's that simple

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.490 
down and there you go it's that simple
now<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.680> tesseracts<00:02:31.160> will<00:02:31.340> pump<00:02:31.640> between

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
now the tesseracts will pump between

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500 
now the tesseracts will pump between
dimensions<00:02:33.500> world<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.310> miss<00:02:34.550> stages<00:02:35.000> other

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
dimensions world so miss stages other

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.780 
dimensions world so miss stages other
planets<00:02:36.080> if<00:02:36.319> you<00:02:36.440> fancy<00:02:36.830> pumping<00:02:37.250> stuff<00:02:37.489> up<00:02:37.640> to

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
planets if you fancy pumping stuff up to

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.839 
planets if you fancy pumping stuff up to
the<00:02:37.910> moon<00:02:38.090> or<00:02:38.300> into<00:02:39.140> your<00:02:39.260> space<00:02:39.500> station<00:02:39.849> they

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
the moon or into your space station they

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.259 
the moon or into your space station they
are<00:02:40.910> awesome<00:02:41.799> inventions<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.849> that's<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
are awesome inventions and that's the

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.210 
are awesome inventions and that's the
liquid<00:02:44.450> tesseract<00:02:45.049> we'll<00:02:45.470> move<00:02:45.590> on<00:02:45.799> now<00:02:46.010> and

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
liquid tesseract we'll move on now and

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.720 
liquid tesseract we'll move on now and
do<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.819> other<00:02:46.940> two<00:02:47.860> okay<00:02:48.890> here's<00:02:49.220> here

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
do the other two okay here's here

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.820 
do the other two okay here's here
setting<00:02:50.060> up<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.269> energy<00:02:50.660> tesseract<00:02:51.200> which

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
setting up the energy tesseract which

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.380 
setting up the energy tesseract which
pop<00:02:52.069> it<00:02:52.220> down<00:02:52.370> on<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.610> end<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.030> redstone

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
pop it down on the end of this redstone

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.960 
pop it down on the end of this redstone
conduit<00:02:53.930> where<00:02:54.410> my<00:02:54.620> energy<00:02:55.160> cells<00:02:55.580> are<00:02:55.760> at<00:02:55.849> the

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
conduit where my energy cells are at the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.420 
conduit where my energy cells are at the
end<00:02:56.090> there<00:02:56.299> now<00:02:57.200> this<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.680> obviously<00:02:58.190> this<00:02:58.250> is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
end there now this is obviously this is

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.400 
end there now this is obviously this is
the<00:02:58.519> energy<00:02:58.760> frequency<00:02:59.569> so<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.900> won't<00:03:00.079> show<00:03:00.260> up

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
the energy frequency so it won't show up

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.410 
the energy frequency so it won't show up
the<00:03:00.530> lava<00:03:00.739> ones<00:03:01.040> inside<00:03:01.459> it<00:03:01.670> nor<00:03:02.000> will<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.239> show

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
the lava ones inside it nor will it show

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.630 
the lava ones inside it nor will it show
up<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.599> ones<00:03:02.780> from<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.110> item<00:03:03.500> tesseract<00:03:03.920> so

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
up the ones from the item tesseract so

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.220 
up the ones from the item tesseract so
we'll<00:03:04.790> have<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.030> create<00:03:05.239> new<00:03:05.450> frequencies<00:03:06.049> but

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
we'll have to create new frequencies but

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.350 
we'll have to create new frequencies but
we'll<00:03:06.410> go<00:03:06.590> for<00:03:06.829> three<00:03:07.610> this<00:03:07.790> time<00:03:07.849> just

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
we'll go for three this time just

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.190 
we'll go for three this time just
because<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:09.260> we<00:03:09.380> will<00:03:09.500> call<00:03:09.709> this<00:03:09.890> one<00:03:10.160> power

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
because and we will call this one power

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.400 
because and we will call this one power
and<00:03:12.200> set<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.620> frequency<00:03:12.829> and<00:03:13.519> save<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:15.260> it's

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
and set the frequency and save so it's

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.650 
and set the frequency and save so it's
in<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.590> frequency<00:03:16.100> list<00:03:16.180> now<00:03:17.180> we'll<00:03:17.420> leave<00:03:17.540> it

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
in the frequency list now we'll leave it

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.530 
in the frequency list now we'll leave it
public<00:03:17.989> access<00:03:18.380> for<00:03:18.440> now<00:03:19.090> but<00:03:20.090> we<00:03:20.209> do<00:03:20.329> want<00:03:20.510> to

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
public access for now but we do want to

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.590 
public access for now but we do want to
make<00:03:20.690> sure<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.959> it's<00:03:21.109> send<00:03:21.500> only<00:03:22.450> escape<00:03:23.450> to

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
make sure that it's send only escape to

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.900 
make sure that it's send only escape to
come<00:03:23.780> out<00:03:23.900> that<00:03:24.079> GUI<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:24.920> now<00:03:25.160> we're<00:03:25.549> able<00:03:25.700> to

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
come out that GUI so now we're able to

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.490 
come out that GUI so now we're able to
teleport<00:03:26.150> our<00:03:26.480> power<00:03:26.750> anywhere<00:03:27.290> we<00:03:27.470> like

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
teleport our power anywhere we like

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.280 
teleport our power anywhere we like
between<00:03:28.010> dimensions<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:28.910> worlds<00:03:29.269> which<00:03:30.139> is

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
between dimensions and worlds which is

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.770 
between dimensions and worlds which is
fantastic<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.670> we<00:03:31.730> shall<00:03:32.180> demonstrate<00:03:32.359> that

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
fantastic and we shall demonstrate that

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.099 
fantastic and we shall demonstrate that
in<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:32.959> moment<00:03:33.819> also<00:03:34.819> we<00:03:35.420> needed<00:03:35.720> we<00:03:35.959> have<00:03:36.079> a

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
in the moment also we needed we have a

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.840 
in the moment also we needed we have a
diamond<00:03:36.410> chest<00:03:36.769> here<00:03:37.010> which<00:03:37.160> is<00:03:37.400> going<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:37.730> be

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
diamond chest here which is going to be

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.690 
diamond chest here which is going to be
our<00:03:38.120> pretend<00:03:38.510> sorting<00:03:39.019> system<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:40.400> we<00:03:40.519> want

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
our pretend sorting system and we want

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.640 
our pretend sorting system and we want
to<00:03:40.790> put<00:03:40.910> an<00:03:41.000> item<00:03:41.150> tesseract<00:03:41.840> next<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.319> it<00:03:42.440> now

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
to put an item tesseract next to it now

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.410 
to put an item tesseract next to it now
the<00:03:42.950> item<00:03:43.130> tests<00:03:43.639> are<00:03:43.730> acts<00:03:43.850> can<00:03:44.150> pump

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
the item tests are acts can pump

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.509 
the item tests are acts can pump
straight<00:03:44.780> into<00:03:45.049> an<00:03:45.170> inventory<00:03:45.440> which<00:03:46.370> is

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
straight into an inventory which is

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.340 
straight into an inventory which is
which<00:03:46.790> is<00:03:46.819> nice<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.299> simple<00:03:47.480> or<00:03:47.930> they<00:03:48.200> also

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
which is nice and simple or they also

which is nice and simple or they also
interact<00:03:48.799> with<00:03:48.980> BuildCraft<00:03:49.430> pipes<00:03:49.819> if<00:03:50.090> needs

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
interact with BuildCraft pipes if needs

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:50.910 
interact with BuildCraft pipes if needs
be

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
be

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.770 
be
again<00:03:51.920> there's<00:03:52.400> no<00:03:52.609> frequency<00:03:53.239> set<00:03:53.540> for<00:03:53.720> the

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
again there's no frequency set for the

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.170 
again there's no frequency set for the
items<00:03:54.170> yet<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.040> have<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.400> make<00:03:55.579> one<00:03:55.609> up<00:03:55.910> we'll

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
items yet so I have to make one up we'll

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.809 
items yet so I have to make one up we'll
call<00:03:56.359> this<00:03:56.510> one<00:03:56.569> six<00:03:57.109> why<00:03:57.440> not<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:58.430> we'll<00:03:58.670> call

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
call this one six why not and we'll call

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:05.379 
call this one six why not and we'll call
this<00:03:59.030> one<00:03:59.530> items<00:04:00.530> in<00:04:03.130> save<00:04:04.130> frequency<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:04.970> set

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
this one items in save frequency and set

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.180 
this one items in save frequency and set
it<00:04:05.599> so<00:04:06.290> it's<00:04:06.440> now<00:04:06.590> working<00:04:07.069> again

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
it so it's now working again

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.470 
it so it's now working again
and<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:08.460> want<00:04:08.640> this<00:04:08.760> one<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.150> be<00:04:09.180> receive<00:04:09.780> only

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
and we want this one to be receive only

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.450 
and we want this one to be receive only
so<00:04:12.480> now<00:04:12.810> we<00:04:12.870> have<00:04:13.140> our<00:04:13.380> pretend<00:04:13.800> sorting<00:04:14.280> room

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
so now we have our pretend sorting room

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.310 
so now we have our pretend sorting room
and<00:04:14.700> our<00:04:14.880> pretend<00:04:15.240> power<00:04:15.540> room<00:04:15.780> what<00:04:16.170> we're

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
and our pretend power room what we're

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.830 
and our pretend power room what we're
going<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.530> do<00:04:16.709> power<00:04:17.670> a<00:04:17.820> quarry<00:04:18.180> obviously

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
going to do power a quarry obviously

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.009 
going to do power a quarry obviously
nice<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.830> simple<00:04:20.390> pop<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.540> quarry<00:04:21.780> down

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
nice and simple pop the quarry down

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.620 
nice and simple pop the quarry down
wherever<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:22.680> want<00:04:22.890> any<00:04:23.130> age<00:04:23.550> or<00:04:24.030> dimension

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
wherever you want any age or dimension

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.930 
wherever you want any age or dimension
and<00:04:24.840> you'll<00:04:25.560> be<00:04:25.650> wanting<00:04:25.980> the<00:04:26.070> item<00:04:26.460> tesseract

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
and you'll be wanting the item tesseract

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.730 
and you'll be wanting the item tesseract
it<00:04:27.240> doesn't<00:04:27.540> matter<00:04:27.690> which<00:04:27.840> side<00:04:27.870> it<00:04:28.290> goes<00:04:28.470> on

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
it doesn't matter which side it goes on

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.470 
it doesn't matter which side it goes on
its<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.520> quarry<00:04:29.760> will<00:04:29.910> always<00:04:30.090> pump<00:04:30.330> out

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
its the quarry will always pump out

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.500 
its the quarry will always pump out
either<00:04:30.690> into<00:04:30.990> a<00:04:31.020> pipe<00:04:31.290> on<00:04:31.500> any<00:04:31.920> side<00:04:32.220> or<00:04:32.550> in

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
either into a pipe on any side or in

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.850 
either into a pipe on any side or in
this<00:04:33.600> case<00:04:33.810> we've<00:04:34.020> popped<00:04:34.200> it<00:04:34.290> on<00:04:34.350> top<00:04:34.590> just

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
this case we've popped it on top just

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.580 
this case we've popped it on top just
because<00:04:35.150> we<00:04:36.150> want<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.480> choose<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.750> items<00:04:37.260> in

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
because we want to choose the items in

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.440 
because we want to choose the items in
that<00:04:37.950> we've<00:04:38.070> got<00:04:38.100> saved<00:04:38.580> in<00:04:38.760> our<00:04:38.880> frequency

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
that we've got saved in our frequency

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.740 
that we've got saved in our frequency
list<00:04:39.660> and<00:04:40.650> we'll<00:04:40.770> set<00:04:40.980> to<00:04:41.100> that<00:04:41.220> frequency

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
list and we'll set to that frequency

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.010 
list and we'll set to that frequency
also<00:04:42.750> make<00:04:42.930> sure<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.140> this<00:04:43.380> is<00:04:43.530> on<00:04:43.560> send<00:04:44.040> only

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
also make sure that this is on send only

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.830 
also make sure that this is on send only
okay<00:04:46.020> so<00:04:46.920> now<00:04:47.040> our<00:04:47.190> quarry<00:04:47.490> will<00:04:47.970> teleport<00:04:48.480> all

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
okay so now our quarry will teleport all

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.710 
okay so now our quarry will teleport all
items<00:04:49.470> straight<00:04:50.190> into<00:04:50.520> that<00:04:50.670> tesseract<00:04:51.510> over

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
items straight into that tesseract over

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.430 
items straight into that tesseract over
there<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:52.050> into<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.380> chest<00:04:52.650> we<00:04:53.640> need<00:04:53.790> power

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
there and into the chest we need power

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.440 
there and into the chest we need power
it's<00:04:55.440> that<00:04:55.590> simple<00:04:55.860> again<00:04:56.550> select<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.150> same

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
it's that simple again select the same

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.140 
it's that simple again select the same
frequency<00:04:58.110> set<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.040> frequency<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.930> it's<00:05:00.930> off

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
frequency set the frequency and it's off

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.570 
frequency set the frequency and it's off
so<00:05:03.150> hopefully<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:03.810> can<00:05:03.840> see<00:05:04.070> what<00:05:05.070> benefits

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
so hopefully you can see what benefits

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.260 
so hopefully you can see what benefits
the<00:05:05.760> tesseracts<00:05:06.300> are<00:05:06.450> to<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:06.960> um<00:05:08.000> yeah<00:05:09.000> have

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
the tesseracts are to you um yeah have

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.960 
the tesseracts are to you um yeah have
fun<00:05:09.540> with<00:05:09.660> them<00:05:09.780> guys
