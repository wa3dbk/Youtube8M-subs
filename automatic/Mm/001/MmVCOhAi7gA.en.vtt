list and I just think he's so underrated
well<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.399> think<00:00:35.640> I'd<00:00:35.940> put<00:00:36.149> him<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.390> near<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
well I think I'd put him at near the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.530 
well I think I'd put him at near the
near<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> ANA<00:00:37.980> he's<00:00:38.280> not<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> worst<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:39.270> he's

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
near the ANA he's not the worst but he's

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.990 
near the ANA he's not the worst but he's
definitely<00:00:39.690> lower<00:00:40.110> third<00:00:40.440> um<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.610> yeah<00:00:41.790> yeah

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
definitely lower third um but yeah yeah
