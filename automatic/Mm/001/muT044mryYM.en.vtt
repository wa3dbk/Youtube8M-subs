 first of all I used one 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.350
 simple toolbox 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.880
 because it is very durable it is much more 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.900
 economic is much cheaper 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.330
 let's start 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.330
 I in my time box going 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:50.829
 time here I keep the jokers I keep of 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:54.989
 usually leads to drop that these 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:01:00.370

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:12.900

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:27.430
 artificial is made with a stopper one after 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:30.130
 of beer and leads is a TV forest 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.430
 that came to me very very simple and 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.909
 I did well and this is for the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.909
 trolling 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:54.180
 then then here I keep some carabiners of 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:58.230
 reserve of various sizes and then in the other 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:05.400
 compartments note ngo tengo of the leads 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:11.720
 smaller for the fixed eaves so 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:17.990
 open the cassette here or too simple 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:33.090
 I also believe in the stars they serve 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:39.500
 how well do you know about night fishing for 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:46.170
 show the float and then I think 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:48.000
 and then I call in the distress of 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.940

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:01.470
 First you stretch the waffles for 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:03:06.209
 reel then I keep the line of 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:11.150
 rancia that it is not that it is discreet that me 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:17.280
 I've caught it and it's very durable 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:25.920
 being able to time the walls for the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:30.420
 reel then see some carabiners from 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.660
