00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
is when players have no respect for the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.200 
is when players have no respect for the
well-being<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.920> other<00:01:53.040> players<00:01:53.460> what<00:01:54.119> do

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.289 
like and Omnicom sue Albert Haynesworth
and<00:01:58.380> Dante<00:01:58.740> Robinson<00:01:58.979> who<00:01:59.490> played<00:01:59.820> very

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
and Dante Robinson who played very

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.060 
and Dante Robinson who played very
different<00:02:00.720> from<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.960> average<00:02:01.079> NFL<00:02:01.530> player

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
different from the average NFL player

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.700 
different from the average NFL player
which<00:02:02.729> puts<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.329> other<00:02:03.540> player<00:02:03.960> safety<00:02:04.409> at

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
which puts the other player safety at

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.370 
which puts the other player safety at
risk<00:02:05.149> now<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.180> kind<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.659> know<00:02:06.810> how<00:02:06.960> these<00:02:07.110> NFL
