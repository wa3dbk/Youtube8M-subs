coverage<00:01:46.190> this<00:01:46.340> was<00:01:46.520> my<00:01:46.670> fault<00:01:46.940> I<00:01:46.970> don't<00:01:47.119> know

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
coverage this was my fault I don't know

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.910 
coverage this was my fault I don't know
what<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.390> did<00:01:47.630> I<00:01:47.810> think<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.140> moved<00:01:48.350> Joseph<00:01:48.710> out<00:01:48.830> of

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
what I did I think I moved Joseph out of

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.440 
what I did I think I moved Joseph out of
position<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.430> win<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.119> blow<00:01:50.270> in<00:01:50.390> the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
position and win the blow in the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.260 
position and win the blow in the
coverage<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:50.810> that<00:01:51.770> kind<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.010> sucked<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:52.820> here

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
coverage so that kind of sucked but here

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.520 
coverage so that kind of sucked but here
we<00:01:53.330> go<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:53.600> is<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.840> play<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.049> think<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.439> is

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
we go this is the play I think this is

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.780 
we go this is the play I think this is
the<00:01:54.650> play<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:55.070> is<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:55.250> first<00:01:55.460> time<00:01:55.640> I'm

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
the play this is the first time I'm

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.429 
the play this is the first time I'm
running<00:01:56.060> at<00:01:56.119> this<00:01:56.210> power<00:01:56.360> point<00:01:56.630> got<00:01:57.049> a<00:01:57.080> mad

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
running at this power point got a mad

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.070 
running at this power point got a mad
and<00:01:57.799> earlier<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.340> mean<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:58.790> worked<00:01:59.150> so<00:01:59.330> I<00:01:59.750> was

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
and earlier I mean it worked so I was

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.870 
and earlier I mean it worked so I was
gonna<00:02:00.229> run<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.619> because<00:02:00.950> his<00:02:01.100> run<00:02:01.310> defense<00:02:01.700> was

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
gonna run it because his run defense was

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.030 
gonna run it because his run defense was
suspect<00:02:02.090> he<00:02:02.750> was<00:02:02.869> not<00:02:03.049> adjusting<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:03.770> as<00:02:03.920> you

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
suspect he was not adjusting so as you

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.950 
suspect he was not adjusting so as you
see<00:02:04.220> here<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.790> time<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:05.090> run<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.390> power<00:02:05.570> last

time I ran the strong power this is the

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.910 
time I ran the strong power this is the

for<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.590> backup<00:02:15.980> running<00:02:16.160> back<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.880> dude<00:02:17.180> I

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
for a backup running back that dude I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.789 
for a backup running back that dude I
think<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.959> last<00:02:18.140> year<00:02:18.290> was<00:02:18.410> contract

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
think this is the last year was contract

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.380 
think this is the last year was contract
he's<00:02:18.890> probably<00:02:19.040> get<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.310> good<00:02:19.430> contract<00:02:19.970> next

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
he's probably get a good contract next

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.000 
he's probably get a good contract next
year<00:02:20.720> every<00:02:21.110> continues<00:02:21.530> playing<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.769> way<00:02:21.860> he

year every continues playing the way he
does<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.370> look<00:02:22.489> at<00:02:22.579> that<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:23.209> time<00:02:23.390> he's<00:02:23.510> not

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
does and look at that this time he's not

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.640 
does and look at that this time he's not
getting<00:02:23.840> away<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.049> putting<00:02:24.230> his<00:02:24.320> hands<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:24.560> the

cookie jar but for the most part I can
really<00:02:26.840> stop<00:02:27.050> him<00:02:27.080> for<00:02:27.560> whatever<00:02:27.800> reason<00:02:28.220> his

really stop him for whatever reason his
offense<00:02:28.610> was<00:02:28.670> pretty<00:02:28.910> simple<00:02:29.270> but<00:02:29.420> at<00:02:29.660> the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
offense was pretty simple but at the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.570 
offense was pretty simple but at the
same<00:02:30.140> time<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.530> couldn't<00:02:30.890> stop<00:02:31.069> it<00:02:31.099> but<00:02:31.340> here<00:02:31.489> we

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
same time I couldn't stop it but here we

game running to the outside will foster

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.979 
game running to the outside will foster
fosters<00:02:34.580> was<00:02:34.730> six<00:02:34.970> rushes<00:02:35.300> now<00:02:35.450> we've<00:02:35.870> done

fosters was six rushes now we've done
the<00:02:36.170> same<00:02:36.349> exact<00:02:36.739> play<00:02:36.950> again<00:02:37.310> because<00:02:37.489> well

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
look at it it's getting like 10 yards

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.380 
look at it it's getting like 10 yards
per<00:02:39.890> game<00:02:39.950> he's<00:02:40.310> not<00:02:40.489> adjusting<00:02:40.940> at<00:02:41.030> all

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
per game he's not adjusting at all

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.759 
per game he's not adjusting at all
still<00:02:41.780> not<00:02:41.989> adjusting<00:02:42.379> you<00:02:42.440> think<00:02:42.590> he<00:02:42.650> would

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
still not adjusting you think he would

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.680 
still not adjusting you think he would
start<00:02:42.920> blitzing<00:02:43.340> players<00:02:43.549> still<00:02:43.970> has<00:02:44.180> not<00:02:44.450> and

start blitzing players still has not and

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.080 
start blitzing players still has not and
Foster's<00:02:45.349> still<00:02:45.590> gets<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:46.010> ton<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:46.310> yards<00:02:46.760> here

if we don't get it it could possibly

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.920 
if we don't get it it could possibly
change<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.610> momentum<00:02:58.879> and<00:02:59.269> we<00:02:59.540> all<00:02:59.690> hit<00:02:59.900> the
