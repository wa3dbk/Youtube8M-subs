00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
one at the moment so we're using the

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.209 
one at the moment so we're using the
kitchen<00:00:48.739> table<00:00:50.139> don't<00:00:51.139> you<00:00:51.199> pop<00:00:51.469> back<00:00:52.069> in

kitchen table don't you pop back in

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.660 
kitchen table don't you pop back in
there<00:00:52.429> like<00:00:52.579> that<00:00:53.109> okay<00:00:54.109> and<00:00:54.370> that<00:00:55.370> goes<00:00:55.549> in

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
there like that okay and that goes in

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.660 
there like that okay and that goes in
the<00:00:55.729> hive<00:00:55.909> like<00:00:56.179> that<00:00:56.359> doesn't<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:57.489> so<00:00:58.489> that's

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
the hive like that doesn't it so that's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.969 
the hive like that doesn't it so that's
okay<00:00:59.120> on<00:00:59.269> there<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.869> have<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.440> put<00:01:00.619> some<00:01:00.769> nails

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
okay on there I have to put some nails

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.030 
okay on there I have to put some nails
in<00:01:01.249> this<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:02.389> ideally<00:01:03.079> I<00:01:03.319> would<00:01:03.440> have<00:01:03.649> a<00:01:03.679> much

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
in this and ideally I would have a much

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.390 
in this and ideally I would have a much
smaller<00:01:04.369> hammer<00:01:05.030> I<00:01:05.620> think<00:01:06.620> about<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:06.920> frame

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
smaller hammer I think about a frame

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.520 
smaller hammer I think about a frame
week<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:08.210> is<00:01:09.110> good<00:01:09.590> at<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.770> moment<00:01:10.270> although

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
week is is good at the moment although

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.650 
week is is good at the moment although
as<00:01:12.530> we<00:01:12.740> had<00:01:12.890> them<00:01:13.010> delivered<00:01:13.190> last<00:01:13.580> week<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.360> may

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
as we had them delivered last week I may

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.250 
as we had them delivered last week I may
only<00:01:14.810> have<00:01:14.900> five<00:01:15.410> frames<00:01:16.130> as<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:16.670> as<00:01:17.510> a<00:01:17.660> nucleus

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
only have five frames as a as a nucleus

only have five frames as a as a nucleus
the<00:01:19.000> recommendation<00:01:20.000> is<00:01:20.210> new<00:01:20.360> that<00:01:20.510> you<00:01:20.630> put

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
the recommendation is new that you put

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.210 
the recommendation is new that you put
an<00:01:20.990> extra<00:01:21.230> three<00:01:21.800> on<00:01:23.680> pretty<00:01:24.680> soon<00:01:24.920> after

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
an extra three on pretty soon after

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.970 
an extra three on pretty soon after
getting<00:01:25.370> them<00:01:25.730> so<00:01:26.060> they<00:01:26.210> can<00:01:26.390> then<00:01:26.600> grow<00:01:27.500> in

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
getting them so they can then grow in

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.020 
getting them so they can then grow in
the<00:01:28.100> hive<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:30.470> foundation<00:01:31.190> goes<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:31.880> way

around<00:01:32.300> then<00:01:33.260> you<00:01:33.350> can<00:01:33.590> pull<00:01:34.400> or<00:01:34.670> push<00:01:34.730> it<00:01:35.360> down

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
around then you can pull or push it down

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.090 
around then you can pull or push it down
oops<00:01:37.190> hang<00:01:37.940> on<00:01:38.120> you're<00:01:38.360> pulling<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:38.780> too<00:01:39.020> much

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.630 
they and I think if they're really angry
and<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:10.920> might<00:03:11.099> mean<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.340> there's<00:03:11.610> something

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
and it might mean that there's something

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.030 
and it might mean that there's something
wrong<00:03:15.049> alright<00:03:16.049> so<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.709> see<00:03:16.860> some

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040

wrong alright so you can see some
interesting

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.050 

no<00:03:21.030> that's<00:03:21.239> cap<00:03:21.480> brewed<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.109> think<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:23.819> cat

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
no that's cap brewed I think the cat

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.369 
no that's cap brewed I think the cat
food<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.659> babysitter's<00:03:25.409> babies<00:03:25.859> in<00:03:25.980> there

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.970 

pop<00:03:31.379> that<00:03:31.560> one<00:03:31.650> buck<00:03:31.799> in<00:03:31.950> them<00:03:33.590> all<00:03:34.590> right<00:03:34.680> so

pop that one buck in them all right so

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:45.020 
pop that one buck in them all right so
this<00:03:35.099> one<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:35.639> is<00:03:35.790> number<00:03:35.909> two<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:44.190> think

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
this one this is number two I think

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.059 
this one this is number two I think
that's<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.359> drone<00:03:45.569> so<00:03:45.930> it's<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.650> drone<00:03:46.859> sales

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
that's a drone so it's the drone sales

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.390 
that's a drone so it's the drone sales
much<00:03:47.340> bigger<00:03:48.709> while<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.799> drones<00:03:50.099> are<00:03:50.370> the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
much bigger while the drones are the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.920 
much bigger while the drones are the
ones<00:03:50.609> are<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.819> big<00:03:51.000> eyes<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.629> they're<00:03:51.780> really

beekeeper told us to do is to put all of

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.050 
beekeeper told us to do is to put all of
our<00:05:06.310> new<00:05:06.610> frames<00:05:07.030> at<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.050> front<00:05:08.849> because<00:05:09.849> she

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
our new frames at the front because she

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.240 
our new frames at the front because she
because<00:05:10.449> the<00:05:10.570> Queen<00:05:10.810> tends<00:05:11.139> to<00:05:11.349> work<00:05:11.560> from<00:05:12.099> the

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
because the Queen tends to work from the

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.839 
because the Queen tends to work from the
back<00:05:12.460> to<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:12.849> front<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.419> hive<00:05:14.430> so<00:05:15.430> let's

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
back to the front of the hive so let's

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.260 
back to the front of the hive so let's
pop<00:05:16.419> this<00:05:16.599> one<00:05:16.660> just<00:05:17.050> in<00:05:17.169> here<00:05:18.240> right<00:05:19.240> so

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
pinholes yeah so six seven I'll do so

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.469 
pinholes yeah so six seven I'll do so
the<00:05:44.500> bees<00:05:44.680> will<00:05:44.830> come<00:05:45.039> up<00:05:45.190> and<00:05:45.639> they'll<00:05:45.880> suck
