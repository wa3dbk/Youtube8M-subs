other video check it out all i'll have
it<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.050> link<00:00:22.769> videos<00:00:23.070> below<00:00:23.760> but

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it in the link videos below but

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.509 
it in the link videos below but
basically<00:00:24.500> this<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.560> an<00:00:25.800> alternate<00:00:26.099> method<00:00:26.279> to

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
basically this is an alternate method to

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.849 
basically this is an alternate method to
that<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.240> other<00:00:27.599> ones<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.960> use<00:00:28.109> UAV<00:00:28.590> counter

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that the other ones that use UAV counter

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.110 
that the other ones that use UAV counter
UAV<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:30.349> advanced<00:00:31.349> UAV<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> support<00:00:32.700> area

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
UAV and advanced UAV in the support area

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.639 
UAV and advanced UAV in the support area
but<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> little<00:00:34.020> bit<00:00:34.230> better<00:00:34.410> i

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
but this one is a little bit better i

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.100 
but this one is a little bit better i
think<00:00:34.860> because<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.239> team<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.690> don't

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
think because you have a team and don't

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.110 
think because you have a team and don't
mind<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.440> java<00:00:37.649> feel<00:00:37.860> if<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.730> team

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
mind that java feel if you have a team

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.940 
mind that java feel if you have a team
that<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.450> go<00:00:39.540> ahead<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.840> run<00:00:40.230> those<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.770> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
that can go ahead and run those for you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.090 
that can go ahead and run those for you
and<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.210> run<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.570> specialist<00:00:43.100> kill

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and you can run the specialist kill

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.010 
and you can run the specialist kill
streaks<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.579> basically<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.570> right

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
streaks and basically what that is right

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.660 
streaks and basically what that is right
there<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.620> see<00:00:46.649> i<00:00:46.800> got<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:47.160> my<00:00:47.430> first

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
there you can see i got one my first

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.479 
there you can see i got one my first
kill<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.120> got<00:00:48.510> sleight<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.780> hand<00:00:49.320> pro<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.950> or<00:00:50.460> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and marathon you run around quietly to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
and marathon you run around quietly to
try<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.549> get<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> couple<00:01:30.030> kills<00:01:30.329> once<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
try to get a couple kills once you get a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
try to get a couple kills once you get a
couple<00:01:31.530> more<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.950> three<00:01:32.220> kills<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.909> get

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
couple more like three kills you get

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.310 
couple more like three kills you get
assassin<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.020> sudden<00:01:34.049> you're

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
assassin and then all of a sudden you're

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.380 
assassin and then all of a sudden you're
invisible<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:35.759> opinion<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
invisible so in my opinion this is the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.880 
invisible so in my opinion this is the
best<00:01:36.540> way<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.750> go<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.530> see<00:01:37.650> i<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
best way to go you can see i have a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.710 
best way to go you can see i have a
three<00:01:38.070> kill<00:01:38.250> streak<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:38.880> now<00:01:39.420> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
three kill streak right there now that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.140 
three kill streak right there now that
was<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.869> think<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.229> 3<00:01:40.710> or<00:01:40.740> 4<00:01:41.009> i'm<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.310> sure<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.670> um

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
was I think a 3 or 4 i'm not sure but um

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.130 
was I think a 3 or 4 i'm not sure but um
but<00:01:42.920> basically<00:01:43.920> once<00:01:44.490> i<00:01:44.640> get<00:01:44.880> uh<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.840> next

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
but basically once i get uh the next

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.380 
but basically once i get uh the next
level<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.500> killstreaks<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.460> i<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:47.759> i<00:01:47.970> got<00:01:48.119> a
