00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.610
 we have outside 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.559
 Of course , there is no longer on board 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.230
 but also the suitable rooms to the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.800
 boards and he wants them now 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.199
 I would like to start with the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.760
 both here 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.890
 this role in a modified form so 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.350
 my name is with my desire or otherwise 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.920
 what do you think of most of ours? 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.880
 boards from mag.a to skates that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.989
 always the same role 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.590
 just in a different color 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.829
 all roles are 78 years hardness 69 with 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.320
 the diameter have a sharp outside 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 edge and give them a rounded edge 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.520
 the roles are very I was by it 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.410
 very comfortable and offer a high 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.949
 measure of cancer so they are very good 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.780
 suitable for cruising and even cruising 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.270
 The lowry can be used very well 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.640
 only to say that are not so good 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 suitable for sliding have the role 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.619
 is a role specifically to freeze or 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.840
 also amateur was developed 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.680
 she is harder than the other two 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.119
 She has half an hour of 83 70 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.570
 millimeters in diameter as well 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.049
 little bit bigger here at the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.110
 role 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.390
 both edges are rounded off so you have one 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.280
 just a nicer got second 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.430
 transition so that means you came to the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.930
 slide more control and initiate 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.850
 to withdraw the board again 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.990
 direction of travel 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.659
 the surface is at the uniqa 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.360
 brushed that he let think in the morning 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.250
 get away there was the role that chance 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.040
 wanted to give also a certain 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.020
 to tingle because they look fresh 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.990
 cardboard on the board on it comes the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.380
 last role in bunde is the role the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.350
 roll comes standard on the hair 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.210
 and is as it were our role down because 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.030
 she has something present diameter she is 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.380
 finished with the diameter and has 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.939
 a hardness of 80 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.470
 They moved in midfield between the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.480
 role eg dogs role 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.790
 we made something harder because of her 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.980
 your wider pad anyway 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.630
 even a higher level of pi also offers 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.280
 here at the roll have the outside 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.849
 sharp edge and rounded them 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.420
 edge 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.610
 so you can, for example, the drift 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.590
 makes the politician better control 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.970
 but still came through the sheep 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.010
 you still have a lot of grip in the curve 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.780
 like you see me at the bike and 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.040
 Riots can actually be for everyone 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.049
 offer something 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.110
 You can also use the rooms for example 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.400
 exchange the boards if want 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.970
 They are also very good, for example 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.880
 Also suitable for a high or a hole 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.390
 again wonderful to take care of it because 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.890
 I would say good 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.890
 probably the fuck
