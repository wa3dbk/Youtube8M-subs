right it is loner Prime I just actually
had<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> look<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
had to look that up so it is a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.700 
had to look that up so it is a
inter-clan<00:00:51.239> wore<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.199> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
inter-clan wore it this is going to be a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.310 
inter-clan wore it this is going to be a
best<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.430> three<00:00:53.520> series<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.230> is

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
best of three series and so it is

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.470 
best of three series and so it is
between<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> Prime<00:00:56.219> clan<00:00:56.550> loner<00:00:56.910> versus

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
assumed this is going to be a barracks

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.979 
assumed this is going to be a barracks
because<00:02:41.280> marine<00:02:41.969> King<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.389> the<00:02:42.659> king<00:02:42.870> of

because marine King is the king of
Marines<00:02:43.319> but<00:02:44.129> that's<00:02:44.310> actually<00:02:44.519> not<00:02:45.239> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
Marines but that's actually not a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.569 
Marines but that's actually not a
barracks<00:02:46.049> that's<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.319> factory<00:02:46.919> going<00:02:47.280> down<00:02:47.430> so

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
barracks that's a factory going down so

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.159 
barracks that's a factory going down so
that's<00:02:47.760> why<00:02:48.000> marine<00:02:48.599> king<00:02:48.780> went<00:02:48.959> for<00:02:49.109> the

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:49.169 
that's why marine king went for the

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.939 
that's why marine king went for the
early<00:02:49.409> gasps<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.000> wow<00:02:51.000> right<00:02:51.510> now<00:02:51.919> right<00:02:52.919> now

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:52.949 
early gasps and wow right now right now

are these buildings going down in the

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.729 
are these buildings going down in the
center<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.299> would<00:02:57.750> imagine<00:02:57.840> if<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.319> could<00:02:58.409> tag

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
center I would imagine if you could tag

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.860 
center I would imagine if you could tag
these<00:02:58.919> el<00:02:59.129> nivel<00:02:59.310> watchtowers<00:02:59.849> just<00:03:00.180> one<00:03:00.480> time

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
these el nivel watchtowers just one time

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.539 
these el nivel watchtowers just one time
that<00:03:01.439> he<00:03:01.560> would<00:03:01.709> see<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:02.069> buildings<00:03:02.400> at<00:03:02.459> the

that he would see the buildings at the

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.520 
that he would see the buildings at the
center<00:03:02.909> i'm<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.419> exactly<00:03:03.989> sure<00:03:04.139> because<00:03:04.439> I've

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
center i'm not exactly sure because I've
