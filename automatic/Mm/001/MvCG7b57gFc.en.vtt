butter<00:02:34.810> bla<00:02:35.079> up<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.370> exits<00:02:37.030> for<00:02:37.769> like<00:02:38.769> I've

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
butter bla up to the exits for like I've

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.559 
butter bla up to the exits for like I've
done<00:02:39.159> here

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.880 

okay<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.980> if<00:02:48.129> I<00:02:48.340> do<00:02:49.239> drop<00:02:49.540> down<00:02:49.750> we're<00:02:50.680> going<00:02:50.829> to

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
okay so if I do drop down we're going to

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.000 
okay so if I do drop down we're going to
see<00:02:51.010> their<00:02:51.780> program<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.810> thought<00:02:53.140> access<00:02:53.769> and

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
see their program I thought access and

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.580 
see their program I thought access and
parents<00:02:54.400> ology<00:02:54.970> if<00:02:55.629> you<00:02:55.750> just<00:02:55.930> do<00:02:56.049> up<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
six folks if we do this library one like

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.069 
six folks if we do this library one like
I've<00:02:59.829> done<00:02:59.920> here<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:01.090> comes<00:03:01.299> up<00:03:01.480> asking<00:03:01.659> you<00:03:01.900> to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
I've done here it comes up asking you to

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.839 
I've done here it comes up asking you to
open<00:03:02.409> like<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.650> different<00:03:02.980> file<00:03:03.159> format<00:03:03.609> and

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
open like a different file format and

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.770 
open like a different file format and
that's<00:03:04.090> just<00:03:04.799> right<00:03:05.819> so<00:03:06.819> if<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.090> just<00:03:07.239> type<00:03:07.450> up
