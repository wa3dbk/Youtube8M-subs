00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
you come into your applications and you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.300 
you come into your applications and you
basically<00:01:09.780> pick<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.530> ones<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.979> want<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and I'm going to call it test apps and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.090 
and I'm going to call it test apps and
when<00:01:18.840> i<00:01:18.869> call<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.170> test<00:01:19.439> apps<00:01:19.650> basically<00:01:20.040> i

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
when i call this test apps basically i

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100 
when i call this test apps basically i
need<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.310> create<00:01:20.520> aliases<00:01:21.020> quote<00:01:22.020> unquote

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
need to create aliases quote unquote

link<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.720> program<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> link<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.950> so

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
link to the program for it to link to so

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.920 
link to the program for it to link to so
basically<00:01:29.820> what<00:01:30.210> i'm<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> bin<00:01:30.689> here

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
basically what i'm not going to bin here

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.480 
basically what i'm not going to bin here
i'm<00:01:31.079> gonna<00:01:31.170> come<00:01:31.320> into<00:01:31.409> applications<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
i'm gonna come into applications and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.819 
i'm gonna come into applications and
let's<00:01:32.729> say<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.090> example<00:01:33.119> i<00:01:33.630> want<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.079> get<00:01:34.530> this

just go make a list this will go ahead

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.580 
just go make a list this will go ahead
and<00:01:53.579> create<00:01:53.729> two<00:01:53.939> aliases<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.840> by

and create two aliases for you by

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.109 
and create two aliases for you by
default<00:01:55.829> only<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.670> first<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.000> will<00:01:57.090> be

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
default only the first one will be

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.240 
default only the first one will be
highlighted<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.770> simply<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> whole

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
highlighted you can just simply a whole

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.709 
highlighted you can just simply a whole
again<00:01:59.610> go<00:01:59.790> back<00:01:59.850> down<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.420> are<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.570> one

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
again go back down so you are the one

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.510 
again go back down so you are the one
hold<00:02:01.170> your<00:02:01.259> command<00:02:01.590> key<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.219> simply

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
hold your command key and just simply

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.609 
hold your command key and just simply

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
move them to your test apps folder now

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.719 
move them to your test apps folder now
they're<00:02:04.829> out<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:04.979> your<00:02:05.159> Applications<00:02:05.640> folder

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
they're out of your Applications folder

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.999
