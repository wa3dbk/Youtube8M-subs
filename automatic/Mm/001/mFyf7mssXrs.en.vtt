forty millimeter ultra range zoom lens

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.310 
forty millimeter ultra range zoom lens
I've<00:00:16.180> been<00:00:16.390> a<00:00:16.420> bit<00:00:16.630> surprised<00:00:17.050> by<00:00:17.260> the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
I've been a bit surprised by the

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.170 
I've been a bit surprised by the
reaction<00:00:17.470> to<00:00:17.830> this<00:00:17.980> lens<00:00:18.189> by<00:00:18.430> reviewers<00:00:18.820> a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
reaction to this lens by reviewers a

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.659 
reaction to this lens by reviewers a
sort<00:00:19.720> of<00:00:19.810> quite<00:00:20.320> yarn<00:00:20.680> as<00:00:20.950> if<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.369> lens<00:00:21.520> was

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669 
sort of quite yarn as if the lens was

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.279 
sort of quite yarn as if the lens was
just<00:00:21.910> a<00:00:22.000> freshening<00:00:22.419> up<00:00:22.539> of<00:00:22.720> an<00:00:22.810> old<00:00:22.960> design

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
just a freshening up of an old design

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.510 
just a freshening up of an old design
but<00:00:23.860> it<00:00:23.980> isn't

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
but it isn't

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.510 
but it isn't
I<00:00:24.550> think<00:00:25.419> reviewers<00:00:25.869> get<00:00:26.050> jaded<00:00:26.349> a<00:00:26.770> lens<00:00:27.220> arise

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
I think reviewers get jaded a lens arise

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.260 
I think reviewers get jaded a lens arise
for<00:00:27.789> tests

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
for tests

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.080 
for tests
Wow<00:00:28.660> it's<00:00:28.990> a<00:00:29.109> 200<00:00:29.590> millimeter<00:00:30.010> f-14<00:00:30.640> not

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
Wow it's a 200 millimeter f-14 not

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.130 
Wow it's a 200 millimeter f-14 not
seeing<00:00:31.330> one<00:00:31.420> of<00:00:31.510> those<00:00:31.660> before

don't<00:01:27.790> think<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.150> lens<00:01:28.390> is<00:01:28.659> an<00:01:28.840> upgrade<00:01:29.229> to

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
don't think this lens is an upgrade to

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.950 
don't think this lens is an upgrade to
the<00:01:29.439> earlier<00:01:29.770> version<00:01:30.189> at<00:01:30.369> all<00:01:30.579> it's<00:01:31.329> new<00:01:31.659> lens

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
the earlier version at all it's new lens

the earlier version at all it's new lens
that<00:01:32.229> happens<00:01:32.500> that<00:01:32.650> have<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.860> same<00:01:33.040> focal

length as is a decedent I expected it to
feel<00:01:36.670> familiar<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:37.119> little<00:01:37.329> different<00:01:37.750> but

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
feel familiar a little different but

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.600 
feel familiar a little different but
actually<00:01:38.259> it<00:01:38.619> feels<00:01:38.829> like<00:01:38.979> I've<00:01:39.130> added<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.460> new

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.630 
review of the f/4 earlier version you'll
know<00:01:44.439> that<00:01:44.680> when<00:01:44.799> I<00:01:44.829> look<00:01:45.100> through<00:01:45.220> my<00:01:45.340> library

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
know that when I look through my library

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.520 
know that when I look through my library
I<00:01:46.060> was<00:01:46.420> astonished<00:01:46.659> at<00:01:46.990> how<00:01:47.049> many<00:01:47.290> of<00:01:47.409> the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
I was astonished at how many of the

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.780 
I was astonished at how many of the
pictures<00:01:47.890> were<00:01:48.009> taken<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.369> that<00:01:48.430> lanes

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
pictures were taken on that lanes

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.940 
pictures were taken on that lanes
without<00:01:49.420> my<00:01:49.750> knowing<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:50.290> it<00:01:50.439> had<00:01:50.530> become<00:01:50.649> my

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950

difference between this lens and the old
one<00:02:01.930> is<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:02.469> as<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:03.250> zoom<00:02:03.460> out<00:02:03.670> towards<00:02:04.060> one

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270

but it is a lot more expensive it can

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.980 
but it is a lot more expensive it can

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
replace several lenses though and so the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.570 
replace several lenses though and so the
