a couple of chords you need to know and

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.779 
a couple of chords you need to know and
some<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.390> these<00:00:21.510> licks<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> soul<00:00:22.580> just<00:00:23.580> try

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
some of these licks in the soul just try

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.790 
some of these licks in the soul just try
and<00:00:23.850> make<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.119> simple<00:00:24.660> don't<00:00:25.350> worry<00:00:25.560> if<00:00:25.680> you

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
and make it simple don't worry if you

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920 
and make it simple don't worry if you
can't<00:00:25.830> nail<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.430> exactly<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.180> way<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.630> we

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
can't nail it exactly the way it is we

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.290 
can't nail it exactly the way it is we
can<00:00:28.080> always<00:00:28.230> arrange<00:00:28.650> otherwise<00:00:29.519> but

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
can always arrange otherwise but

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.609 
can always arrange otherwise but
basically<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.779> need<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.140> know<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> chord

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
basically you need to know the chord

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.229 
basically you need to know the chord
shapes<00:00:31.949> if<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.219> can't<00:00:32.430> keep<00:00:32.730> up<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
shapes if you can't keep up with the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.870 
shapes if you can't keep up with the
sliding<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> strumming<00:00:34.410> fine<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:35.640> but

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
sliding and the strumming fine but but

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.850 
sliding and the strumming fine but but
these<00:00:36.149> chord<00:00:36.750> shapes<00:00:37.050> are<00:00:37.260> very<00:00:37.410> good<00:00:37.739> to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
these chord shapes are very good to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.119 
these chord shapes are very good to
learn<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.790> definitely<00:00:39.120> need<00:00:39.329> them<00:00:40.129> for
