00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
with one this is the vid pro Z 96k kit

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.590 
with one this is the vid pro Z 96k kit
and<00:00:19.380> we're<00:00:20.189> really<00:00:20.310> happy<00:00:20.640> with<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.570> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
and we're really happy with it this is a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.630 
and we're really happy with it this is a
very<00:00:22.050> durable<00:00:22.529> light<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.039> looks<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.490> can

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
very durable light it looks like you can

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.820 
very durable light it looks like you can
drop<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.269> it'll<00:00:24.539> turn<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.170> when<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.619> done

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
drop it and it'll turn on when it's done

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.029 
drop it and it'll turn on when it's done
being<00:00:26.519> dropped<00:00:27.050> it's<00:00:28.050> actually<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.590> brighter

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
being dropped it's actually a brighter

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.659 
being dropped it's actually a brighter
light<00:00:29.220> than<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.000> light<00:00:30.300> panels<00:00:30.660> micro<00:00:31.669> pro

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
light than the light panels micro pro

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.479 
light than the light panels micro pro
and<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.690> actually<00:00:33.899> has<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> wider<00:00:34.500> beam<00:00:34.980> than

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
and it actually has a wider beam than

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.400 
and it actually has a wider beam than
the<00:00:35.670> light<00:00:35.790> panels<00:00:36.120> micropro<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.170> think

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the light panels micropro so I think

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.959 
the light panels micropro so I think
that<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.100> actually<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.700> be<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.820> good

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
that this is actually going to be a good

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.240 
that this is actually going to be a good
fit<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.420> lot<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.750> guys<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:40.079> there<00:00:40.260> the

version<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:55.140> basically<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.590> same

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
version of this it's basically the same

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.220 
version of this it's basically the same
light<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.460> it'll<00:00:56.699> come<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.329> Sony<00:00:57.899> to

light but it'll come with a Sony to
Panasonic<00:00:59.039> adapter<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.840> panasonic

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
Panasonic adapter and a panasonic

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.920 
Panasonic adapter and a panasonic
battery<00:01:01.859> which<00:01:02.579> will<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> same<00:01:03.510> kind<00:01:03.840> that

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
battery which will be the same kind that

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.440 
battery which will be the same kind that
will<00:01:04.080> fit<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.439> an<00:01:04.530> hvx200<00:01:05.299> camera<00:01:06.299> or

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
will fit like an hvx200 camera or

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.179 
will fit like an hvx200 camera or
something<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> way<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.070> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
something like that the way that it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.219 
something like that the way that it
works<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.490> basically<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.450> light<00:01:09.869> panels

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
works is basically like a light panels

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.320 
works is basically like a light panels
micro<00:01:10.710> light<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> little<00:01:11.970> dial

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
micro light so you have a little dial

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.780 
micro light so you have a little dial
knob<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.380> fully<00:01:13.680> dimmable<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.640> can

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
knob here it's fully dimmable so you can

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.600 
knob here it's fully dimmable so you can
see<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.210> dim<00:01:15.390> range<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.400> it's<00:01:17.400> very

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
see the dim range here and it's very

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.210 
see the dim range here and it's very
bright<00:01:17.880> now<00:01:18.720> what<00:01:19.170> makes<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.590> light<00:01:19.830> unique

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
bright now what makes this light unique

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.429 
bright now what makes this light unique
is<00:01:20.460> its<00:01:21.060> filter<00:01:21.479> system<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> actually<00:01:22.290> comes

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
is its filter system it actually comes

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.850 
is its filter system it actually comes
with<00:01:22.530> two<00:01:22.799> filters<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:25.070> diffuser<00:01:26.070> filter<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
with two filters a diffuser filter and a

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.080 
with two filters a diffuser filter and a
warming<00:01:28.860> filter<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.520> what's<00:01:29.909> nice<00:01:30.030> about

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
warming filter and what's nice about

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.700 
warming filter and what's nice about
these<00:01:30.479> filters<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.140> actually<00:01:31.290> come<00:01:31.680> with

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
these filters is they actually come with

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.649 
these filters is they actually come with
little<00:01:32.130> metal<00:01:32.400> discs<00:01:32.759> embedded<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.299> them<00:01:33.450> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
little metal discs embedded in them and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.140 
little metal discs embedded in them and
these<00:01:34.320> are<00:01:34.500> magnets<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> put<00:01:35.670> them<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
these are magnets so to put them on you

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.060 
these are magnets so to put them on you
just<00:01:36.390> slap<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> front<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.710> actually

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
just slap it on to the front it actually

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.350 
just slap it on to the front it actually
will<00:01:38.280> stay<00:01:38.490> there<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.119> fall

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
will stay there it's not going to fall

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.539 
will stay there it's not going to fall
off<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.770> did<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> very<00:01:41.250> good<00:01:41.369> job

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
off it they did a very good job

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.780 
off it they did a very good job
designing<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:43.259> fits<00:01:43.500> very<00:01:43.590> good<00:01:43.979> these

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
designing this it fits very good these

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.819 
designing this it fits very good these
are<00:01:44.939> cleanable<00:01:45.420> they're<00:01:45.810> very<00:01:46.020> durable<00:01:46.380> so

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
are cleanable they're very durable so

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.620
