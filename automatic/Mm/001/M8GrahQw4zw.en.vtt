00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello in his day I made a quiche but not 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.210
 prepare the dough and this time we're going 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.580
 to make the complete recipe in a bowl 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.710
 big we put 200 grams of flour 100 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.600
 grams of butter and a pinch of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.640
 salt this is easier to do with the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.279
 blender but if you do not have it you can 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.990
 do manually if the butter is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.940
 At room temperature it will be much more 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.610
 easy to mix 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.490
 then add the water which is about 50 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.620
 milliliters and it is not necessary to knead 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.430
 is the mass is homogeneous and 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.430
 press it well 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.900
 and 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.200
 once we have compacted it the 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.180
 we wrap with plastic wrap and put it in 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.180
 in the fridge for about 40 minutes 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.360
 just before stretching it in a bowl 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.550
 we put the eggs the liquid cream the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.830
 25 grams of butter that we have 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.030
 dissolved in the microwave a pinch of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.030
 salt and pepper 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.470
 and we beat it well 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.070
 and we reserve it now let's extend 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.830
 the mass does not matter if it breaks us 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.710
 we can go repairing as 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.890
 We extend as you can see it is only about 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:53.110
 millimeters wide 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.110
 we roll it on the roller 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.540
 and we put it in the mold 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.650
 and you see and if there is any imperfection 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.650
 it is repaired without problems 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.420
 and as you know it is of brightness and sweet ham 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.170
 we put the brightness 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.290
 we cut the ham into juices 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.850
 i 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.280
 and we distribute it evenly 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.349
 and we add the mixture that we have made with 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.349
 anteriority 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.959
 the oven is preheated to 180 degrees 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.940
 we leave heat down and it will be during 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.770
 one hour if you do not brown over the 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.010
 last ten minutes you put heat up 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.010
 and down 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.470
 and eat good I hope you have 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.470
 liked a hug until then
