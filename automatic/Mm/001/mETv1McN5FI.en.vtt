00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 very good we are all in minecraft 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.150
 1.7 points 10 let's see a mod a a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.349
 mini motorbike or minibus 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.880
 it's really a super super bot 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.730
 kid would actually say that it is from the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.060
 smallest I've seen is a super and 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.120
 minimal term that adds a little something that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.580
 if you are watching here 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.580
 in your kind of bar that calls web 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.180
 more than 11 can come quite well 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.610
 the point is that this can be 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.490
 drop when you chop stone and there's a 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.990
 probability of 1 to thousand ie it comes out 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.270
 very little unless you're lucky 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.300
 then you can leave more but you normal 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.430
 is from one comes approaching one of these 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.160
 for every 1,000 of eating is when 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.559
 stones and we send and this helps us this 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.559
 it's simply to sharpen us 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:57.760
 sharpen them to the age the weapon and the h 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.760
 iron we need it 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.650
 and we put an iron ax and a 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.260
 stone of these to sharpen as you see 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.240
 we get a sharp iron ax that 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.700
 it has six attack ie it has what 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.840
 same as a diamond ax for that 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.330
 I say it may be fine we can 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.540
 sharpen it to get the same effect 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.190
 that diamond but only spending iron and 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.600
 the little stones that are weird 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.890
 letting go yes it is true that it does not come out 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.180
 a lot, but 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.590
 play simply by graph late or 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.830
 early you will jump more than one of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.870
 these it is only by breaking stones and 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.090
 that more than one is going to skip what 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.290
 It serves also is for the sword only 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.880
 can with the sword and the ax 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.280
 we come back here and we make the sword of 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.190
 sharp iron I have the same attack 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.200
 than a diamond 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.440
 then it may be fine for very 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.030
 specific, but it's very cool and 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.730
 soul has not spent diamond between a 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.980
 sword equally strong 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.420
 which is pretty cool this is all 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.160
 what the mod brings but it is true 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.050
 that would molaría that the left of this 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.270
 hesitate could be used with all 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.160
 the at least the weapons that we could 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.460
 sharpen also a diamond wheel or something 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.080
 well and let us have a little dot 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.119
 more attack so you do that 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.830
 simply increase a point then 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.030
 it equals a diamond but molaría 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.460
 also that the diamond ones could be 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.490
 sharpen I do not know if in the end they will add or 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.890
 no but it would be pretty cool but 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.960
 good diamond titles as you see a 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.800
 tiny little txiki mod or micro 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.390
 bots 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.550
 I really like to say it so you can 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.060
 try it but that can be quite 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.970
 useful depending on the situation, yes, but 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.180
 good you have the description is for the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.060
 1.7 point 10 has material and sitalá 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.090
 comfort that centers as always a 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.090
 heap 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.090
 bye 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.220
 no no no
