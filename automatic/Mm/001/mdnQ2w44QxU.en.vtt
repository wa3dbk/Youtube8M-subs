00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Well, initially you need to choose the right 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.509
 the correct frame size when to buy 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.150
 bike in any store you right 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.830
 You must tell me how to read correctly. 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.230
 at the moment and i took the bike 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.490
 at random the first one is 18 frame she basically 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.340
 my frame will try as you correctly 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.279
 carry you landing about how I need 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.750
 maybe a little higher I tried I barely 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.699
 barely get us dots land this now 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.250
 I try heel and heel should 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.200
 free to reach the pedal as we see 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.649
 no heel flies on what is not necessary 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.020
 approximately at least a centimeter 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.890
 lower the seat 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.539
 that's about a centimeter 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.090
 lowered try further now with me 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.300
 baby is free i should free 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.070
 flying under the heel just the same can 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.350
 to take hold of the wall permission to be 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.559
 and try to crank the pedals 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.480
 back so the hips do not move forward 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.400
 otter track in place i'm free style 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.830
 heel actually screwed will they 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.479
 heel weed 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.280
 and when I put the sock already 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.520
 a certain angle and tattoo was very important 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.530
 because when we press 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.280
 the pedal is down below what we do here 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.110
 such a movement due to the foot 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.780
 Ostap is very responsible for her 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.250
 calf muscle and we press 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.159
 very important centimeter at the very bottom here 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.110
 and from a little distracted from landing here 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.270
 how to correct the correctness of all put 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.439
 sitting right now this place spot 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.540
 money is not worth much because 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.869
 that i don't have a light movie shade ahead 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.250
 I am sitting almost straight 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.649
 your saddle should be light 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.200
 forward and cleaning and no shadow 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.630
 mean i have to let go of here 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.420
 central bolt and seat move 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.329
 at least a centimeter 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.350
 move back here there is an opinion 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.000
 what 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.990
 landing door frame is played so you 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.600
 will not give missing 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.170
 on the crotch, I think that is not very 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.250
 right because if you suddenly 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.660
 you fall off the bike on the go agasphere 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.530
 will go your legs somewhere there at 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.240
 you are not and still be on 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.860
 crotch 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.840
 hang out on this frame how would she down to 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.530
 was not therefore it is not worth it 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.570
 important element equal different not 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.460
 only the height they differ even in length 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.560
 so so bought a frame more more 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.660
 Rostovka than on this can be you not 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.880
 only high and maybe long 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.320
 there is a wheel and will not be longer although you can 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.830
 adjust due to what happens 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.940
 takeaway 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:48.260
 different lengths here is the moment somewhere 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.340
 90 millimeters and removal can be from 60 to 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.959
 140 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.390
 if this athlete is athletes 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.920
 try to put forward possible because 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.440
 that they have a low landing then they 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.740
 sacrifice turns as you see 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.470
 this removal at the moment it is worth 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.610
 up we can flip it then 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.200
 this angle will be in the opposite direction almost 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.610
 all athletes prefer to be bottom 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.700
 why below because it is collect and 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.890
 less air resistance ordinary 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.040
 the townsfolk ride around the parks they want 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.810
 by the time a comfortable fit 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.660
 so the average man site stand short 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.200
 takeaway and upward to feeling yourself 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.269
 comfortable in athletes down here since 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.300
 right well, probably everyone should 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.800
 do for yourself as it is convenient for him 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.290
 the process of skating is simply not a process 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.870
 gaining experience shot yourself already 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.769
 final landing for example when 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.720
 speaking on the fact that I veterans 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.940
 landing a long high when I drive 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.500
 go and adat you remove us leave yourself 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.630
 so short I feel comfortable to ride 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.690
 very long on long 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.690
 distances
