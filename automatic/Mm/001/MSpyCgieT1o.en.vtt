00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.340 
actually quite a good goalkeeper he is
he's<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> best<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> world<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.840> he<00:01:28.229> is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
he's not the best in the world but he is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.200 
he's not the best in the world but he is
quite<00:01:28.619> alright<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.189> game<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.640> could<00:01:30.060> have

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
quite alright in this game I could have

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.609 
quite alright in this game I could have
found<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> saw<00:01:30.750> her<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.290> don't<00:01:31.439> have

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
found the saw her but I just don't have

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.109 
found the saw her but I just don't have
the<00:01:31.770> coins<00:01:32.009> at<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> moment<00:01:32.610> because<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.939> team

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the coins at the moment because the team

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.749 
the coins at the moment because the team
is<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.420> expensive<00:01:33.720> already<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.799> soon<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:35.670> I

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
is so expensive already but soon as I

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.569 
is so expensive already but soon as I
played<00:01:36.000> 29<00:01:36.390> games<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:36.960> him<00:01:37.020> only<00:01:37.350> played<00:01:37.650> 12

he actually went up by a million after I

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.010 
he actually went up by a million after I
bought<00:06:47.610> him<00:06:47.790> but<00:06:47.940> this<00:06:48.060> is<00:06:48.180> a<00:06:48.210> very<00:06:48.389> nice<00:06:48.660> a

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
bought him but this is a very nice a

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.689 
bought him but this is a very nice a
little<00:06:49.860> bit<00:06:49.949> of<00:06:49.979> a<00:06:50.100> luncheon<00:06:50.370> that<00:06:50.460> really

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 
little bit of a luncheon that really

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:51.950 
little bit of a luncheon that really
launched<00:06:50.940> but<00:06:51.060> very<00:06:51.240> nice<00:06:51.360> goal<00:06:51.570> by<00:06:51.690> glass

launched but very nice goal by glass
which<00:06:52.620> is<00:06:52.740> think<00:06:53.070> it's<00:06:53.220> the<00:06:53.310> only<00:06:53.340> 1i<00:06:53.729> score

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
which is think it's the only 1i score

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.999 
which is think it's the only 1i score
with<00:06:54.210> him<00:06:54.330> during<00:06:54.930> a<00:06:55.229> plane<00:06:55.590> with<00:06:55.740> this<00:06:55.860> team

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.009 
with him during a plane with this team

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:57.770 
with him during a plane with this team
but<00:06:56.190> this<00:06:56.370> is<00:06:56.550> Clive<00:06:57.000> he<00:06:57.150> doesn't<00:06:57.449> need<00:06:57.539> much

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
but this is Clive he doesn't need much

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.719 
but this is Clive he doesn't need much
space<00:06:57.900> he<00:06:58.410> creates<00:06:58.440> his<00:06:58.830> own<00:06:58.979> space<00:06:59.310> he<00:06:59.580> is

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
space he creates his own space he is

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.670 
space he creates his own space he is
fantastic<00:07:00.360> for<00:07:00.509> his<00:07:01.229> price<00:07:01.500> I<00:07:01.530> would

buster<00:07:03.870> going<00:07:04.229> through<00:07:04.410> with<00:07:04.590> a<00:07:04.620> very<00:07:04.919> nice

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
buster going through with a very nice

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.360 
buster going through with a very nice
finish<00:07:05.520> past<00:07:06.360> the<00:07:06.479> goalkeeper<00:07:06.780> actually<00:07:07.380> he

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
finish past the goalkeeper actually he

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.999

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 
think he's worth 3.3 million right now

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.350 
think he's worth 3.3 million right now
but<00:07:13.770> he<00:07:14.220> is<00:07:14.310> a<00:07:14.340> very<00:07:14.520> nice<00:07:14.729> player<00:07:15.030> and<00:07:15.210> here

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
but he is a very nice player and here

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.480 
but he is a very nice player and here

finish off by one of the nicer schools i

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.400 
finish off by one of the nicer schools i
scored<00:07:27.300> i<00:07:27.330> think<00:07:27.600> which<00:07:27.960> is<00:07:27.990> a<00:07:28.169> free-kick

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.410 
scored i think which is a free-kick

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.469 
scored i think which is a free-kick
buyback<00:07:28.979> i'm<00:07:29.250> willing<00:07:29.820> to<00:07:29.940> curve<00:07:30.240> it<00:07:30.270> around

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 
buyback i'm willing to curve it around

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:31.969 
buyback i'm willing to curve it around
the<00:07:30.930> wall<00:07:31.110> it's<00:07:31.260> not<00:07:31.410> that<00:07:31.620> were<00:07:31.680> the<00:07:31.740> best

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 
the wall it's not that were the best

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:33.830 
the wall it's not that were the best
goalkeeper<00:07:32.520> performance<00:07:33.060> but<00:07:33.180> in<00:07:33.539> my<00:07:33.720> opinion

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 
goalkeeper performance but in my opinion

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.570 
goalkeeper performance but in my opinion
this<00:07:34.080> was<00:07:34.139> for<00:07:34.440> being<00:07:34.590> nice<00:07:34.800> goal<00:07:35.099> basically

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 
this was for being nice goal basically

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.060 
this was for being nice goal basically
also<00:07:36.150> because<00:07:36.479> I<00:07:36.720> then<00:07:36.930> actually<00:07:37.530> never<00:07:37.740> score

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.070 
also because I then actually never score

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.920 
also because I then actually never score
