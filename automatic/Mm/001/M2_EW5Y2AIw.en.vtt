00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.020
 that day is already a while with it 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.459
 employs successfully bluetooth boxes 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.020
 to sell on Amazon 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:19.119
 Whether your newest in the shopping cart 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:20.770
 you will hear it today in the pack 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.870
 the mercury box we find quite a lot 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.090
 accessories besides a usb and aux 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.140
 cable and a bracelet bend is here 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.060
 also a bag in the scope of delivery 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.890
 contain the but in contrast to the 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.780
 the jogger soulmate serves only for protection 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.340
 because the box itself cool way 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.200
 splash water is protected 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.640
 besides, she is very small and fits 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.739
 without problems with her noble 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.269
 aluminum case in a trouser pocket 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.670
 on the top we have beautiful way 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.859
 a play break button which is not always 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.289
 usual is like the creative sound 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.909
 Blaster review is already addressed 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.440
 Something went wrong with the brand reebok 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.030
 Run the buttons on the 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.890
 top concerns the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.929
 volume control namely acts at 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.789
 android devices as forward and rewind 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.199
 button , of course, it was not so optimal 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.800
 is when you regulate the volume 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.629
 want 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.210
 You have to do that on the smartphone 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.560
 At ios it looks different but that 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.780
 is not the worst at all 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.290
 at the bluetooth box intel 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.360
 that is somehow that sounded like that 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.340
 sounds like that now has to say that though 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.780
 she is just noticeably worse than 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.000
 all the other bluetooth boxes i have 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.860
 but have clearly tested it also costs 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.170
 less and she is smaller that should 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.010
 to keep in mind 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.170
 Nonetheless, it did not sound like that 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.850
 not impressive the bass is 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.980
 impressive not too strong not too 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.020
 weak really pleasant but otherwise 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.510
 it is not pleasant music with her 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.230
 because everything sounds very flat it sounds 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.060
 rather small 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.830
 so the mercury box is just for you 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.540
 all those who really are at any price 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.330
 A water protected bluetooth box 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.130
 want and one that sounds better 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.560
 as her smartphone but not much 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.120
 In addition, I personally advise you 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.980
 one of the four other non-boxing 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.360
 have tested link in the 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.340
 I compared them description 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.810
 also all in one video that was it too 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.040
 already from my short review I hope 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.490
 see you soon again , it 'll be good 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.490
 until then
