00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello hello hello hello hello dammit 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.830
 this computer went crazy I'm the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.990
 thunder of hello hello slopes x not 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.849
 lie I know that most are not 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.370
 stringers but to those that are 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.619
 damn it where it is more the face of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.050
 angry good this is a new video 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.630
 Demonstration of how to do 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.850
 certain lines and at minute 40 lalalala 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.250
 the truth is that surely not to 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.230
 anybody get this type of water 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.570
 it requires a real good control 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.239
 about economics unlike my 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.280
 videos of 180 champions at minute 40 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.500
 to make certain lines in a game 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.890
 real can be like the lockout hit in 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940
 boxing but in the late x net 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.010
 administrations that does not possess good 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.920
 defense against cavalry as per 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.289
 example the vikings damn vikings or 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 as also the Aztecs we had already 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.730
 seen that the e3 halberdiers are required 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.370
 to kill a single paladin if the enemy 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.530
 attacks you with 100 bullets lines you will need 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.600
 easily the hundred beekeepers for 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.719
 learn them why hard that to 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.700
 40 minutes have them x net so this 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.570
 type of attack serves more than anything to 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.580
 one against one 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.860
 already several members of the rhythm clan 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.870
 they ran many clans players from 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.970
 advanced medium level filling those of 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.210
 paladins and they were left with face 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.030
 bata back to black from where there is as 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.100
 he made so many paladins shit 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.260
 going back to the video I chose the Persians 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.090
 to show that you do not need much of 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.280
 have bonus creation of the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.590
 faster cavalry to have so many 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.050
 paladins as it happens with the seconds by 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.060
 example in clear good equipment what 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.830
 main in this type of attack is 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.570
 get to imperial with an important 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.910
 number of resources for which 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.190
 we will need easily to have 150 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.619
 villagers in total and they had put together 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.810
 resources with complete technologies 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.490
 from very early so if 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.740
 you do not have an economy mode 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.070
 stable forget that this comes out 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.440
 in this video I made 180 villagers with 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.600
 complete technologies those of economy 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.190
 since I came to castles for which 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.590
 I already say very well to do the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.140
 paladins alike there are many ways 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.119
 to reach this amount as advancing 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.489
 to the imperial castle very early 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.930
 but equally to make words is 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.939
 one of the most units 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.769
 all things so that we will 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.769
 need many resources equally 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.370
 as the paladins costs only gold 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.770
 and food the wood will be what 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.740
 we will attend if you need gold and 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.480
 which are remarkably expensive 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.790
 we will need easily to have about 70 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.280
 farmers has about 40 gold miners 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.200
 of others between stone and wood for 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.940
 learn later to have resources 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.120
 to reach the maximum amount possible 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.970
 of paladins like in the 180 video 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.130
 champions at minute 40 we will need in 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.830
 the best possible way to have the greatest 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.840
 how many stables we can of this 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.690
 way several greens are logged to the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.530
 also go creating words as 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.530
 soon as posible 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.930
 it is ideal to get to Imperial of 32 and 33 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.550
 minutes this video is made with 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.800
 relatively normal times and 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.130
 standards as feudal 13 minutes 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.140
 castles in 17 imperial 32 that 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.959
 any intermediate player can do 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.300
 at the end of the video I will show the resources 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.400
 we put together in total the times of everything 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.769
 that 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.260
 in my case I came to imperial as in the 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.540
 resources about 3000 of food live 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.870
 rich in wood and almost 200 gold 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.480
 creating 180 villagers in 30 minutes with 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.459
 all the complete technologies 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.079
 remember it's not the same time 30 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.150
 villagers that join with all the 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.250
 full resource technologies that 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.000
 I feel 30 that only match with casualties 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.340
 technologies 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.069
 the difference between time and technology 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.290
 is notorious is like saving two brothers 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.420
 together in January let's say they save the 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.700
 same amount of money one dollar per 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.709
 day then the one that together from January 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.170
 will have more money than that fair 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.849
 from April to the end of the year with 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.549
 villagers and resources the same thing happens 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.109
 The sooner we have technologies 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.109
 more resources we are accumulating 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.590
 and from now on we are killing villagers 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.840
 because we will need the largest population 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.910
 available as we go on having 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.220
 the resources to create more 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.390
 paladins after having them complete 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.390
 in the smithy and barn 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.260
 remember that in a game by 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.020
 Internet should kill a little before 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.720
 villagers play against the computer not 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.550
 there is the reason why if you selected a 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.710
 the villagers that I want to kill with 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.590
 hold the delete key pressed 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.870
 move instantly as I said before the 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.300
 resources that we will not need and that 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.060
 we have plenty of wood 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.010
 to go selling as well as stone and 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.560
 if they have food left over because 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.840
 resources that we have are being evaluated in 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.360
 other words loses the initial price 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.570
 each time they will buy resources at a lower 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.570
 price 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.490
 these types of attacks if they want they can 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.320
 combine it with true Beefeaters 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.389
 enemy another real bullet can you 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.460
 deal with for those who criticized 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.699
 always of this attack the la la la la la 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.699
 the 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.300
 and well we have here the lines 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.430
 this can all hope that you have 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.530
 liked the video for many who do not 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.310
 believe in our images now that what 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.160
 they sell a video 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.290
 I hope you create cataracts do not forget a 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.389
 video of a shows since this guy 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.760
 of attack requires that a player has 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.830
 a lot of practice and experience for which 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.980
 that is not learned by looking at a simple 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:10.169
 video is a matter of practice I have 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.270
 three years of play and I am an expert in 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:14.639
 the boom that's why it comes out so naturally 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.830
 so those that do not come out and 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:19.050
 they want to do it is a matter of practicing 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.850
 many students to the clan prisms 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.250
