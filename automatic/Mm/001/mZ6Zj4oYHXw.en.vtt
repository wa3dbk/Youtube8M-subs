00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.350
 Hello everyone, you're crazy artur and today I 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.019
 I will tell you about the principles of the battle on ltshkah 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.450
 urban setting is generally sick 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.880
 the theme of all people who start just 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.210
 ride lt never get in 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.939
 the city for them is all the losses I am 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.420
 everything is sad it looms again the city that in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.550
 media for starters let's draw once 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.359
 clear border between points 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.110
 classical and drum drums 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.440
 Now we will talk about ordinary ltshkah 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.620
 there is 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.730
 which most by example 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.290
 ru 251 . this is the most classic 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.280
 typical l . 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.280
 that is, you are not talking about selected ones 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.870
 how was that then there are 3 of us 90 t71 possible 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.670
 play drum 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.489
 Ie try concentrated 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.129
 always makaeva somewhere around the corner but for 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.590
 such as ore 71 task a little 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.729
 others to begin with my recommendation would be 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.310
 it is not flattery as if some screams 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.140
 close at the very beginning of the battle it is very 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.619
 sad for you and fast by the way 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.110
 end because usually these tricks 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.450
 are trying to take tyazh or st-shki who 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.030
 just can very quickly peck 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.860
 so you need to go somewhere more 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.799
 open space now what 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.500
 did and thanks to my gently program 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.070
 by color and a little warming on themselves 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.430
 batch a 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.890
 the boy went to the hangar in principle here 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.369
 merit no more than a kid on my arte 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.890
 261 of course well done reduced sap such 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.460
 grace flies to shine and 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.020
 just farted enough powerful such 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.780
 player on batchat which give already 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.680
 I forgot that the car is also a vanshotit 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.240
 stacks on the go 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.210
 Well, our time is a rarity so 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.840
 point number one does not get further than 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.409
 your allies especially at the beginning of the battle 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.119
 fad tight 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.880
 why actually stand near their 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:11.080
 allies first stand near them it 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.840
 so that when your enemy 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.540
 in this case the waffle differ on 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.489
 thicker allies like stress 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.010
 some heavy 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.470
 you were able to go out and deal damage as 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.480
 at least you and a little 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.940
 will help about your team take it apart 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.190
 as a maximum, carry the output on yourself and 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.560
 let me make a free-shot your 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.989
 allies here is the second point that is 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.750
 1 do not climb on the rampage immediately and do not climb 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.569
 first than your allies the second is 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.840
 when enemies who have been shot by the power we give them 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.579
 they are sho you are very important to know one 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.040
 fad 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.599
 in which most palms are inexperienced 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.180
 failed 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.609
 in no case can not interfere with their 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.650
 more serious and fat allies 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.200
 because they in the city will do much 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.420
 more than an altar as you will agree 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.049
 whatever nagibator but anyway 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.079
 Lt-Shka in the city very well let's say 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.950
 addicted to skiers if you god forbid 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.799
 interfere 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.950
 oh how bad have you done to your team 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.900
 if you rub on someone or 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.660
 I don't know there but do anything 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.180
 something to restrain there to disturb them 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.099
 move in some tight space 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.720
 if you are not sure that you can 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.790
 stand still and not disturb your 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.780
 allies better not meddle just stand 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.959
 and wait in the wings to do not disturb your 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.849
 allies and how not to meddle without your 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.540
 drive home it will cost but if you don’t 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.880
 stir in let it be sad all the same 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.639
 the main goal of ltshke in the city is 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.380
 distract the enemy, that is to say 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.450
 here yaga came across quite competently and 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.819
 she did not wait for me to eat now 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.940
 over the countries I immediately give a butt to 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.700
 I was pretty good at it because of this 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.739
 that is, it was unpleasant for him to play 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.730
 that is, well, the boy shoot at 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.410
 board russell. 2.3 l. throws it in 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.940
 very strongly influenced 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.980
 psychologically that is even if you are not 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.409
 bit of damage 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.180
 put all the same the fact that it is with 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.949
 different sides of whom you have it all 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.699
 lost can someone not break through 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.820
 scared something else then it is your 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.110
 the contribution of certain victory still gives 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.600
 I didn’t have time to shoot good like tigers 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.199
 who decided already a circle will shoot me 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.090
 reasonably 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.389
 I managed it we lit together with 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.889
 a point that is another fad like 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.750
 can help your allies this 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.660
 to breed the enemy that is to come to 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.490
 card doll while your second 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.620
 ally will be from the opposite side 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.190
 do the same thing actually 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.530
 breed but at the end of the fight when it seems to be 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.240
 predetermined the fate of this battle in 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.039
 In this case, this is of course a drain because 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.889
 what's on the opposite flank our 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.289
 allies mercilessly surrendered to 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.660
 ride to the maximum proper 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.570
 podamazhit and maybe pick a couple 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.120
 frags but here are a bit unlucky and 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.490
 got out on the stuffing that I threw on 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.240
 693 if not for fox then most likely I 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.360
 I had to take at least that's cleaner 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.160
 such a small training vidos hope 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.500
 at least some useful information 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.840
 which I tried to convey to you saying 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.030
 you will be set aside and then the future coat 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.220
 Here you can act in the city 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.500
 more effectively if you liked 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.840
 video or mine seemed useful 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.610
 tips like and subscribe to 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.270

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.700
 vidosiki 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.000
 also if for example you don't ride 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.099
 Ltshkah then show your brother how 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.630
 need to act in the city on the example we 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.630
 their vidos all good luck
