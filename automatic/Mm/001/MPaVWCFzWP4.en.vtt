Harman eccentric fireplace insert and
once<00:00:13.160> we<00:00:13.309> installed<00:00:13.700> this<00:00:13.879> thing<00:00:14.179> and<00:00:14.360> started

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
once we installed this thing and started

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.440 
once we installed this thing and started
using<00:00:15.200> it<00:00:15.410> to<00:00:15.530> heat<00:00:15.709> our<00:00:15.740> downstairs<00:00:16.400> our<00:00:16.730> oil

using it to heat our downstairs our oil

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.650 
using it to heat our downstairs our oil
bill<00:00:17.750> was<00:00:18.199> reduced<00:00:18.590> by<00:00:18.710> half<00:00:19.210> these<00:00:20.210> are<00:00:20.570> the

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
bill was reduced by half these are the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.410 
bill was reduced by half these are the
necessary<00:00:21.140> tools<00:00:21.670> it's<00:00:22.670> a<00:00:22.849> bit<00:00:23.000> of<00:00:23.090> a<00:00:23.179> job

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
necessary tools it's a bit of a job

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.269 
necessary tools it's a bit of a job
which<00:00:23.689> is<00:00:23.720> why<00:00:23.990> a<00:00:24.259> pellet<00:00:24.560> stove<00:00:24.740> is<00:00:24.920> not<00:00:25.070> for

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
which is why a pellet stove is not for

into<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.779> technicalities<00:00:30.199> of<00:00:30.560> how<00:00:30.830> it<00:00:30.980> works

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
into the technicalities of how it works

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.090 
into the technicalities of how it works
this<00:00:32.029> is<00:00:32.180> about<00:00:32.390> a<00:00:32.660> week's<00:00:33.200> worth<00:00:33.440> of<00:00:33.680> ashes

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
this is about a week's worth of ashes

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.250 
this is about a week's worth of ashes
you<00:00:34.250> can<00:00:34.400> use<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:35.210> stove<00:00:35.450> almost<00:00:35.840> a<00:00:35.930> full<00:00:36.230> week

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
you can use the stove almost a full week

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.860 
you can use the stove almost a full week
before<00:00:36.530> you<00:00:36.980> have<00:00:37.130> to<00:00:37.280> empty<00:00:37.430> out<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:38.030> ash<00:00:38.450> pan

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
before you have to empty out the ash pan

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.340 
before you have to empty out the ash pan
and<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.680> pellets<00:00:40.010> themselves<00:00:40.900> almost<00:00:41.900> empty

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
and the pellets themselves almost empty

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.830 
and the pellets themselves almost empty
this<00:00:43.160> is<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.370> hopper<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:43.880> I'll<00:00:44.630> show<00:00:44.810> you

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
this is the hopper and I'll show you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.450 
this is the hopper and I'll show you
these<00:00:45.020> another<00:00:45.290> time<00:00:45.500> it<00:00:45.860> takes<00:00:45.980> about<00:00:46.280> an

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
these another time it takes about an

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.640 
these another time it takes about an
entire<00:00:46.820> winter<00:00:47.300> season<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.930> fill<00:00:48.110> up<00:00:48.230> this<00:00:48.350> one

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
entire winter season to fill up this one

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.900 
entire winter season to fill up this one
can<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.790> ashes<00:00:50.630> so<00:00:51.230> this<00:00:51.650> is<00:00:51.770> already<00:00:52.070> a<00:00:52.190> couple

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
can of ashes so this is already a couple

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.380 
can of ashes so this is already a couple
of<00:00:52.970> times<00:00:53.120> in<00:00:57.280> that<00:00:58.280> can<00:00:58.460> be<00:00:58.550> added<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.910> compost

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
of times in that can be added to compost

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.180 
of times in that can be added to compost
later<00:00:59.630> just<00:00:59.960> not<00:01:00.140> all<00:01:00.290> in<00:01:00.410> one<00:01:00.440> clump<00:01:00.830> you<00:01:01.040> can

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
later just not all in one clump you can

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.670 
later just not all in one clump you can
layer<00:01:01.400> it<00:01:01.490> for<00:01:01.820> some<00:01:02.090> it<00:01:02.990> takes<00:01:03.140> about<00:01:03.260> 20

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
layer it for some it takes about 20

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.069 
layer it for some it takes about 20
minutes<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:04.119> vacuum<00:01:05.119> out<00:01:05.180> all<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.570> extra<00:01:05.899> ash

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079 
minutes to vacuum out all the extra ash

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.349 
minutes to vacuum out all the extra ash
about<00:01:06.859> once<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.189> month<00:01:07.219> when<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.820> performance

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:08.359 
about once a month when the performance

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.359 
about once a month when the performance
starts<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.750> go<00:01:08.869> down<00:01:09.079> and<00:01:09.320> these<00:01:09.799> fire<00:01:10.070> plates

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
starts to go down and these fire plates

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.560 
starts to go down and these fire plates
have<00:01:10.579> to<00:01:10.700> come<00:01:10.880> out<00:01:10.909> you<00:01:11.179> have<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:11.390> vacuum

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
have to come out you have to vacuum

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.410 
have to come out you have to vacuum
behind<00:01:12.140> there<00:01:12.469> and<00:01:12.679> once<00:01:13.429> a<00:01:13.579> season<00:01:13.789> you<00:01:14.299> have

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
behind there and once a season you have

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.480 
behind there and once a season you have
to<00:01:14.539> pull<00:01:14.719> the<00:01:14.840> whole<00:01:15.020> thing<00:01:15.350> out<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:15.770> do<00:01:16.460> a

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
to pull the whole thing out and do a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:35.540 
to pull the whole thing out and do a
relief

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.000 

okay<00:01:36.330> we've<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.780> everything<00:01:37.080> all<00:01:37.410> nice<00:01:37.710> and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
okay we've got everything all nice and

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.250 
okay we've got everything all nice and
clean<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.520> now<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.910> only<00:01:39.150> thing<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:40.020> add

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
clean so now the only thing is to add

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.440 
clean so now the only thing is to add
pillow<00:01:40.650> we've<00:01:41.250> got<00:01:41.400> lots<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.790> pellets<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.270> last

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
pillow we've got lots of pellets to last

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.670 
pillow we've got lots of pellets to last
us<00:01:42.600> through<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.840> winter<00:01:42.930> what<00:01:43.530> you're

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
us through the winter what you're

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.470 
us through the winter what you're
looking<00:01:43.950> at<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.430> about<00:01:44.640> four<00:01:45.090> tons

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
looking at here was about four tons

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.240 
looking at here was about four tons
rocks<00:01:46.080> a<00:01:46.170> little<00:01:46.350> bit<00:01:46.440> less<00:01:46.620> since<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:46.980> started

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
rocks a little bit less since we started

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.230 
rocks a little bit less since we started
heating<00:01:47.940> this<00:01:48.060> winter<00:01:48.620> so<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:50.820> cost<00:01:51.060> of

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
heating this winter so the cost of

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.030 
heating this winter so the cost of
pellets<00:01:51.570> has<00:01:51.930> gone<00:01:52.170> up<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.500> little<00:01:52.710> bit<00:01:52.830> with

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
pellets has gone up a little bit with

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.890 
pellets has gone up a little bit with
the<00:01:53.160> recession<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:54.060> it's<00:01:54.420> sort<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.720> tied

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
the recession because it's sort of tied

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.720 
the recession because it's sort of tied
to<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.290> building<00:01:55.740> industry<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:56.580> the

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
to the building industry because the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.270 
to the building industry because the
pellets<00:01:57.000> are<00:01:57.120> generated<00:01:57.600> from<00:01:57.720> sawdust<00:01:58.350> but

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
pellets are generated from sawdust but

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.970 
pellets are generated from sawdust but
even<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.150> it's<00:02:00.570> nowhere<00:02:00.960> near<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.320> volatility

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
even so it's nowhere near the volatility

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.690 
even so it's nowhere near the volatility
of<00:02:02.010> oil<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.170> it's<00:02:04.170> still<00:02:04.470> only<00:02:04.860> running<00:02:05.580> us

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
of oil and it's still only running us

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.180 
of oil and it's still only running us
about<00:02:05.970> half<00:02:06.480> of<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.780> cost<00:02:07.050> of<00:02:07.680> what<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:07.950> used

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
about half of the cost of what we used

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.310 
about half of the cost of what we used
to<00:02:08.280> spend<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.970> heat<00:02:09.420> our<00:02:09.450> house<00:02:09.720> every<00:02:10.050> winter
