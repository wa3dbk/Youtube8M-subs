that he just finished giving lessons to
fray<00:05:23.370> so<00:05:23.850> I<00:05:24.560> mean<00:05:26.330> they'll<00:05:27.330> probably<00:05:27.660> improve

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
fray so I mean they'll probably improve

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.780 
fray so I mean they'll probably improve
from<00:05:28.290> there<00:05:28.530> you<00:05:28.800> know<00:05:28.950> they'd<00:05:29.310> get<00:05:29.550> some

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
from there you know they'd get some

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.680 
from there you know they'd get some
lessons<00:05:30.200> um<00:05:31.520> nothing<00:05:32.520> there<00:05:32.880> all<00:05:33.000> right<00:05:33.210> if

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
lessons um nothing there all right if

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.710 
lessons um nothing there all right if
they<00:05:34.500> play<00:05:34.830> their<00:05:34.980> game<00:05:35.160> I<00:05:35.430> guess<00:05:35.730> be

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
they play their game I guess be

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.030 
they play their game I guess be
interesting<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.140> see<00:05:37.260> how<00:05:37.350> they<00:05:37.440> transition

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
interesting to see how they transition

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.430

from<00:05:38.070> online<00:05:38.610> tool<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.450> they<00:05:40.110> got<00:05:40.230> a<00:05:40.260> lot<00:05:40.380> of

from online tool and they got a lot of
inexperienced<00:05:41.070> players<00:05:41.280> i<00:05:41.430> guess<00:05:41.550> you<00:05:41.700> could

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
inexperienced players i guess you could

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.230 
they I guess you put their gameplay see
if<00:05:46.110> they<00:05:46.230> can<00:05:46.380> bring<00:05:46.500> it<00:05:46.680> here<00:05:47.060> they<00:05:48.060> got<00:05:48.210> a
