00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.485
 Father in Heaven 

00:00:07.526 --> 00:00:12.764
 We hear your precious name 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:18.010
 Of course a name is just a word 

00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:28.000
 And it can be forgotten after you hear it. 

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:34.372
 But a name was spoken even before the day of creation 

00:00:34.373 --> 00:00:41.219
 And he'll be here when it all comes to an end. 

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:45.108
 Delivered from the lips of God 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.559
 To the ears of Mary on the wings of the angel 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.904
 Jesus (Jesus) 

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:55.028
 Jesus 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.000
 The name that gave us life for us 

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.806
 The song that all creation sings 

00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:08.000
 Jesus (Jesus) Oh Jesus 

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:16.000
 The proudest of the nations came and went 

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:23.360
 Jesus, his name lives 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.012
 When I'm woken up by a nightmare 

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:38.900
 A desperation holds me and grabs me 

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:45.558
 When I'm scared and I do not know what to pray 

00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:53.333
 I just say, and I feel the fear is gone. 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.000
 Delivered from the lips of God 

00:01:57.176 --> 00:02:00.500
 To the ears of Mary on the wings of the angel 

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:07.449
 Jesus (Jesus) Sweet Jesus 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.915
 The name that gave us life for us 

00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:14.505
 The song that all creation sings 

00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:19.822
 Jesus (Jesus) Oh Jesus 

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:28.000
 The proudest of the nations came and went 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:35.161
 Jesus, his name lives 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.200
 Eternal hope and promise 

00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:41.680
 Dawn will end 

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:44.700
 and when it's over 

00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:50.917
 His name will live 

00:02:51.322 --> 00:02:54.956
 Delivered from the lips of God 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.146
 To the ears of Mary on the wings of the angel 

00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:06.019
 Jesus (Jesus) 

00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:09.000
 The Name that gave his life for our sake 

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:13.017
 The song that all creation sings 

00:03:13.018 --> 00:03:18.841
 Jesus (Jesus) Sweet Jesus 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.448
 The proudest of the nations came and went 

00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:32.681
 Jesus, his name lives 

00:03:32.684 --> 00:03:39.987
 The proudest of the nations came and went 

00:03:40.658 --> 00:03:52.924
 Jesus, his name lives 

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:15.394
