always stuck close to the new maximum

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.270 
always stuck close to the new maximum
portion<00:01:20.180> like<00:01:20.450> two<00:01:20.780> ounces<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.410> protein<00:01:21.619> other

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
portion like two ounces of protein other

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.609 
portion like two ounces of protein other
schools<00:01:22.700> exceeded<00:01:23.330> it<00:01:23.450> more<00:01:24.140> often<00:01:24.290> than<00:01:24.590> not

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
schools exceeded it more often than not

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.160 
schools exceeded it more often than not
and<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:25.550> then<00:01:25.970> their<00:01:26.300> portion<00:01:26.630> sizes<00:01:26.990> this

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
and so then their portion sizes this

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.649 
and so then their portion sizes this
year<00:01:27.380> cannot<00:01:27.950> exceed<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.550> two<00:01:28.729> ounce<00:01:28.940> of<00:01:29.180> the

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.139 
year cannot exceed the two ounce of the
protein<00:01:30.080> so<00:01:30.800> our<00:01:31.520> students<00:01:32.030> aren't

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
protein so our students aren't

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.820

necessarily<00:01:32.210> seeing<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.170> different<00:01:33.470> size<00:01:33.680> of
