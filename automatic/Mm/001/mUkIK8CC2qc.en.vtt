click<00:00:42.150> up<00:00:42.300> gives<00:00:42.540> us<00:00:42.630> a<00:00:42.720> little<00:00:42.840> bit<00:00:43.580> little

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
click up gives us a little bit little

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.740 
click up gives us a little bit little
bit<00:00:44.670> little<00:00:45.230> distortion<00:00:46.230> from<00:00:46.380> the<00:00:46.500> pre<00:00:47.750> which

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
bit little distortion from the pre which

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.240 
bit little distortion from the pre which
in<00:00:48.870> some<00:00:49.050> instances<00:00:49.500> might<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.040> nice

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
in some instances might be kind of nice

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.730 
in some instances might be kind of nice
I<00:00:50.580> mean<00:00:50.700> there's<00:00:50.940> some<00:00:51.780> classic<00:00:52.200> Led<00:00:52.380> Zepplin

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
I mean there's some classic Led Zepplin

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.140 
I mean there's some classic Led Zepplin
tones<00:00:53.010> where<00:00:53.250> you've<00:00:53.370> got<00:00:53.580> some<00:00:53.610> pre

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
tones where you've got some pre

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.960 
tones where you've got some pre
distortion<00:00:54.830> and<00:00:55.830> you<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.220> go<00:00:56.310> crazy<00:00:56.520> I'll

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
distortion and you can go crazy I'll

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.630 
distortion and you can go crazy I'll
show<00:00:57.240> you

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.870 

you

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.670 

so<00:01:10.780> that's<00:01:10.930> actually<00:01:11.049> an<00:01:11.350> additional

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
so that's actually an additional

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.929 
so that's actually an additional
distortion<00:01:12.580> from<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.759> prayer

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.270 

our<00:01:18.840> output<00:01:19.259> sensitivity<00:01:19.829> here<00:01:20.039> as<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
our output sensitivity here as the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.959 
our output sensitivity here as the
volume<00:01:20.579> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> our<00:01:21.179> D<00:01:21.329> aw<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:23.009> that's

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
volume going to our D aw and I that's

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.550 
volume going to our D aw and I that's
full<00:01:24.299> out<00:01:24.479> I'm<00:01:24.689> coming<00:01:25.049> back<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.259> bit<00:01:25.530> here

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
full out I'm coming back a bit here

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.190 
full out I'm coming back a bit here
because<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.670> that's<00:01:27.030> too<00:01:27.299> much<00:01:27.450> gain<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:28.079> me

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
because I that's too much gain for me

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.499 
because I that's too much gain for me
and<00:01:28.500> that's<00:01:28.710> too<00:01:28.950> little<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.490> I'm<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and that's too little so I'm here and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.789 
and that's too little so I'm here and
I'm<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.810> allowing<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.289> little<00:01:31.530> bit<00:01:31.679> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
I'm just allowing a little bit of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.469 
I'm just allowing a little bit of
freedom<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.250> movement<00:01:32.429> here<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.359> don't

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
freedom of movement here so I don't

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.779 
freedom of movement here so I don't
distort<00:01:33.929> my<00:01:34.469> signal<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:34.979> into<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.399> W

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
distort my signal going into my do W

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:42.620 
distort my signal going into my do W
we've<00:01:36.539> got<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> level<00:01:36.929> set<00:01:40.429> we<00:01:41.429> have<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> 57<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.359> on

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
we've got a level set we have a 57 on on

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.529 
we've got a level set we have a 57 on on
the<00:01:42.780> cab<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:46.700> pretty<00:01:47.700> good<00:01:47.849> level<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.420> might

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
the cab here pretty good level you might

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:49.699 
the cab here pretty good level you might
be<00:01:48.659> able<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> give<00:01:48.929> it<00:01:48.959> a<00:01:49.049> little<00:01:49.259> tiny<00:01:49.500> bit

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
be able to give it a little tiny bit
