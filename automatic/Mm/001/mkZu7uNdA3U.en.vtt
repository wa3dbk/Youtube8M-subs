one two three four five six lift pump

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:34.160 
one two three four five six lift pump
raw<00:00:31.850> all<00:00:32.850> righty<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.450> got<00:00:33.570> covers<00:00:33.899> off<00:00:34.020> so

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
raw all righty so I got covers off so

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.930 
raw all righty so I got covers off so
you<00:00:34.290> see<00:00:34.440> inside<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> bottom<00:00:35.670> there<00:00:35.820> where

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
you see inside in the bottom there where

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
you see inside in the bottom there where
the<00:00:36.030> lift<00:00:36.180> pump<00:00:36.360> goes<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.950> like<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> camshaft

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the lift pump goes is a like a camshaft

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
the lift pump goes is a like a camshaft
which<00:00:38.879> runs<00:00:39.149> all<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.390> way<00:00:39.690> along<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> length

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
which runs all the way along the length

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.240 
which runs all the way along the length
down<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> bottom<00:00:40.800> Matt<00:00:41.480> very<00:00:42.480> much<00:00:42.780> very<00:00:43.250> not

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
down the bottom Matt very much very not

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.920 
down the bottom Matt very much very not
a<00:00:44.280> crankshaft<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.059> camshaft<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.780> don't

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
a crankshaft but a camshaft you don't

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.319 
a crankshaft but a camshaft you don't
see<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.200> elope<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:49.550> as<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.850> spin<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
see it elope in there as you spin the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.520 
see it elope in there as you spin the
pump<00:00:51.570> or<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> engine<00:00:52.530> spins<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.949> pump<00:00:54.230> all<00:00:55.230> of

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
pump or the engine spins the pump all of

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.849 
pump or the engine spins the pump all of
that<00:00:56.629> well<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> fuel<00:00:57.989> gets<00:00:58.140> firstly<00:00:58.649> picked

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
that well the fuel gets firstly picked

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.410 
that well the fuel gets firstly picked
up<00:00:58.980> by<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.160> lift<00:00:59.370> pump<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.879> gets<00:01:00.030> pumped<00:01:00.329> up

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
up by the lift pump and gets pumped up

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.389 
up by the lift pump and gets pumped up
to<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:00.719> which<00:01:01.260> goes<00:01:01.500> into<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> top<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.129> what

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
to here which goes into the top of what

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.030 
to here which goes into the top of what
I<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.670> called<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> rack<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.920> then<00:01:04.920> as

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
I think is called the rack and then as

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.370 
I think is called the rack and then as
it<00:01:05.189> spins<00:01:07.220> each<00:01:08.220> little<00:01:08.580> piston<00:01:09.260> pushes<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
it spins each little piston pushes the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.450 
it spins each little piston pushes the
fuel<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.799> towards<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.520> new<00:01:11.729> jet<00:01:11.939> report<00:01:13.460> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
fuel up towards the new jet report and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.560 
fuel up towards the new jet report and
then<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.970> out<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> inject<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:17.570> okay

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
then up and out to the inject up okay

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.539 
then up and out to the inject up okay
now<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> governor<00:01:19.409> end<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:22.170> know

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
now this is the governor end you know

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:36.870 
now this is the governor end you know
get<00:01:23.549> my<00:01:23.670> hammer<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:23.970> get<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.390> off<00:01:24.570> carefully

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:48.010 

maybe<00:01:37.880> there's<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.149> bit<00:01:38.299> more<00:01:39.909> ah<00:01:43.479> whoops<00:01:47.020> oil

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
maybe there's a bit more ah whoops oil

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.819 
maybe there's a bit more ah whoops oil
everywhere

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
everywhere

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.029 
everywhere
uh<00:01:50.079> okay<00:01:51.079> besides<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.500> fact<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:51.710> just<00:01:51.860> made

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
uh okay besides the fact that just made

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.200 
uh okay besides the fact that just made
a<00:01:52.069> big<00:01:52.280> mess<00:01:52.429> huh

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
a big mess huh

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.289 
a big mess huh
that's<00:01:54.079> your<00:01:54.229> fuel<00:01:54.469> cut<00:01:54.679> lever<00:01:54.969> and<00:01:55.969> you'll

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
that's your fuel cut lever and you'll

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.209 
that's your fuel cut lever and you'll
see<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:56.689> that's<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.530> rack<00:01:57.709> there<00:01:58.009> that's

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
see that that's the rack there that's

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.459 
see that that's the rack there that's
what<00:01:58.399> governs<00:01:59.270> how<00:01:59.420> much<00:01:59.600> fuel<00:01:59.929> actually<00:02:00.079> goes

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
what governs how much fuel actually goes

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.550 
what governs how much fuel actually goes
into<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.069> engine<00:02:01.399> from<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.670> pump<00:02:02.439> losing<00:02:03.439> it

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
into the engine from the pump losing it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.370 
into the engine from the pump losing it
off<00:02:03.679> formations<00:02:04.159> yeah<00:02:05.200> there's<00:02:06.200> your

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
off formations yeah there's your

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.779 
off formations yeah there's your
flyweight<00:02:08.200> just<00:02:09.200> like<00:02:09.380> an<00:02:09.530> old<00:02:09.709> steam<00:02:10.399> engine

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
flyweight just like an old steam engine

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.940 
flyweight just like an old steam engine
the<00:02:10.880> weights<00:02:11.060> fly<00:02:11.390> up<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.840> push<00:02:12.709> on<00:02:12.920> the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
the weights fly up and push on the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.610 
the weights fly up and push on the
governor<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.140> yeah<00:02:16.780> it's<00:02:17.780> got<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.110> spring

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
governor and so yeah it's got to spring

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.830 
governor and so yeah it's got to spring
loaded<00:02:21.940> know<00:02:22.940> what<00:02:23.120> you'd<00:02:23.239> call<00:02:23.450> them<00:02:23.599> they're

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
loaded know what you'd call them they're

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.030 
loaded know what you'd call them they're
adjustable<00:02:24.230> at<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.470> back<00:02:24.620> there<00:02:24.829> but<00:02:24.950> they're

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
adjustable at the back there but they're

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.250 
adjustable at the back there but they're
spring-loaded<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.599> more<00:02:26.810> those<00:02:26.959> weights

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
spring-loaded so the more those weights

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.690 
spring-loaded so the more those weights
move<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.910> more<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:30.220> governor<00:02:31.220> pushes<00:02:31.549> on

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
move the more the governor pushes on

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.869 
move the more the governor pushes on
that<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:33.110> push<00:02:33.319> on<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.590> rack<00:02:33.799> to<00:02:34.370> increase<00:02:34.700> the

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
that to push on the rack to increase the

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.690 
that to push on the rack to increase the
fuel<00:02:35.060> or<00:02:35.269> decrease<00:02:35.890> now<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:36.920> said<00:02:37.310> that's<00:02:37.489> fuel

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
fuel or decrease now I said that's fuel

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.629 
fuel or decrease now I said that's fuel
cut<00:02:37.940> that's<00:02:38.150> stop<00:02:38.480> altogether<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.459> more

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
cut that's stop altogether and the more

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.300 
cut that's stop altogether and the more
that<00:02:40.790> goes<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.120> way<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.420> more<00:02:41.569> fuel<00:02:41.870> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
that goes that way the more fuel the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.330 
that goes that way the more fuel the
governor<00:02:43.310> will<00:02:43.430> let<00:02:43.609> in<00:02:44.859> so<00:02:45.859> that<00:02:45.980> means<00:02:46.160> by

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
governor will let in so that means by

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.699 
governor will let in so that means by
adjusting<00:02:46.850> these<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.359> could<00:02:47.510> adjust<00:02:47.780> how

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
adjusting these you could adjust how

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.160 
adjusting these you could adjust how
much<00:02:48.739> fuel<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.310> injected<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.760> think<00:02:50.170> there's

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
much fuel is injected I think there's

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.400 
much fuel is injected I think there's
