to a fuel bladder that I'm running with
the<00:00:17.740> Y<00:00:18.190> s120<00:00:19.090> engine<00:00:19.540> had<00:00:20.500> a<00:00:20.530> lot<00:00:20.710> of<00:00:20.740> questions

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
best way to show the system would be to

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.410 
best way to show the system would be to
do<00:00:25.810> just<00:00:26.050> a<00:00:26.140> really<00:00:26.410> quick<00:00:26.530> video<00:00:27.330> here<00:00:28.330> are

kind<00:01:55.359> of<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.569> diagonal<00:01:56.169> pattern<00:01:56.429> and<00:01:57.429> this<00:01:57.549> is

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
kind of a diagonal pattern and this is

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.859 
kind of a diagonal pattern and this is
going<00:01:57.849> to<00:01:57.939> allow<00:01:58.649> fuel<00:01:59.649> line<00:01:59.889> to<00:02:00.700> get<00:02:00.869> fuel

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
going to allow fuel line to get fuel

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.580 
going to allow fuel line to get fuel
from<00:02:02.169> pretty<00:02:02.560> much<00:02:02.679> any<00:02:02.979> angle<00:02:03.779> so<00:02:04.779> we've<00:02:05.380> got

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
from pretty much any angle so we've got

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.680 
from pretty much any angle so we've got
one<00:02:06.310> hole<00:02:06.549> there<00:02:07.080> do<00:02:08.080> another<00:02:08.289> one<00:02:08.530> here<00:02:09.690> on

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
one hole there do another one here on

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.140 
one hole there do another one here on
the<00:02:10.840> opposite<00:02:11.230> side<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.820> is<00:02:12.940> going<00:02:13.060> to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
the opposite side and this is going to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.080 
the opposite side and this is going to
run<00:02:13.360> down<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.780> length<00:02:13.960> of<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.290> fuel<00:02:14.500> tubing

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
run down the length of the fuel tubing

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.360 
run down the length of the fuel tubing
again<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.200> fuel<00:02:17.440> tubing<00:02:17.769> length<00:02:17.980> is<00:02:18.129> going<00:02:18.310> to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
again the fuel tubing length is going to

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.850 
again the fuel tubing length is going to
depend<00:02:18.459> on<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.879> size<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.269> balloon<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:20.349> so

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
depend on the size of the balloon and so

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.270 
depend on the size of the balloon and so
you<00:02:21.370> kind<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.700> get<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.940> picture<00:02:22.300> as<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:23.319> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
you kind of get the picture as to the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.979 
you kind of get the picture as to the
holes<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.060> that's<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.360> course<00:02:25.510> going<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.840> run

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
holes and that's of course going to run

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.250 
holes and that's of course going to run
down<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.410> length<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:27.640> tube<00:02:28.110> once<00:02:29.110> you've

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
down the length of the tube once you've

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.040 
down the length of the tube once you've
done<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:30.330> you're<00:02:31.330> basically<00:02:31.660> going<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.900> take

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
done that you're basically going to take

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.860 
done that you're basically going to take
the<00:02:32.200> balloon<00:02:32.430> you're<00:02:33.430> going<00:02:33.549> to<00:02:33.610> insert<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
the balloon you're going to insert the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.199 
the balloon you're going to insert the
balloon<00:02:35.080> into<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:36.580> tube<00:02:36.760> into<00:02:37.030> the

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
balloon into the the tube into the

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.199 
balloon into the the tube into the
balloon<00:02:37.390> as<00:02:37.870> such<00:02:38.670> with<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.790> tube<00:02:39.970> in<00:02:40.120> there

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
balloon as such with the tube in there

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.339 
balloon as such with the tube in there
as<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:40.420> can<00:02:40.540> see<00:02:40.690> stretch<00:02:40.989> it<00:02:41.140> out<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.230> little

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
as you can see stretch it out a little

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.050 
as you can see stretch it out a little
bit<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:43.390> is<00:02:43.569> going<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.900> go<00:02:44.019> on<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.530> your

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
bit this is going to go on to your

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.780 
bit this is going to go on to your
grommet<00:02:46.060> here<00:02:46.450> your<00:02:46.989> fuel<00:02:47.260> nipple<00:02:47.590> going<00:02:48.489> into

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
grommet here your fuel nipple going into

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.479 
grommet here your fuel nipple going into
the<00:02:48.880> tank<00:02:49.150> whichever<00:02:49.510> tank<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.989> may<00:02:50.140> be<00:02:50.489> in

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
the tank whichever tank it may be in

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.780 
the tank whichever tank it may be in
this<00:02:51.700> case<00:02:51.910> it's<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.360> would<00:02:52.750> be<00:02:52.840> in<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.019> whiplash

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
this case it's it would be in a whiplash

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.000 
this case it's it would be in a whiplash
nitro<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:55.000> don't<00:02:55.989> have<00:02:56.140> an<00:02:56.319> extra<00:02:56.560> fuel<00:02:56.769> tank

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
nitro I don't have an extra fuel tank

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.289 
nitro I don't have an extra fuel tank
here<00:02:57.280> but<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:58.269> do<00:02:58.750> have<00:02:58.959> this<00:02:59.019> little<00:03:00.299> plastic

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
here but I do have this little plastic

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.930 
here but I do have this little plastic
piece<00:03:01.690> here<00:03:01.930> basically<00:03:02.769> just<00:03:03.160> for<00:03:03.370> again<00:03:03.670> for

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
piece here basically just for again for

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.479 
piece here basically just for again for
just<00:03:04.150> video<00:03:05.110> sake<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:06.040> is<00:03:06.220> going<00:03:06.430> to

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
just video sake this is going to

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.490 
just video sake this is going to
illustrate<00:03:07.090> kind<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.629> how<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.900> goes<00:03:08.079> into<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
illustrate kind of how it goes into the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.759 
illustrate kind of how it goes into the
tank<00:03:08.739> like<00:03:09.459> such<00:03:09.930> once<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.140> gets<00:03:11.319> inflated

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
tank like such once this gets inflated

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.520 
tank like such once this gets inflated
with<00:03:12.010> air<00:03:12.280> it's<00:03:13.120> going<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.540> excel<00:03:13.959> with<00:03:14.230> fuel

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
with air it's going to excel with fuel

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.369 
with air it's going to excel with fuel
rather<00:03:14.739> it's<00:03:14.980> going<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.340> expand<00:03:15.819> once<00:03:16.569> before

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
rather it's going to expand once before

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.289 
rather it's going to expand once before
you<00:03:17.560> actually<00:03:17.739> put<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:18.250> fuel<00:03:18.549> into<00:03:19.269> the

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
you actually put the fuel into the

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.210 
you actually put the fuel into the
balloon<00:03:19.750> what<00:03:20.440> you're<00:03:20.620> going<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.829> want<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.100> do

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
balloon what you're going to want to do

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.190 
balloon what you're going to want to do
is<00:03:21.489> take<00:03:21.790> these<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.540> up<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.980> syringe<00:03:24.370> here

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
is take these this up the syringe here

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.270 
is take these this up the syringe here
insert<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.500> you're<00:03:26.920> going<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.100> want<00:03:27.220> to

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
insert it and you're going to want to

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.090 
insert it and you're going to want to
suck<00:03:27.639> out<00:03:27.850> all<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.750> air<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.680> basically

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
suck out all of the air this basically

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.390 
suck out all of the air this basically
gives<00:03:30.220> it<00:03:30.609> an<00:03:30.760> air<00:03:31.030> free<00:03:31.480> system<00:03:32.230> which<00:03:33.069> is<00:03:33.220> why

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
gives it an air free system which is why

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.030 
gives it an air free system which is why
it<00:03:33.459> does<00:03:33.849> run<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:34.420> much<00:03:34.599> better<00:03:34.900> as<00:03:35.109> opposed<00:03:35.889> to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
it does run so much better as opposed to

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.819 
it does run so much better as opposed to
something<00:03:36.310> like<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.609> fuel<00:03:37.030> magnet<00:03:37.510> or<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.959> bubble

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
something like a fuel magnet or a bubble

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.430 
something like a fuel magnet or a bubble
is<00:03:39.069> clunk<00:03:39.370> or<00:03:39.549> anything<00:03:39.849> like<00:03:39.880> that<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.440> making

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
is clunk or anything like that so making

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.030 
is clunk or anything like that so making
the<00:03:41.560> system<00:03:42.090> completely<00:03:43.319> void<00:03:44.319> of<00:03:44.530> air<00:03:44.829> is

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
the system completely void of air is

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.080 
the system completely void of air is
what<00:03:45.880> adds<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.510> performance<00:03:47.319> increase<00:03:48.090> so

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
what adds the performance increase so

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.800 
what adds the performance increase so
with<00:03:49.239> that<00:03:49.389> being<00:03:49.599> said<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:50.410> is<00:03:51.280> how<00:03:51.639> you

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
with that being said that is how you

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.539 
with that being said that is how you
will<00:03:52.810> make<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:52.989> fuel<00:03:53.319> bladder<00:03:53.530> system<00:03:53.980> if

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
will make a fuel bladder system if

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.520 
will make a fuel bladder system if
anyone<00:03:54.910> has<00:03:55.030> any<00:03:55.239> questions<00:03:55.269> you<00:03:56.079> can<00:03:56.109> shoot
