00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.960
 hey what everyone says be 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.790
 writing the booklet to show a 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.160
 method where you can download videos and 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.809
 music from youtube since enough 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.940
 people have been asking me for 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.580
 the facebook page by a method 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.740
 safe and easy the application that we are going to 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.449
 occupy is called snap tuc and it does not 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.310
 find in the place thor vais to have 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.510
 that download it directly from the forum 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.670
 of X's age is where I 've 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.410
 got it installed it is like any 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.239
 another regular application once 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.090
 installed let's go inside it 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.860
 and as you can see we have the more or less the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.520
 same interface that youtube have 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.469
 categories the top popular videos and a 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.230
 youtube search engine where you are going to be able 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.480
 look for a specific video either by 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.070
 a name for example let's apply 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.090
 to the lupita and let's write a name 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.649
 specifically I do not know videos videos by 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.199
 example in for key let's write 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.809
 because we are going to select the second 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.070
 option and as you see here we see all 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.440
 the list of videos 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.200
 related to this name we are going to 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.440
 select for example this option of 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.240
 this transformers trailer and how do you see 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.310
 at the bottom we have this option 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.110
 to be able to download and we have the option 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.660
 of audio that we are going to see it a little bit 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.770
 later we have these three options 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.830
 that we can download the videos to 360 480 and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.170
 to 720 the bad thing is that we will not be able to 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.630
 download the videos in 1080p or more than 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.670
 are 1080 to all the videos you go 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.479
 to be able to download 720 we are going to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.220
 select this option from 720 and as 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.450
 they're already starting to come down on the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.450
 Notification bar 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.570
 and since it's already finished downloading we're going 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.500
 to play the video if it works 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.500
 correctly 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.130
 and to download the audio is already a bit 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.530
 simpler let's select by 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.120
 example this video we are going to go to the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.080
 part of downloads and we will select 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.310
 the first option that is audio or mp3 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.720
 we are going to select it and as you can see 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.850
 is beginning to fall is 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.590
 turning what is a bit more 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.570
 fast that the video nothing else is the audio 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.700
 as you see there we will hope that 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.490
 finish to play and see 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.720
 that works correctly as you see 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.720
 finalized let's open 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.290
 and this was the simplest method 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.970
 I could find to download videos and 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.860
 music from youtube 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.720

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.440
