00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
if you don't do it correctly it could be

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.050 
if you don't do it correctly it could be
you<00:00:14.070> really<00:00:15.590> you<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.980> should<00:00:17.760> really<00:00:17.970> know

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
which means for most people that just

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.740 
which means for most people that just
find<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.570> easier<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.260> work<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:23.480> you<00:00:24.480> know<00:00:24.600> we

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
our system but if you're not going to do

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.010 
our system but if you're not going to do
that<00:00:35.670> you're<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> try<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.420> attempt<00:00:36.840> this

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that you're going to try to attempt this

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.580 
that you're going to try to attempt this
on<00:00:37.260> your<00:00:37.440> own<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.510> first<00:00:39.950> word<00:00:40.950> wisdom<00:00:41.430> is

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
on your own the first word wisdom is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
on your own the first word wisdom is
don't<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:43.739> greedy<00:00:44.840> start<00:00:45.840> low<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.590> move<00:00:47.309> up

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
don't get greedy start low and move up

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.439 
don't get greedy start low and move up
very<00:00:47.969> gradually<00:00:48.750> because<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:51.000> may<00:00:51.180> try

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
very gradually because you may try

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.450 
very gradually because you may try
something<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.899> feel<00:00:52.110> good<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.649> four<00:00:53.250> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
something and feel good for four to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.880 
something and feel good for four to
three<00:00:53.640> days<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.149> then<00:00:54.300> crash<00:00:54.660> hard<00:00:54.989> or<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
three days and then crash hard or and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.220 
three days and then crash hard or and
you<00:00:56.059> very<00:00:57.059> easily<00:00:57.149> will<00:00:57.600> think<00:00:57.840> well<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you very easily will think well if a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.020 
you very easily will think well if a
little<00:00:58.500> bit<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:58.829> good<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> lot<00:00:59.489> will<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.699> better

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
little bit was good a lot will be better

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.930 
little bit was good a lot will be better
but<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> lot<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.920> these<00:01:02.129> biochemical

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
but for a lot of these biochemical

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.149 
but for a lot of these biochemical
mechanisms<00:01:03.600> there's<00:01:03.899> threshold<00:01:04.500> doses<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
mechanisms there's threshold doses and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.890 
mechanisms there's threshold doses and
you<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.460> over<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> certain<00:01:06.090> amount<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.720> then

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
you get over a certain amount and then

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.020 
you get over a certain amount and then
boom<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.380> system<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.369> starts<00:01:08.670> throwing

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
boom the system just starts throwing

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.109 
boom the system just starts throwing
stuff<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.040> haven't<00:01:11.369> organized

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
stuff out and if you haven't organized

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.140 
stuff out and if you haven't organized
the<00:01:12.360> whole<00:01:12.540> system<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.200> ready<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:13.770> that

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
the whole system to be ready for that

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.109 
the whole system to be ready for that
you<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.360> get<00:01:15.509> yourself<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:16.170> trouble<00:01:16.610> but<00:01:17.610> you

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
you can get yourself in trouble but you

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.420 
you can get yourself in trouble but you
know<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.509> are<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.619> main<00:01:19.979> things

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
know if you are to do it the main things

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.920 
know if you are to do it the main things
are<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.970> make<00:01:21.119> sure<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.540> you've<00:01:21.720> got<00:01:21.750> good

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930

intestinal<00:01:32.610> health<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.600> start<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.259> them

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
intestinal health if you start with them

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.690 
intestinal health if you start with them
you<00:01:36.210> will<00:01:36.900> not<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:37.710> yourself<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.520> much

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
you will not get yourself in so much

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.899 
you will not get yourself in so much
trouble<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.390> then<00:01:40.049> once<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.610> spend<00:01:41.610> some

trouble and then once you spend some

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.630 
trouble and then once you spend some
time<00:01:42.210> maybe<00:01:42.750> two<00:01:43.290> months<00:01:43.649> doing<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.220> then

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
time maybe two months doing that then

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.050 
time maybe two months doing that then
you<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:45.000> go<00:01:45.180> into<00:01:46.310> trying<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> turn<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you can go into trying to turn up the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.389 
you can go into trying to turn up the
glutathione<00:01:48.390> system<00:01:49.229> maybe<00:01:49.829> feed<00:01:50.220> in

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
glutathione system maybe feed in
