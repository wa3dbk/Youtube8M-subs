00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.870 
printing and why it's really that much
better<00:00:10.050> than<00:00:10.200> really<00:00:10.980> anybody<00:00:11.400> else<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.820> I

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
better than really anybody else that I

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.940 
better than really anybody else that I
know<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.480> does<00:00:12.690> it<00:00:12.870> by<00:00:13.200> themselves<00:00:13.799> that's

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
know that does it by themselves that's

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.460 
know that does it by themselves that's
not<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> huge<00:00:14.639> major<00:00:14.880> company<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:16.230> think

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
not a huge major company and I think

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.320 
not a huge major company and I think
mine<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:17.039> even<00:00:17.369> compare<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.820> those<00:00:18.119> big

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
mine can even compare to those big

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.820 
mine can even compare to those big
companies<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.410> might<00:00:19.560> get<00:00:19.710> your

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
companies that you might get your

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.550 
companies that you might get your

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
stickers printed by so my stickers

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.679 
stickers printed by so my stickers
usually<00:00:22.980> run<00:00:23.160> about<00:00:23.369> $12<00:00:24.119> for<00:00:24.330> 100<00:00:25.580> that<00:00:26.580> is

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
usually run about $12 for 100 that is

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.839 
usually run about $12 for 100 that is
including<00:00:28.010> what<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.039> might<00:00:29.400> want<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.670> call

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
lamination but it is way better than

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.330 
lamination but it is way better than
that<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.340> seal<00:00:32.669> all<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.180> my<00:00:33.329> stickers<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:34.380> UV

four or five of these that are still

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.580 
four or five of these that are still
rockin<00:00:48.000> after<00:00:48.329> two<00:00:48.629> years<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.379> weather

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
rockin after two years and the weather

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.660 
rockin after two years and the weather
and<00:00:50.539> you<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:51.899> has<00:00:52.590> been<00:00:52.890> some<00:00:53.100> change

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
and you know there has been some change

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.510 
and you know there has been some change
between<00:00:53.910> my<00:00:54.360> methods<00:00:54.809> over<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.800> past<00:00:56.070> month

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
between my methods over the past month

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.849 
between my methods over the past month
at<00:00:56.789> least<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:58.199> upped<00:00:58.620> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
at least like I really have upped it

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.040 
at least like I really have upped it
because<00:00:59.219> I've<00:00:59.399> had<00:00:59.579> some<00:00:59.879> mixed<00:01:00.539> results<00:01:00.660> with

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
because I've had some mixed results with

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.599 
because I've had some mixed results with
some<00:01:01.079> things<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.739> since<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.219> am<00:01:02.370> printing

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
some things and since I am printing

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.200 
some things and since I am printing
directly<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.570> stickers<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:05.430> ink<00:01:05.640> might

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
directly on the stickers the ink might

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.899 
directly on the stickers the ink might
attend<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:07.170> bled<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.920> didn't<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.490> such

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
attend to have bled if I didn't do such

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.200 
attend to have bled if I didn't do such
steps<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.960> used<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.920> high<00:01:11.189> quality<00:01:11.430> sealer

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
steps so I used the high quality sealer

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.140 
steps so I used the high quality sealer
like<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.540> said<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.799> put<00:01:14.280> two<00:01:14.729> coats<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
like I said and I put two coats of that

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.630 
like I said and I put two coats of that
on<00:01:15.540> every<00:01:15.960> single<00:01:16.140> sticker<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.490> even

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
on every single sticker and I can even

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.460 
on every single sticker and I can even
do<00:01:17.850> peel<00:01:18.119> tabs<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.290> edges

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
do peel tabs like you see on the edges

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.420 
do peel tabs like you see on the edges
so<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.220> quick<00:01:20.520> release<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.220> these<00:01:23.220> are

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
so it's quick release and these are

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.789 
so it's quick release and these are
really<00:01:24.119> really<00:01:24.240> high-quality<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:25.409> printed

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
really really high-quality it's printed

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.679 
really really high-quality it's printed
on<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> material<00:01:26.520> much<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.060> vinyl<00:01:27.360> it's

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
on a material much like vinyl it's

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.590 
on a material much like vinyl it's
called<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.049> thermal<00:01:28.470> label<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.030> what<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.270> kind

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
called a thermal label and what is kind

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.120 
called a thermal label and what is kind
of<00:01:30.689> hard<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> thermal<00:01:31.530> label<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.979> if

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
of hard with a thermal label is if

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.179 
of hard with a thermal label is if
you're<00:01:32.509> doing<00:01:33.509> some<00:01:33.990> stuff<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.860> has<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you're doing some stuff on it it has a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.399 
you're doing some stuff on it it has a
really<00:01:35.490> thin<00:01:35.820> layer<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> white<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.079> under

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
really thin layer of the white but under

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.800 
really thin layer of the white but under
it<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.619> actually<00:01:38.040> black<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.570> any

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
it is actually black so if you get any

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.969 
it is actually black so if you get any
kind<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.170> acid<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.100> or<00:01:41.780> some<00:01:42.780> some<00:01:43.560> products

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
kind of acid on it or some some products

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.889 
kind of acid on it or some some products
actually<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.430> acid<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.509> know<00:01:45.570> some

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
actually have acid in it and I know some

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.700 
actually have acid in it and I know some
tapes<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.310> acid<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.820> them<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.119> used

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
tapes that have acid in them that I used

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.620 
tapes that have acid in them that I used
to<00:01:49.710> put<00:01:49.890> over<00:01:50.040> them<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.520> Prior<00:01:51.590> prior<00:01:52.590> times

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
to put over them in Prior prior times

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.060 
to put over them in Prior prior times
actually<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.810> pulled<00:01:55.140> through<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.710> black

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
actually like pulled through the black

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.520 
actually like pulled through the black
from<00:01:56.369> underneath<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.380> that<00:01:58.380> is

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
from underneath and so that is

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.050 
from underneath and so that is
definitely<00:01:58.710> consideration<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.670> I've<00:01:59.790> taken

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
definitely consideration that I've taken

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.149 
definitely consideration that I've taken
and<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.200> see<00:02:01.259> there<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.740> no<00:02:01.860> black

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
and as you can see there is no black

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.030 
and as you can see there is no black
where<00:02:02.430> there<00:02:02.610> shouldn't<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.409> these<00:02:04.409> images

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
where there shouldn't be on these images

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.960 
where there shouldn't be on these images
so<00:02:06.680> that's<00:02:07.680> kind<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.039> like<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.399> little<00:02:08.640> side

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
so that's kind of like a little side

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.809 
so that's kind of like a little side
note<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.590> these<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.830> printed<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.280> thermals

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
note but these are printed on thermals

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.380 
note but these are printed on thermals
you<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.150> check<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.510> out<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> Internet

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
you can check it out on the Internet

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.210 
you can check it out on the Internet
I get<00:02:13.630> them<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.650> got<00:02:15.520> these<00:02:16.350> from<00:02:17.350> somewhere

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
I get them I got these from somewhere

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.070 
I get them I got these from somewhere
but<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.240> can<00:02:19.360> get<00:02:19.480> them<00:02:19.600> all<00:02:19.720> over<00:02:19.959> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
but you can get them all over the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.630 
but you can get them all over the
internet<00:02:20.410> they're<00:02:20.650> all<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:21.010> same<00:02:21.040> I'm<00:02:21.430> pretty

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
internet they're all the same I'm pretty

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.600 
internet they're all the same I'm pretty
sure<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.140> li<00:02:23.380> have<00:02:23.680> these<00:02:24.010> white<00:02:24.220> ones<00:02:24.459> and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
sure but I li have these white ones and

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.340 
sure but I li have these white ones and
a<00:02:24.700> couple<00:02:24.910> different<00:02:25.209> sizes<00:02:25.360> but<00:02:25.870> that's<00:02:26.110> kind

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
a couple different sizes but that's kind

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.520 
a couple different sizes but that's kind
of<00:02:26.610> not<00:02:27.610> important<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.300> so<00:02:28.750> they're<00:02:29.230> much

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
of not important and so they're much

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.010 
of not important and so they're much
like<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.850> vinyls<00:02:30.850> because<00:02:31.240> they're<00:02:31.630> not<00:02:31.810> a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
like a vinyls because they're not a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.410 
like a vinyls because they're not a
paper-based<00:02:32.530> material<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.640> like<00:02:34.270> your

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
paper-based material so like your

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.730 
paper-based material so like your
standard<00:02:34.660> Avery<00:02:35.410> or<00:02:35.650> even<00:02:36.490> USPS<00:02:37.060> slaps<00:02:37.390> are

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
standard Avery or even USPS slaps are

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.710 
standard Avery or even USPS slaps are
based<00:02:38.740> on<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.010> paper<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.700> then<00:02:40.150> they<00:02:40.540> add

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
based on a paper that then they add

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.600 
based on a paper that then they add
adhesive<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.440> back<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.430> is<00:02:42.489> a

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
adhesive to the back but this is a

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.990 
adhesive to the back but this is a
plastic<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.569> it<00:02:43.720> is<00:02:43.810> extremely<00:02:44.730> weather<00:02:45.730> and

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
plastic so it is extremely weather and

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.570 
plastic so it is extremely weather and
more<00:02:46.540> specifically<00:02:46.930> water<00:02:47.290> repellent<00:02:47.950> even

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
more specifically water repellent even

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.630 
more specifically water repellent even
without<00:02:49.620> putting<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.860> sealers<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.220> whatever

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
without putting the sealers and whatever

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.090 
without putting the sealers and whatever
on<00:02:51.790> top<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.269> but<00:02:52.690> since<00:02:53.019> I<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.739> put<00:02:53.920> ink

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
on top of it but since I have to put ink

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.949 
on top of it but since I have to put ink
over<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.670> whatever<00:02:54.820> I<00:02:55.209> then<00:02:55.660> do<00:02:55.810> the

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
over it and whatever I then do the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.350 
over it and whatever I then do the
sealer<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:56.470> make<00:02:56.620> sure<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.890> ink<00:02:57.010> stays<00:02:57.880> on<00:02:58.120> and

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
sealer to make sure the ink stays on and

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.590 
sealer to make sure the ink stays on and
so<00:02:58.890> if<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.250> are<00:03:00.580> familiar<00:03:01.000> with<00:03:01.239> putting

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
so if you are familiar with putting

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.930 
so if you are familiar with putting
stickers<00:03:01.840> up<00:03:02.080> or<00:03:02.290> anything<00:03:02.650> in<00:03:03.070> general<00:03:03.370> you

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
stickers up or anything in general you

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.550 
stickers up or anything in general you
should<00:03:04.450> know<00:03:05.019> that<00:03:05.260> um<00:03:05.470> if<00:03:06.660> they<00:03:07.660> whether<00:03:08.260> even

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
should know that um if they whether even

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.400 
should know that um if they whether even
if<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:08.890> have<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.360> laminate<00:03:10.360> over<00:03:10.570> them<00:03:10.870> the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
if you have a laminate over them the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.020 
if you have a laminate over them the
sticker<00:03:11.800> absorbs<00:03:12.610> water<00:03:12.820> from<00:03:13.239> behind<00:03:13.570> and

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
sticker absorbs water from behind and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.810 
sticker absorbs water from behind and
this<00:03:16.030> being<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.510> plastic<00:03:17.050> is<00:03:17.320> much<00:03:18.220> better<00:03:18.459> than

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
this being a plastic is much better than

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.949 
this being a plastic is much better than
a<00:03:19.420> standard<00:03:20.230> UPS<00:03:20.769> sticker<00:03:21.700> because<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.690> water

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
a standard UPS sticker because the water

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.050 
a standard UPS sticker because the water
can't<00:03:23.350> seep<00:03:23.650> through<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.040> back<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.700> destroy

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
can't seep through the back and destroy

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.930 
can't seep through the back and destroy
the<00:03:25.209> image<00:03:25.299> like<00:03:25.630> that<00:03:25.840> it's<00:03:26.260> very<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.370> kind<00:03:27.820> of

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
the image like that it's very it kind of

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.500 
the image like that it's very it kind of
creates<00:03:28.540> two<00:03:28.989> layers<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:30.329> protectant<00:03:31.329> one

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
creates two layers of protectant one

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.759 
creates two layers of protectant one
from<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.780> back<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.019> one<00:03:32.140> from<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.350> front<00:03:32.530> in

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
from the back and one from the front in

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.280 
from the back and one from the front in
between<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.250> actual<00:03:33.519> design<00:03:33.940> which<00:03:34.600> is<00:03:34.840> very

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
between the actual design which is very

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.000 
between the actual design which is very
effective<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:37.630> know<00:03:37.750> it's<00:03:38.290> very

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
effective and you know it's very

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.620 
effective and you know it's very
comparable<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.610> vinyl<00:03:40.030> like<00:03:40.209> I<00:03:40.360> said

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
comparable to vinyl like I said

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.960 
comparable to vinyl like I said
unfortunately<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:41.500> isn't<00:03:41.739> vinyl<00:03:42.160> I've<00:03:42.310> tested

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
unfortunately it isn't vinyl I've tested

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.000 
unfortunately it isn't vinyl I've tested
printing<00:03:43.299> on<00:03:43.420> vinyl<00:03:43.690> but<00:03:43.959> I<00:03:43.989> have<00:03:44.260> not<00:03:44.530> found<00:03:44.799> a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
printing on vinyl but I have not found a

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.850 
printing on vinyl but I have not found a
really<00:03:45.269> or<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.360> cheap<00:03:46.690> effective<00:03:47.230> method<00:03:47.709> of

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
really or a cheap effective method of

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.310 
really or a cheap effective method of
doing<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.280> myself<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:49.000> then<00:03:49.150> give<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:50.110> guys
