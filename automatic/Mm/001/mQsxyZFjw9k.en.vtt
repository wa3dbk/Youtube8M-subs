replayability<00:03:37.000> I'll<00:03:37.569> probably<00:03:37.810> never<00:03:37.989> hit

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
replayability I'll probably never hit

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.870 
replayability I'll probably never hit
one<00:03:38.230> hundred<00:03:38.500> percent<00:03:38.530> on<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:38.920> it's<00:03:39.760> because

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
one hundred percent on it it's because

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.819 
one hundred percent on it it's because
it's<00:03:40.090> gonna<00:03:40.209> take<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.720> lot<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.230> frickin<00:03:41.560> time<00:03:41.739> to

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
it's gonna take a lot of frickin time to

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.660 
it's gonna take a lot of frickin time to
do<00:03:41.950> that<00:03:42.160> but<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:43.660> do<00:03:44.200> see<00:03:45.040> this<00:03:45.190> game<00:03:45.370> as<00:03:45.489> being
