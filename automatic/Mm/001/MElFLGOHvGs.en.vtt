00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.400
 This is Elgrand but 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.480
 If you look at the third sheet, it's a bit bigger 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.759
 It is feeling 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.440
 The third seat is solid 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.269
 During the period 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.269
 I think it's old 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.279
 Perseverance that opened the second seat 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.279
 Tokyo report 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.779
 Penetration of crime prevention awareness 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.689
 More and more 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.380
 Full rotation from second sheet to third sheet 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.610
 Drive edition 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.610
 I wonder if I can have a fun drive 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.729
 4 games are over 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.729
 I would like to go on the pitch 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.660
 It is free in the future by the guidance policy of the center 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.050
 6:00 pm to 4:40 pm on the 6th 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.250
 Shipping is free 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.260
 Again eyes 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.330
 And here 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
 I'm jealous of my life 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900
 A chance to say 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.780
 Should I use Grandma Jack? 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.470
 think 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.230
 And after all that Nikki down ceremony I visited 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.900
 Because there is 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.820
 It would be nice if you could use one of them when something happened 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.820
 I think 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.420
 I'm telling someone of atm this time though 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.260
 Two people from Nakanan Kazume local 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
 Isn't it very easy to do? 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.290
 I thought this was great 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.530
 Get in the same race 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.530
 It is boat people people 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.160
 It is also a back door 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.560
 I have to wait for a push 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.780
 After all there was something called Shimauchi though 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.150
 If you tighten with a light force 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.790
 There is no need to compensate for 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.200
 1552 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.560
 kindly 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.849
 I think that is always
