00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.420
 I will explain how to install in 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.730
 minecraft the tour a mannequin temps ya 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.010
 which is very useful and I will explain how 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.530
 install it and pretty much a life of 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.210
 how it is used and well some will not know 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.090
 what this mod does 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.880
 I 'm going to briefly summarize what 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.980
 does is add as an inventory of 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.260
 all the objects of the game and apart from 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.450
 that helps us to remove the rain to do 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.390
 from night to day and going from creative to 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.760
 survival let's help us a lot in 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.350
 the time of the game to download the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.409
 you manning we go to the page that 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.089
 you will have in the information of this video 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:47.989
 simply click on the link that you 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:50.449
 I'll leave it and you'll download and they'll come out 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.699
 the versions of which you can 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.589
 download me in my case and where I'm going 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.109
 to explain that it really does not matter because 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.479
 they are all installed equally simply 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.060
 download the one of your version I by 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.910
 example is going to be this one 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.600
 we wait a few seconds 5 seconds e 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.509
 concretely to be loaded 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.400
 advertising and we give you to jump 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.410
 advertising 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.060
 and here we go to save the file 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.490
 I already have it saved it does not 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.290
 you need to keep it and well as you can 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.140
 see I already have it here downloaded and 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.520
 we just click on it and we're 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.190
 open let's do it a little bit more 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.810
 small we give here to the X and what 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.810
 we will put here a little corner 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.189
 to have it nicely nike already open now 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.990
 let's go to the windows button simply 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.500
 we have to write 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.220
 the abstract percentage symbol like this 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.760
 as you see so that the whole mouse 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.410
 so and it comes out in the roaming folder we give 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:56.400
 there we opened the point folder minecraft and 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.440
 let's go well there we will have a file 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.410
 called minecraft we give you right click 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.410
 and April with winrar file 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.520
 we give the X here and this too 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.520
 we make it a little tiny 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.190
 yes 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.680
 so we can see better the two of us 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.019
 this form 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.810
 The first thing we have to do is in 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.379
 this folder in minecraft dot hard 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.189
 delete the meta folder inf from click 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:32.250
 right and delete files we give to 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:35.639
 what if we erase and make sure that no 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.889
 is if you have opened this folder on 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.719
 rap and you do not have it you do not have to 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:42.269
 do nothing since you have deleted it 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:45.569
 previously now we go here to the retail 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.459
 manning temps we select everything does not happen 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.439
 nothing if we select the one of the two 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.930
 little dots this and we take everything 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.579
 dragging it down here because if I 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.769
 let's go then this part of above can 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.909
 that we get in some folder and that 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.489
 is what we do not want simply 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.260
 we want him to get into this so what 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.200
 let's go down here down 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.209
 we give everything to accept and ready 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.540
 we already supposedly have the mode 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.370
 installed does not need nor module ader 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.730
 or anything like that 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.590
 now let's go to minecraft let's open it 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.959
 well at first glance it seems that no 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.870
 we have none or nothing now what 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.489
 we have to do is give it to the aee or 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.159
 opening the inventory depends where 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.459
 you have and we will leave all the items that 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.989
 we can have if we do not want to have the 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.500
 activated mof we simply give the 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.500
 key 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.349
 and it will disappear if we want it to return to 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.530
 appear again next door and you're 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.530
 we can have our inventory here 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.079
 favorites well if we use a lot of some 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.090
 item in particular we have here in case 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.390
 we want to enchant the weapons of how 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.120
 we want the potions that is what I eat 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.220
 we want to do exactly one potion and 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.780
 the new things that they are doing as 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.310
 the artificial rockets and others 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.620
 modify them with the colors that we make 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.019
 and everything here too if we give the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.190
 inventory we can look for exactly what 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.760
 that we want for example if we want 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.519
 search diamond 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.959
 is not little with a little that you put me already 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.209
 all the diamond objects come out and 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.310
 which is very useful at the time of 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.919
 handle the creative we can also 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.720
 move directly from the survival mode to 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.820
 creative mode or aventure mode 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.130
 we just click here and go 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.440
 changing without having to be with 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.880
 codes and so on we can also eliminate 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.570
 the rain in any case that we 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.490
 bother a lot or activate it as you see is 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.490
 raining now we give here 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.770
 to the little button 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.830
 Oh 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.290
 Oh 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.710
 and now it will continue to deactivate the rain 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.300
 it will take a little bit but then it will 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.000
 delete we can also put if 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.620
 we want it to be in the morning that is 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.750
 late in the afternoon or whatever 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.249
 dusk but you do not see it anyway 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.699
 to put 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:09.080
 the creative to be able to fly and so you see 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:11.470
 better the sun is here morning nap 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.460
 It has started to rain now suddenly 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:19.230
 like he does not want the thing 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:21.480
 if we want the sun to be average 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.330
 at noon 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.370
 or if we want it to be late or 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.180
 directly if we want it to be 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.410
 we can also modify the night 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.170
 difficulty of the game very easily 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.930
 clicking on the clip head here what 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.820
 you can put and here what he does is 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.290
 fill us hearts imagined by 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.170
 example I will put myself in survival 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.080
 moment you see that it takes away a heart 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:49.050
 because here and give me directly 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.000
 they carry the hearts we also have a 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.640
 option to save the items we have 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.070
 for example imagine that we have this 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.990
 this this and a lot of super objects 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.880
 important that we have been a mine or what 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.070
 that is and we are doing a job 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.830
 important or without doing gameplays and we 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.230
 they kill and we have to go and recover the 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.840
 objects again because if not we do not 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:12.630
 let's pass the objectives that it has 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.490
 just that map because you simply give it 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.700
 to save one or to which you want we have 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.400
 up to 77 spaces to save we give 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.460
 here and then we load it for example I 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.030
 had these objects are we going to do what 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:29.540
 let him die for example 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:33.670
 let's go somewhere that there are many 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:39.940
 sites or I directly get creative 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:43.210
 flight and I make myself a suicide here it's worth not 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:46.590
 I do not fall at all it does not give me a strong 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.140
 milk, let's go there so you can see it well 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:53.380
 I think that from here I put his rival 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:55.750
 and here then the palm is worth you see that no 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.520
 I have the objects and of course I do not remember 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.470
 exactly what have I lost then 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.690
 we simply give it to save and we 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:05.440
 they automatically put all the objects 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.450
 really that is very useful in case you do 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.210
 gameplay or me that I know to meet the 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:13.270
 objectives of each map and also by 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.160
 example does not need to look for a site of 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.900
 wash to throw things just if 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.550
 we want to totally get rid of something 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.630
 we give here 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.220
 in this way and they are 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.220
 Y 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.540
 with the left click directly worth 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.880
 let's go pressing the things we want 

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:35.080
 erase and ready we can also take it and 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:37.000
 drag it up to the trash can and 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.120
 Well this is what the tour does 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.580
 items I hope you liked and now 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.370
 what can you do more easily 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.570
 games the gameplays and others so what 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.360
 said I hope you liked this 

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.650
 guide like and favorites helps a lot and 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.010
 until the next 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.010
 agur
