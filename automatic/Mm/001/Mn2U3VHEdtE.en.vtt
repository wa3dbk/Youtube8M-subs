role of Kolya and today I'll be showing
you<00:00:06.930> how<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.890> make<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.550> water<00:00:08.849> resistant<00:00:09.510> paper

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
you how to make a water resistant paper

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.509 
you how to make a water resistant paper
boat<00:00:11.179> well<00:00:12.179> one<00:00:12.719> way<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.230> supposedly<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.370> use<00:00:14.490> a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
boat well one way is supposedly to use a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.840 
boat well one way is supposedly to use a
crayon<00:00:15.139> so<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.410> wax<00:00:16.590> would<00:00:17.190> fight<00:00:17.490> against

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
crayon so the wax would fight against

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.790 
crayon so the wax would fight against
water<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:19.609> color<00:00:20.609> in<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.539> whole<00:00:21.750> sheet<00:00:22.710> of

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
water and color in the whole sheet of

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:33.280 
water and color in the whole sheet of
paper<00:00:23.039> as<00:00:23.850> much<00:00:24.119> as<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.390> can

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.360 

time<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> start<00:00:34.649> my<00:00:34.940> other<00:00:35.940> side<00:00:36.270> they<00:00:36.780> guess

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
time to start my other side they guess

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:51.590 
time to start my other side they guess
it's<00:00:38.370> colored<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.790> enough<00:00:49.520> well<00:00:50.520> now<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> guess

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
it's colored in enough well now I guess

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.130 
it's colored in enough well now I guess
that<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.699> pretty<00:00:53.699> much<00:00:53.789> color<00:00:54.539> game<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:54.930> much<00:00:54.960> as

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
that I pretty much color game as much as

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.520 
that I pretty much color game as much as
I<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.610> few<00:00:57.149> seconds<00:00:57.750> may<00:00:58.020> not<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
I can in a few seconds may not be the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.760 
I can in a few seconds may not be the
best<00:00:58.710> quality<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.989> guess<00:01:00.989> it'll<00:01:01.289> do<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
best quality but I guess it'll do for a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.979 
best quality but I guess it'll do for a
demonstration

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
demonstration

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.140 
demonstration
anyway<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> fold<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.769> actual<00:01:05.220> boat<00:01:05.460> you

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
anyway now to fold the actual boat you

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.670 
anyway now to fold the actual boat you
might<00:01:06.330> want<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.540> try<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.170> precise<00:01:07.500> as

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
might want to try to be as precise as

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.890 
might want to try to be as precise as
possible<00:01:07.939> when<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.030> first<00:01:09.270> fold<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> paper

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
possible when you first fold the paper

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.160 
possible when you first fold the paper
in<00:01:10.260> half<00:01:10.290> while<00:01:11.100> vertical<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:14.030> make<00:01:15.030> sure<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
in half while vertical and make sure to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.130 
in half while vertical and make sure to
try<00:01:17.009> our<00:01:17.100> best<00:01:17.310> make<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.700> perfect<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.270> make<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
try our best make it perfect and make a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.600 
try our best make it perfect and make a
tight<00:01:19.470> crease<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.830> even<00:01:23.100> more<00:01:23.220> precise

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
tight crease to be even more precise

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.840 
tight crease to be even more precise
create<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.210> tight<00:01:24.990> crease<00:01:25.409> by<00:01:26.070> folding<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.610> in

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
create a tight crease by folding it in

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.940 
create a tight crease by folding it in
half<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:32.210> then<00:01:33.210> releasing<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.750> back<00:01:33.799> now<00:01:34.799> that

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
half as then releasing it back now that

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.300 
half as then releasing it back now that
you<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> crease<00:01:35.810> fold<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.159> flaps<00:01:38.159> down

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
you have the crease fold the flaps down

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.850 
you have the crease fold the flaps down
to<00:01:41.310> get<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.750> might<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:44.520> some<00:01:44.729> people<00:01:45.860> look

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
to get what might to some people look

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.340 
to get what might to some people look
like<00:01:47.420> kind<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.570> sailboat

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.600 

okay<00:01:53.299> then<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.479> fold<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.110> flaps<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.340> flaps

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
okay then just fold the flaps the flaps

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.320 
okay then just fold the flaps the flaps
at<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.820> bottom<00:01:57.119> up<00:01:57.270> cover<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:58.110> these<00:01:58.229> flaps<00:01:59.330> on

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
at the bottom up cover up these flaps on

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:09.830 
at the bottom up cover up these flaps on
both<00:02:00.840> sides<00:02:06.140> for<00:02:07.140> easier<00:02:07.439> folding<00:02:07.890> later<00:02:08.840> you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
both sides for easier folding later you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:19.000 
both sides for easier folding later you
can<00:02:09.989> tuck<00:02:10.350> these<00:02:10.590> corners<00:02:11.100> in<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:12.330> prefer

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.580 

then<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.340> grab<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.730> paper<00:02:21.600> go<00:02:21.840> from<00:02:22.170> under

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
then you grab the paper go from under

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.630 
then you grab the paper go from under
and<00:02:23.480> fold<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.569> out<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.459> to<00:02:26.459> get<00:02:26.580> a

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and fold it out like this to get a

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.370 
and fold it out like this to get a
square<00:02:28.700> depending<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:29.850> how<00:02:30.390> tall<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:31.050> want

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
square depending on how tall you want

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.820 
square depending on how tall you want
the<00:02:31.560> edges<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> sailboat<00:02:33.050> fold<00:02:34.050> this

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
the edges of the sailboat fold this

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.650 
the edges of the sailboat fold this
crease<00:02:35.780> then<00:02:36.780> fold<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.410> flap<00:02:37.910> upward<00:02:38.910> and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
crease then fold this flap upward and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.040 
crease then fold this flap upward and
make<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.050> other<00:02:40.319> flap<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.980> other<00:02:41.100> side<00:02:41.400> just

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
make the other flap the other side just

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.289 
make the other flap the other side just
as<00:02:43.050> tall<00:02:43.290> was<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.530> by<00:02:43.980> matching<00:02:44.250> up<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.940> bottom

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
as tall was it by matching up the bottom

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.240 
as tall was it by matching up the bottom
lines<00:02:46.819> when<00:02:47.819> you're<00:02:47.910> done<00:02:48.030> doing<00:02:48.209> this<00:02:49.250> take

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
lines when you're done doing this take

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.050 
lines when you're done doing this take
the<00:02:50.819> bombs<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.780> boat<00:02:52.350> like<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.280> fold<00:02:53.819> it

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
the bombs of boat like this and fold it

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.080 
the bombs of boat like this and fold it
out<00:02:55.280> you're<00:02:56.280> gonna<00:02:56.400> end<00:02:56.610> up<00:02:56.670> with<00:02:56.730> something

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
out you're gonna end up with something

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.560 
out you're gonna end up with something
like<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.760> you're<00:02:59.850> pretty<00:03:00.150> much<00:03:00.299> done

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.210 
proof of this later another way that
some<00:03:24.510> people<00:03:24.540> waterproof<00:03:25.440> their<00:03:25.650> paper<00:03:26.010> boats

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
some people waterproof their paper boats

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.810 
some people waterproof their paper boats
is<00:03:26.970> simply<00:03:27.420> by<00:03:27.540> folding<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.049> first<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.829> then

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
is simply by folding it first and then

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.680 
is simply by folding it first and then
putting<00:03:30.359> scotch<00:03:30.870> tape<00:03:31.320> all<00:03:32.070> over<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.640> all<00:03:33.329> over

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
putting scotch tape all over it all over

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:42.819 
putting scotch tape all over it all over
the<00:03:33.810> exposed<00:03:34.140> areas

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.360 

now<00:03:43.829> that<00:03:44.040> I'm<00:03:44.129> done<00:03:44.250> with<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.579> basic<00:03:45.000> boat

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
now that I'm done with the basic boat

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.910 
now that I'm done with the basic boat
let's<00:03:47.370> take<00:03:47.610> a<00:03:47.640> roll<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.180> scotch<00:03:48.450> tape<00:03:48.920> anyone

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
let's take a roll of scotch tape anyone

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.009 
let's take a roll of scotch tape anyone
and<00:03:51.860> cover<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.010> bottom<00:03:53.189> of<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.340> boat<00:03:53.489> with<00:03:53.640> it

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
and cover the bottom of the boat with it

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:17.039 
and cover the bottom of the boat with it
that's<00:03:55.019> it

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.219 

well<00:04:17.650> anyway<00:04:18.129> the<00:04:18.370> point<00:04:18.579> is<00:04:18.789> tape<00:04:19.329> as<00:04:19.539> much<00:04:19.900> of

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
well anyway the point is tape as much of

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.369 
well anyway the point is tape as much of
the<00:04:20.470> whole<00:04:21.099> boat<00:04:21.370> as<00:04:21.639> you<00:04:21.849> can<00:04:22.120> I<00:04:22.419> don't<00:04:23.199> really

00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:23.379 
the whole boat as you can I don't really

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:25.320 
the whole boat as you can I don't really
have<00:04:23.590> time<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.889> do<00:04:24.190> everything<00:04:24.699> so<00:04:24.910> I<00:04:24.940> just<00:04:25.120> did

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
have time to do everything so I just did

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.210 
have time to do everything so I just did
the<00:04:25.509> main<00:04:25.690> part<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.319> inside<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:28.199> these<00:04:29.199> sides

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.270 

now<00:04:33.220> we'll<00:04:33.520> be<00:04:33.669> testing<00:04:34.180> how<00:04:34.629> waterproof

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
now we'll be testing how waterproof

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.520 
now we'll be testing how waterproof
exactly<00:04:36.280> is<00:04:36.490> each<00:04:36.879> paper<00:04:37.210> boat<00:04:37.530> beginning

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
exactly is each paper boat beginning

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.100 
exactly is each paper boat beginning
with<00:04:39.150> crayons<00:04:40.150> so<00:04:40.720> inside<00:04:41.470> this<00:04:41.650> thing

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
with crayons so inside this thing

00:04:43.110 --> 00:05:03.700 
with crayons so inside this thing
tilting<00:04:44.110> little<00:04:44.409> fix<00:04:45.310> that

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.920 

as<00:05:04.710> you<00:05:04.830> can<00:05:04.950> see<00:05:05.220> it<00:05:05.460> works<00:05:05.670> pretty<00:05:05.970> good<00:05:06.090> but

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
as you can see it works pretty good but

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.980 
as you can see it works pretty good but
the<00:05:07.920> model<00:05:08.250> is<00:05:08.310> pretty<00:05:08.610> soggy<00:05:08.850> not<00:05:09.570> as<00:05:09.720> soggy

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
the model is pretty soggy not as soggy

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.160 
the model is pretty soggy not as soggy
as<00:05:10.200> a<00:05:10.230> normal<00:05:10.530> paper<00:05:10.770> but<00:05:11.210> this<00:05:12.210> will<00:05:12.420> not<00:05:12.600> be<00:05:12.870> a

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
as a normal paper but this will not be a

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.750 
as a normal paper but this will not be a
permanent<00:05:14.010> waterproof<00:05:14.640> boat<00:05:16.370> you<00:05:17.370> know<00:05:17.460> water

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
permanent waterproof boat you know water

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.940 
permanent waterproof boat you know water
will<00:05:18.180> still<00:05:18.480> soak<00:05:18.990> up<00:05:19.230> the<00:05:19.440> bottom<00:05:19.800> and

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
will still soak up the bottom and

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.700 
will still soak up the bottom and
eventually<00:05:20.520> very<00:05:21.360> very<00:05:21.690> slowly<00:05:22.050> spread<00:05:22.560> out

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
eventually very very slowly spread out

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.180 
eventually very very slowly spread out
through<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:23.190> whole<00:05:23.400> boat<00:05:24.050> now<00:05:25.050> the<00:05:25.190> crayon

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
through the whole boat now the crayon

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.040 
through the whole boat now the crayon
though<00:05:26.370> is<00:05:26.550> metal<00:05:26.850> is<00:05:27.920> how<00:05:28.920> are<00:05:29.040> you<00:05:29.160> trying<00:05:29.400> to

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
though is metal is how are you trying to

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:46.460 
though is metal is how are you trying to
scotch<00:05:31.050> tape<00:05:31.500> boat<00:05:44.540> it<00:05:45.540> seems<00:05:46.020> to<00:05:46.230> be<00:05:46.320> working

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
scotch tape boat it seems to be working

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.540 
scotch tape boat it seems to be working
fine<00:05:47.419> spins<00:05:48.419> around<00:05:48.570> the<00:05:48.780> roll<00:05:52.190> scotch<00:05:53.190> tape

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
fine spins around the roll scotch tape

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.659 
fine spins around the roll scotch tape
is<00:05:53.760> actually<00:05:53.940> really<00:05:54.480> effective<00:05:55.400> none<00:05:56.400> of<00:05:56.520> the

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
is actually really effective none of the

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.260 
is actually really effective none of the
papers<00:05:56.850> left<00:05:57.390> so<00:05:57.600> far<00:05:58.700> this<00:05:59.700> is<00:05:59.880> probably<00:06:00.150> the

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
papers left so far this is probably the

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.490 
papers left so far this is probably the
best<00:06:00.390> amount<00:06:00.720> that<00:06:00.810> even<00:06:01.080> though<00:06:01.200> it<00:06:01.260> takes

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
best amount that even though it takes

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.760 
best amount that even though it takes
very<00:06:01.800> very<00:06:01.980> long<00:06:03.260> so<00:06:04.260> you<00:06:04.350> might<00:06:04.500> want<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:04.710> be

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
very very long so you might want to be

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.490 
very very long so you might want to be
patient<00:06:05.160> when<00:06:05.280> it<00:06:05.310> can<00:06:07.310> anyway<00:06:09.110> those<00:06:10.110> are<00:06:10.380> the

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
patient when it can anyway those are the

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
patient when it can anyway those are the
results<00:06:11.990> well<00:06:12.990> now<00:06:13.590> that<00:06:13.770> the<00:06:13.890> video<00:06:14.220> is<00:06:14.340> over

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520
