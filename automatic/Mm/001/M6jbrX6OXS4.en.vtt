00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.290 
Plus out of time and it is Road or visa
I<00:03:16.769> think<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.159> was<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.519> actually<00:03:17.670> heads<00:03:18.150> that

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
I think it was that actually heads that

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.149 
I think it was that actually heads that
one<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.629> to<00:03:19.019> give<00:03:19.170> us<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.409> four-four<00:03:19.830> draw<00:03:20.040> I

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
one in to give us the four-four draw I

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.770 
one in to give us the four-four draw I
know<00:03:20.220> it's<00:03:20.459> only<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.700> draw<00:03:20.940> but<00:03:21.120> every<00:03:21.540> point

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
know it's only a draw but every point

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.600 
know it's only a draw but every point
counts<00:03:21.900> when<00:03:22.560> you're<00:03:22.590> playing<00:03:22.920> divisions<00:03:23.489> and

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
counts when you're playing divisions and

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.820 
counts when you're playing divisions and
I<00:03:23.760> think<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.510> guys<00:03:24.659> have<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:25.140> admit<00:03:25.409> that<00:03:25.620> was

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
I think you guys have to admit that was

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.399 
I think you guys have to admit that was
a<00:03:25.890> hell<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.430> comeback<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:27.299> be<00:03:27.420> down<00:03:27.690> three

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
a hell of a comeback to be down three

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.020 
a hell of a comeback to be down three
goals<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.920> 70th<00:03:29.340> minute<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.730> managed<00:03:29.940> to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
goals in the 70th minute and managed to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.850 
goals in the 70th minute and managed to
come<00:03:30.180> back<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.480> draw<00:03:30.629> that<00:03:31.080> is<00:03:31.200> not<00:03:31.409> too<00:03:31.620> bad

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
come back and draw that is not too bad

work you may find it difficult because
obviously<00:03:51.390> I'm<00:03:51.959> hyping<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.560> up<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.799> lot<00:03:52.950> at<00:03:53.069> the

obviously I'm hyping it up a lot at the

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.679 
obviously I'm hyping it up a lot at the
moment<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:53.790> in<00:03:53.849> a<00:03:53.909> couple<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.299> weeks<00:03:54.450> time

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
moment there in a couple of weeks time

you know once all the hypes died down
this<00:03:56.519> method<00:03:56.819> will<00:03:56.939> start<00:03:57.150> working<00:03:57.299> again<00:03:57.569> and

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
this method will start working again and

just<00:03:59.670> wanted<00:03:59.909> to<00:04:00.000> illustrate<00:04:00.330> how<00:04:00.750> easy<00:04:00.780> it

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
just wanted to illustrate how easy it

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.380 
just wanted to illustrate how easy it
was<00:04:01.409> to<00:04:01.470> use<00:04:01.769> this<00:04:01.890> technique<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.489> just<00:04:03.239> going

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
was to use this technique and just going

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.970 
was to use this technique and just going
through<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.780> finding<00:04:04.019> plenty<00:04:04.349> of<00:04:04.590> cards<00:04:04.890> to

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
through and finding plenty of cards to

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.979 
through and finding plenty of cards to
trade<00:04:05.189> with<00:04:05.340> 200<00:04:05.879> bins<00:04:06.090> on<00:04:06.330> all<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.569> these<00:04:06.689> ones

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
trade with 200 bins on all of these ones

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.539 
trade with 200 bins on all of these ones
and<00:04:07.170> I'll<00:04:07.709> be<00:04:07.799> listing<00:04:07.980> them<00:04:08.129> up<00:04:08.220> for<00:04:08.400> around

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:01.859 
back of the net I believe I don't think

00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:03.979 
back of the net I believe I don't think
it<00:07:01.919> would<00:07:02.009> have<00:07:02.099> given<00:07:02.249> him<00:07:02.399> a<00:07:02.429> no<00:07:02.639> goal<00:07:02.989> had

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:03.989 
it would have given him a no goal had

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:06.379

that<00:07:06.599> was<00:07:06.719> a<00:07:06.779> goal<00:07:07.049> or<00:07:07.409> an<00:07:07.799> own<00:07:07.889> goal<00:07:07.919> very

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:08.429 
that was a goal or an own goal very

00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:10.159 
that was a goal or an own goal very
frustrating<00:07:09.029> I<00:07:09.119> went<00:07:09.299> ultra<00:07:09.659> tacky<00:07:09.899> as<00:07:10.079> you

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:11.489 
saw in the first game it really worked

00:07:11.489 --> 00:07:13.999 
saw in the first game it really worked
out<00:07:11.729> and<00:07:12.029> I<00:07:12.209> ended<00:07:12.539> up<00:07:12.689> managing<00:07:13.319> to<00:07:13.649> equalize

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:14.009 
out and I ended up managing to equalize

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.399 
out and I ended up managing to equalize
but<00:07:14.549> in<00:07:14.969> this<00:07:15.089> game<00:07:15.329> it<00:07:15.479> didn't<00:07:15.809> and<00:07:16.019> we<00:07:16.139> end<00:07:16.289> up

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:16.409 
but in this game it didn't and we end up

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:18.529 
but in this game it didn't and we end up
