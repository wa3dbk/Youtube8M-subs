00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
their fruit and then the plant is done

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.430 
their fruit and then the plant is done
for<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:34.680> couple<00:02:35.680> little<00:02:36.459> holes<00:02:36.610> in<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.030> one

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
for a couple little holes in that one

when you're storing your Tomatoes inside

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.539 
when you're storing your Tomatoes inside
it's<00:02:40.209> best<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.930> store<00:02:41.500> them<00:02:41.799> not<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:42.340> the

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
it's best to store them not in the

it's best to store them not in the
refrigerator<00:02:43.150> but<00:02:43.330> like<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.629> a<00:02:43.720> bowl<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.170> a

refrigerator but like in a bowl on a
counter<00:02:44.650> they'll<00:02:44.860> last<00:02:45.099> longer<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.730> way<00:02:45.970> if

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
counter they'll last longer that way if

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.240 
counter they'll last longer that way if
you<00:02:46.930> have<00:02:47.019> any<00:02:47.080> holes<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.709> them<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:47.920> may<00:02:48.069> have

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
you have any holes in them you may have

at all possible leave part of the stem
with<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:12.069> you'll<00:03:12.819> stay<00:03:13.000> fresher<00:03:13.299> longer

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
with it and you'll stay fresher longer

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.100 
with it and you'll stay fresher longer
that<00:03:13.959> way<00:03:14.110> as<00:03:14.260> well<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:16.299> if<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.660> mate<00:03:16.840> is<00:03:16.959> get

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
that way as well and if the mate is get

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.600 
that way as well and if the mate is get
too<00:03:17.290> much<00:03:17.500> water<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:18.010> can<00:03:18.129> get<00:03:18.280> into<00:03:18.489> this

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
too much water you can get into this

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.490 
too much water you can get into this
cracking<00:03:19.120> stuff<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.599> see<00:03:19.810> something<00:03:20.200> crawled

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
cracking stuff I see something crawled

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.020 
cracking stuff I see something crawled
into<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.920> one<00:03:21.100> there<00:03:23.370> best<00:03:24.370> thing<00:03:24.579> to<00:03:24.609> do<00:03:24.850> is

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
into that one there best thing to do is

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.430 
into that one there best thing to do is
to<00:03:25.180> pick<00:03:25.299> them<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:25.660> they<00:03:25.750> don't<00:03:25.900> bust<00:03:26.170> any

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
to pick them so they don't bust any

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.289 
to pick them so they don't bust any
further<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:28.019> had<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.049> lot<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.410> fruit<00:03:29.650> come<00:03:29.889> on<00:03:30.299> all

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
further I had a lot of fruit come on all

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.300 
further I had a lot of fruit come on all
at<00:03:31.660> once<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.799> start<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.639> ripen<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:35.200> now<00:03:36.190> I'm

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
at once and start to ripen and now I'm

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.860 
at once and start to ripen and now I'm
not<00:03:36.489> getting<00:03:36.609> very<00:03:36.910> many<00:03:37.120> blooms<00:03:37.389> throughout

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
not getting very many blooms throughout

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.300 
not getting very many blooms throughout
the<00:03:38.079> tomato<00:03:38.709> patch<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:40.120> another<00:03:40.630> thing<00:03:40.720> that

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
the tomato patch so another thing that

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.620 
the tomato patch so another thing that
taking<00:03:42.310> all<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.489> these<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:43.060> are<00:03:43.180> close<00:03:43.450> to

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
taking all of these that are close to

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.420 
taking all of these that are close to
being<00:03:43.780> ripe<00:03:44.019> off<00:03:44.260> will<00:03:44.500> do<00:03:44.650> is<00:03:44.859> allow<00:03:45.040> energy

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
being ripe off will do is allow energy

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.339 
being ripe off will do is allow energy
to<00:03:45.819> go<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.359> can<00:03:46.480> start<00:03:46.750> producing<00:03:46.989> more

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
to go and it can start producing more

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.710 
to go and it can start producing more
fruit<00:03:47.730> all<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.880> that<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.239> doesn't<00:03:49.419> have<00:03:49.630> to

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
fruit all of that and it doesn't have to

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.550 
fruit all of that and it doesn't have to
focus<00:03:49.900> on<00:03:50.220> ripening<00:03:51.220> everything<00:03:51.790> up<00:03:52.290> I've<00:03:53.290> got

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
focus on ripening everything up I've got

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.720 
focus on ripening everything up I've got
a<00:03:53.590> lot<00:03:53.799> that<00:03:54.040> are<00:03:54.069> really<00:03:54.400> close<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:57.609> why

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
a lot that are really close and so why

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.360 
a lot that are really close and so why
not<00:03:57.910> go<00:03:58.060> ahead<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.269> take<00:03:58.510> them<00:03:59.040> that<00:04:00.040> way<00:04:00.220> the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
not go ahead and take them that way the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.599 
not go ahead and take them that way the
energy<00:04:00.609> can<00:04:00.910> go<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.269> new<00:04:01.419> productions

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
energy can go to the new productions

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.360 
energy can go to the new productions
