00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.830
 and of course 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.730
 missing 28 eggs welcome once again 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.490
 to a video this time of cold male 3 today 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.919
 we are playing domain on the map of 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.419
 how do you call uploading I have no idea 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.270
 what is this map called , I forgot 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:22.820
 it was from the expansion that of klaus 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.340
 waters that had come out I do not know how 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.960
 second or third I think the second or 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.429
 the third of lcd in the hands of a 3 and this 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.620
 game had gone exclusively for 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.780
 play as he says his own name in the 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.000
 close combat which then 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.030
 where they exceeded many weapons were the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.100
 Shotguns and also defense weapons 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.790
 personal how are you using here the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.409
 I apologized for the mp5 that by the way 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.019
 it was also an unlockable weapon of 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.059
 some of the expansions what happens 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.710
 I do not remember which note is that 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.580
 baron filtres jazz collar derision 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.769
 I remember 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.589
 and I decided to play for a while this mode of 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.019
 game because good because there were very 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.670
 few on Friday available in america 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.530
 the truth so it will be one of the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.479
 few who had large population of 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.030
 players and the other reason is because 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.200
 I really wanted to use the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.950
 pitiÃ¼ses as they are not used anymore in bar 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.700
 11 14 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.500
 the domain and all your maps will be fine 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.360
 designed on one side and well stupid 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.579
 on the other the game 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.399
 taiz when you have designed this this 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.869
 expansion had put closed and as 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.579
 these maps are called where one will play 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.409
 close 4 yes yes, because all 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.140
 they were like houses or buildings was like 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.789
 urban land and it 's a charm but what 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.920
 what I liked is that it was multilevel and 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.049
 when they did multilevel it's the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.429
 your minimap radar did not tell you where 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.259
 there were the players in the different 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.759
 levels that means that if you're in 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.959
 the first floor you have no idea where 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.750
 there were enemies in the second or the 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.429
 third floor but if there were more and more of 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.990
 a level on some of the maps what 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.729
 means this to play with the mini 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.709
 map that one is used to be in 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.299
 practically every shooters was 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.130
 practically impossible in this game and 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.170
 although during the whole gameplay they go 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.909
 to realize that they will never see very 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.380
 few times to see the triangles 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.670
 orange on the same map that 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.349
 show where are the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.750
 enemies that means you have to 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.340
 use different ways to locate yourself 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.709
 so on the one hand a lot of people 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.180
 criticized Dais for that and I was one of 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.380
 those because I thought the minimap 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.730
 He lost all sense and everything 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.010
 what is the name of any need to 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.380
 use it and at the same time also the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.050
 silencers you know that the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.050
 mufflers on weapons and the biggest 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.940
 benefit they give is behind me and I 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.260
 I did not realize that eventually , 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.580
 kill 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.510
 eventually I'm going to kill that guy 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.390
 because I did not realize I was there 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.590
 but good in the silencers the reason 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.510
 main reason why silencers 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.220
 they serve in this game and in practically 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.220
 all the shooters is that they keep you 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.170
 away there is the enemy and you 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.970
 keep away from him minimal to 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.000
 when you shoot then when everything 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.070
 shoot in a game with a silencer and 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.620
 it's not like your little red triangle in the 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.850
 map of the enemy then you can flank 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.800
 the always and they are not going to give 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.530
 account where you are but here in this 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.090
 type of map design where the solo 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.470
 made shoot here from the ladder 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.140
 wall does not appear to be in a 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.420
 level of them immediately makes the 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.610
 ridiculous they put it silenced a gun and 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.410
 On the one hand I was criticized because 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.660
 then minimap stops working but 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.520
 On the other hand it gave an extra emotion the 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.140
 game because you could play like it was 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.570
 hardcore in quotes because you do not have 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.970
 in a functional minimap but at the same 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.850
 you have time 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.190
 weapons with damage the damage model 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.170
 absolutely real and how you create it as 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.490
 they created the game and it's not the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.740
 hardcore that two bullets kills any 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.000
 person and good in my opinion in 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.570
 hardcore the one with the best connection 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.100
 always goes but no no no gives 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.130
 whoever has those who have the most pin 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.990
 high and you already know that with internet 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.720
 troglodyte of costa rica i put at 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.310
 I play with a ping that can be high 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.550
 I always jump, I think this game is going 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.930
 like with 86 90 ping and it's always like that 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.480
 the truth that the ping lower than me 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.860
 I can play that like a 60 and the highest 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.630
 that then sometimes when I see with my 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.170
 European friends is how they have arrived 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.660
 hundreds and that's always bad 150 for 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.890
 there is always a bad ping is bad 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.910
 demonstration of what can not be a 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.080
 game problem that is made in the 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.130
 internet is in integral 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.990
 but good returning what was 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.400
 talking about close waters that's something that 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.980
 I feel that although a 4 does 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.989
 missing too strong prominent not 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.669
 we have any we have maybe your 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.590
 metro operation and stop counting no 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.600
 we have maps where we can do this 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.780
 type of confrontation in which one is 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.840
 can grab shots with people in 50 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.750
 meters away or less and that 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.490
 this expansion itself is really good 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.199
 although I am also critical and I am going to 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.300
 keep criticizing not multilevel is and 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.860
 that he could not and that the minimap will leave 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.389
 of being a factor and how they are going to be 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.650
 account here in this gameplay I was very 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.900
 very well but nevertheless I had to 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.370
 cut a lot of the gameplay because in 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.900
 place to leave town silos to departure 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.010
 You all came running for me 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.930
 all running points all 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.389
 time trying to find the enemies and 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.949
 that really is I hope a lot 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.360
 I understand that he has the best 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.970
 clowns waters games 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.979
 in my opinion the main cause is this 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.380
 the high recoil weapons as per 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.570
 example is audio request that the mp5 was 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.280
 a weapon that had a setback 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.479
 horizontal terrible or I do not remember 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.950
 how were the statistics but it was 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.180
 terrible where he used this weapon and 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.970
 try to shoot someone who 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.500
 it was 40 meters away 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.030
 active weapon for you das additive 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.169
 xativa and for all sides for the right 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.300
 for the left it was not so much for 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.539
 up but yes for the sides and in 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.130
 close combat does not matter you put a 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.200
 a laser sight and is called a 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.580
 laser pointer and you can shoot from the 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.440
 hip everything you want and the 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.139
 truth that control is the only day 20 or 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.910
 30 meters is easy to 15 meters is still 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.100
 better and when you're playing as well as 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.290
 you're here at virtually point-blank range 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.270
 and relevant and the recoil is high or 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.620
 small in a gun because you have all the 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.690
 ability to control it because they are 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.580
 firing on par in baron g-14 it 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.890
 lost for me the whole reason why I 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.320
 I would use you is a defense weapon 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.910
 personal tombstone uu that is the weapon 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.590
 exclusive of engineers who also 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.240
 it makes it worse because engineers is a 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.190
 class that is used a lot for a 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.170
 film especially in conquest and etcetera 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.820
 does not have any logic of using the 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.500
 orders for what better to use the 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.660
 carbines that are universal in bar 11 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.550
 14 and you have a weapon that is a lot more 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.080
 versatile for greater distances than 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.050
 you do not have to face a choice 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.550
 4 then I hope it is but I do not know how it goes 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.830
 to be dragons titla people are talking 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.630
 very much this new dlc and that is going to be 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.920
 very chiva and that to have very good weapons 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.020
 and also that weapons can already 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.430
 try the people who are in the test 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.190
 environment in this is a good example 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.230
 what you anticipate there is no minimap 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.150
 I have no idea if there was an enemy but 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.040
 for how the outcome of the 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.390
 split and how I saw the triangle and 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.280
 what are the calaveritas of my 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.780
 very watching companions I imagined I was going 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.040
 to have someone behind that ladder and 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.200
 that's why he has the grenade and at the end I 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.510
 it worked fine but everything is a game of 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.409
 riddles where you get the enemies 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.179
 is 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:46.459
 it's something you can not predict by 

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:48.739
 blame the map then it's time I 

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:51.169
 I hope you give understand his error and that 

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:53.719
 of some kind of expansion I hope 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:55.369
 which is this one in which the weapons of 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:57.379
 personal defense have a little more 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:58.909
 of use and not how bad they are 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:00.289
 now is that really I was not used 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:02.119
 nothing more for a challenge but not because 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.110
 feel that they serve me for nothing I do not know 

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:05.239
 guys, what do you think? 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.610
 they feel that we need a little more 

00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:09.110
 of the close combat of returning us 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.169
 exactly the life of this but that 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.909
 we have something else I do not know close quarter yes 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:15.319
 that we can shoot with this kind of 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:16.819
 weapons instead of having to follow 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:18.829
 using the carbines in all 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:20.689
 classes especially the engineer or them 

00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:22.129
 It seems that it is fine as it is and take 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:23.929
 a film should always take advantage of 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:26.300
 your giant maps and shoot at everything 

00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:27.889
 the world at very long distances I 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.059
 do not put in the comments because 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:30.229
 these are always interesting topics 

00:07:29.059 --> 00:07:32.989
 discussion 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:34.189
 and everyone's opinion is always good and 

00:07:32.989 --> 00:07:35.869
 here we are already reaching the end of 

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:37.729
 gameplay in a game that is the truth 

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:39.319
 it was super good I think they killed me 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:41.779
 like four or five times and kill like a 

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:43.519
 30 enemies which shows what 

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:45.199
 I said the last video say relevant if 

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:47.209
 you use the scientific command of 

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:49.539
 keyboard and the final mouse accounts are 

00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:51.979
 by players 

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:53.150
 at the end of the video if you liked it you know 

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:54.740
 have a favorite X and do not leave 

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:58.120
 that they feel like it and until next time 

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.120
 goodbye time
