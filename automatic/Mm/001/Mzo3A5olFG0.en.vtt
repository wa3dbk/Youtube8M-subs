wet<00:02:00.450> wild<00:02:00.659> one<00:02:00.990> claims<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.680> be<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> bomb<00:02:02.189> stain

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
wet wild one claims to be a bomb stain

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.850 
wet wild one claims to be a bomb stain
so<00:02:02.850> that'll<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.240> hopefully<00:02:03.869> harder<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.710> get

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
so that'll be hopefully harder to get

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.280 
so that'll be hopefully harder to get
off<00:02:05.009> then<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:06.030> lip<00:02:06.210> color<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.750> we're<00:02:07.200> gonna

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
off then the lip color so we're gonna

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.380 
off then the lip color so we're gonna
start<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.250> tried<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.209> pick

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
start with this one I tried to pick

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
start with this one I tried to pick
colors<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.720> were<00:02:09.989> really

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
colors that were really

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.400 
colors that were really
similar<00:02:10.680> and<00:02:11.010> I<00:02:11.820> don't<00:02:12.360> know<00:02:12.600> just<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.200> can

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.690 
similar and I don't know just you can
you<00:02:13.950> know<00:02:14.070> fully<00:02:15.060> compare<00:02:15.650> okay<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.460> looks

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
you know fully compare okay so it looks

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.400 
just going to apply it in the same way
that<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.459> did<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.790> other<00:04:09.910> one

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.849 

it<00:04:13.410> feels<00:04:14.420> pretty<00:04:15.420> much<00:04:15.569> identical<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:16.650> far

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
it feels pretty much identical so far

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.290 
it feels pretty much identical so far
going<00:04:17.100> on<00:04:17.930> super<00:04:18.930> moisturizing

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.390 

I<00:04:23.389> like<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.020> color<00:04:24.229> of<00:04:24.500> this<00:04:24.650> one<00:04:24.830> much<00:04:25.129> better

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
I like the color of this one much better

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.059 
I like the color of this one much better
as<00:04:25.610> much<00:04:25.879> more<00:04:26.060> intense<00:04:26.629> looks<00:04:27.379> like<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.620> pretty

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:28.069 
as much more intense looks like a pretty

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:32.680 
as much more intense looks like a pretty
kind<00:04:28.879> of<00:04:29.030> ruby<00:04:29.449> red<00:04:30.069> it<00:04:31.069> does<00:04:31.280> have<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:32.000> little

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
kind of ruby red it does have a little

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.180 
kind of ruby red it does have a little
bit<00:04:32.810> of<00:04:32.840> a<00:04:33.020> gloss<00:04:33.259> finish<00:04:33.289> to<00:04:33.889> it<00:04:33.919> right<00:04:34.159> now

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
bit of a gloss finish to it right now

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.580 
bit of a gloss finish to it right now
like<00:04:34.789> I<00:04:34.909> said<00:04:35.090> it<00:04:35.210> feels<00:04:35.330> very<00:04:35.690> similar<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.470> the

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
like I said it feels very similar to the

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.230 
like I said it feels very similar to the
NYC<00:04:37.129> one<00:04:37.639> feels<00:04:38.120> very<00:04:38.840> very<00:04:40.240> moisturizing

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
NYC one feels very very moisturizing

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.820 
NYC one feels very very moisturizing
like<00:04:41.780> literally<00:04:42.199> just<00:04:42.349> feels<00:04:42.560> like<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:42.800> have

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
like literally just feels like you have

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.409 
like literally just feels like you have
chapstick<00:04:43.370> on<00:04:43.430> your<00:04:43.610> lips<00:04:43.759> since<00:04:44.090> this<00:04:44.210> is<00:04:44.389> a

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
chapstick on your lips since this is a

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.240 
chapstick on your lips since this is a
balm<00:04:44.720> stain<00:04:45.080> I'm<00:04:45.349> going<00:04:45.470> to<00:04:45.530> let<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.710> sit<00:04:46.009> for<00:04:46.220> a

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
balm stain I'm going to let it sit for a

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.369 
balm stain I'm going to let it sit for a
few<00:04:46.310> minutes<00:04:46.729> and<00:04:46.909> I<00:04:47.539> will<00:04:47.599> come<00:04:47.840> back<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:48.229> see

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:48.379 
few minutes and I will come back to see

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:49.869 
few minutes and I will come back to see
if<00:04:48.500> this<00:04:48.620> kind<00:04:48.830> of<00:04:48.919> set<00:04:49.220> in<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.460> lips

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:49.879 
if this kind of set in the lips

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.330 
if this kind of set in the lips
sometimes<00:04:50.449> they<00:04:50.810> magnify<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.680> little<00:04:51.979> bit<00:04:52.159> the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
sometimes they magnify a little bit the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.939 
sometimes they magnify a little bit the
balm<00:04:52.520> stains<00:04:52.819> so<00:04:53.120> we'll<00:04:53.300> see<00:04:53.509> what<00:04:54.409> happens<00:04:54.770> do

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
balm stains so we'll see what happens do

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
been about five minutes and it seems to

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.029 
been about five minutes and it seems to
still<00:04:59.150> have<00:04:59.509> a<00:04:59.539> glossy<00:05:00.080> finish<00:05:00.259> it<00:05:00.710> hasn't

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
see how long this will stay on so I

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.899 
see how long this will stay on so I
wanted<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.500> show<00:05:06.740> you<00:05:06.830> guys<00:05:06.949> an<00:05:07.190> update<00:05:07.370> after

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
it's been about an hour and a half the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.800 
it's been about an hour and a half the
gloss<00:05:11.840> is<00:05:12.610> not<00:05:13.610> really<00:05:14.120> there<00:05:14.330> but<00:05:14.509> I<00:05:14.539> actually

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
gloss is not really there but I actually

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.770 
gloss is not really there but I actually
prefer<00:05:15.050> that<00:05:15.729> it<00:05:16.729> feels<00:05:16.940> like<00:05:17.180> it's<00:05:17.360> like<00:05:17.419> sunk

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
into my lips better now but it still

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.029 
into my lips better now but it still
looks<00:05:20.210> really<00:05:20.539> vibrant<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:21.229> nice<00:05:21.469> the<00:05:21.830> color

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
always a plus I'm actually very

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.339 
always a plus I'm actually very
impressed<00:06:00.169> I<00:06:00.349> wasn't<00:06:00.590> really<00:06:00.770> expecting<00:06:01.340> that

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
impressed I wasn't really expecting that

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.219 
impressed I wasn't really expecting that
who<00:06:03.979> knew<00:06:04.189> as<00:06:04.669> far<00:06:04.969> as<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.389> pigmentation<00:06:05.839> goes

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
who knew as far as the pigmentation goes

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.159 
who knew as far as the pigmentation goes
I<00:06:06.409> would<00:06:06.559> definitely<00:06:07.039> say<00:06:07.279> that<00:06:07.309> the<00:06:07.939> wet<00:06:08.899> wild

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
I would definitely say that the wet wild

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.609 
I would definitely say that the wet wild
bomb<00:06:09.800> stain<00:06:10.219> is<00:06:10.520> more<00:06:11.509> pigmented<00:06:12.110> I<00:06:12.289> like<00:06:12.499> the

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:12.619 
bomb stain is more pigmented I like the

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:14.499 
bomb stain is more pigmented I like the
texture<00:06:12.949> both<00:06:13.279> of<00:06:13.490> them<00:06:13.669> so<00:06:14.119> I<00:06:14.149> guess<00:06:14.300> I<00:06:14.419> would

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:14.509 
texture both of them so I guess I would

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:16.149 
texture both of them so I guess I would
say<00:06:14.569> I<00:06:14.749> would<00:06:14.899> choose<00:06:15.169> the<00:06:15.409> wet<00:06:15.649> and<00:06:15.770> wild<00:06:15.830> bomb

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.159 
say I would choose the wet and wild bomb

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.939 
say I would choose the wet and wild bomb
stain<00:06:16.460> over<00:06:16.729> the<00:06:16.969> NYC<00:06:17.419> lip<00:06:17.779> color<00:06:17.990> because<00:06:18.800> you

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
stain over the NYC lip color because you

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:22.059 
stain over the NYC lip color because you
have<00:06:19.099> that<00:06:19.369> longer-lasting<00:06:20.379> factor<00:06:21.379> as<00:06:21.649> a

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069 
have that longer-lasting factor as a

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.029 
have that longer-lasting factor as a
bomb<00:06:22.399> stain<00:06:22.669> and<00:06:22.909> it<00:06:22.999> doesn't<00:06:23.330> feel<00:06:23.770> drying<00:06:24.770> at

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
bomb stain and it doesn't feel drying at

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.219 
bomb stain and it doesn't feel drying at
all<00:06:25.309> like<00:06:25.729> most<00:06:25.999> bomb<00:06:26.210> stains<00:06:26.569> do<00:06:26.809> so<00:06:27.050> that's

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
all like most bomb stains do so that's
