you're going to want to when you first
set<00:02:12.569> up<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:12.989> external

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
set up this external

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.100 
set up this external
drive<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.040> your<00:02:14.370> regular<00:02:14.520> computer<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.960> want

drive on your regular computer you want
to<00:02:16.290> set<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.620> up<00:02:16.710> with<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.400> fat32<00:02:18.860> file<00:02:19.860> system

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
to set it up with the fat32 file system

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.060 
to set it up with the fat32 file system
I<00:02:21.330> think<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.690> lot<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.870> default<00:02:22.350> drives<00:02:22.590> nowadays

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
I think a lot of default drives nowadays

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.670 
I think a lot of default drives nowadays
including<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.670> one<00:02:23.940> are<00:02:24.120> set<00:02:24.720> up<00:02:24.840> for<00:02:24.870> ntfs

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
including this one are set up for ntfs

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.890 
including this one are set up for ntfs
which<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.580> like<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> more<00:02:27.000> modern<00:02:27.360> one<00:02:27.510> more

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
which is like a more modern one more

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.200 
which is like a more modern one more
current<00:02:28.230> one<00:02:28.670> from<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:29.790> I've<00:02:29.910> read<00:02:30.000> online

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
current one from what I've read online

current one from what I've read online
you<00:02:30.740> can<00:02:31.740> like<00:02:31.950> put<00:02:32.130> data<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:32.550> here<00:02:32.730> but<00:02:32.850> then

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
you can like put data on here but then

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000 
you can like put data on here but then
once<00:02:33.210> you<00:02:33.360> try<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.600> put<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.110> data<00:02:34.410> from<00:02:34.920> the

in alright so here we are it looks like

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.960 
in alright so here we are it looks like
the<00:03:00.810> backup<00:03:01.290> started<00:03:01.980> after<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.730> couple

the backup started after a couple
minutes<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.390> kind<00:03:03.600> of<00:03:03.660> preparing<00:03:04.110> itself<00:03:04.410> here

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
minutes a kind of preparing itself here

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
hard drive in here put the screws back

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.839 
hard drive in here put the screws back
plug<00:04:49.199> it<00:04:49.319> all<00:04:49.409> back<00:04:49.620> in<00:04:49.889> and<00:04:50.340> what<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:50.639> would

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
plug it all back in and what I would

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.490 
plug it all back in and what I would
suggest<00:04:50.969> to<00:04:51.300> while<00:04:51.569> you<00:04:51.659> have<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:51.900> open<00:04:52.409> like

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
suggest to while you have it open like

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.830 
suggest to while you have it open like
this<00:04:52.560> if<00:04:52.979> you<00:04:53.430> have<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.550> can<00:04:53.849> of<00:04:54.180> compressed<00:04:54.539> air

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
this if you have a can of compressed air

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.869 
this if you have a can of compressed air
or<00:04:55.319> whatever<00:04:55.680> go<00:04:56.340> ahead<00:04:56.490> and<00:04:56.610> give<00:04:56.699> that<00:04:56.729> a

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
or whatever go ahead and give that a

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.339 
or whatever go ahead and give that a
quick<00:04:57.060> spray<00:04:57.360> because<00:04:57.569> it<00:04:57.780> can<00:04:57.960> get<00:04:58.080> kind<00:04:58.259> of

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
quick spray because it can get kind of

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.589 
quick spray because it can get kind of
dusty<00:04:58.530> in<00:04:58.800> there<00:04:58.979> so<00:04:59.280> never<00:04:59.909> hurts<00:05:00.180> to<00:05:00.449> I'll

actually already had the latest firmware
installed<00:05:28.379> on<00:05:28.919> it<00:05:28.949> so<00:05:29.940> I<00:05:29.969> mean<00:05:30.509> maybe<00:05:30.990> it<00:05:31.169> does

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
installed on it so I mean maybe it does

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.779 
installed on it so I mean maybe it does
that<00:05:31.469> automatically<00:05:32.009> but<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:32.490> might<00:05:32.639> as<00:05:32.729> well

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
that automatically but you might as well

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.010 
that automatically but you might as well
just<00:05:33.029> do<00:05:33.120> it<00:05:33.240> on<00:05:33.330> your<00:05:33.360> hard<00:05:33.629> drive<00:05:33.750> just

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
just do it on your hard drive just

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.469 
just do it on your hard drive just
better<00:05:34.469> safe<00:05:34.770> than<00:05:34.889> sorry<00:05:34.949> I<00:05:35.310> guess<00:05:35.340> and<00:05:35.789> just

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
better safe than sorry I guess and just

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.719 
better safe than sorry I guess and just
to<00:05:36.629> show<00:05:36.840> you<00:05:36.870> that<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:37.319> did<00:05:37.500> work<00:05:37.710> we'll<00:05:38.580> go<00:05:38.669> to

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
to show you that it did work we'll go to

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.189 
to show you that it did work we'll go to
system<00:05:39.090> information<00:05:39.330> here<00:05:39.840> and<00:05:39.870> you'll<00:05:40.080> be

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
system information here and you'll be

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.749 
system information here and you'll be
able<00:05:40.259> to<00:05:40.409> see<00:05:41.270> 413<00:05:42.270> gigs<00:05:42.509> out<00:05:42.750> of<00:05:42.870> 465<00:05:43.770> gigs<00:05:44.339> so

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
able to see 413 gigs out of 465 gigs so

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.249 
able to see 413 gigs out of 465 gigs so
obviously<00:05:45.180> it<00:05:45.270> takes<00:05:45.360> a<00:05:45.539> little<00:05:45.659> bit<00:05:45.839> up<00:05:45.990> for<00:05:46.229> a

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
obviously it takes a little bit up for a

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.680 
obviously it takes a little bit up for a
random<00:05:46.589> kind<00:05:46.800> of<00:05:46.889> system<00:05:47.219> data<00:05:47.430> but<00:05:47.759> I<00:05:47.969> do<00:05:48.449> have

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
random kind of system data but I do have

or then reload it with all the
information<00:06:29.129> it's<00:06:29.550> on<00:06:29.669> the<00:06:29.789> external<00:06:31.759> so

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 
information it's on the external so

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:36.620 
information it's on the external so
we'll<00:06:33.060> see<00:06:33.270> how<00:06:33.300> long<00:06:33.750> that<00:06:34.139> takes<00:06:35.449> once<00:06:36.449> this

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
we'll see how long that takes once this

gets done here

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.500 
gets done here
going<00:06:39.300> to<00:06:39.360> restart<00:06:41.240> probably<00:06:42.240> will<00:06:42.360> take

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
going to restart probably will take

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.450 
going to restart probably will take
another<00:06:42.720> couple<00:06:42.990> hours<00:06:43.260> here<00:06:46.010> all<00:06:47.010> right<00:06:47.160> so

another couple hours here all right so
it<00:06:47.550> looks<00:06:47.610> like<00:06:47.790> it's<00:06:48.000> going<00:06:48.120> to<00:06:48.180> take<00:06:48.330> about

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
it looks like it's going to take about

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.420 
it looks like it's going to take about
the<00:06:48.900> same<00:06:48.930> amount<00:06:49.140> of<00:06:49.440> time<00:06:49.530> as<00:06:49.710> the<00:06:50.100> original

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
the same amount of time as the original

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.410 
the same amount of time as the original
