to<00:03:34.630> me<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:35.580> was<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.760> speaker<00:03:37.090> strobe<00:03:37.360> I<00:03:37.480> used<00:03:37.720> I

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
to me I was the speaker strobe I used I

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.740 
to me I was the speaker strobe I used I
haven't<00:03:39.459> heard<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.850> message<00:03:40.209> yet<00:03:40.390> so<00:03:40.660> I'm

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
haven't heard the message yet so I'm

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.080 
haven't heard the message yet so I'm
guessing<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:42.280> would<00:03:42.430> have<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.700> trip<00:03:42.940> it

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090

in<00:03:43.239> order<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.570> hear<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.049> so<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:45.370> pale<00:03:45.610> only<00:03:45.910> six

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
in order to hear it so the pale only six

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.199 
in order to hear it so the pale only six
months<00:03:46.239> old<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.900> was<00:03:47.110> never<00:03:47.560> used<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:51.209> they

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
months old it was never used so they

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.899 
months old it was never used so they
replaced<00:03:52.600> it<00:03:52.810> with<00:03:52.870> an<00:03:53.200> EST<00:03:53.590> 3<00:03:54.419> and

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.690 
broke my back getting it up onto this
platform<00:05:50.919> so<00:05:51.919> this<00:05:52.039> is<00:05:52.160> where<00:05:52.310> a<00:05:52.340> stain<00:05:52.669> it's

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
platform so this is where a stain it's

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.029 
platform so this is where a stain it's
actually<00:05:53.270> suspended<00:05:53.840> by<00:05:54.020> cables<00:05:54.590> right<00:05:54.860> now

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
actually suspended by cables right now

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:56.589 
actually suspended by cables right now
if<00:05:55.280> the<00:05:55.550> cables<00:05:55.910> were<00:05:55.970> to<00:05:56.060> be<00:05:56.180> detached<00:05:56.599> from

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
if the cables were to be detached from

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:58.600 
if the cables were to be detached from
the<00:05:56.870> panel<00:05:57.110> it<00:05:57.410> would<00:05:57.530> fall<00:05:57.770> over<00:05:57.800> well<00:05:58.400> not

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
the panel it would fall over well not

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.920 
the panel it would fall over well not
really<00:05:58.669> but<00:05:59.240> you<00:05:59.330> would<00:05:59.449> actually<00:05:59.630> have<00:05:59.810> to

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
really but you would actually have to

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.719 
really but you would actually have to
push<00:06:00.289> it<00:06:00.320> really<00:06:00.560> hard<00:06:00.650> to<00:06:00.860> push<00:06:01.070> it<00:06:01.220> over<00:06:01.520> but

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
push it really hard to push it over but

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.969 
push it really hard to push it over but
it's<00:06:02.539> pretty<00:06:02.750> sturdy<00:06:03.080> without<00:06:03.410> the<00:06:03.500> cables<00:06:03.889> i

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
it's pretty sturdy without the cables i

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:08.660 
it's pretty sturdy without the cables i
just<00:06:04.160> put<00:06:04.310> it<00:06:04.400> on<00:06:04.490> for<00:06:04.669> extra<00:06:04.970> measures<00:06:05.770> so

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
just put it on for extra measures so

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
just put it on for extra measures so
you<00:06:09.670> have<00:06:09.820> you<00:06:09.940> got<00:06:10.030> any<00:06:10.120> comments<00:06:10.450> or
