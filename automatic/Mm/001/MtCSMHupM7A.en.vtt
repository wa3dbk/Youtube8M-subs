00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.719
 and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.290
 good today we are going to prepare one of a 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.869
 delicious cream Catalan cream 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.349
 Catalan is very similar to custard 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.960
 to the cream I mocked what happens that what 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.360
 it has the caramelized sugar on top 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.489
 that gives it that special touch to 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.390
 doing it we're going to need 500 milliliters 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:33.940
 of milk 3 egg yolks 100 grams of 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.250
 sugar afterwards we're going to need 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.559
 more sugar for what would be the 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.559
 caramelized by sugar 20 cream 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.350
 grams of cornstarch- type cornmeal or 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.660
 if we have the possibility to put him 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.980
 cornstarch to make it even 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.480
 thinner 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.460
 to taste and apart we will need a branch 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.859
 of cinnamon and lemon peel but 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.140
 trying to make the most of what is 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.670
 the white part 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.129
 First of all we will put in a saucepan 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.129
 three quarters of the milk 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:18.240
 together with lemon peel and cinnamon 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.040
 and we will put it to heat is not 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.700
 need to boil more than anything to 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.969
 flavor the law 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.520
 meanwhile in a bowl we will put the 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:33.170
 egg yolks 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.170
 and we will beat them 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.280
 when we have them well beaten 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.580
 we will add the milk that we have left without 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.550
 put in the saucepan 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.860
 and we will mix it too 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.860
 we will also add the sugar 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.050
 and we will mix it again 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.310
 and when we have already dissolved the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.579
 sugar we will add corn flour 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.149
 type cornstarch or starch if we have 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.979
 found 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.200
 the starch we can buy it in 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.170
 pharmacies 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.140
 or somewhere somewhere as more 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.900
 specialized but if not with flour 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.489
 of corn the perfect one when we already have what 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.340
 which is the area of corn already comes 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:28.590
 incorporated we will reserve it and already in this 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:32.599
 moment we have the milk that is already 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.599
 hot and it's already 1 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.830
 then as now we have hot 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.879
 and smoke comes out we can remove the skin of 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.879
 lemon and cinnamon 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.370
 and now with the help of a colander 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.709
 we will strain the mixture we have made 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.709
 before because we do this because we 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.860
 Interests that we stay fine and so 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.260
 Well, we can avoid any 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.780
 impurity of the egg shells or some 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.850
 thing that has not been left and we will remain 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.850
 the very fine Catalan cream 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.980
 and once we have it well done 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.560
 we will put this mixture again on the fire 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.050
 we will heat it to medium heat 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.510
 low and with a spoon we will go 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.230
 mixing for especially so that it does not 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.680
 hook us on what is the basis of the 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.170
 we'll have casserole in the fire until 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.270
 that is thickening and as you can see they are 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.390
 a few minutes it's not long but every 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.990
 Once it is already a little thicker already 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.460
 every time we have it more thick now 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.960
 we have to move on because if it is not 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.440
 to keep in mind that once 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.990
 cool it will already be expressed more so already 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.290
 we can take it out of the fire and once you 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:58.599
 we have taken from the fire we will throw it in 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.280
 the typical ceramic bags of the 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.280
 Catalan cream 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.739
 and let it cool for later 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.790
 cremate it and while we wait for it to 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:22.389
 cool it is important to cover our 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:26.770
 Catalan cream with film paper so that 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:29.280
 do not give air and we do not form a 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.280
 wig 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.730
 before putting the sugar 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.129
 now let's cool our our 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.830
 cream at room temperature 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.649
 and then when they have already 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.099
 cooled in the refrigerator will already 

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:57.659
 we have cooled the Catalan cream 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.659
 then we can take it out 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:04.189
 and the plastic that we had covering 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:04.189
 and we will put 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.060
 we will put the sugar to burn them 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.970
 it is important to create them just before 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.800
 consume them more than anything so that because 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.800
 if the sugar does not soften 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.180
 we will get good sugar 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.090
 distributed 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.870
 and now with the cream shovel well 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:34.330
 hot let's burn the sugar the 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.210
 we can do with the traditional cream 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.699
 that is heated to fire with a blowtorch 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.120
 or with this same one that is electrical like 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.120
 we want 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.420
 well caramelized 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.030
 and once we have them all 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:13.910
 caramelized or burned because we already have 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.520
 our Catalan cream ready-made and ready 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.580
 to consume as you see is very easy to 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.440
 It 's great and it's done in a 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.389
