was 2006 when I came over to Birmingham

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.830 
was 2006 when I came over to Birmingham
and<00:00:22.390> we<00:00:23.140> talked<00:00:23.350> about<00:00:23.440> the<00:00:23.770> design<00:00:23.920> of<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.840> XK

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
and we talked about the design of the XK

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.560 
and we talked about the design of the XK
yeah<00:00:26.200> that<00:00:26.500> time<00:00:26.740> what<00:00:27.280> I<00:00:27.310> wanted<00:00:27.580> to<00:00:27.700> do<00:00:27.850> today

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
is rather than just talk about where

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.510 
is rather than just talk about where
your<00:00:31.690> ideas<00:00:31.810> come<00:00:32.290> from<00:00:32.320> is<00:00:32.649> work<00:00:33.219> with<00:00:33.399> you

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
your ideas come from is work with you

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.880 
your ideas come from is work with you
and<00:00:33.730> create<00:00:34.090> some<00:00:34.330> ideas<00:00:34.690> and<00:00:35.020> so<00:00:35.320> we<00:00:35.740> do<00:00:35.860> a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
and create some ideas and so we do a

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.490 
and create some ideas and so we do a
little<00:00:36.010> different<00:00:36.610> thing<00:00:36.820> here<00:00:37.380> we're<00:00:38.380> going

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
little different thing here we're going

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.420 
little different thing here we're going
to<00:00:38.560> we're<00:00:38.890> going<00:00:38.980> to<00:00:39.070> pull<00:00:39.190> out<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.400> old

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
to we're going to pull out the old

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.940 
to we're going to pull out the old
sketch<00:00:39.850> pad<00:00:40.150> and<00:00:40.480> we're<00:00:40.930> gonna<00:00:41.050> design<00:00:41.260> the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
sketch pad and we're gonna design the

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.330 
sketch pad and we're gonna design the
next<00:00:42.400> generation<00:00:42.550> skill<00:00:43.980> design<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.100> next

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
next generation skill design the next

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.910 
next generation skill design the next
generation<00:00:45.820> of<00:00:45.850> Jagga<00:00:46.150> right<00:00:46.450> here<00:00:46.770> Ian

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
generation of Jagga right here Ian

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.800 
generation of Jagga right here Ian
so<00:00:48.100> what<00:00:48.220> I<00:00:48.250> thought<00:00:48.400> I<00:00:48.489> do<00:00:48.550> in<00:00:48.790> totality<00:00:49.600> but

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
so what I thought I do in totality but

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.170 
so what I thought I do in totality but
just<00:00:49.960> it<00:00:50.079> all<00:00:50.170> mode<00:00:50.410> all<00:00:50.920> now<00:00:51.190> yeah<00:00:51.370> ok<00:00:52.030> we

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
just it all mode all now yeah ok we

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.660 
just it all mode all now yeah ok we
finished<00:00:52.420> my<00:00:52.690> lunch<00:00:52.840> and<00:00:53.230> maybe<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.340> car<00:00:54.550> will

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
finished my lunch and maybe the car will

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.819 
finished my lunch and maybe the car will
be<00:00:54.730> done<00:00:54.880> by<00:00:55.030> teatime<00:00:55.420> most<00:00:56.200> designers<00:00:56.530> tend

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
be done by teatime most designers tend

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.950 
be done by teatime most designers tend
to<00:00:56.950> draw<00:00:57.130> from<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.310> front<00:00:57.610> to<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.790> rear<00:00:57.960> okay

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
to draw from the front to the rear okay

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.840 
to draw from the front to the rear okay
so<00:00:59.500> it's<00:00:59.649> almost<00:00:59.860> like<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.250> written<00:01:00.489> word<00:01:00.670> you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
so it's almost like the written word you

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.880 
so it's almost like the written word you
know<00:01:00.970> to<00:01:01.030> start<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.660> finish<00:01:01.989> right<00:01:02.350> I<00:01:02.590> like<00:01:02.860> a

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
know to start the finish right I like a

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.359 
know to start the finish right I like a
little<00:01:03.100> bit<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.399> it<00:01:03.520> a<00:01:03.730> nice<00:01:04.119> turn<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:05.009> then<00:01:06.009> a

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
little bit of it a nice turn and then a

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.090 
little bit of it a nice turn and then a
long<00:01:06.850> sloping<00:01:07.299> windshield<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.799> more<00:01:08.979> like

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
long sloping windshield it's more like

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.260 
long sloping windshield it's more like
that<00:01:09.280> yep<00:01:09.639> that's<00:01:10.090> fine<00:01:10.359> and<00:01:11.170> then<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:13.119> need

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
that yep that's fine and then you need

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.550 
that yep that's fine and then you need
to<00:01:13.299> get<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.509> little<00:01:13.600> bit<00:01:13.840> more<00:01:13.990> attitude<00:01:14.289> in

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
to get a little bit more attitude in

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.139 
to get a little bit more attitude in
there<00:01:14.710> so<00:01:14.829> this<00:01:14.950> has<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.219> come<00:01:15.399> up<00:01:15.429> so<00:01:15.939> this<00:01:16.090> is

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
there so this has to come up so this is

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.580 
there so this has to come up so this is
the<00:01:16.270> lightest<00:01:16.689> you<00:01:16.899> want<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.109> get<00:01:17.229> this<00:01:17.409> is

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
the lightest you want to get this is

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.919 
the lightest you want to get this is
short<00:01:17.859> to<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.009> front<00:01:18.280> as<00:01:18.399> possible<00:01:18.929> you're

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
short to the front as possible you're

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:21.889 
short to the front as possible you're
looking<00:01:20.139> for<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:20.289> very<00:01:20.499> overhand

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
looking for a very overhand

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.209 
looking for a very overhand
yes<00:01:22.899> if<00:01:23.079> we<00:01:23.139> can<00:01:23.409> I<00:01:23.439> mean<00:01:23.679> it's<00:01:23.799> not<00:01:23.920> always

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
yes if we can I mean it's not always

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:25.980 
yes if we can I mean it's not always
possible<00:01:24.399> because<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.909> flat<00:01:25.149> requirement<00:01:25.719> is

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
possible because the flat requirement is

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.809 
possible because the flat requirement is
this<00:01:26.170> how<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.409> process<00:01:26.859> really<00:01:27.039> goes<00:01:27.340> you

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
this how the process really goes you

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:29.160 
this how the process really goes you
know<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.030> start<00:01:28.299> a<00:01:28.359> process<00:01:28.569> of<00:01:28.929> just

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
know you start a process of just

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.399 
know you start a process of just
hydrates<00:01:30.130> or<00:01:30.759> sketch<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.810> then<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.049> engineer

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
hydrates or sketch and then the engineer

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.109 
hydrates or sketch and then the engineer
now<00:01:32.590> I<00:01:32.619> can't<00:01:33.039> make<00:01:33.189> that<00:01:33.399> I'm<00:01:33.579> sorry<00:01:33.909> well

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
now I can't make that I'm sorry well

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.609 
now I can't make that I'm sorry well
what<00:01:34.329> we<00:01:34.450> actually<00:01:34.600> do<00:01:34.869> is<00:01:35.049> we<00:01:35.079> start<00:01:35.350> off<00:01:35.529> with

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
what we actually do is we start off with

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.379 
what we actually do is we start off with
sketches<00:01:35.979> like<00:01:36.009> these<00:01:36.249> we<00:01:36.700> do<00:01:36.850> actually<00:01:37.029> scan

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:37.389 
sketches like these we do actually scan

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:38.910 
sketches like these we do actually scan
them<00:01:37.569> into<00:01:37.689> Photoshop<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:38.229> we<00:01:38.469> render<00:01:38.799> them

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
them into Photoshop and we render them

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.010 
them into Photoshop and we render them
up<00:01:39.039> and<00:01:39.909> that's<00:01:40.060> about<00:01:40.179> where<00:01:40.569> I<00:01:40.600> can<00:01:40.899> have

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
up and that's about where I can have

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.440 
up and that's about where I can have
leave<00:01:41.649> the<00:01:41.859> process<00:01:42.340> then<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.029> designers

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
leave the process then to the designers

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.870 
leave the process then to the designers
to<00:01:43.539> start<00:01:43.779> creating<00:01:44.880> three-dimensional

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
to start creating three-dimensional

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.300 
to start creating three-dimensional
models<00:01:46.509> in<00:01:46.659> ileus<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.649> same<00:01:47.829> stuff<00:01:48.069> you<00:01:48.189> use

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
models in ileus the same stuff you use

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.030 
models in ileus the same stuff you use
the<00:01:48.429> filming

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
the filming

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.550 
the filming
program<00:01:49.610> animation<00:01:50.450> stuff<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:51.290> we<00:01:51.380> will

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
program animation stuff and we will

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.060 
program animation stuff and we will
build<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:52.160> virtual<00:01:52.880> model<00:01:53.480> an<00:01:53.720> alias<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.440> then

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
build a virtual model an alias and then

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.650 
build a virtual model an alias and then
with<00:01:55.250> that<00:01:55.280> model<00:01:55.820> you'll<00:01:55.970> check<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:56.360> look<00:01:56.540> at

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
with that model you'll check it look at

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.330 
with that model you'll check it look at
it<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:56.900> we'll<00:01:57.020> rotate<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.530> will<00:01:57.770> animate<00:01:58.070> it

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
it and we'll rotate it will animate it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.550 
it and we'll rotate it will animate it
and<00:01:58.940> then<00:01:59.060> we'll<00:01:59.210> cut<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.450> full-size<00:01:59.960> car<00:02:00.350> and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
and then we'll cut a full-size car and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.950 
and then we'll cut a full-size car and
clay<00:02:00.800> we<00:02:01.220> still<00:02:01.460> use<00:02:01.640> modelling<00:02:02.060> clay<00:02:02.180> and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
clay we still use modelling clay and

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.150 
clay we still use modelling clay and
we'll<00:02:03.110> start<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.410> see<00:02:03.470> what<00:02:03.650> its<00:02:03.770> power<00:02:03.950> looks

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
we'll start to see what its power looks

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.680 
we'll start to see what its power looks
