of the Android devices that I've had

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.910 
of the Android devices that I've had
that<00:00:08.760> have<00:00:08.880> not<00:00:09.030> had<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.420> latest<00:00:09.960> Google

that have not had the latest Google
operating<00:00:11.460> system<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.900> systems<00:00:13.349> have<00:00:13.530> been

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
operating system the systems have been

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.980 
operating system the systems have been
promised<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.460> then<00:00:14.700> they're<00:00:15.000> not<00:00:15.150> they're

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
promised and then they're not they're

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.290 
promised and then they're not they're
not<00:00:16.020> rolled<00:00:16.529> out<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.550> I've<00:00:17.699> had<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.970> return

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
not rolled out so I've had to return

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.330 
not rolled out so I've had to return
those<00:00:18.539> devices<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.230> instead<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.859> an<00:00:19.980> iphone

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
those devices and instead get an iphone

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.279 
those devices and instead get an iphone
because<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.670> have<00:00:20.880> an<00:00:21.000> up-to-date<00:00:21.289> operating

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
because I have an up-to-date operating

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.349 
because I have an up-to-date operating
system<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.220> really<00:00:23.490> like<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.060> Android

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
system but I really like the Android

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.390 
system but I really like the Android
system<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.350> just<00:00:25.470> wondered<00:00:25.680> why<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:25.980> takes

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
system and I just wondered why it takes

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700 
system and I just wondered why it takes
so<00:00:26.519> long<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.330> get<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.930> updated<00:00:28.410> google

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
so long to get the updated google

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.339 
so long to get the updated google
systems<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:30.269> other<00:00:30.420> manufacturers

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
systems on to other manufacturers

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.290 
systems on to other manufacturers
hardware<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.099> I've<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.579> I've<00:00:32.880> had<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.270> my

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
hardware and I've have I've had all my

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.830 
hardware and I've have I've had all my
devices<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.380> AT&amp;T<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.570> you<00:00:36.570> know<00:00:36.660> would

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
devices on on AT&amp;T and you know would

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.030 
devices on on AT&amp;T and you know would
like<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.140> know<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.440> there's<00:00:37.680> anything<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
like to know if there's anything that

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.770 
like to know if there's anything that
can<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.309> done<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.059> regard<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:39.600> I

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
can be done in that regard because I

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.020 
can be done in that regard because I
think<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.140> big<00:00:40.489> miss<00:00:41.489> market

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
think it's a big miss market

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.400 
think it's a big miss market
opportunities<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.840> guess<00:00:42.989> my<00:00:43.110> first<00:00:43.260> question

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
opportunities I guess my first question

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.340 
opportunities I guess my first question
is<00:00:43.890> why<00:00:44.399> did<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.730> take<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:44.969> long<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.750> then

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
is why did it take so long and then

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.720 
is why did it take so long and then
secondly<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.160> anything<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.670> be

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
secondly is there anything that can be

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
secondly is there anything that can be
done<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.239> ameliorate<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.020> situation<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.010> you

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
done to ameliorate that situation if you

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.330 
done to ameliorate that situation if you
see<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.489> as<00:00:50.610> an<00:00:50.700> issue<00:00:50.789> yeah<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.960> yeah<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
see that as an issue yeah so yeah it's a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.990 
see that as an issue yeah so yeah it's a
tissue<00:00:53.809> Google<00:00:54.809> kind<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.469> determines<00:00:56.160> what

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
tissue Google kind of determines what

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.389 
tissue Google kind of determines what
platform<00:00:57.629> gets<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.320> newest<00:00:58.620> releases<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
platform gets the newest releases and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.760 
platform gets the newest releases and
win<00:00:59.699> oftentimes<00:01:00.420> that's<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.960> negotiated

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
win oftentimes that's a negotiated

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.530 
win oftentimes that's a negotiated
arrangement<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:04.460> that<00:01:05.460> that's<00:01:06.060> something

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
arrangement and so that that's something

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.270 
arrangement and so that that's something
we<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:07.020> work<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.380> hard<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:07.950> know<00:01:08.130> that's

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
we we work at hard and we know that's

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.149 
we we work at hard and we know that's
important<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> our<00:01:08.909> customers<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.159> we're

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
important to our customers and we're

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.039 
important to our customers and we're
constantly<00:01:11.549> working<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.479> Google<00:01:12.840> and

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
constantly working that with Google and

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.940 
constantly working that with Google and
so<00:01:14.509> it's<00:01:15.509> kind<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.930> an<00:01:16.080> ambiguous<00:01:16.619> answer

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
so it's kind of an ambiguous answer

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.380 
so it's kind of an ambiguous answer
because<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.280> can't<00:01:17.610> give<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.880> direct<00:01:18.060> answer

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
because I can't give you a direct answer

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.780 
because I can't give you a direct answer
in<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.229> setting<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.369> something<00:01:20.549> we're

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
in this setting but it's something we're

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.030 
in this setting but it's something we're
working<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.659> negotiated<00:01:22.259> issue<00:01:22.409> okay

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
working and it's a negotiated issue okay

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.910 
working and it's a negotiated issue okay
so<00:01:23.150> your<00:01:24.150> feedback<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.720> important<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.680> just

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
so your feedback is important it's just

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.039 
so your feedback is important it's just
one<00:01:26.070> more<00:01:26.100> data<00:01:26.490> point<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:27.030> me<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.330> recognize

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
one more data point for me I recognize

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.450 
one more data point for me I recognize
this<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.350> an<00:01:28.439> issue<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.430> working

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
this is an issue and so we are working

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.679 
this is an issue and so we are working
it<00:01:29.939> very<00:01:30.180> aggressively<00:01:32.090> Android<00:01:33.090> platform<00:01:33.600> is

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
it very aggressively Android platform is

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.569 
it very aggressively Android platform is
one<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.170> are<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.799> committed<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.280> as

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
one that we are really committed to as

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.899 
one that we are really committed to as
well<00:01:35.790> i<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.799> ecosystem<00:01:38.310> is

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
well i I just I think this ecosystem is

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.690 
well i I just I think this ecosystem is
better<00:01:39.210> served<00:01:39.540> with<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> lot<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.100> really<00:01:41.490> good

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
better served with a lot of really good

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.940 
better served with a lot of really good
healthy<00:01:43.189> OSS<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:46.680> know<00:01:46.710> that

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
healthy OSS and and so you know that

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.889 
healthy OSS and and so you know that
this<00:01:47.040> Windows<00:01:47.490> platform<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.750> I'm

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
this Windows platform is one that I'm

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.960 
this Windows platform is one that I'm
really<00:01:49.770> motivated<00:01:49.920> about<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.850> an

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
really motivated about this is an

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.660

you<00:02:11.459> know<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.610> think<00:02:12.180> it's<00:02:12.420> got<00:02:12.629> some<00:02:12.840> work<00:02:13.020> to

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
you know I think it's got some work to

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.640 
you know I think it's got some work to
do<00:02:13.319> we

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
do we

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.020 
do we
got<00:02:13.769> some<00:02:13.950> work<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.099> do<00:02:14.310> with<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.610> particularly

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
got some work to do with it particularly

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.390 
got some work to do with it particularly
as<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.180> relates<00:02:15.269> to<00:02:15.480> security<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.230> as<00:02:17.159> you

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
as it relates to security and as you

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.179 
as it relates to security and as you
think<00:02:18.030> about<00:02:18.170> large<00:02:19.170> cap<00:02:19.439> businesses<00:02:20.010> and

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
think about large cap businesses and

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.589 
think about large cap businesses and
security<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:20.760> we're<00:02:20.879> doing<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.120> lot<00:02:21.299> of<00:02:21.360> work

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
security so we're doing a lot of work

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.880 
security so we're doing a lot of work
there<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.049> make<00:02:22.170> sure<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.500> we've<00:02:22.590> got<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
there to make sure that we've got the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.140 
there to make sure that we've got the
security<00:02:23.189> aspects<00:02:23.819> short<00:02:24.299> up<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.659> it<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.500> I

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
security aspects short up on it but I

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.520 
security aspects short up on it but I
oozed<00:02:27.150> about<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.750> new<00:02:27.900> opportunities<00:02:28.439> that
