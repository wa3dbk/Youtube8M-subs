00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.830
 they remember the previous video where 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.020
 I speak of predispositions failure 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.910
 good in a few words if we have a 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.650
 correct attitude we are much closer 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.169
 of success that if we think in a way 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.020
 negative but I never told you exactly 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.510
 what it is to have a winning attitude like that 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.490
 that goes there as an example reason is 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.050
 tell them about rafa nadal he is 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.390
 considered the best tennis player of all 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.070
 the times on clay court and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.320
 one of the best in the history of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.290
 tennis also holds the record of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 consecutive victories with a number of 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.179
 81 victories on the same court but 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.640
 they know what it is that concerns me what 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:40.920
 what makes rafael nadal different is not 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.679
 your physical condition or your abilities 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.329
 itself as a tennis player but despite 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.850
 he is always challenging the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.769
 chances and expectations and gives the all 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.780
 for everything to win even if you have 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.449
 forecast that statistically already 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.609
 lost any of us put in a 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.929
 winning attitude like the nadal rafa and 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.909
 as I explained earlier in my video 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.499
 of predisposition to failure if we think 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.539
 as a winner we have a lot of 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:05.159
 chances to win these are two 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.850
 characteristics that I think are the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.159
 most fundamental for 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.420
 number 1 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.340
 be persistent 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.439
 this I think is the most fundamental of 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.700
 all and is based on not giving up 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.130
 and do not stop until you get what 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.500
 we want we can be the player with more 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.450
 mechanics of the world but if we do not play 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.759
 it's going to be very difficult to get to buy 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.380
 our goals have to be like 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.690
 scarlett the squirrel from the ice area 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.210
 they remember how mascarat chased 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.549
 your visit without caring 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.350
 nothing else in the whole world that went up is 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.030
 so we have to do ourselves with 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.320
 our goals 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.780
 we want you to pursue them no matter 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.430
 what we have in front of us 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.490
 number 2 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.200
 to be resilient to be resilient is our 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.830
 ability to cope with a situation 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.380
 difficult and leave strengthened but because 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.020
 we left strengthened good because if 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.630
 we can somehow overcome a 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.640
 difficulty or difficult situation that is 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.440
 that we use to overcome them becomes 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.570
 in an acquired resource that we have 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.509
 us to face even another 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.390
 greater challenge suppose for a second that 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.700
 we stung in champions and our opponent 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.459
 It is the perfect control of our 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.370
 Champions usually in this type of 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.320
 situations I would recommend changing 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.660
 our matrices even runes to a 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.020
 more defensive or at least those that do not 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.550
 we always use a small adjustment 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.280
 because in fact we're going to have to take 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.050
 another mentality the line one mind reads 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.030
 much more defensive than that 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.910
 we are used to think 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.470
 although eye I'm not saying forever 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.990
 that we play against our cancer 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.940
 we have to make adjustments in 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.709
 our students or masters but if it is 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.020
 an effective practice to carry out 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.270
 to play against these in my 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.800
 personal experience and lately in the 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.069
 livestream I was going down a lot 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.080
 between 534 platinum but that was not any 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.720
 reason to discourage me fight not from 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.400
 arms but every time tries to play 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.220
 better and when we lost because of me 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.739
 domain rock and tried little by little 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.720
 peoples overcoming can be mistakes 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.970
 small as maybe I should not have gone 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.830
 to save that particular bus or 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.739
 I should have spent my pin 4 on another 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.780
 bus or maybe I should have chopped another 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.000
 champions that finally it worked 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.250
 better with our time so now 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.800
 they know try to be persistent 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.110
 putting the greatest amount of effort 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.300
 possible to reach your goals without 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.060
 import the obstacles and do not 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.310
 discourage the bad spells 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.959
