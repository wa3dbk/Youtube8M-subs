00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hey people today is the topic 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.060
 save in the beauty area I want you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.319
 just show that quite a lot 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.480
 you probably already have products 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.670
 at home you also have in one 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.349
 other area of ​​application to be totally good 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.540
 you know, for example, too 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.820
 that something like lip peeling very much 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.350
 Even such things can be expensive 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.789
 At home with simple ingredients 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.500
 do it Yourself 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.000
 and yes those are just things where 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.400
 so one or the other euro 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.760
 perhaps could save and is now 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.480
 quite a lot of fun with the video 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.430
 in the meantime there really is 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.260
 unbelievably many baby creams on the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.059
 Market can be very expensive 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.050
 actually there is a baby cream 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.300
 just one 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.920
 moisturizing and a make up 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.780
 and that's why you can do it all 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.640
 just mix it yourself and when 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.350
 You can dose the make-up directly 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.070
 also the opacity of the bb queen 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.070
 determine 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.330
 everyone knows him 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.360
 I personally like to wear something 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.949
 browser on my face on easy 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.440
 something fresher and not quite so 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.270
 to look the same, which I also very much 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.250
 often when I just do not feel like it 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.000
 have 1000 different products too 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.770
 use 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 then I like to take the bronze too 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.370
 just as an eyeshadow mostly 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.979
 namely a small blender 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.900
 brush and carry the browser in mine 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.880
 I think that does not look like this 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.720
 so very natural in the face but 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.720
 also on the eyes 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.980
 especially in the colder season 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.750
 require brittle lips very much care 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.510
 But if you look at the prices of 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.310
 lips peels look then yes 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.990
 one can only marvel 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.880
 You can do a lip piercing entirely 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.580
 Just do it myself, I'll take it here 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.480
 just two teaspoons of sugar one 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.830
 teaspoon oil and half a teaspoon 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.830
 Honey and the whole lot together 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.200
 with some sugar mixture on mine 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.420
 I am now massaging my lips with my fingers 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.100
 making a circling movement it 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.140
 could easily make up a few minutes 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.940
 I have solved all dead skin cells 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.470
 and lips become smooth 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.510
 you can either do that 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.510
 wash or cover as I do 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.610
 ok i admit i am absolutely 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.890
 lipstick addicted and we buy 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.870
 constantly a new lipstick but me 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.340
 rarely buy a new rouge 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.230
 and that's why it can be that 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.629
 i do not have the right rouge to my 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.790
 lipstick but you can just 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.980
 your lipstick on your cheeks 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.349
 apply the whole with the fingers 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.390
 Blend something and tata you have that 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.489
 perfect fit to your profession 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.830
 lip color the whole is ultimately 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.830
 nothing else than a creme rusch 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.570
 for me bodylotion is by far the distance 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.340
 best hair cure you can use 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.020
 I usually do that so I enter 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.150
 few hours before my hair 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.230
 wash some of the body lotion in 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.910
 lubricate the length 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.410
 let the whole country have a nice effect 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.480
 and then my hair 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.120
 they are so soft 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:21.220
 supple and shiny so tried 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:23.470
 Definitely that was on now 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.000
 my tips on the topic save june 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.770

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.840

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.790
 product which has been at home also 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.190
 in a different application area altogether 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.320
 can be good or just that some 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.370

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.230
