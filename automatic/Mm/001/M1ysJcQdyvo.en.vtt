simple very effective and it's very

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.410 
simple very effective and it's very

slow down examples of the impact of
quick-draw<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.969> clearly<00:00:57.300> see<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> effect

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
quick-draw can clearly see the effect

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.630 
quick-draw can clearly see the effect
the<00:00:58.410> weapon<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:58.800> quick<00:00:59.010> draw<00:00:59.129> obviously

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the weapon with quick draw obviously

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.700 
the weapon with quick draw obviously
aims<00:00:59.850> down<00:01:00.059> quicker<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.899> again<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.350> really

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
aims down quicker this again is really

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.349 
aims down quicker this again is really
slowed<00:01:01.949> down<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.370> still<00:01:02.609> even<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.969> real<00:01:03.120> time

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
slowed down but still even in real time

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.090 
slowed down but still even in real time
you<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.690> see<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> difference<00:01:04.379> however<00:01:04.979> when

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
you can see the difference however when

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.230 
you can see the difference however when
it<00:01:05.129> comes<00:01:05.339> down<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> aiming<00:01:05.850> down<00:01:05.970> from

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
it comes down to aiming down from

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.179 
it comes down to aiming down from
sprinting<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.530> see<00:01:07.740> no<00:01:07.770> difference

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
sprinting you really see no difference

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.160 
sprinting you really see no difference
and<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.760> thought<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.180> very<00:01:09.210> strange<00:01:09.659> you

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and I thought that was very strange you

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.750 
and I thought that was very strange you
can<00:01:10.290> see<00:01:10.439> maybe<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.740> small<00:01:11.100> difference<00:01:11.310> between

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
can see maybe a small difference between

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.670 
can see maybe a small difference between
the<00:01:11.850> two<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.479> nowhere<00:01:12.810> near<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> impact<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the two but nowhere near the impact it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.050 
the two but nowhere near the impact it
had<00:01:13.830> when<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> deicing<00:01:14.400> from<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.760> standard

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
had when a deicing from a standard

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.999 
had when a deicing from a standard

we<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.280> some<00:01:17.460> gray<00:01:17.729> area<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.240> some<00:01:18.479> questions

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
we see some gray area and some questions

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.510 
we see some gray area and some questions
are<00:01:18.990> raised<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.409> what<00:01:19.560> its<00:01:19.680> effects<00:01:20.070> actually

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
are raised of what its effects actually

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.070 
are raised of what its effects actually
are<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> creative<00:01:21.540> class<00:01:21.630> menu<00:01:21.960> it

are so in the creative class menu it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.480 
are so in the creative class menu it
states<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> min<00:01:22.799> faster<00:01:23.189> after<00:01:23.310> sprinting

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
states you a min faster after sprinting

as<00:01:24.000> well<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.479> mantel<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.020> climb<00:01:25.229> faster<00:01:25.770> so

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
as well as mantel and climb faster so

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.710 
as well as mantel and climb faster so
the<00:01:26.369> first<00:01:26.549> thing<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.790> found<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.090> little<00:01:27.240> off<00:01:27.479> was

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the first thing I found a little off was

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.420 
the first thing I found a little off was
mantling<00:01:28.229> walls<00:01:28.500> however<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.159> will<00:01:29.310> apply

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
mantling walls however this will apply

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.249 
mantling walls however this will apply
to<00:01:29.640> mantling<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.210> anything<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> game<00:01:31.079> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
to mantling up anything in the game I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.170 
to mantling up anything in the game I
found<00:01:31.650> zero<00:01:32.040> difference<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> time<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
found zero difference in the time to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.730 
found zero difference in the time to
climb<00:01:33.390> whether<00:01:33.720> i<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:33.930> using<00:01:34.079> dexterity<00:01:34.650> or

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
climb whether i was using dexterity or

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
climb whether i was using dexterity or
not<00:01:35.040> there<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.549> other<00:01:35.670> uses<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.390> perk

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
not there are other uses for the perk

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.120 
not there are other uses for the perk
but<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.259> scenario<00:01:37.439> its<00:01:37.890> rendered

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
but in this scenario its rendered

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.980 
but in this scenario its rendered
useless<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.970> next<00:01:39.210> test<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.450> did<00:01:39.600> was<00:01:39.750> against

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
useless the next test I did was against

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.780 
useless the next test I did was against
printing<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.500> aiming<00:01:40.770> over<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.280> time<00:01:41.490> i<00:01:41.520> did

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
printing to aiming over this time i did

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.550 
printing to aiming over this time i did
it<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:41.939> dexterity<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.930> quick<00:01:43.170> draw<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it with dexterity and not quick draw and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.350 
it with dexterity and not quick draw and
as<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.189> see<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.490> difference<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.180> my

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
as you can see the difference is so my

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.850 
as you can see the difference is so my
new<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.229> real<00:01:46.380> time<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> want<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
new if this was in real time you want to

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.710 
new if this was in real time you want to
see<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> difference<00:01:47.340> at<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.180> again<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.600> this

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
see a difference at all so again in this

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.780 
see a difference at all so again in this
scenario<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.320> useless<00:01:49.590> as<00:01:49.860> well<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.520> quick

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
scenario it is useless as well so quick

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.730 
scenario it is useless as well so quick
draw<00:01:50.939> anixter<00:01:51.420> d<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.990> did<00:01:52.140> nothing<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.590> far

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.440

as<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.979> me<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.280> after<00:01:53.340> sprinting<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> thought

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
as a me and after sprinting so I thought

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.969 
as a me and after sprinting so I thought
I<00:01:54.509> should<00:01:54.570> try<00:01:54.869> them<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.170> use<00:01:55.439> them<00:01:55.619> together

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
I should try them and use them together

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.530 
I should try them and use them together
and<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.340> found<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:56.880> see<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> sizeable

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
and I found you actually see a sizeable

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.910 
and I found you actually see a sizeable
difference<00:01:57.719> when<00:01:58.049> comparing<00:01:58.439> someone<00:01:58.680> using

neither but still now I mean dexterity

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.590 
neither but still now I mean dexterity
is<00:02:02.729> useless<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.299> aren't<00:02:03.509> using

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
is useless if you aren't using

is useless if you aren't using
quick-draw<00:02:04.079> as<00:02:04.229> well<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.860> decide<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.250> test

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
quick-draw as well so I decide to test

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.100 
quick-draw as well so I decide to test
the<00:02:05.700> time<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.000> takes<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.240> fire<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.780> weapon

effects that and sure enough you see a
noticeable<00:02:10.770> difference<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> time<00:02:11.700> it

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849

which i think is kind of strange I'm not

which i think is kind of strange I'm not
sure<00:02:34.800> if<00:02:35.100> that's<00:02:35.310> what<00:02:35.400> truck<00:02:35.670> meant<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.060> do

sure if that's what truck meant to do

but the phrase aim faster after

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.920 
but the phrase aim faster after
sprinting<00:02:38.400> makes<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.240> sound<00:02:39.390> like<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:39.720> should

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
sprinting makes it sound like you should

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.060 
sprinting makes it sound like you should

be able to aim faster after sprinting
but<00:02:41.790> after<00:02:41.940> testing<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.630> really<00:02:42.990> didn't<00:02:43.230> see<00:02:43.380> it

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
but after testing I really didn't see it

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.900 
but after testing I really didn't see it
but<00:02:43.770> when<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:43.980> pair<00:02:44.160> dexterity<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.640> quick

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
but when you pair dexterity and quick

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.790 
but when you pair dexterity and quick
draw<00:02:45.090> together<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.690> do<00:02:45.990> see<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> fairly<00:02:46.680> big

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
draw together you do see a fairly big

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.350 
draw together you do see a fairly big
difference<00:02:47.220> in<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.430> time<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.760> 80s<00:02:48.030> after

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
difference in the time and 80s after

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.180 
difference in the time and 80s after
sprinting<00:02:48.570> but<00:02:49.110> again<00:02:49.200> not<00:02:49.590> as<00:02:49.770> much<00:02:49.950> when

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
sprinting but again not as much when

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.740 
sprinting but again not as much when
you're<00:02:50.280> using<00:02:50.430> them<00:02:50.670> separate<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.510> hope

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
you're using them separate but I hope

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.360 
you're using them separate but I hope
this<00:02:51.960> doesn't<00:02:52.230> confuse<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.650> guys<00:02:52.770> too<00:02:52.980> much<00:02:53.160> I

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
this doesn't confuse you guys too much I

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.310 
this doesn't confuse you guys too much I
still<00:02:53.790> think<00:02:53.970> dexterity<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> really<00:02:54.960> good<00:02:55.080> /

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
still think dexterity is a really good /

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.780 
still think dexterity is a really good /
easily<00:02:55.770> one<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.040> best<00:02:56.100> if<00:02:56.400> not<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.580> best

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
easily one of the best if not the best

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.150 
easily one of the best if not the best
in<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.240> perk<00:02:57.480> 3<00:02:57.750> slot<00:02:58.080> being<00:02:58.680> able<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.010> shoot

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
in the perk 3 slot being able to shoot

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.800 
in the perk 3 slot being able to shoot
faster<00:02:59.550> after<00:02:59.640> sprinting<00:02:59.760> is<00:03:00.150> really<00:03:00.600> really

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
faster after sprinting is really really

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.720 
faster after sprinting is really really

thinking about changing your classes
maybe<00:03:08.910> taking<00:03:09.330> out<00:03:09.390> dexterity<00:03:09.840> or<00:03:09.930> maybe<00:03:10.170> just

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
maybe taking out dexterity or maybe just

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.720 
maybe taking out dexterity or maybe just
adding<00:03:10.590> on<00:03:10.680> quick-draw<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:11.130> really<00:03:11.520> get<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
adding on quick-draw to really get the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.280 
adding on quick-draw to really get the
full<00:03:11.910> effectiveness<00:03:12.330> out<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.870> both<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.050> them

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.330 
dexterity on my submachine guns I just
feel<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:18.660> much<00:03:18.989> faster<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.680> my<00:03:19.770> movement<00:03:20.010> at<00:03:20.310> my

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340
