00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 this video has shown that you can 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.400
 do with home organza materials 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.120
 neither of the two 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.740
 [Laughs] 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.049
 Hello, I will explain where we can 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.570
 take out a spark generator in this 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.820
 obviously home case for the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.710
 assembly of the dart gun that 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.199
 we made a video many people have 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.080
 order where you can take out then nothing 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.730
 very easy to click on the video that you see 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.679
 up to the left and you will see the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.250
 the gun assembly is very good 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.410
 Well, we have lighters, this kind of 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.079
 lighter that we see is not worth the typical 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.600
 waste stone worth we have to 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.780
 focus on these lighter those of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.989
 spark are also worth the lighters of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.129
 kitchen and also this one that we'll see 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.800
 later 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.440
 good the lighter the typical lighter 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.360
 this pocket to light the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.989
 cigars simply with pliers 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.100
 we are removing what is the part is 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.409
 metallic button are four pieces of nothing 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.750
 because it's pulling up goes to everything 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.159
 mounted without being stuck on people 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.009
 then mounted dropped would be removed then 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.680
 here we have the spark generator 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.750
 let's say model model one there are two 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.390
 models then models one in any 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.399
 lighter lighter both kitchen 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.759
 We can always find pocket money 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.580
 and when it's spark-like there we can 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.860
 see as well taking it out for what is the 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.350
 cable cited black would launch the spark that 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.990
 then mounting the gun as 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.940
 there is something good this is the second model 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.890
 this is quite more powerful than the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.110
 previous but it's also bigger and 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.000
 hard to get for it then in 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.800
 gas heaters we can 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.289
 find one or also in the stoves 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.690
 of gas that are ignited by spark 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.610
 there is another one is very easy to take out here 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.720
 we can see the test of the spark that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.730
 does and nothing because here we have both 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.170
 types of 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.000
 to spark pains that we can 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.430
 get in any house are very 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.790
 easy to get and they can serve us 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.860
 for 2000 and a montage like that of the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.000
 dart gun come I hope that you 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.620
 like it until later 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.220
 good and if you liked the video 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.180
 subscribe give to like shares and 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.820
 comment yes no then you know online go 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.180
 to you 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.180
