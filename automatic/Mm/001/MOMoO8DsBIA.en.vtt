00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Hi, how are you? I'm here to Lucas. 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.770
 I bring another one of my figures in this case 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:11.759
 I bring you to the reissue of that 62 that 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.920
 de galba throne this reissue they released 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.379
 two reissues of the face pulls two 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.050
 reissues of this which took the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.529
 original colors of the 80s and pulled the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.020
 mode s that is the color of the caricature 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.020
 or anime that is much more stereo 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.240
 more attached to the color in fact to me 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.890
 I like it a lot, that's why I bought 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.430
 it is instead of the environment 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.200
 oviedo of the reissue another because I 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.780
 they like more for their colors the players 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.860
 of these are closer I like 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.480
 because here they have the 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.650
 to your home 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.270
 to shoot that here we are 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.430
 have on hand here is your fit the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.780
 Well, it is because it keeps good 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.820
 conditions I bought it this new 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.000
 comes here as a small drawing what 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.360
 original of the 80s those that come from 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.810
 the eighties comes with his rifle and comes 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.450
 with this one in particular that is a the matrix 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.909
 It is totally metal 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.460
 has good weight comes with its one 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.310
 card and comes with your instructions 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.740
 and the companies that I hit this one 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.679
 has an alternating transformation but I 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.679
 Wrong was transformed in this way 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:42.330
 it was used as a gun type 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.540
 in this way you can point it and what 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.360
 can you use one as a gun this 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.300
 its alternate version that practically in 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.910
 the in the in the caricature would never be 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.560
 it was always seen in tank or cannon mode 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.480
 because we are going to proceed with the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.480
 transformation of this rises what 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:10.100
 this we say is totally 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:16.660
 let's say this like this 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.660
 and here we get what is the hand of this 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.680
 and here we grab 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.340
 way and doing this you take off your head 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.030
 in this way and then there they have it 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.660
 gentlemen this is the pattern no longer have 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.530
 have other other sounds that is 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.060
 and its way of transformation and has 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.140
 still another 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.140
 and that speaks to them 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:57.080
 here and we finally grab what is 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:00.470
 the cannon and we put it on his arm 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.880
 right in this way 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.090
 and we can also put the gun 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.150
 by the other arm and then 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.610
 It has different 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.610
 they have different dialogues which 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.720
 his eyes shine and various things 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.800
 this and finally we grab what is 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.569
 the matrix that the movie takes away 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.420
 he recognizes he takes it off so he takes a 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.770
 tram agnus and hangs it on this 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.390
 way what the movie was until 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.790
 he is hold loud he takes it off and he 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.239
 turns into prime rollers then all 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.110
 we know that galba tron ​​is practically 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:49.590
 the megatron reincarnation that was 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.470
 revived by this one in the movie and 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.600
