00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.960
 to prepare it well in aragua and miranda 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.579
 is that the presentation of the new image 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:10.450
 that side 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.720
 in front of which 500 great legitimate powers cultivated one of them is a 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.689
 powerful antioxidant 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.710
 also known as san martín silvestre 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.150
 oca tourism 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.800
 we remove the shell that does not cover in that Italian city 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.940
 and since it presides like this it determines av 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.810
 to generate a sexagenarian who left in a bad state 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.540
 In addition, enough for retired people 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.150
 a cup of sugar can be a heavy workload or studies 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.300
 a cinnamon stick 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.890
 i in this fourth 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.940
 the region 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.560
 additional to this we are going to move with a wooden spatula we take it to the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.590
 fire 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.710
 up to this point 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.080
 but you have the necessary assistance 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.990
 and free at the end almost at the end and let's leave a teaspoon of honey 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.890
 crazy 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.790
 we do that so you have 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.240
 greater elasticity 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.290
 that marmalade neighborhood 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.390
 look like chocolate eight pages 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.320
 il 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.090
 your end consistency in your legs once this little thing 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.490
 already at that moment and the jam that is taking possession we realize 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.180
 this the bustle 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.980
 The pointer 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.360
 it's a nightclub 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.360
 the lazy 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.890
 we have added the president of vimcorsa 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.000
 we wait a few minutes 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.229
 we turn off the fire 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.439
 we let them rest a little while and then we empty it 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:16.979
 eg a cited source i 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:21.339
 We hope that it will fit well to be used in the reality of these 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.019
 convoys a narrow margin 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.019
 If we had borrowed one year 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.999
 of water the mantle is very large can say in this case 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.689
 you want to stay like this 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:41.419
 too big for this to be processed a little bit but that always 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:42.359
 wants 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.100
 in pieces that are not like a culé 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.560
 so that they feel momentary ignores if the Catalan attack 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.469
 third front at this point 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:53.939
 and here we pay 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.929
 fire fidelity so require it 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:59.969
 we let rest a little here 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.729
 I come on vacation as he pointed 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:04.499
 with a container 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:05.559
 Until now 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:06.639
 we want to use
