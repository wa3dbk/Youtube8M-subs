00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.480
 saved all the games spaces are 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.000
 Dr. White we are here today with the 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.309
 fifth episode of our road to 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.379
 split one and ii barbo no thanks in 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.210
 this series where we go to try to 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.590
 win division one with players 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.539
 second floor 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.890
 we are still in division 8 against 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.930
 probably the strongest team 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.290
 found so far for a team with diego 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.210
 cost year royce is not for sure from 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.650
 underestimate 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.969
 there was a serious problem in this 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.730
 I play the lag that I don't know if it was caused 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.500
 from me probably because I don't have the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.350
 car connection for sure an English one 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.210
 American, however, this game gava me 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.790
 sorry for the opponent it was my fault 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.290
 or if the blame on now I don't know in 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.140
 any case lag that makes this game 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.780
 unplayable for what you see is a pretext 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.220
 impossible to build an action because a 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.850
 sometimes your game freezes 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.299
 it looks like a little freeze 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.829
 let's look intently at what happens to 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.810
 nineteenth try to cross osvaldo 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.580
 these occasions are very soft 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.770
 that must be exploited especially when 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.030
 the vague game must be exploited all 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.640
 opportunities and what was an opportunity 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.600
 golden we sure take it 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.729
 easily to the 22nd then continue 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.549
 I really like to attack because 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.470
 we air is the central defender do 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.900
 a great duck on this morata roll 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.570
 arrives parolo who bags it 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.240
 practically empty door pro here 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.740
 scandalous moyer continues the game with 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.330
 so he looks at having his own 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.860
 mestre is not a problem of the card 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.180
 acquisition that I would lose some 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.610
 brake was just there in the game 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.400
 alive Butt fact that you can fly 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.360
 even here we have the fabric but put it back 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.979
 sipe of the Slovak player who 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.070
 here too no empty door not 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.390
 I rejoice because it goes well, it is not beautiful to exult 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.430
 in this case because the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.630
 game was definitely spoiled by the 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.759
 lag 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.729
 but what does the opponent decide to do 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.500
 he decides to leave the game then 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.269
 I'm going to win them I had on the bench too 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.510
 se lewandowski so still a great one 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.120
 team for division 8 a team 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.250
 from division 1 and in my case lost 2 0 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.989
 it leads a match against a team 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.420
 really interesting a southern hybrid 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.010
 sorry saudi arabia then there is mexico 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.730
 to be a dini a south korea 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.080
 so there are so many different states 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.150
 some skills have fast players 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.620
 however interesting helton and 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.230
 Ronaldinho is not really a midfield 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.519
 very physical but in any case passes 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.349
 immediately ahead with this 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.910
 great goal of the gaucho galluccio who 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.060
 I have not yet tried tell me if you have any 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.250
 taken as it is one of my favorites on 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.610
 usually scared because it's okay won't be 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.530
 fast but a pink disgust is more or less 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.420
 would be perfect for the philosophy of 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.090
 so my team if I can find me 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.190
 well with totti and hit him I don't see 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.840
 why ronaldinho should not find me 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.299
 well but maybe I'll try it of course 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.340
 not in this team because it would be a little 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.930
 difficult make the races it would take a 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.810
 hernanes and other Brazilian players 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.680
 in the case I am a shit because I do 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.930
 this goal 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.700
 here, however, especially if it is necessary to adopt for 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.319
 winning divisions also needs to be done 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.010
 these things I don't usually do here 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.660
 but you'll forgive me, I know it's a lot 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.880
 another sick father answers 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.980
 in the last episode on myelin not 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.750
 I made melina in with the part 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.030
 simply the opponent stopped 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.440
 play then I on 30 decided to keep 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.170
 the ball rather than going out of the deal 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.269
 78 goals also to speed up a little 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.829
 time so I hadn't undermined for 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.790
 the opponent was not playing then 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.150
 really 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.890
 trust in the meantime you have seen the goal of 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.569
 two to one with pablo daniel osvaldo 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.790
 he is a great player 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.530
 the review will probably come via 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.370
 gorgias promises I had lost the clips as 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.900
 the story doing all because with the 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.030
 story I play these games but 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.640
 I really am very much 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.409
 satisfied with this player will come 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.900
 an ad hoc column 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.120
 it's not a pretty video column 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.920
 simple on the series to those who want to be 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.720
 I'll be a little provocative 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.069
 I don't know if this week 's next 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.510
 however quiet it will come too 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.819
 this video exploiting you are seeing 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.979
 how the three-man defense is punctured 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.019
 really too easily on this me 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.350
 seems a little weak way to those with 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.289
 the defense to 3 3 5 2 3 4 2 1 3 4 3 3 4 1 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.690
 2 respect maybe or friends like i am 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.610
 using I have a 4 module talking 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.199
 then you can see the problems of scared 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.349
 on kick-off 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.910
 he surely fails to defend though 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.260
 osvaldo it really goes with extreme 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.030
 here also a bit of luck 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.860
 because the goalkeeper still para it 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.460
 at the beginning, however, that always remains on 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.800
 feet and valdo also puts 5 2's goals in 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.180
 defense left some 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.070
 little problem because I don't have anyway 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.940
 great phenomena and the opponent 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.370
 then 53 tennis matches of fifa 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.250
 you know how they are he goes up front 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.539
 total so I can start again 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.789
 quietly in the counterattack this 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.010
 two against one wonderfully managed 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.229
 with this huge number of osvaldo 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.580
 we hope it does not mark the derby indeed 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.949
 probably this video we go after 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.810
 derby if you have made a mistake I hate you 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.280
 if it has n't scored better than if we have 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.289
 also won the important that you do not 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.500
 are of the inter b miri we will see later how 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.110
 the ninetieth mourning derby square will go 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.120
 head the goal of 7 to 3 and closes the 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.580
 game and the episode we are to score 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.080
 full also in division 8 will go up by 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.900
 sure the difficulty going on in the 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.940
 video we will see in the meantime four games 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.500
 made in division 8 4 victories indeed 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.599
 sorry among victor three games three 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.010
 apologetic victories so come with 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.510
 what the components left us 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.110
 subscribers to the channel we will see soon 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.110
 Hi everyone
