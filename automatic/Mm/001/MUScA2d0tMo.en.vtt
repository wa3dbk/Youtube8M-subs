00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 Wobblers are probably the most diverse 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.990
 multifaceted spinning bait class 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.240
 variety of shapes of sizes and colors 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.639
 designed to satisfy not only the taste and 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.420
 most fastidious fish but sometimes 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.859
 aesthetic preferences of anglers 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 classifications of all kinds of forms are called upon 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.990
 make at least some sort of systematization 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.439
 but for example such baits as compound 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.869
 wobblers can be distinguished in a separate class 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.590
 regardless of their shape and size, the main 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.500
 x furnace 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.480
 unifying this presence 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.910
 several parts of the body 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.280
 their bait may be two like a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.710
 Most of the composition is not for 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.350
 more so flexible and agile 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.239
 connecting bait body parts 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.879
 allows her to create very 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.280
 naturalistic movements and angler 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.739
 perform the wiring at the slowest and 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.949
 delicate style is a must 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.530
 provokes even the most passive 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.600
 intractable predator fishing in 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.629
 flooded lakes of the Lower Volga 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.220
 cold water and little active fish 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.950
 it is the composite wobbler allowed 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.810
 achieve the best result it was 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.400
 psr model from pontoon21 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.740
 in the spring it is usually catching on 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.250
 shoal apparently an obstacle then 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.900
 there we are now see the coastal with growing 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.680
 last year's grass, or rather not growing 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.420
 already dying some bushes stick in 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.390
 All these places can stand pike 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.570
 so before every place we catch 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.579
 slowly we don't know how pike is tuned 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.740
 some of them are in active phase 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.240
 it is absolutely very sluggish therefore 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.619
 as important as possible slowly 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.479
 hold slowly 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.820
 close proximity to each 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.579
 the obstacles are exactly for this i use 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.530
 allowing to fish such places 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.470
 a very slow pace will make it 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.230
 pacer 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.210
 treason 90 film we probably is the one 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.300
 the rarest case when fishing 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.420
 the bait gets so capacious 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.090
 diverse 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.800
 both meaningfully and psr name in 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.350
 translated from English means and 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.530
 is very convenient to clarify the essence 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.530
 name on the example with the word horse running 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.900
 amble is a literal 0 move when with as 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.870
 he immediately lifts both legs to the right or 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.300
 on the left while swaying from side to 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.390
 side to the main characteristics 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.610
 Wobblers Pacer as bait refers 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.950
 longitudinal vibrations his body when 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.020
 wiring he shakes his tanks from the side 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.650
 aside depending on tempo 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.570
 wiring 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.090
 his fluctuations can be sharp and 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.520
 active or opposite smooth and 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.110
 unhurried however the game of this wobbler 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.360
 cannot be characterized only 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.860
 longitudinal they are also called rolling or 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:49.030
 body vibrations 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:51.490
 Wobbling the usual part of some commit 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.920
 wide and sweeping vibrations only in 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.360
 one plane and these only 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.590
 attractive to fish 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.340
 but the so-called different course of the phaser 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.480
 significantly expands the boundaries 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.000
 of opportunities 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.090
 conventional compound bait literally 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.830
 passed train locomotives 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.930
 unwraps it in place i mean i 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.519
 tugging a little he unfolds 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.920
 comes on the other hand a little bit 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.750
 turns over and again a little jerk 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.120
 he makes literally a few vibrations 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.250
 again turns 90 in some 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.080
 even 180 degrees 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.750
 it turns out very, very slowly 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.120
 catch some particular place at 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.980
 posting every lure body movement 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.860
 accompanied by turning right or 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.049
 left and such a complex movement immediately in 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.910
 several planes even occur 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:45.930
 with simple uniform wiring , here's another 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.880
 tricky perch is not just ryvkin it 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.060
 somehow do not excite doing and enough 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.910
 for a long time 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.060
 just dragging evenly a wobbler 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.000
 so he went straight but due to 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.410
 the fact that the lure is compound 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.030
 additionally plays and that's it 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.160
 this is the movement for some reason 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.160
 provokes these here perks 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:20.870
 fun 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:25.490
 I think wow stupid this boar 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.800
 this is real gang shooter here 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.160
 small perch rides I sent a shallow water 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.650
 bait because here plus somewhere 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.110
 half a meter maximum depth peyser again 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.640
 Well, here is such a great bass 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.110
 From and I pricked in shock 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.240
 if with simple uniform wiring 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.790
 peter only slightly deviates to the right or 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.560
 left then twitching his movement 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.600
 seemingly chaotic at first glance 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.550
 unpredictable 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.170
 after a jerk with a rod in appearance seeks 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.330
 go in the direction given by anglers 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.520
 trajectories and at more temperamental 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.170
 Vigorous wiring Pacer is capable 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.160
 make a turn and almost a hundred 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.860
 eighty degrees 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.280
 thereby demonstrating the predator chaotic 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.820
 movements of the victim when fishing in such 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.530
 constrained to peaceful conditions on my 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.900
 a look is very convenient to use just 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.830
 nevertheless just like that 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.690
 arises 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.030
 need to throw here literally under this 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.990
 Bush and useful wiring is obtained 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.110
 meter and a half 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.850
 with a 100 insight opens us new facets he 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.860
 allows you to work almost on site 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.750
 that is, and a little bit he pulled 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.430
 turned turned over and confused 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.590
 practically in the same place with 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.990
 whom I tugged him that is very 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.810
 what a slow bait is obtained if 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.140
 we need to update some small 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.150
 small concrete part of the window 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.570
 between the roots between the grass 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:51.919
 then the composite here are the most profitable roles 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:53.270
 lure minnow of course will be in one 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.100
 jerk go a great distance 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.220
 part of whom can not play almost 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.920
 in place 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.670
 composite wobbler psr presented in two 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.010
 sizes 75 millimeters and 90 millimeters 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:08.220
 each size model has two 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:11.370
 neutral buoyancy option or her 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.820
 also called suspending and floating 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.250
 floating floating psd better suited 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.320
 for shallow water places he 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.750
 proved to be an excellent bait 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.240
 able to wade over slightly 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.390
 covered with water thickets of grass or 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.580
 Koryazhnika Suspender preferred for 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:33.000
 jerking wiring and active manners 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.670
 catching risking bait movement and and 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.590
 turns and course changes are exactly 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.640
 remind movement scared or 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.190
 wounded fish 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.220
 due to its neutral buoyancy and 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.350
 ability to freeze in the water column such 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.190
 pace version 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.200
 presents to angler more 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.810
 opportunities for fishing on various 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.330
 depths of the next video releases 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.470
 applications we will continue our story about 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.140
 compound wobblers 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:02.190
 on the example of other equally prominent 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:06.120
 models for each trophy 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:09.150
 have a story and tackle 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.570
 for any story 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.690
 pontoon 21 here it is fishing 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.690
 happiness
