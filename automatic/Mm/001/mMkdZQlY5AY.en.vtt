and<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.960> disputed<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.770> because<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.160> thought<00:00:20.310> that

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and I disputed it because I thought that

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.509 
and I disputed it because I thought that
if<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.779> did<00:00:22.050> then<00:00:22.320> maybe<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.680> could<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:23.430> I

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
if I did then maybe I could do it but I

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.759 
if I did then maybe I could do it but I
think<00:00:23.869> because<00:00:24.869> i<00:00:24.960> use<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.260> official

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
