notebook<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.320> actually<00:00:55.800> from<00:00:57.379> back<00:00:58.379> when

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
notebook is actually from back when

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.770

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
collecting it so it looks like I might

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.340 
collecting it so it looks like I might
have<00:01:04.409> actually<00:01:04.589> tried<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.129> start<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.430> pokedex

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.000 
were probably just put in this pocket
and<00:05:43.710> forgotten<00:05:44.220> about<00:05:44.400> so<00:05:45.770> yeah<00:05:46.770> I'll

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
and forgotten about so yeah I'll

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
and forgotten about so yeah I'll
probably<00:05:47.130> be<00:05:47.670> taking<00:05:48.630> a<00:05:48.840> look<00:05:48.960> at<00:05:49.170> the<00:05:50.030> these

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
probably be taking a look at the these

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.880 
probably be taking a look at the these
two<00:05:51.300> that<00:05:51.480> I<00:05:51.510> have<00:05:51.750> in<00:05:51.990> my<00:05:52.170> collection<00:05:52.230> and

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
two that I have in my collection and

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.920 
two that I have in my collection and
possibly<00:05:53.280> replacing<00:05:53.700> them<00:05:53.940> with<00:05:53.970> these<00:05:54.270> so

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
possibly replacing them with these so

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.070 
possibly replacing them with these so
but<00:05:55.290> there<00:05:55.410> will<00:05:55.590> be<00:05:56.540> these<00:05:57.540> of<00:05:57.780> some<00:05:57.930> kind

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
but there will be these of some kind

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.650 
but there will be these of some kind
available<00:05:58.380> for<00:05:58.770> trade<00:05:58.950> so<00:05:59.580> for<00:06:00.240> now<00:06:00.360> since

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
available for trade so for now since

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.810 
available for trade so for now since
they<00:06:01.130> this<00:06:02.130> seems<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.400> be<00:06:02.460> a<00:06:02.520> pretty<00:06:02.700> good

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
they this seems to be a pretty good

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.970 
they this seems to be a pretty good
place<00:06:03.060> to<00:06:03.210> store<00:06:03.390> to<00:06:03.510> them<00:06:03.740> those<00:06:04.740> are<00:06:04.860> the

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
place to store to them those are the

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.650 
place to store to them those are the
only<00:06:05.130> cards<00:06:05.820> that<00:06:06.000> I<00:06:06.060> found<00:06:06.390> in<00:06:06.600> here<00:06:07.190> so<00:06:08.660> I

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
only cards that I found in here so I

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.360 
only cards that I found in here so I
just<00:06:10.140> check<00:06:10.350> in<00:06:10.440> the<00:06:10.530> pockets<00:06:10.920> and<00:06:11.070> everything

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
just check in the pockets and everything

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.220 
just check in the pockets and everything
of<00:06:11.490> these<00:06:11.610> but<00:06:11.880> nothing<00:06:12.150> else<00:06:12.300> so<00:06:12.870> thought

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
of these but nothing else so thought

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.310 
of these but nothing else so thought
that<00:06:13.380> was<00:06:13.500> an<00:06:13.590> interesting<00:06:13.830> find<00:06:14.250> and<00:06:14.520> uh<00:06:15.320> I'll

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
that was an interesting find and uh I'll

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.100 
that was an interesting find and uh I'll
