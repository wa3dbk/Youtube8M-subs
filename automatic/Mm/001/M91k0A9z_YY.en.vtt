so a lot of people avoid nuts and mostly

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.779 
so a lot of people avoid nuts and mostly
because<00:00:22.350> they're<00:00:22.830> high<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.189> calorie<00:00:23.519> and

because they're high in calorie and

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.700 
because they're high in calorie and
they're<00:00:24.029> high<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.330> fats<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.050> lot<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.529> people

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710

equate<00:00:26.160> fat<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:27.090> something<00:00:27.449> bad<00:00:27.689> not<00:00:28.470> all<00:00:28.740> fats

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
equate fat to something bad not all fats

nuts<00:00:30.929> are<00:00:31.140> actually<00:00:31.500> beneficial<00:00:31.949> for<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.430> so

nuts that are available and what the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.670 
nuts that are available and what the
differences<00:00:38.820> are<00:00:39.000> between<00:00:39.030> them<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:40.620> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
differences are between them and how you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.530 
differences are between them and how you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
so the first one is almonds and when

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.639 
so the first one is almonds and when
you're<00:00:44.910> eating<00:00:45.090> nuts<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.690> want<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:46.170> avoid

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
you're eating nuts you want to avoid

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.440 
you're eating nuts you want to avoid
anything<00:00:46.920> that's<00:00:47.160> roasted<00:00:47.430> anything<00:00:48.329> that's

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
overly salted the roasting process as

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.779 
overly salted the roasting process as
you<00:00:51.899> know<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.379> said<00:00:52.710> nuts<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.399> filled

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
you know as I just said nuts are filled

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.790 
you know as I just said nuts are filled
with<00:00:53.879> fats<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.170> don't<00:00:55.350> want<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.590> cook

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
with fats so you don't want to cook

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
with fats so you don't want to cook
those<00:00:56.039> fats<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.120> them<00:00:57.270> put<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
those fats then have them put it in a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.330 
those fats then have them put it in a
bag<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.199> then<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> shelf<00:00:58.829> that's<00:00:59.010> sitting

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
bag and then on a shelf that's sitting

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.220 
bag and then on a shelf that's sitting
there<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.730> years<00:00:59.940> or<00:01:00.149> months<00:01:00.539> or<00:01:00.780> whatever<00:01:00.899> it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
there for years or months or whatever it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.139 
there for years or months or whatever it
is<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.530> those<00:01:01.890> fats<00:01:02.129> become<00:01:02.489> rancid<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
is because those fats become rancid and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.579 
is because those fats become rancid and
that's<00:01:03.690> not<00:01:03.870> great<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.170> your<00:01:04.260> cardiovascular
