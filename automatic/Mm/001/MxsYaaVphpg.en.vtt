can you can
it<00:01:07.130> just<00:01:07.369> helps<00:01:07.670> with<00:01:07.759> seating<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.390> plugs<00:01:08.659> and

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
it just helps with seating the plugs and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.609 
it just helps with seating the plugs and
the<00:01:09.380> locking<00:01:09.680> plug<00:01:09.890> in<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:10.369> grommet<00:01:11.350> it<00:01:12.350> has<00:01:12.590> a

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
the locking plug in the grommet it has a

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.740 
the locking plug in the grommet it has a
secure<00:01:13.130> ring<00:01:13.399> around<00:01:13.549> here<00:01:13.969> which<00:01:14.180> holds<00:01:14.420> that

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
secure ring around here which holds that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.830 
secure ring around here which holds that
into<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.110> SPI<00:01:16.000> which<00:01:17.000> is<00:01:17.149> a<00:01:17.180> slaughter<00:01:17.509> post

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
into the SPI which is a slaughter post

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.870 
into the SPI which is a slaughter post
insert<00:01:18.289> now<00:01:18.680> basically<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.280> push<00:01:19.579> it<00:01:19.729> into

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
insert now basically you push it into

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.139 
insert now basically you push it into
position<00:01:20.119> with<00:01:20.930> your<00:01:21.110> hand<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:21.759> then<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:22.880> tap

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
position with your hand and then you tap

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.910 
position with your hand and then you tap
firmly<00:01:23.570> each<00:01:23.930> side<00:01:26.439> and<00:01:27.439> that's<00:01:27.710> how<00:01:27.860> simple

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
firmly each side and that's how simple

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.420 
firmly each side and that's how simple
it<00:01:28.250> is

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.950 

we've<00:01:31.430> basically<00:01:31.659> knocked<00:01:32.659> all<00:01:32.840> they're

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
we've basically knocked all they're

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.940 
we've basically knocked all they're
locking<00:01:33.170> plugs<00:01:33.590> in<00:01:34.039> our<00:01:34.780> air<00:01:35.780> grommet<00:01:36.170> in<00:01:36.350> so

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
locking plugs in our air grommet in so

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.289 
locking plugs in our air grommet in so
they're<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.250> differences<00:01:37.759> with<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.090> two

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
they're the differences with the two

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.529 
they're the differences with the two
that<00:01:39.049> you<00:01:39.200> see<00:01:39.409> from<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.649> back<00:01:39.859> of<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.100> unit

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
that you see from the back of the unit

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.270 
that you see from the back of the unit
that's<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.869> four<00:01:42.109> simple<00:01:42.469> components<00:01:43.100> that

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
that's the four simple components that

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.060 
that's the four simple components that
we<00:01:43.430> have<00:01:43.460> any<00:01:43.850> offense<00:01:44.179> so<00:01:44.689> as<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:44.929> can<00:01:45.049> see<00:01:45.109> it

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
we have any offense so as you can see it

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.279 
we have any offense so as you can see it
is<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.280> very<00:01:46.399> very<00:01:46.850> simple<00:01:47.149> design<00:01:47.479> what<00:01:48.170> I'd

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
is a very very simple design what I'd

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.800 
is a very very simple design what I'd
like<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:48.500> do<00:01:48.740> now<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:48.950> try<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:50.479> Nick<00:01:50.630> our

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.230 
install manager and he can show you how
simple<00:01:54.109> it<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.530> install<00:01:54.950> your<00:01:55.700> very<00:01:55.969> first

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
simple it is to install your very first
