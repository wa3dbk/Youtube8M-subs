00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.340 
tap again turn it off all right it's
also<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.640> my<00:02:36.940> opinion<00:02:37.060> somewhat<00:02:37.780> childproof

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
also in my opinion somewhat childproof

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.590 
also in my opinion somewhat childproof
so<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.709> children<00:02:39.100> can't<00:02:39.340> come<00:02:39.610> come<00:02:40.090> up<00:02:40.270> tap

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
so the children can't come come up tap

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.949 
so the children can't come come up tap
it<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:40.959> then<00:02:41.020> run<00:02:41.739> away<00:02:41.770> leave<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.400> on<00:02:42.959> it

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
it and then run away leave it on it

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.870 
it and then run away leave it on it
turns<00:02:44.320> itself<00:02:44.650> off<00:02:44.860> after<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.340> few<00:02:45.400> minutes

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
turns itself off after a few minutes

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.120

which<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.660> just<00:02:47.110> way<00:02:47.320> cool<00:02:47.590> we<00:02:47.770> didn't<00:02:48.010> really

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
which is just way cool we didn't really

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.030 
which is just way cool we didn't really
realize<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.640> until<00:02:49.290> our<00:02:50.290> kids<00:02:50.530> had<00:02:50.709> left<00:02:50.739> it

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
realize that until our kids had left it

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.030 
realize that until our kids had left it
on<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.570> came<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.170> turn<00:02:53.350> off<00:02:53.470> shut<00:02:53.769> itself
