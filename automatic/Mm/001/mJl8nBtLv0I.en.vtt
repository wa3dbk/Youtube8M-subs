three blades installed and these are the
three<00:01:37.950> millimeter<00:01:38.400> blades<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.909> basically

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
three millimeter blades that basically

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.230 
three millimeter blades that basically
make<00:01:39.450> three<00:01:39.780> millimeter<00:01:40.229> slices<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.970> and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
make three millimeter slices and on and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.539 
make three millimeter slices and on and
in<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.170> side<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:43.710> there's<00:01:43.920> nice<00:01:44.159> storage

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
in on the side here there's nice storage

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.969 
in on the side here there's nice storage
compartments<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:46.140> get<00:01:46.350> an<00:01:46.530> additional

compartments and you get an additional
seven<00:01:47.460> different<00:01:47.909> blades<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.689> we'll<00:01:49.020> go

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
seven different blades and we'll go

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.719 
seven different blades and we'll go
ahead<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> explain<00:01:49.950> those<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.490> one

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
ahead and explain those in just one

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.789 
ahead and explain those in just one
second<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.990> other<00:01:52.140> thing<00:01:52.320> you're<00:01:52.439> gonna<00:01:52.530> get

second the other thing you're gonna get

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.539 
second the other thing you're gonna get
is<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:54.000> food<00:01:54.329> holder<00:01:54.600> or<00:01:54.930> pusher<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.920> this

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
is the food holder or pusher and this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.580 
is the food holder or pusher and this
goes<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.299> machine<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.170> as<00:01:58.290> you

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
goes in the machine like that and as you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.880 
goes in the machine like that and as you
push<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.860> produce<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.810> you<00:02:00.810> know<00:02:00.960> your<00:02:01.619> hands

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
push the produce in you know your hands

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.440 
push the produce in you know your hands
never<00:02:02.159> come<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.640> contact<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.240> blade

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
never come in contact with a blade

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.020 
never come in contact with a blade
because<00:02:03.719> there<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.079> nice<00:02:04.380> solid<00:02:05.030> plastic

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
because there is this nice solid plastic

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.020 
because there is this nice solid plastic
piece<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.780> no<00:02:07.079> time<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:07.710> when<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.190> you

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
piece so at no time now when this you

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.969 
piece so at no time now when this you
know<00:02:09.149> pusher<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.959> food<00:02:10.140> pusher<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.500> guard<00:02:10.830> is

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
know pusher the food pusher the guard is

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.380 
know pusher the food pusher the guard is
in<00:02:11.009> place<00:02:11.340> can<00:02:12.120> your<00:02:12.330> hands<00:02:12.569> get<00:02:12.870> cut

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
in place can your hands get cut

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.600 
in place can your hands get cut
so<00:02:13.870> that's<00:02:14.050> very<00:02:14.320> nice<00:02:14.590> this<00:02:14.800> is<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.950> very<00:02:15.220> safe

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
so that's very nice this is a very safe

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.180 
so that's very nice this is a very safe
and<00:02:15.790> well<00:02:16.060> designed<00:02:16.450> machine<00:02:16.960> from<00:02:17.740> Germany

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
and well designed machine from Germany

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.440 
and well designed machine from Germany
so<00:02:18.220> let's<00:02:18.520> go<00:02:18.640> ahead<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.820> take<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.120> out<00:02:19.390> of

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
so let's go ahead and take that out of

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.240 
so let's go ahead and take that out of
the<00:02:19.540> box<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.500> next<00:02:20.650> thing<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:20.950> want<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.190> focus

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
the box the next thing I want to focus

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.480 
the box the next thing I want to focus
on<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:23.050> actual<00:02:23.290> box<00:02:23.620> top<00:02:23.920> this<00:02:24.100> is<00:02:24.160> very

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
on is a the actual box top this is very

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.990 
on is a the actual box top this is very
important<00:02:25.030> very<00:02:25.090> useful<00:02:25.690> information<00:02:26.260> as<00:02:27.000> you

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
important very useful information as you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.760 
important very useful information as you
can<00:02:28.150> see<00:02:28.360> these<00:02:28.960> are<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.260> different<00:02:29.590> blade

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
can see these are the different blade

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.190 
can see these are the different blade
styles<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.580> basically<00:02:31.060> get<00:02:31.300> two<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.960> this

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
styles so you basically get two of this

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.920 
styles so you basically get two of this
blade<00:02:32.530> which<00:02:32.800> is<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.100> blank<00:02:33.430> style<00:02:33.850> blade<00:02:34.150> you

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
blade which is the blank style blade you

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.960 
blade which is the blank style blade you
get<00:02:35.080> two<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.680> blade<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.520> actually<00:02:36.850> has

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
get two of this blade that actually has

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.030 
get two of this blade that actually has
little<00:02:37.380> slices<00:02:38.380> on<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.620> let<00:02:38.740> me<00:02:38.800> see<00:02:38.920> if<00:02:38.980> I

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
little slices on to let me see if I

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.770 
little slices on to let me see if I
could<00:02:39.190> pull<00:02:39.400> these<00:02:39.550> out<00:02:39.790> one<00:02:40.030> at<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.240> time

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
could pull these out one at a time

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.960 
could pull these out one at a time
while<00:02:41.350> I'm<00:02:41.500> showing<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:42.790> that's

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
while I'm showing that to you so that's

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.420 
while I'm showing that to you so that's
this<00:02:43.120> blade<00:02:43.420> here<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:44.470> kind<00:02:44.800> of<00:02:44.860> just<00:02:45.070> makes

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
this blade here this kind of just makes

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.460 
this blade here this kind of just makes
slices<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.180> then<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.810> get<00:02:46.930> three<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.350> this

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
slices and then you get three of this

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.570 
slices and then you get three of this
blade<00:02:47.740> this<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.070> blade<00:02:48.250> that's<00:02:48.370> already

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
blade this is the blade that's already

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.400 
blade this is the blade that's already
pre-installed<00:02:48.970> in<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.690> machine<00:02:49.990> this<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:50.200> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
pre-installed in the machine this is the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.340 
pre-installed in the machine this is the
three<00:02:50.740> millimeter<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:52.330> know<00:02:52.450> slicing<00:02:53.050> discs

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
three millimeter you know slicing discs

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.400 
three millimeter you know slicing discs
you<00:02:53.980> get<00:02:54.130> two<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.700> wavy<00:02:54.910> cuts<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.690> then

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
you get two of the wavy cuts and then

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.830 
you get two of the wavy cuts and then
you<00:02:56.530> get<00:02:56.739> one<00:02:57.100> of<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.850> five<00:02:58.239> millimeter

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
you get one of the five millimeter

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.410 
you get one of the five millimeter
slicing<00:02:59.410> blade<00:02:59.620> you<00:03:00.190> could<00:03:00.340> see<00:03:00.580> by<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.850> you

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
slicing blade you could see by the you

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.170 
slicing blade you could see by the you
know<00:03:01.450> on<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.900> top<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.590> there's<00:03:03.400> like<00:03:03.670> two

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
know on the top of this there's like two

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.060 
know on the top of this there's like two
little<00:03:04.420> dots<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:05.080> that'll<00:03:05.560> let<00:03:05.739> you<00:03:05.890> know

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
little dots and that'll let you know

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.100 
little dots and that'll let you know
that<00:03:06.340> that's<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:09.480> there's<00:03:10.480> two<00:03:10.570> little<00:03:10.900> dots

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
that that's the there's two little dots

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.690 
that that's the there's two little dots
right<00:03:11.440> here<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.980> that's<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.220> same<00:03:12.430> as<00:03:12.489> two

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
right here and that's the same as two

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.920 
right here and that's the same as two
little<00:03:12.940> dots<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.239> this<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.660> five

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
little dots so this is the five

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.020 
little dots so this is the five
millimeter<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.920> one<00:03:15.100> with<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.459> one<00:03:15.700> dot

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
millimeter and the one with the one dot

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.970 
millimeter and the one with the one dot
is<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.660> three<00:03:16.989> millimeter<00:03:17.500> that's<00:03:17.769> how<00:03:17.920> you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
is the three millimeter that's how you

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.110 
is the three millimeter that's how you
can<00:03:18.160> tell<00:03:18.310> them<00:03:18.400> apart<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.700> could<00:03:18.790> also<00:03:18.940> look

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
can tell them apart you could also look

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.410 
can tell them apart you could also look
at<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.269> spacing<00:03:19.750> there's<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.930> lot<00:03:20.080> wider<00:03:20.739> space

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
at the spacing there's a lot wider space

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.970 
at the spacing there's a lot wider space
now<00:03:22.420> this<00:03:22.600> is<00:03:22.720> actually<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.140> key<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.650> this<00:03:23.799> is

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
now this is actually the key and this is

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.490 
now this is actually the key and this is
very<00:03:24.190> important<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.120> can<00:03:25.390> see<00:03:25.660> which

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
very important so that you can see which

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.460 
very important so that you can see which
cuts<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.600> what<00:03:28.600> produce<00:03:28.900> you're<00:03:29.140> gonna<00:03:29.260> make

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
cuts and what produce you're gonna make

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.870 
cuts and what produce you're gonna make
you<00:03:29.620> could<00:03:29.739> make<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:30.100> minimum<00:03:30.549> of<00:03:30.640> nine

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
you could make a minimum of nine

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.789 
you could make a minimum of nine
different<00:03:31.420> style<00:03:31.720> cuts<00:03:32.019> that<00:03:32.170> they<00:03:32.350> have<00:03:32.530> told

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
different style cuts that they have told

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.070 
different style cuts that they have told
you<00:03:33.100> but<00:03:33.850> I'm<00:03:34.000> sure<00:03:34.209> if<00:03:34.299> you<00:03:34.420> get<00:03:34.540> creative<00:03:34.989> and

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
you but I'm sure if you get creative and

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.500 
you but I'm sure if you get creative and
start<00:03:35.140> putting<00:03:35.709> in<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.760> different<00:03:37.239> cutters

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
start putting in the different cutters

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.789 
start putting in the different cutters
in<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.720> different<00:03:37.989> positions<00:03:38.140> you<00:03:38.560> may<00:03:38.590> be

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
in the different positions you may be

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.590 
in the different positions you may be
able<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.100> make<00:03:39.250> more<00:03:39.519> but<00:03:39.730> we<00:03:39.850> guarantee<00:03:40.360> nine

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
able to make more but we guarantee nine

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.660 
able to make more but we guarantee nine
different<00:03:41.080> cuts<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.860> first<00:03:42.100> cut<00:03:42.430> is

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
different cuts the first cut is

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.630 
different cuts the first cut is
basically<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.769> 90-degree<00:03:44.769> waffle<00:03:45.340> cut<00:03:45.519> and

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
basically a 90-degree waffle cut and

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.310 
basically a 90-degree waffle cut and
that's<00:03:45.760> by<00:03:45.880> using<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:46.269> blank<00:03:46.600> and<00:03:46.900> two<00:03:47.110> of<00:03:47.200> the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
that's by using a blank and two of the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
that's by using a blank and two of the
wavy<00:03:47.530> cuts<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:48.700> next<00:03:49.060> is<00:03:49.209> a<00:03:49.980> 130<00:03:50.980> degree

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
wavy cuts the next is a 130 degree

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.789 
wavy cuts the next is a 130 degree
waffle<00:03:51.790> cut<00:03:51.970> by<00:03:52.150> using<00:03:52.390> two<00:03:53.320> of<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.470> waffle

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
waffle cut by using two of the waffle

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.380 
waffle cut by using two of the waffle
cuts<00:03:53.950> again<00:03:54.160> in<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.340> blank<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:54.940> could<00:03:55.120> see

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
cuts again in a blank and you could see

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.500 
cuts again in a blank and you could see
the<00:03:55.900> orientation<00:03:56.320> when<00:03:56.890> you<00:03:57.010> put<00:03:57.250> these

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
the orientation when you put these

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.900 
the orientation when you put these
blades<00:03:58.510> in<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:59.350> want<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.620> have<00:03:59.830> the<00:04:00.220> machine

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
blades in you want to have the machine

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.699 
blades in you want to have the machine
like<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.660> you<00:04:02.140> have<00:04:02.320> three<00:04:02.590> different

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
like this and you have three different

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.280 
like this and you have three different
blade<00:04:03.160> selections<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:04.030> put<00:04:04.209> in<00:04:04.360> and<00:04:04.600> these<00:04:04.930> are

blade selections to put in and these are

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.930 
blade selections to put in and these are
the<00:04:05.380> different<00:04:05.650> blades<00:04:05.860> you'll<00:04:06.130> pick<00:04:06.459> one<00:04:06.489> two

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
the different blades you'll pick one two

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.280 
the different blades you'll pick one two
and<00:04:07.090> three<00:04:07.269> blades<00:04:07.480> let<00:04:07.660> me<00:04:07.720> show<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:07.989> really

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
and three blades let me show you really

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.720 
and three blades let me show you really
quick<00:04:08.620> how<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.860> blades<00:04:09.190> come<00:04:09.430> in<00:04:09.519> and<00:04:09.640> out

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
quick how the blades come in and out

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.880 
quick how the blades come in and out
first<00:04:10.570> you'll<00:04:10.780> need<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:11.019> remove<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.350> guard<00:04:11.590> so

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
first you'll need to remove the guard so

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.410 
first you'll need to remove the guard so
to<00:04:11.980> do<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.130> you'll<00:04:12.430> turn<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.670> machine<00:04:13.120> over

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
to do that you'll turn the machine over

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.750 
to do that you'll turn the machine over
and<00:04:13.630> then<00:04:14.440> on<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.650> top<00:04:14.829> you'll<00:04:15.100> see<00:04:15.160> in<00:04:15.670> the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
and then on the top you'll see in the

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.430 
and then on the top you'll see in the
middle<00:04:16.060> there's<00:04:16.329> a<00:04:16.390> plastic<00:04:16.690> piece<00:04:17.200> and

there's a little tab on one side you

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.150 
there's a little tab on one side you
want<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.390> take<00:04:20.019> your<00:04:20.169> thumb<00:04:20.470> on<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.769> opposite

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
want to take your thumb on the opposite

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.950 
want to take your thumb on the opposite
side<00:04:21.370> of<00:04:21.400> where<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.760> tab<00:04:22.030> is<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.360> push<00:04:22.630> and

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
side of where the tab is and push and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.529 
side of where the tab is and push and
the<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:24.220> guard<00:04:24.430> will<00:04:24.580> just<00:04:24.789> simply<00:04:25.150> come<00:04:25.360> off

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
the the guard will just simply come off

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:26.290 
the the guard will just simply come off
and

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
and

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.550 
and
machine<00:04:26.629> is<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:26.990> know<00:04:27.110> dangerous<00:04:27.470> because

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
machine is you know dangerous because

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.129 
machine is you know dangerous because
now<00:04:27.800> we<00:04:27.860> have<00:04:28.129> the<00:04:28.370> cutting<00:04:29.060> blades<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.900> remove

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
now we have the cutting blades to remove

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.809 
now we have the cutting blades to remove
the<00:04:30.259> cutting<00:04:30.470> blades<00:04:30.740> once<00:04:31.099> again<00:04:31.370> turn<00:04:31.729> the

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:31.819 
the cutting blades once again turn the

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.580 
the cutting blades once again turn the
machine<00:04:32.120> over<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.539> you're<00:04:33.020> just<00:04:33.139> gonna<00:04:33.319> press

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
machine over and you're just gonna press

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.040 
machine over and you're just gonna press
down<00:04:33.669> right<00:04:34.669> here<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.090> this<00:04:35.150> will<00:04:35.360> remove<00:04:35.629> the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
down right here and this will remove the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.249 
down right here and this will remove the
cutting<00:04:36.530> blade<00:04:37.539> so<00:04:38.539> you<00:04:38.569> can<00:04:38.780> see<00:04:38.930> now<00:04:39.080> we<00:04:39.139> have

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
cutting blade so you can see now we have

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.930 
cutting blade so you can see now we have
three<00:04:39.710> different<00:04:40.039> positions<00:04:40.159> where<00:04:40.639> we<00:04:40.669> can

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
three different positions where we can

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.180 
three different positions where we can
put<00:04:41.180> three<00:04:41.509> different<00:04:41.659> blades<00:04:42.110> in<00:04:42.349> and<00:04:42.860> if<00:04:43.069> you

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
put three different blades in and if you

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.740 
put three different blades in and if you
put<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.520> blades<00:04:43.759> in<00:04:43.940> this<00:04:44.060> orientation

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
put the blades in this orientation

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.290 
put the blades in this orientation
you'll<00:04:44.870> get<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.550> this<00:04:46.550> orientation<00:04:47.000> you'll

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
you'll get that this orientation you'll

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.450 
you'll get that this orientation you'll
get<00:04:47.449> that<00:04:47.659> which<00:04:47.840> is<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.050> waffle<00:04:48.470> 130<00:04:49.129> degrees

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
get that which is the waffle 130 degrees

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.600 
get that which is the waffle 130 degrees
if<00:04:49.639> you<00:04:49.729> put<00:04:49.940> two<00:04:50.210> blanks<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:50.870> a<00:04:51.289> wavy<00:04:51.860> you'll

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
if you put two blanks and a wavy you'll

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.189 
if you put two blanks and a wavy you'll
basically<00:04:53.090> get<00:04:53.240> wavy<00:04:53.599> slices<00:04:54.199> if<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:55.129> put<00:04:55.400> in

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
basically get wavy slices if you put in

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.469 
basically get wavy slices if you put in
basically<00:04:57.199> a<00:04:57.319> five<00:04:57.680> millimeter<00:04:58.370> slicing<00:04:59.210> and

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
basically a five millimeter slicing and

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.070 
basically a five millimeter slicing and
a<00:05:00.370> basically<00:05:01.370> a<00:05:01.400> julienne<00:05:01.940> blade<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.719> a<00:05:02.810> blank

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
a basically a julienne blade and a blank

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.850 
a basically a julienne blade and a blank
you'll<00:05:03.560> get<00:05:03.740> five<00:05:04.129> millimeter<00:05:05.080> strips<00:05:06.080> or

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
you'll get five millimeter strips or

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.399 
you'll get five millimeter strips or
kind<00:05:07.460> of<00:05:07.490> like<00:05:07.610> matchsticks<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:08.539> you<00:05:09.259> can

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
kind of like matchsticks and you can

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.059 
kind of like matchsticks and you can
also<00:05:09.560> do<00:05:09.860> a<00:05:09.889> three<00:05:10.400> millimeter<00:05:10.610> slices<00:05:11.419> and

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 
also do a three millimeter slices and

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.670 
also do a three millimeter slices and
five<00:05:13.069> millimeter<00:05:13.819> slices<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.750> here's<00:05:15.530> the

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
five millimeter slices and here's the

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.899 
five millimeter slices and here's the
really<00:05:15.830> cool<00:05:15.949> ones<00:05:16.250> that<00:05:16.430> I<00:05:16.490> really<00:05:16.699> like<00:05:16.879> a

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
really cool ones that I really like a

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:19.330 
really cool ones that I really like a
lot<00:05:17.030> this<00:05:17.990> is<00:05:18.139> actually<00:05:18.469> the<00:05:18.560> wavy<00:05:18.800> strips

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
lot this is actually the wavy strips

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.990 
lot this is actually the wavy strips
with<00:05:19.759> one<00:05:20.060> blank<00:05:20.419> one<00:05:21.020> julienne<00:05:21.789> slicer<00:05:22.789> and

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
with one blank one julienne slicer and

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.379 
with one blank one julienne slicer and
one<00:05:23.240> wavy<00:05:23.479> cutter<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:24.610> then<00:05:25.610> these<00:05:25.849> last<00:05:26.150> two

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
one wavy cutter and then these last two

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.350 
one wavy cutter and then these last two
my<00:05:26.569> favorite<00:05:27.050> absolute<00:05:27.440> actually<00:05:28.430> we<00:05:29.180> could

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
my favorite absolute actually we could

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.809 
my favorite absolute actually we could
do<00:05:29.479> five<00:05:29.750> millimeter<00:05:30.349> cubes<00:05:30.800> by<00:05:31.310> using<00:05:31.520> the

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819 
do five millimeter cubes by using the

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.610 
do five millimeter cubes by using the
basically<00:05:32.389> a<00:05:32.509> slicing<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:33.229> five<00:05:33.409> millimeter

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
basically a slicing a five millimeter

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.610 
basically a slicing a five millimeter
slicing<00:05:34.340> and<00:05:34.550> two<00:05:35.419> of<00:05:35.599> the<00:05:35.690> julienne<00:05:36.139> cutters

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
slicing and two of the julienne cutters

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.800 
slicing and two of the julienne cutters
and<00:05:36.889> last<00:05:37.880> but<00:05:38.150> not<00:05:38.300> least<00:05:38.659> this<00:05:39.169> is<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.740> best

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
and last but not least this is the best

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.659 
and last but not least this is the best
shape<00:05:41.810> that<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:42.139> machine<00:05:42.469> makes<00:05:42.740> this<00:05:43.490> is

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
shape that the machine makes this is

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.459 
shape that the machine makes this is
actually<00:05:44.000> diamonds<00:05:44.539> so<00:05:44.930> I<00:05:44.960> don't<00:05:45.169> know<00:05:45.259> of<00:05:45.349> any

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:45.469 
actually diamonds so I don't know of any

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:46.659 
actually diamonds so I don't know of any
other<00:05:45.529> machine<00:05:45.949> that'll<00:05:46.099> actually<00:05:46.279> allow<00:05:46.610> you

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
other machine that'll actually allow you

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.149 
other machine that'll actually allow you
to<00:05:46.849> make<00:05:47.029> diamonds<00:05:47.389> out<00:05:47.870> of<00:05:48.560> you<00:05:49.069> know

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
to make diamonds out of you know

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.320 
to make diamonds out of you know
basically<00:05:49.460> most<00:05:50.240> any<00:05:50.509> hard<00:05:51.319> or<00:05:51.680> firm
