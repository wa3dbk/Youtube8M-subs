00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.469
 do not 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:18.160
 on the first floor in the first video that 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:21.430
 would be the year 2015 and if it's still my 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.670
 same or not and all that but good this 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.100
 this is an informative video this more 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.310
 that nothing informative because I know that 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.070
 I was absent from this month of December 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.410
 all that but it was not because I said anything 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.320
 loua about videos but because I left 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.980
 vacation or was not where just 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.409
 record my videos and also there was not a 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.479
 computer that is enough 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:50.110
 good enough to edit video anything of 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:53.320
 that's why I decided not to record it and 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.500
 posted on twitter that dayz would upload my 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.330
 first video or this year and it was and 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.000
 Well, nothing if they do not follow me, they should 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.129
 follow me all that is not but what 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.809
 we are waiting for this year are quite 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.080
 good things 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.840
 this Mossos will continue to be mods and 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.939
 the jump 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.399
 and start uploading new tutorials 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.570
 more advanced I would say the one that is well 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.630
 what before did not work correctly 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.909
 well or more or less well because if 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.960
 it works this but it does not work like 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.670
 it works wrong at 0.9 and some some 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.700
 functions still do not work but 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.729
 will start a chair explain the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.890
 tutorials also this was 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.280
 working on a project that is a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.280
 game 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.240
 later that they were recorded a small 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.920
 or a mini mini gaming job so that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.340
 see and it's not yet let's say 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.650
 completely done that fake ship that 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.870
 it's not even the beta yet 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.250
 acknowledged that there are still many 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:01.430
 things to add and nothing and I ask 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.080
