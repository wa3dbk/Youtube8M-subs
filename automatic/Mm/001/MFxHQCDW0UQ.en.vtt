00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
elder scrolls online is another wow

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.020 
elder scrolls online is another wow
clone<00:01:55.080> rather<00:01:55.679> than<00:01:56.009> an<00:01:56.160> online<00:01:56.550> version<00:01:56.789> of

clone rather than an online version of

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.730 
clone rather than an online version of
the<00:01:57.119> Elder<00:01:57.420> Scrolls<00:01:57.450> games<00:01:57.959> but<00:01:58.440> if<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.619> look

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the Elder Scrolls games but if you look

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.770 
the Elder Scrolls games but if you look
closely<00:01:59.069> the<00:01:59.459> camera<00:01:59.729> vastly<00:02:00.149> resembles<00:02:00.660> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
closely the camera vastly resembles the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.839 
closely the camera vastly resembles the
over-the-shoulder<00:02:01.170> view<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.800> Skyrim<00:02:02.429> which

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:02.849 
over-the-shoulder view of Skyrim which

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:04.520 
over-the-shoulder view of Skyrim which
is<00:02:03.000> further<00:02:03.179> indication<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.929> maneuver<00:02:04.289> and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
is further indication that maneuver and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.139 
is further indication that maneuver and
characters<00:02:04.979> should<00:02:05.160> feel<00:02:05.399> more<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.759> Elder

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
characters should feel more like Elder

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.749 
characters should feel more like Elder
Scrolls<00:02:06.450> rather<00:02:07.050> than<00:02:07.380> standard<00:02:07.860> mmorpgs
