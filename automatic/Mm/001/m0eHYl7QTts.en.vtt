this first setup is moderate difficulty

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.580 
this first setup is moderate difficulty
is<00:02:55.390> because<00:02:55.450> we're<00:02:55.870> going<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.049> use<00:02:56.260> some

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
is because we're going to use some

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.289 
is because we're going to use some
attachments<00:02:57.129> that<00:02:57.250> don't<00:02:57.459> necessarily<00:02:58.120> play

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
muzzle break to obtain that recoil and

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.460 
muzzle break to obtain that recoil and
switch<00:03:16.030> out<00:03:16.209> that<00:03:16.390> vertical<00:03:16.900> grip<00:03:17.109> would<00:03:17.260> one

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
difference is that the tactical light

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.180 
difference is that the tactical light
only<00:03:46.569> comes<00:03:46.900> on<00:03:47.079> when<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.379> aim<00:03:47.590> down<00:03:47.829> size
