you<00:00:27.380> know<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:27.710> I<00:00:27.770> figured<00:00:28.600> yeah<00:00:29.600> uh<00:00:30.580> it's<00:00:31.580> a

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
you know so I figured yeah uh it's a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.150 
you know so I figured yeah uh it's a
really<00:00:32.000> fun<00:00:32.059> game<00:00:32.269> it's<00:00:32.809> pretty<00:00:33.230> realistic<00:00:33.890> um

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
really fun game it's pretty realistic um

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.280 
really fun game it's pretty realistic um
the<00:00:35.000> realistic<00:00:35.540> thing<00:00:35.750> is<00:00:35.870> when<00:00:36.020> they<00:00:36.140> put

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
the realistic thing is when they put

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.450 
the realistic thing is when they put
their<00:00:36.410> arms<00:00:36.590> out<00:00:36.739> when<00:00:36.860> they're<00:00:36.920> out<00:00:37.100> but<00:00:37.370> the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
their arms out when they're out but the

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.680 
their arms out when they're out but the
unrealistic<00:00:37.790> thing<00:00:38.149> is<00:00:38.239> that<00:00:38.390> they<00:00:38.480> just

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
unrealistic thing is that they just

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.229 
unrealistic thing is that they just
dissolve<00:00:38.899> in<00:00:39.290> midair<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:39.800> I<00:00:40.670> actually<00:00:40.790> got<00:00:41.210> a

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239
