00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 if all are dancer of Rome and today 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:12.210
 I will give you advice on how to soften 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.740
 the envelopes some exercises he is with you and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.350
 also of the rates 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.699
 then I tip jean louis with the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.050
 first of all I want to say that I am 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:28.170
 coppelia and are called count coppelia 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.000
 study sole and these are the measures a 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.309
 34 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.530
 I'm annoyed not to slip one 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.100
 time to see naturally enlarged for 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.079
 coach and elastic that you need not to do 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.360
 run away the heel of the boot was 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.270
 c to support the ankles that of 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.660
 I usually sail in nylon because you don't 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.140
 that is, those of silk anyway 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:02.969
 that things get better then 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:06.890
 so then take bugs between bursts 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.280
 to a jam in the shoe's face 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:15.470
 ground and crush the mask with the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.470
 hands pressing lightly 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:26.490
 of course you make some objects e 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:33.780
 put it back in then try to see 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:35.250
 a little the shoe sounds ok, take it 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.770
 the save point that the best in 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.770
 silicone this for example latex 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.700
 so small 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:04.790
 ok out stan fans though then 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:10.090
 in line of adult sleep those of the 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:13.160
 seated tip provides the strung elastic 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.760
 see strange things do rewards in the 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.709
 enlarged shoes is fine and in China 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:29.780
 and before you tie in auctions take 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:33.200
 the plates on the left and pay attention when 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.320
 ours to see together with annoyance 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.100
 as you have put it perhaps saves time 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.450
 because then after detained put the 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.900
 foot in flash 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.450
 take spears or lasso and start the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.950
 roll tight tight enough 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.200
 tight without stopping in the hamlets 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.620
 hold it with one hand and then with the other 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.530
 but no 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.950
 take the other tied it up so 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.660
 to stop that other course there 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.420
 they are ways and ways but there was none 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.730
 shoes on the second lap you can 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:16.489
 leave the first frozen capital 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:21.400
 once arrived friar 1 vat and then 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.400
 go and hide under the link 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.769
