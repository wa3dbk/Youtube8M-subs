 tomÃ¡s 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.389
 hello friends today I bring you a news 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:17.029
 about the supposed iphone 6 that does not end 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:20.900
 to invent the guy who works nothing for 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.640
 called bernard ni and he says he just 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.070
 to create this new concept of what 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.060
 it could be the new iPhone 6 with 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.480
 larger screen of 4.5 inches and not 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.160
 would have the home born ok it's about 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.730
 a thinner design than the current one 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.829
 iphone 5 and more beautiful apparently from 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.829
 japan to which this 16 would have a new 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.160
 design and it would be thinner and smaller 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.219
 that the iphone 5 than the iphone iphone 6 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.129
 this new concept if they took it out would be 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:00.019
 the best iphone until now every plan 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:02.170
 designed though absence of a button we 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.610
 indicates that the cupertino company 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.800
 would introduce the iphone the gestures of 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.030
 Multi-touch control is already introduced 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.880
 on the ipad 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.290
 multitouch gestures are the cases 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.390
 you known to make the application 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.570
 best 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.950
 enter multitasking by putting four 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.080
 fingers on the screen and exceeding the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.450
 upwards that afterwards she did not have 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.530
 with work, we used all of your 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.530
 hand to close applications and 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.290
 and the scroll also tells us what 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.830
 The iPhone 6 has a screen 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.410
 4.5 inches and 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.320
 and just borderless with the latest model 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.760
 from htc or they also tell us what 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.820
 colors will this iphone be this 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.450
 iphone model and in the hand 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.040
 confirmandos black and aluminum that 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.970
 as well 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.090
 one thing that I see the image is 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.310
 that I do not think it's going to have year 6 and 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.910
 is not going to have year 7 and I had 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.950
 heard that apollo had said that the 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.229
 year 7 ok 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.200
 I was going to have the widgets as android not 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.750
 it's like with you download I decided the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.650
 tweet called das was x that to put you 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.049
 widgets to your device 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.930
 you will be able to do the same with the year 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.360
 7 although we have the system that is not 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.099
 real if it's not going to be like that with the widgets 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.069
 because it appears here in the new design 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:37.090
 a new concept that has taken acne 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:39.010
 It looks the same as the iPhone 5 does not 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.480
 also what I could notice is that 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.480
 have the largest screen the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.540
 applications are bigger ok and follow 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.439
 being able to see without complications 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.439
 with the page no 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.090
 and well they are the concepts and rumors 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.440
 that he has taken out for now 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.440
 support with a rumor 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.110
 well we hope that if that 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.200
 phone because the truth to me is 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.900
 It is very beautiful but whoever is true 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.360
 they said the iphone 5 a year ago and it's going 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.060
 to be able to project the keyboard and who 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.549
 knows more things but good the last 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.160
 ends up being an iphone 4s more norms 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:26.530
 fast when you open the processor 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:29.720
 core and the roll do not seem this 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.690
 new concept of apple and 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.580
 if they liked to comment and like it and 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.240

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.240
