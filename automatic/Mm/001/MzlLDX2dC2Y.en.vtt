00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.590
 He started competing when he was 10 years old 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.970
 approximately when it was a store to 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.450
 a shopping center and saw a track of 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.970
 ice 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.309
 and I start to compete assiduously 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.280
 in 2008 he is the first skater of 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.710
 philippines 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.630
 at the time of competing continuously 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.320
 we only saw him at the Olympic Games and 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.320
 finished nineteenth 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:36.120
 / nothing at times 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.120
 in the usa in california with jon next 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.870
 does not have quadruples 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.990
 first jump of the triple axel program 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.080
 today so 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.010
 now triple triple combination 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.359
 better but certainly better 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.969
 the last jump of the triple loop program 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.969
 and good good 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.069
 this very used music and this part 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.660
 end always used for 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.660
 sequence of steps online 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.230
 but this ballad also 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.719
 like the fight 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.760
 well designed with a lot of grip to me what 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.180
 what I like about the claw they will remove 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.500
 the point for the fall in the axel apart 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.340
 of the three points that you will lose 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.830
 because it's going to be a -3 in the in the boe 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.709
 but only the claw and the tenacity and the 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:37.379
 strength, I like these people a lot 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.379
 having this is different at least 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.380
 the first jump failed but the rest 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.160
 of elements was perfect the 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.990
 pirouettes with their levels and it's there 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.080
 where is it going 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.050
 to be able to support has been scratched with 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.170
 scratch more worlds if also the part 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.560
 choreographic the end are modest are 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.360
 points over 66 and peak 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.810
 as the 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.970
 tomorrow because tomorrow if we are tomorrow 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.489
 here I do not know well what I say but let's go 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.380
 is with MorÃ³zov because he is the choreographer 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.480
 of this program he is training 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.700
 notice the height that pity the reception 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.590
 has fallen 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.500
 in the tail of the blade balls 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.050
 of blade but the height was 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.680
 extraordinary and very good pirouettes with 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.680
 flexibility 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.280
 there is the combination 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.890
 to the position of the body is very good 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.810
 this turn 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.930
 How long we did not see a boy 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:46.010
 from the south but we do not see it in a 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:49.100
 year yushchenko if we see little in few 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.420
 Sometimes boys show off what 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.890
 did in a continuous way then it 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.940
 injured his hip and stopped doing it there 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.350
 good youtube is unusual in a 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.260
 boy you have to have a flexibility 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.000
 brutal dorsal 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.830
 trained with york knicks the 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.490
 very veteran and with the Olympic champion 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:11.729
 in gando he won yes 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.970
 with that costume that looked like a zebra and 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.919
 it was a suit in the middle of plastic 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:22.710
 but one ugly thing come on I do not 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:25.430
 I liked it and I would love it good 6703 is going 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.430
 to seventh place 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.979
 and there you need one more here to get in 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.979
 back because now the same
