00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:24.990
 hey, how are you ? see another video 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.840
 game that I am for those who do not know this 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.769
 crowd waved another tutorial right to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.600
 you go out 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.360
 and this time the guys I'm here with a 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.910
 is doing this tutorial because it's me 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.129
 I once commented on a video of a guy 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.700
 who was doing gameplay of the game calls 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.920
 Where can you play in that game there? 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.600
 video I commented there asking if 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.370
 that is optional on my pc 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.710
 nobody answered me downloaded game and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.980
 It worked, there's a guy on my 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.690
 Review spoke to ran into his pc 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.019
 But winning is the same as mine. 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.420
 It worked fine there after that 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.729
 The whole conversation he asked me, my 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.890
 pc rotated for 32 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.650
 I told him that I only had one 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.220
 way to make the menu turn one I thought 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.030
 What's mine or his that in the case of our pc? 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.549
 are almost equal and is a code is that the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.670
 people put in the boot definitions 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.119
 of team fortress 2 that makes him stay 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.850
 as more graphic than the minimum 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.720
 people can choose and doing so he 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.280
 run perfectly on our pc is the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:46.010
 This is the code from here. 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.010
 It's if you're seeing right. 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.390
 You guys are seeing the code right. 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.960
 but the code is the one from here and I will teach 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.330
 You, how you stand, do not have it behind you. 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.890
 so serious, really simple people are 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:09.959
 I need to have a little animal behind. 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:15.450
 Of course you go there on the steam is with the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:19.980
 right click on time brings here how 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.769
 here right-click properties and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.040
 So the guys here are setting options 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.410
 arrangements are here and here will not be 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.380
 Nothing 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:37.319
 you copied this code here that I 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:41.220
 I'll leave the application and you'll go there and 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:48.510
 you go there in the boot options was 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:51.560
 that we opened and you go and paste 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.049
 and paste a code 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.069
 There you go to school a code here and 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:02.530
 give an ok 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:06.100
 you're welcome, right? 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.760
 So that's it, everybody, it 's just you 're all alone. 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.910
 you get the code only if you get the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.090
 code and put nanÃ¡ definitions of 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.650
 boot or do it all over again here 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.140
 properties set the person already ranking 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.200
 you copy and paste the code here 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.860
 close what to close and ready 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.660
 When are you going to play when you 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.720
 Are you going to play and will you be in good shape? 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.380
 will be 100 leg will probably go 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:39.519
 be uglier and the resolution goes there 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.890
 It's small but for you who want to enjoy it 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.290
 The game does not want to play well. 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.900
 This is the way to play this. 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.569
 Who posted in this topic 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.370
 right guy there who asked that he not asked 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.739
 But I told him what I was going to do. 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.840
 tutorial in exchange he writes in my 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:01.030
 Channel then liked this video, right? 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.610
 It's especially for you, man, that I 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.730
 I'm making a video for you like 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.590
 This video is crazed and I liked it. 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.920
 I like they do not like it 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.480
 It is important to evaluate why 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.040
 You will see likes going to help me. 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.269
 invest in the channel let the channel better 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.010
 of what is already 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.769
 favorite video that also helps in 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.850
 disclosure register the channel making us 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.340
 transcribed and enjoy the channel fan page 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.510
 is that everything there is the opposite of what I did 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.310
 to do 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.450
 I do not think I liked what I was going to do. 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.700
 if you decide here but this is a mistake 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.190
 of the few neodi I usually do not 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.919
 So this was the video was not 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.919
 I hope you liked it and said
