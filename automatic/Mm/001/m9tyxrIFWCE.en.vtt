00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.399
 hello glory, there are nights 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.040
 and today we go 40 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.620
 to our map 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.799
 we won't pass it by the way 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.039
 because it is not just a profession it 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:14.759
 answer 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.910
 it was not interesting already when we were in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.810
 my car capitals let me 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.970
 her then we also will not 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.649
 in Moscow is better 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:27.409
 data, let's first believe 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:28.810
 tasks 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.810
 Well, the map is a wave 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.930
 the rules are simple 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.780
 on this map 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.640
 they are not 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.690
 can do what they want to do 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.130
 Well, goes to the chita elite wants to go to 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.100
 keeper these 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.430
 In general, play for fun 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.100
 naturally 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.270
 better to play without a back thought and on 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.030
 survival 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.010
 where most likely in general 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310
 but so you can teleport and 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.420
 wants to do 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420
 more rules uses textures 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.960
 that's how you see but here we have this land 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.880
 instead huge 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.320
 ore we are underway, we changed gold 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.770
 glands coal trump to 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.770
 Vsevolozhsk with the state 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.350
 how often does it get there now 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.530
 will show 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.990
 This type of craters on some here 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.140
 mineral 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.530
 there are a lot of them 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.220
 Kyivstar copper 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.360
 sensor cheeses we did for the first time so 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.600
 not to shine 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.189
 Well, what else are we like? 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.360
 changes and most importantly pronko 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.750
 show me a fight 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.170
 the gold you see now is in 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.880
 process 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.820
 this is leather 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.140
 squirrels released 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.790
 by the way skin armor and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.790
 food gives became at the very beginning of things 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.240
 with 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.910
 and the same does not appear 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.910
 In general, iron is done this will help 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.820
 well and so on holidays on all equally 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.960
 only color grow 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.090
 fights 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.090
 police said 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.109
 so what what changed the torment 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:18.659
 much money 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.269
 so the first could give 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.269
 you get it yourself 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.879
 he could only like that 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.809
 together someone else's 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:29.279
 Yu 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:31.089
 now through 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:33.599
 skeptics suit 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.599
 well and then 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.079
 patients this bill 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.449
 even essentially 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.769
 and in the very no pieces 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:45.959
 5 May 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.689
 the Internet is generally like that 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:49.959
 m 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.310
 someone all ask me for years and we have 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.329
 evidence stock 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.319
 so let's move on to the assignments 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.809
 that is, where to start 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.189
 do research all the satellites there 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.449
 we have the only satellite 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.329
 but no if there is a satellite 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.789
 pay off 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:08.289
 for and continue to follow all 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.899
 science station someone he is 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.709
 and his salon there 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.289
 here he is pursuing another planet like me 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.290
 I'll show you now 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.159
 that's when 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.569
 on this satellite brew 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.809
 there you see the box 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.809
 I think we have there 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.309
 to failure 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.859
 she decree 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.899
 grotesque of another planet 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.899
 so strange my hands 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:41.359
 I have my hands 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.599
 plans for payout ratings 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.899
 but we are making really different 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.349
 the planets so how best for you let it 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.309
 will be a surprise 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:53.309
 further and chase the center of the moon we just 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.450
 we knew in full about the authority of these 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.329
 centers 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.129
 Additional tasks 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.319
 find 5 received now we show 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.089
 one of them 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.679
 here is one of these easter start in general 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.009
 there must be a face 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.079
 this program 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.679
 Here is a small village 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:15.979
 this way is not the most beautiful 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:18.279
 you will find better on the rink 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.829
 I remind them here 5 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.049
 then the following additional 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.049
 tasks of this never die 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.680
 descendants explore all the craters 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.370
 Democrats I'll show 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.689
 to find them to accommodate Yerevan 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.889
 on this map there is a land well in the sense 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.460
 one smoking earth 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.779
 and one 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.669
 a tree 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.669
 you need to find its flexibility 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.289
 download this card auction cabinets 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.659
 write-offs 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.249
 how we will be interested to see 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.249
 how will be done shkotovo so shoot 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:56.219
 video 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:57.680
 We will see 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.620
 now shifting more and more into cisco 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.650
 worthlessness of becoming a man
