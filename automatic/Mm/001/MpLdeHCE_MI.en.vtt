this<00:00:00.299> is<00:00:10.550> today's<00:00:11.550> technique<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.240> going<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.599> be

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
this is today's technique is going to be

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.020 
this is today's technique is going to be
teaching<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.230> how<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.410> use<00:00:13.530> bitumen<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.549> glue

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
teaching you how to use bitumen and glue

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.920 
teaching you how to use bitumen and glue
to<00:00:15.330> create<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.929> texture<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.800> light<00:00:17.010> effect<00:00:17.930> so

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
to create a texture and light effect so

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.710 
to create a texture and light effect so
what<00:00:19.080> you'll<00:00:19.260> need<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.010> following

materials<00:00:21.720> we'll<00:00:22.260> need<00:00:22.289> some<00:00:23.300> paint<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.570> in

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
materials we'll need some paint and in

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.609 
materials we'll need some paint and in
this<00:00:25.410> case<00:00:25.590> I'm<00:00:25.710> using<00:00:25.859> acrylic<00:00:27.619> cadmium

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
this case I'm using acrylic cadmium

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.700 
this case I'm using acrylic cadmium
yellow<00:00:28.789> you'll<00:00:29.789> need<00:00:29.939> some<00:00:30.150> contact<00:00:30.660> glue<00:00:30.840> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
yellow you'll need some contact glue you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.370

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
too precious about how I put it on

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
too precious about how I put it on
because<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.009> demo<00:01:17.310> showing<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
because this is just a demo showing you

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.149 
because this is just a demo showing you
what<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:21.650> now<00:01:22.650> you'll<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:22.979> want

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
what you can do so now you'll just want

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.910 
what you can do so now you'll just want
to<00:01:23.220> apply<00:01:23.520> some<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:25.549> acrylic<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.710> once

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
to apply some of the acrylic and once

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.230 
to apply some of the acrylic and once
again<00:01:29.189> I'm<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.430> doing<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.939> any

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.300 

particular<00:01:33.240> way<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:37.650> I'm<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:38.009> spray

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
particular way so now I'm just spray

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.640 
particular way so now I'm just spray
painting<00:01:38.880> over<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.329> top

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.780 

okay<00:01:43.650> now<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.860> I've<00:01:44.040> spray-painted<00:01:44.700> over

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
okay now that I've spray-painted over

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.969 
okay now that I've spray-painted over
the<00:01:45.000> top<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.299> let<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.479> dry<00:01:45.810> I'm<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.830> add

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the top and let it dry I'm going to add

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.940 
the top and let it dry I'm going to add
the<00:01:47.310> contact<00:01:48.000> glue<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.900> add<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.860> in

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the contact glue and you can add it in

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.710 
the contact glue and you can add it in
any<00:01:50.100> design<00:01:50.520> that'll<00:01:50.850> style<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.330> want

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
any design that'll style you want

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.649 
any design that'll style you want
so<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.830> example<00:01:53.250> I'll<00:01:53.400> just<00:01:53.580> do<00:01:53.790> what<00:01:54.630> I

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
so for example I'll just do what I

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.490 
so for example I'll just do what I
normally<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:59.930> to<00:02:00.930> show<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.320> what's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
normally do just to show you what's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.889 
normally do just to show you what's
going<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.300> keep<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.570> repeating

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
going on so you just keep on repeating

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.889 
going on so you just keep on repeating
whatever<00:02:07.229> pattern<00:02:08.069> or<00:02:08.489> design<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.000> want<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
whatever pattern or design you want and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.830 
whatever pattern or design you want and
then<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.200> let<00:02:10.350> that<00:02:10.500> dry<00:02:11.390> so<00:02:12.390> as<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.600> can<00:02:12.720> see

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
then you let that dry so as you can see

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.180 
then you let that dry so as you can see
I<00:02:12.870> put<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.170> whole<00:02:13.319> pattern<00:02:13.560> on<00:02:13.769> now<00:02:13.920> I'm<00:02:14.040> using

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
I put the whole pattern on now I'm using

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.560 
I put the whole pattern on now I'm using
the<00:02:14.400> heat<00:02:14.580> gun<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:17.370> dry<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.959> glue<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:21.420> when

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
the heat gun to dry the glue so when

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.940 
the heat gun to dry the glue so when
you've<00:02:21.690> got<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.110> stage<00:02:22.380> where<00:02:22.830> it's

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
you've got it to that stage where it's

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.410 
you've got it to that stage where it's
dry<00:02:23.280> its<00:02:23.580> touch<00:02:23.850> dry<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:25.050> want<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.320> get<00:02:25.440> your

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
dry its touch dry you want to get your

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.640 
dry its touch dry you want to get your
bitumen<00:02:27.420> mixture<00:02:27.900> I've<00:02:28.110> just<00:02:28.320> thinned<00:02:28.560> it

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
bitumen mixture I've just thinned it

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.310 
bitumen mixture I've just thinned it
down<00:02:28.860> with<00:02:29.070> some<00:02:29.310> white<00:02:30.060> spirits<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.780> you'll

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
down with some white spirits and you'll

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.570 
down with some white spirits and you'll
just<00:02:31.470> basically<00:02:31.890> want<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.220> cover<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.550> whole

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
want sometimes you can even splash a

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.250 
want sometimes you can even splash a
little<00:03:13.980> bit<00:03:14.099> on<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.400> actual<00:03:14.910> work<00:03:18.260> depending

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
little bit on the actual work depending

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.960 
little bit on the actual work depending
on<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.950> effect<00:03:20.160> that<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.700> want

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.160 

so<00:03:23.970> basically<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.959> just<00:03:25.170> rub<00:03:25.349> away<00:03:27.170> and

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
so basically it you just rub away and

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.110 
so basically it you just rub away and
you<00:03:28.290> can<00:03:28.470> leave<00:03:28.680> some<00:03:28.739> areas<00:03:31.910> so<00:03:32.910> I'm<00:03:32.970> gonna

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
you can leave some areas so I'm gonna

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.300 
you can leave some areas so I'm gonna
add<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:34.140> quickly<00:03:34.410> add<00:03:34.709> another<00:03:34.950> layer<00:03:35.280> on

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
add just quickly add another layer on

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.699 
add just quickly add another layer on
top<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.660> technique<00:03:37.019> I<00:03:37.200> showed<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.590> the

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
top so that technique I showed you the

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.319 
top so that technique I showed you the
other<00:03:37.739> day<00:03:38.010> where<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.280> add<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.400> rocks<00:03:38.760> to

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
other day where you add the rocks to

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.059 
other day where you add the rocks to
make<00:03:40.170> these<00:03:40.410> little<00:03:41.900> circles<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.590> I'm<00:03:43.829> just

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
make these little circles so I'm just

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.819 
make these little circles so I'm just
gonna<00:03:44.160> get<00:03:44.400> some<00:03:44.810> white<00:03:48.290> spray<00:03:49.290> paint<00:03:49.319> and

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
gonna get some white spray paint and

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:56.059 
gonna get some white spray paint and
then<00:03:50.340> some<00:03:50.850> red<00:03:51.410> right<00:03:54.739> don't<00:03:55.739> worry<00:03:55.950> about

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
then some red right don't worry about

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.300 
then some red right don't worry about
losing<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:58.200> effects<00:03:58.530> underneath<00:03:58.980> because

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
losing the effects underneath because

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.569 
losing the effects underneath because
this<00:04:00.060> bitumen<00:04:00.480> as<00:04:00.840> soon<00:04:01.019> as<00:04:01.139> you<00:04:01.260> add<00:04:01.410> tips<00:04:02.370> to

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
this bitumen as soon as you add tips to

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.190 
this bitumen as soon as you add tips to
it<00:04:02.730> it'll<00:04:02.970> actually<00:04:03.060> it'll<00:04:03.989> peel<00:04:04.319> back<00:04:06.079> so<00:04:07.079> now

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
it it'll actually it'll peel back so now

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.069 
it it'll actually it'll peel back so now
I've<00:04:07.349> got<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.650> effect<00:04:07.980> as<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.280> can<00:04:08.430> see<00:04:09.079> like

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079
