00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.020
 we are here again from the motor show of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.000
 bologna with our technician 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.300
 Julian lettuce regulations that there today 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.660
 he will talk about such internal fittings 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.760
 thanks nicole and I too greet our people 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.530
 friends listeners from home today a 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.710
 very interesting topic we talk about 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.289
 how to change the extension of the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.379
 own car without incurring the 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.909
 so-called road hazards 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.249
 let's say the interior finishes 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:43.800
 generally they are something of a lot 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.690
 simpler than what it is 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.850
 part of the external layout of the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.620
 bodywork for obvious reasons why the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.629
 bodywork can be seen first then 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.760
 even the police are the first 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.960
 to see them while instead from the point of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.879
 view of who i am 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.889
 the outfitting terms should there 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.809
 to be by those who do the checks a 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:02.280
 vehicle stop and a check 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.199
 within the same 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.450
 this allows us to be able to say that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.060
 therefore also for those who obviously decide 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.460
 to change and embellish let's call it 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.450
 so its own interior then 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.060
 customize it in a certain way 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.400
 can do it without any problem as long as 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
 always respect those two three rules 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.800
 simple we had we always have 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.690
 say 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.440
 always look for type products 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.330
 approved or at least type 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.850
 certified what it means to say nicole 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.830
 certified product type means 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.160
 that one has turned to an institution of 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.270
 recognized certification or in Italy 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.010
 abroad has no importance is 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.160
 important that it be recognized in the 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.320
 European community and based on this institution 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.840
 certification is then released 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.330
 a document that can allow the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.730
 our tuning friend of tuning to be able to 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.290
 move quietly with the 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.000
 customization within 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.350
 vehicles, however, we always repeat 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.400
 vehicles certified or approved in the case 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.230
 you have any doubts 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.230

 mathematical certainty of being able to give you 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.890

 with this I believe not the goals we have 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.700
 at least he gave some useful indications 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.590
 for our friends for interiors of 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.650
 own cars quietly 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.500
 contact specialized fitters 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.420

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.700
 got our certifications 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.500
 another important thing to conclude the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.150
 safety belts the belts of 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.890
 securities must be approved 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.140
 according to European legislation 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.180
 so always hunt on and inside the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.970
