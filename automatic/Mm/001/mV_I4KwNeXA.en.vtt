discourage sparkling wine at a winery to
understand<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:14.549> do<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.540> think<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.260> best

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
understand what we do I think the best

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.910 
understand what we do I think the best
way<00:00:16.770> first<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:18.480> do<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> quick<00:00:19.680> demonstration

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
way first is to do a quick demonstration

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.170 
way first is to do a quick demonstration
of<00:00:20.580> an<00:00:21.060> hour<00:00:21.270> volley<00:00:22.369> disgorging<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:24.029> we

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
of an hour volley disgorging so what we

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.130 
of an hour volley disgorging so what we
have<00:00:24.390> here<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:26.180> bottle<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.330> sparkling<00:00:27.840> wine

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
have here is a bottle of sparkling wine

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.880 
have here is a bottle of sparkling wine
which<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.619> fermented<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.760> bottle<00:00:30.029> and

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
which was fermented in the bottle and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.270 
which was fermented in the bottle and
where<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:33.320> agitated<00:00:34.320> or<00:00:34.680> riddled<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
where we have agitated or riddled the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.160 
where we have agitated or riddled the
yeast<00:00:35.489> leads<00:00:35.790> down<00:00:36.090> into<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> neck<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
yeast leads down into the neck of the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.670 
yeast leads down into the neck of the
bottle<00:00:38.090> what<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.239> want<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.660> now<00:00:39.930> has<00:00:40.410> been

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
bottle what we want to do now has been

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.130 
bottle what we want to do now has been
one<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.010> separate<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.760> yeast<00:00:42.000> from<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.960> rest

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
one to separate the yeast from the rest

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.229 
one to separate the yeast from the rest
of<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> wine<00:00:43.530> without<00:00:43.980> hopefully<00:00:44.640> losing<00:00:44.820> too

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
of the wine without hopefully losing too

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.540 
of the wine without hopefully losing too
much<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.710> process<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.250> called

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
much of it and this process is called

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.319 
much of it and this process is called
disgorgement

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
disgorgement

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.270 
disgorgement
and<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.780> particular<00:00:49.110> way<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.559> doing<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.070> is

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and this particular way of doing it is

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.260 
and this particular way of doing it is
called<00:00:50.520> ala<00:00:50.820> volley<00:00:51.980> what<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.129> do

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.130

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
as we grab our hand cat puller and we

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.090 
as we grab our hand cat puller and we
hold<00:01:00.380> the<00:01:00.530> bottle<00:01:00.800> on<00:01:00.890> our<00:01:01.040> head

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
hold the bottle on our head

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.540 
hold the bottle on our head
notice<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.220> thumb<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:04.760> is<00:01:05.180> there<00:01:05.570> ready<00:01:05.900> to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
notice the thumb is is there ready to

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.660 
notice the thumb is is there ready to
stop<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.580> wine<00:01:07.880> from<00:01:08.090> gushing<00:01:08.510> out<00:01:09.370> place<00:01:10.370> the

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
cat puller next to the cat and we go to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.370 
cat puller next to the cat and we go to
raise<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.370> bottle<00:01:13.670> up<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.630> point<00:01:14.930> where<00:01:15.229> the

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
raise the bottle up to a point where the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.520 
raise the bottle up to a point where the
bubble<00:01:15.770> which<00:01:16.070> is<00:01:16.280> now<00:01:16.460> sitting<00:01:16.850> here<00:01:17.530> finds

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
bubble which is now sitting here finds

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.980 
bubble which is now sitting here finds
its<00:01:18.680> way<00:01:18.880> hitting<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.030> neck<00:01:20.210> at<00:01:20.479> that<00:01:20.660> very

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
its way hitting the neck at that very

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.890 
its way hitting the neck at that very
point<00:01:21.590> we<00:01:22.369> want<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.820> remove<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.450> cat<00:01:23.660> and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
point we want to remove the cat and

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.710 
point we want to remove the cat and
shoot<00:01:24.290> out<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.619> yeast<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.729> yeast<00:01:26.270> leaves

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
shoot out the yeast the yeast leaves

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.280 
shoot out the yeast the yeast leaves
before<00:01:27.220> they<00:01:28.220> mix<00:01:28.520> back<00:01:28.790> into<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.300> white<00:01:29.479> here

is to disgorge a bottle of wine what

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.530 
is to disgorge a bottle of wine what
we'll<00:02:25.740> do<00:02:26.240> place<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.420> ball<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:32.180> can<00:02:33.180> shoot

we'll do place the ball in I can shoot

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.190 
we'll do place the ball in I can shoot
the<00:02:33.690> yeast<00:02:34.260> out<00:02:35.480> again<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:36.600> have<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.780> nice<00:02:36.900> clear

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.320 

this<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.910> dosage<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.910> little<00:02:46.210> bit

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
this is dosage so this is a little bit

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.660 
this is dosage so this is a little bit
of<00:02:46.450> sugar<00:02:48.420> balance<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.570> why

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:17.479 

this<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.420> topic

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.250

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
and then we cap the bottle mix it up a

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.839 
and then we cap the bottle mix it up a
couple<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.590> times<00:03:23.829> to<00:03:24.069> mix<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.370> sugar<00:03:24.400> through

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
and they have it a finished product a

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.140 
and they have it a finished product a
couple<00:03:29.200> of<00:03:29.260> interesting<00:03:29.560> things<00:03:30.030> when<00:03:31.030> we

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
couple of interesting things when we

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.780 
couple of interesting things when we
finish<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.599> bottle<00:03:31.840> off<00:03:31.959> we<00:03:32.140> use<00:03:32.349> a<00:03:32.790> crown

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790
