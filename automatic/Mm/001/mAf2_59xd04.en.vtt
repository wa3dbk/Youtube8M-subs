 the accumulated fat in this area 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.380
 this is a mistake 'since only with a supplementary aerobic activity is 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.290
 will manage to burn the fat that forms the belly that is located between the muscles and 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.240
 the skin with 25 minutes three times a week is sufficient although you can 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.550
 get up to 40 minutes 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.530
 distributed among 5 7 exercises is more than enough 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.250
 It is advisable to perform the abdominals every day 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.250
