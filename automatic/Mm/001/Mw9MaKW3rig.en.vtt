00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
how to set it up so they will mind all

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.540 
how to set it up so they will mind all
the<00:00:29.970> stuff<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.359> would<00:00:30.510> ever<00:00:30.689> want<00:00:31.219> and<00:00:32.219> it's

the same setup as last time coal in the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.470 
the same setup as last time coal in the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
want to use for the bridges over ravines

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.610 
want to use for the bridges over ravines
lava<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.559> water<00:00:43.739> em<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:45.989> told<00:00:46.230> us<00:00:46.440> in

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
lava and water em and then told us in

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.250 
lava and water em and then told us in
the<00:00:46.649> last<00:00:47.280> slot<00:00:47.760> now<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.050> you

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the last slot now what you do is you

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.220 
the last slot now what you do is you
type<00:00:49.469> branch<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.520> type<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:51.030> number

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
type branch and then you type a number

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.260 
type branch and then you type a number
again<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.440> places<00:00:52.770> it'll<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.640> every<00:00:54.090> eight

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
again it places it'll just every eight

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.510 
again it places it'll just every eight
blocks<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.170> important<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.890> are

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
blocks so it's important that you are

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.490 
blocks so it's important that you are
not<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.210> important<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:57.840> it's<00:00:58.020> advised

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
not it's not important but it's advised

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.910 
not it's not important but it's advised
that<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> maximum<00:01:01.140> amount<00:01:01.350> of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
that you for the maximum amount of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.840 
that you for the maximum amount of
protection<00:01:02.609> against<00:01:03.329> map<00:01:03.480> spawning<00:01:04.820> take<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
protection against map spawning take a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.789 
protection against map spawning take a
number<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.689> dividable<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.409> eight<00:01:07.590> in

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
number that is dividable with eight in

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.670 
number that is dividable with eight in
that<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.510> way<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.049> will<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.470> make

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
that because in that way it will it make

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.950 
that because in that way it will it make
sure<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.670> entire<00:01:12.030> tunnel<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.570> lit<00:01:12.869> up

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
sure that the entire tunnel is lit up

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.410 
sure that the entire tunnel is lit up
perfectly<00:01:13.470> alright<00:01:14.340> let's<00:01:14.850> start<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.210> one

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
perfectly alright let's start this one

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.580 
perfectly alright let's start this one
and<00:01:15.600> let's<00:01:15.780> start<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> others<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.530> I'll

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and let's start the others and I'll

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.820 
and let's start the others and I'll
time-lapse<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> process<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.830> what's

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
time-lapse the process for you what's

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.100 
time-lapse the process for you what's
the<00:01:19.920> first<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:21.020> second<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.860> third<00:01:23.000> one

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
the first one second one and third one

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:38.130 
the first one second one and third one
okay<00:01:25.110> Q<00:01:25.409> time<00:01:25.740> lapse

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.720 

you

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.570 

and<00:01:44.560> as<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:45.680> can<00:01:45.830> see<00:01:45.860> as<00:01:46.160> an<00:01:46.280> added<00:01:46.550> feature

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
and as you can see as an added feature

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.900 
and as you can see as an added feature
I've<00:01:47.180> sent<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.320> turtle's<00:01:48.740> back<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.610> of

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
I've sent the turtle's back to the of

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.420 
I've sent the turtle's back to the of
region<00:01:50.500> which<00:01:51.500> basically<00:01:51.830> means<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.220> it's

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
region which basically means that it's

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.340 
region which basically means that it's
going<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.640> return<00:01:52.790> out<00:01:53.150> of<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.450> tunnel<00:01:53.750> this

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
going to return out of the tunnel this

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.910 
going to return out of the tunnel this
feature<00:01:54.860> is<00:01:55.010> a<00:01:55.250> slight<00:01:55.970> bit<00:01:56.330> bucked<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.020> and

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
feature is a slight bit bucked and and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.190 
feature is a slight bit bucked and and
you<00:01:58.190> might<00:01:58.370> experience<00:01:58.730> that<00:01:59.240> for<00:01:59.960> whatever

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
you might experience that for whatever

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.110 
you might experience that for whatever
reason<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.920> turtle<00:02:01.280> might<00:02:01.430> get<00:02:01.640> stuck<00:02:01.910> in<00:02:02.090> the

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
reason the turtle might get stuck in the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.840 
reason the turtle might get stuck in the
tunnel<00:02:02.330> as<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.750> seems<00:02:02.960> like<00:02:03.370> this<00:02:04.370> one<00:02:04.640> down

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
tunnel as it seems like this one down

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.400 
tunnel as it seems like this one down
here<00:02:05.180> is<00:02:05.240> done<00:02:05.950> or<00:02:06.950> is<00:02:07.190> it<00:02:07.340> not<00:02:07.460> done<00:02:07.640> yet

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.010 

yeah<00:02:11.100> as<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.910> see<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.570> are<00:02:12.720> some<00:02:12.900> issues

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
yeah as you see there are some issues

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.220 
yeah as you see there are some issues
with<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.530> em<00:02:13.710> I<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:15.240> no<00:02:15.420> idea<00:02:15.660> why<00:02:15.780> does<00:02:16.020> this

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
with it em I have no idea why does this

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.560 
with it em I have no idea why does this
but<00:02:16.620> it's<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:18.090> better<00:02:18.360> than<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
but it's it's better than the

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.240 
but it's it's better than the
alternative<00:02:18.690> where<00:02:19.410> it's<00:02:19.530> at<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.860> end<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.130> the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
alternative where it's at the end of the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.160 
alternative where it's at the end of the
tunnel<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.700> most<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.420> time<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.780> does<00:02:21.960> work

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
tunnel and most of the time it does work

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.830 
tunnel and most of the time it does work
perfectly<00:02:22.650> at<00:02:23.010> any<00:02:23.220> rate<00:02:23.330> that<00:02:24.330> was<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.480> program

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
perfectly at any rate that was a program
