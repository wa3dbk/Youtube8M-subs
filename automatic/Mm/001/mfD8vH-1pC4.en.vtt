00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
the game masters and game design and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.400 
the game masters and game design and
development<00:02:46.290> at<00:02:46.739> national<00:02:47.340> film<00:02:47.549> school<00:02:47.880> it's

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
development at national film school it's

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.870 
development at national film school it's
it<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.560> true<00:02:49.739> year's<00:02:49.920> course<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:50.489> basically

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
it is true year's course it's basically

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.420 
it is true year's course it's basically
I<00:02:51.510> would<00:02:52.019> say<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.769> really<00:02:53.100> challenging

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
I would say it's a really challenging

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.680 
I would say it's a really challenging
course<00:02:53.970> because<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:55.110> is

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
course because it is

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.760 
course because it is
what<00:02:56.440> work<00:02:57.540> production<00:02:58.540> costs<00:02:59.080> so<00:02:59.320> that's

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
what work production costs so that's

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.800 
what work production costs so that's
what<00:02:59.920> I<00:02:59.950> like<00:03:00.190> about<00:03:00.220> small<00:03:00.910> likely<00:03:01.270> producing

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
what I like about small likely producing

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.230 
what I like about small likely producing
and<00:03:02.440> we<00:03:02.620> actually<00:03:03.040> making<00:03:03.250> games<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.910> we<00:03:04.030> work

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
and we actually making games and we work

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.450

I<00:04:12.980> would<00:04:13.580> say<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:14.240> is<00:04:14.720> challenging<00:04:15.470> because

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
I would say it is challenging because

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.010 
I would say it is challenging because
it's<00:04:16.070> so<00:04:16.250> new<00:04:16.790> and<00:04:16.820> then<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.780> make

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
it's so new and then you and make

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.660 
it's so new and then you and make
something<00:04:18.260> that<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.709> is<00:04:18.830> made<00:04:19.130> for<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.489> via

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
something that it is made for the via

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.390 
something that it is made for the via
and<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.480> wanna<00:04:20.800> the<00:04:21.800> challenge<00:04:22.220> is<00:04:22.370> that

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
and I wanna the challenge is that

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.510 
and I wanna the challenge is that
because<00:04:22.910> it's<00:04:23.720> not<00:04:23.840> hard<00:04:24.350> it's<00:04:24.710> actually<00:04:25.130> it's

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
because it's not hard it's actually it's

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.070 
because it's not hard it's actually it's
easier<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.210> work<00:04:26.360> for<00:04:26.600> the<00:04:26.690> virtual<00:04:26.990> reality

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
easier to work for the virtual reality

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.190 
easier to work for the virtual reality
because<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.740> small<00:04:27.920> nature<00:04:28.100> is<00:04:28.400> more<00:04:28.580> like

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
because the small nature is more like

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.250 
because the small nature is more like
how<00:04:30.200> we<00:04:30.260> live<00:04:30.560> it's<00:04:31.040> not<00:04:31.220> like<00:04:31.510> in<00:04:32.510> screaming

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
how we live it's not like in screaming

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.860 
how we live it's not like in screaming
your<00:04:33.500> faces<00:04:33.890> you<00:04:34.010> inside<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.520> world<00:04:34.730> but<00:04:35.690> the

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
your faces you inside the world but the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.930 
your faces you inside the world but the
challenge<00:04:36.290> just<00:04:36.380> because<00:04:36.680> it's<00:04:36.830> new<00:04:36.980> but<00:04:37.640> I

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
challenge just because it's new but I

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.680 
challenge just because it's new but I
don't<00:04:38.270> see<00:04:38.450> us<00:04:38.480> actually<00:04:38.810> as<00:04:39.740> a<00:04:40.580> problem<00:04:41.390> I<00:04:41.510> see

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
don't see us actually as a problem I see

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.350 
don't see us actually as a problem I see
is<00:04:41.930> something<00:04:42.770> that<00:04:42.890> motivates<00:04:43.310> me<00:04:43.550> more<00:04:43.700> to

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
is something that motivates me more to

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.090 
is something that motivates me more to
work<00:04:44.510> with<00:04:44.810> it<00:04:44.930> because<00:04:45.170> it's<00:04:45.800> just<00:04:45.920> so

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
exciting but I don't see as a problem I

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.850 
exciting but I don't see as a problem I
see<00:04:48.770> as<00:04:48.920> a<00:04:49.340> challenge<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:50.260> it<00:04:51.260> is<00:04:51.320> push<00:04:51.650> me
