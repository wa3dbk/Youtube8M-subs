00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.910
 organic coconut water too 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.739
 natural without any harm or 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.359
 you can just take some ordinary water 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.420
 used to cook without some kind of dense 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.519
 some water so simple bananas and kiwi took 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.100
 everything hindered and turned out so thick 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.810
 smoothie but now I cook more like that 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.780
 cocktails let's start like this to us 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.670
 will need again the most important is 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.830
 wonder I bought one that is all myself 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.170
 doing before I had a manual and need 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.960
 it was just really figachit this period 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.240
 it is convenient for me if you have the opportunity 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.579
 buy all the blender more than once come in handy and 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.390
 very useful thing for useful things 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.390
 So 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.990
 rage can be defrosted in advance 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.810
 a little bit so that our cocktail is not 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.670
 turned out so 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.860
 for what i love slovenia for being here 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.600
 frozen berries they are really straight 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.250
 frozen so delicious they can smell them 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.140
 defrost beforehand so that they do not have 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.869
 were such reptiles to me and our boat is not 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.299
 turned out so cold but the boulevard I 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.360
 I think it's time to chew it is not necessary today I will 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:14.459
 use almond milk 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.890
 By the way, I still did the drawing 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:21.810
 coconut milk jump is delicious but 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.769
 sat with the usual varnish if you drink it 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.769
 I have no milk 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:33.819
 everything is the most interesting and then you do nâ€™t 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.440
 need such a hotel they are super helpful they 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.020
 just vitaminizes they charge 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.849
 energy and now look we spent 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.640
 a minute to clear everything from chop 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.640
