00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
all-american was Terrence Jones now he

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.710 
all-american was Terrence Jones now he

Antoine<00:02:32.850> Walker<00:02:33.120> was<00:02:33.450> his<00:02:33.630> freshman<00:02:34.020> year<00:02:34.050> and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
Antoine Walker was his freshman year and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.230 
Antoine Walker was his freshman year and
I<00:02:34.770> think<00:02:35.040> will<00:02:35.190> happen<00:02:35.310> Antoine<00:02:35.880> he<00:02:36.090> got

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
I think will happen Antoine he got

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.450 
I think will happen Antoine he got
around<00:02:36.510> us<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.930> got<00:02:37.080> better<00:02:37.350> because<00:02:37.860> we<00:02:38.250> made

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
around us and got better because we made

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.340 
around us and got better because we made
him<00:02:38.640> relaxed<00:02:39.240> more<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.570> think<00:02:39.600> tires<00:02:40.050> needs

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
him relaxed more and I think tires needs

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.530 
him relaxed more and I think tires needs
to<00:02:40.470> relax<00:02:40.740> more<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.340> let<00:02:41.760> everything<00:02:42.000> come<00:02:42.360> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
to relax more and let everything come to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.780 
to relax more and let everything come to

him he's doing so much at one time the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.430 
him he's doing so much at one time the
heat<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.090> he<00:02:45.300> doesn't<00:02:45.600> have<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.810> do<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.110> you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
heat and he doesn't have to do that you

know once Antoine stop shooting crazy
shots<00:02:48.780> he<00:02:49.410> realized<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.040> could<00:02:50.190> get<00:02:50.280> him

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
shots he realized that we could get him

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
level I definitely do I see the way he

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.190 
level I definitely do I see the way he
pulls<00:03:07.770> people<00:03:07.980> up<00:03:08.250> he's<00:03:09.120> just<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.630> bull<00:03:09.900> when

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
pulls people up he's just the bull when

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.720 
pulls people up he's just the bull when
every<00:03:10.350> time<00:03:10.530> he<00:03:10.620> gets<00:03:10.800> about<00:03:10.920> he<00:03:11.280> notices

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
every time he gets about he notices

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.910 
every time he gets about he notices
people<00:03:12.300> smaller<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.720> him<00:03:12.870> he<00:03:13.380> puts<00:03:13.650> him<00:03:13.770> on<00:03:13.860> a

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
people smaller to him he puts him on a

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.190 
people smaller to him he puts him on a
box<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:15.060> destroys<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.810> i<00:03:15.840> love<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.170> way

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
box and just destroys and i love the way

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.290 
box and just destroys and i love the way
does<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:17.040> i<00:03:17.280> definitely<00:03:17.730> think<00:03:18.000> he<00:03:18.150> has<00:03:18.269> a

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
does that so i definitely think he has a

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.330 
does that so i definitely think he has a
place<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.720> has<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.050> on<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.170> good<00:03:19.890> team<00:03:20.100> though

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
place it has to be on a good team though

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.860 
place it has to be on a good team though
so<00:03:20.519> he<00:03:20.610> doesn't<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.970> do<00:03:21.180> too<00:03:21.420> much<00:03:21.600> too

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
so he doesn't have to do too much too

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.110 
so he doesn't have to do too much too
early<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.650> he<00:03:22.680> learns<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.160> next<00:03:23.400> level<00:03:23.700> you

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
early so he learns the next level you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.060 
early so he learns the next level you
