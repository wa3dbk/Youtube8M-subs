00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
these mobile fortress is basically

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.949 
these mobile fortress is basically
having<00:03:21.049> incredibly<00:03:21.769> slow<00:03:22.220> reloj<00:03:22.720> reload<00:03:23.720> time

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
which it's one boy over like two seconds

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
shots and they have like the health of

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.129 
shots and they have like the health of
the<00:03:34.459> pre<00:03:34.609> mother<00:03:34.790> ships<00:03:35.090> but<00:03:35.629> they<00:03:35.720> also<00:03:35.840> take

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
the pre mother ships but they also take

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
research center which was actually

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.650 
research center which was actually
already<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.680> building<00:04:53.130> in<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.310> files<00:04:53.630> but<00:04:54.630> I

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
already a building in the files but I

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.440 
already a building in the files but I
never<00:04:55.170> really<00:04:55.620> had<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.830> purpose<00:04:56.340> I<00:04:56.580> guess<00:04:57.300> how

helper<00:04:57.900> hat<00:04:58.650> help<00:04:58.860> are<00:04:59.070> intended<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.490> make<00:04:59.670> an

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
helper hat help are intended to make an

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.240 
helper hat help are intended to make an
upgrade<00:05:00.000> building<00:05:00.540> but<00:05:01.200> I<00:05:01.230> turned<00:05:01.590> it<00:05:01.770> into<00:05:01.950> an

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
upgrade building but I turned it into an

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.810 
upgrade building but I turned it into an
advanced<00:05:02.760> unit<00:05:03.060> building<00:05:03.390> instead<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:05.460> then

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
advanced unit building instead and then

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.610 
advanced unit building instead and then
we're<00:05:05.970> also<00:05:06.090> going<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.360> need<00:05:06.510> an<00:05:06.690> airport<00:05:07.230> to

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
we're also going to need an airport to

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.250 
we're also going to need an airport to
show<00:05:07.860> off<00:05:08.040> some<00:05:08.250> of<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.340> quality<00:05:08.700> of<00:05:08.760> stuff<00:05:09.260> so

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
show off some of the quality of stuff so

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.590 
show off some of the quality of stuff so
might<00:05:10.620> as<00:05:10.770> well<00:05:10.800> build<00:05:11.280> a<00:05:11.640> couple<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.270> research

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
might as well build a couple of research

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.670 
might as well build a couple of research
centers<00:05:12.810> I<00:05:13.110> don't<00:05:13.290> like<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.470> direction

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.370 
they're facing the units would have to
come<00:05:15.330> out<00:05:15.450> of<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.600> courtyard<00:05:15.870> so<00:05:16.230> I'm<00:05:16.290> just

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
and then we'll let our mobile fortresses

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.750 
and then we'll let our mobile fortresses
hang<00:05:40.080> out<00:05:40.260> over<00:05:40.410> here<00:05:40.530> as<00:05:40.890> just<00:05:41.280> a<00:05:41.460> blockade

the<00:05:44.760> thing<00:05:44.880> about<00:05:45.030> mobile<00:05:45.210> fortresses<00:05:45.840> is

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
the thing about mobile fortresses is

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.170 
the thing about mobile fortresses is
that<00:05:46.110> a<00:05:46.140> can<00:05:46.410> the<00:05:47.160> mobile<00:05:47.700> fortresses

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
that a can the mobile fortresses

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.210 
that a can the mobile fortresses
weakness<00:05:48.570> is<00:05:48.750> really<00:05:49.020> being<00:05:49.200> overwhelmed<00:05:50.040> by

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
weakness is really being overwhelmed by

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.890 
weakness is really being overwhelmed by
lots<00:05:50.430> of<00:05:50.580> troops<00:05:50.880> it<00:05:51.419> feels<00:05:51.600> like<00:05:51.720> I've<00:05:51.810> said

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
lots of troops it feels like I've said

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.409 
lots of troops it feels like I've said
it<00:05:52.020> has<00:05:52.110> a<00:05:52.140> ridiculously<00:05:52.830> slow<00:05:53.010> fire<00:05:53.370> rate<00:05:53.419> for

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
it has a ridiculously slow fire rate for

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.060 
it has a ridiculously slow fire rate for
those<00:05:54.510> of<00:05:54.630> you<00:05:54.720> who<00:05:54.840> do<00:05:55.350> beach<00:05:55.620> it's<00:05:55.890> it's

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
those of you who do beach it's it's

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.220 
those of you who do beach it's it's
basically<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.610> boom<00:05:56.760> Canyon<00:05:57.240> except<00:05:57.810> the

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
mobile yes so now that we have all these

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.500 
mobile yes so now that we have all these
plants<00:06:02.730> I'm<00:06:02.910> gonna<00:06:03.120> show<00:06:03.270> off<00:06:03.360> the<00:06:03.480> new

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
plants I'm gonna show off the new

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.300 
plants I'm gonna show off the new
buildings<00:06:03.930> so<00:06:04.110> first<00:06:04.440> off<00:06:04.620> we've<00:06:04.770> got<00:06:04.800> all<00:06:05.070> the

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
buildings so first off we've got all the

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.250 
buildings so first off we've got all the
blue<00:06:05.520> name<00:06:05.790> units<00:06:06.210> are<00:06:06.480> units<00:06:06.840> that<00:06:06.960> are<00:06:07.080> made

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
blue name units are units that are made

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.990 
blue name units are units that are made
in<00:06:07.470> the<00:06:07.560> research<00:06:07.830> center<00:06:08.130> so<00:06:08.610> if<00:06:08.730> you<00:06:08.820> look

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
in the research center so if you look

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.240 
in the research center so if you look
the<00:06:09.300> research<00:06:09.660> center<00:06:09.960> has<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.380> RPG<00:06:10.830> soldier

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
the research center has the RPG soldier

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.730 
the research center has the RPG soldier
gunship<00:06:11.700> mortar<00:06:12.120> and<00:06:12.240> cargo<00:06:12.630> plane<00:06:12.870> so<00:06:13.680> I'm

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
gunship mortar and cargo plane so I'm

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.440 
gunship mortar and cargo plane so I'm
going<00:06:13.919> to<00:06:13.950> make<00:06:14.070> the<00:06:14.220> RPG<00:06:14.850> soldier<00:06:15.270> their

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
going to make the RPG soldier their

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.740 
going to make the RPG soldier their
gunship<00:06:16.260> their<00:06:17.060> mortar<00:06:18.060> there<00:06:18.300> and<00:06:18.540> over

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
gunship their mortar there and over

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.380 
gunship their mortar there and over
there<00:06:18.780> I'm<00:06:18.960> gonna<00:06:19.080> have<00:06:19.169> a<00:06:19.290> cargo<00:06:19.770> plane<00:06:19.919> made

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
there I'm gonna have a cargo plane made

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.580 
there I'm gonna have a cargo plane made
so<00:06:21.390> I<00:06:21.450> can<00:06:21.660> show<00:06:21.870> off<00:06:21.990> all<00:06:22.230> the<00:06:22.440> different

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
so I can show off all the different

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.350 
so I can show off all the different
types<00:06:23.010> you've<00:06:23.370> new<00:06:23.669> units

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
types you've new units

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.960 
types you've new units
and<00:06:24.870> then<00:06:24.960> over<00:06:25.139> here<00:06:25.169> finally<00:06:26.159> last<00:06:26.460> but<00:06:26.789> not

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
and then over here finally last but not

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.159 
and then over here finally last but not
least<00:06:27.240> in<00:06:27.419> the<00:06:27.509> new<00:06:27.629> units<00:06:27.990> is<00:06:28.229> the<00:06:28.590> ac-130<00:06:30.169> and

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
least in the new units is the ac-130 and

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.570 
least in the new units is the ac-130 and
so<00:06:31.379> now<00:06:31.530> we<00:06:31.590> are<00:06:31.710> officially<00:06:31.889> out<00:06:32.220> of<00:06:32.340> money

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
so now we are officially out of money

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.459 
so now we are officially out of money
and<00:06:32.969> we'll<00:06:33.659> wait<00:06:33.780> for<00:06:33.840> all<00:06:34.020> the<00:06:34.110> units<00:06:34.289> to<00:06:34.379> be

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469 
and we'll wait for all the units to be

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:35.589 
and we'll wait for all the units to be
made<00:06:34.620> so<00:06:34.770> we<00:06:34.860> can<00:06:34.979> talk<00:06:35.069> about<00:06:35.189> all<00:06:35.370> of<00:06:35.400> them

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
made so we can talk about all of them

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:37.820 
made so we can talk about all of them
later<00:06:36.599> that<00:06:36.750> guy<00:06:36.900> look<00:06:37.259> at<00:06:37.319> that<00:06:37.409> guy<00:06:37.500> with<00:06:37.620> his

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
later that guy look at that guy with his

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.990 
later that guy look at that guy with his
RPG<00:06:38.460> tell<00:06:38.849> me<00:06:38.909> that<00:06:39.030> isn't<00:06:39.150> amazing<00:06:40.789> is<00:06:41.789> he

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
RPG tell me that isn't amazing is he

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.909 
RPG tell me that isn't amazing is he
holding<00:06:42.270> the<00:06:42.479> RPG<00:06:42.960> back<00:06:43.169> where<00:06:43.439> no<00:06:43.620> he's<00:06:43.770> not

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
holding the RPG back where no he's not

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.899 
holding the RPG back where no he's not
it's<00:06:44.129> just<00:06:44.280> weird<00:06:44.490> ok<00:06:46.219> so<00:06:47.219> this<00:06:47.430> is<00:06:47.610> the<00:06:47.639> cargo

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:47.909 
it's just weird ok so this is the cargo

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:51.649 
it's just weird ok so this is the cargo
plane<00:06:48.330> it's<00:06:48.750> a<00:06:49.020> huge<00:06:50.539> compared<00:06:51.539> to<00:06:51.599> the

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:51.659 
plane it's a huge compared to the

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:53.959 
plane it's a huge compared to the
transport<00:06:52.139> plane<00:06:52.199> its<00:06:52.439> massive<00:06:52.860> it's<00:06:53.039> huge

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:53.969 
transport plane its massive it's huge

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:58.070 
transport plane its massive it's huge
and<00:06:54.599> this<00:06:54.719> is<00:06:54.840> the<00:06:54.900> ac-130<00:06:56.509> which<00:06:57.509> is<00:06:57.690> a<00:06:57.719> drone

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 
and this is the ac-130 which is a drone

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.629 
and this is the ac-130 which is a drone
hence<00:06:58.440> why<00:06:58.800> it<00:06:58.860> doesn't<00:06:59.129> have<00:06:59.370> anyone

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 
hence why it doesn't have anyone

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.879 
hence why it doesn't have anyone
piloting<00:07:00.210> it<00:07:00.360> and<00:07:00.569> so<00:07:01.349> the<00:07:01.469> thing<00:07:01.620> about<00:07:01.740> the

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:01.889 
piloting it and so the thing about the

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:04.640 
piloting it and so the thing about the
ac-130<00:07:02.539> is<00:07:03.539> that<00:07:03.690> it's<00:07:03.810> fast<00:07:04.139> it's<00:07:04.500> got

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
ac-130 is that it's fast it's got

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.129 
ac-130 is that it's fast it's got
amazing<00:07:04.740> range<00:07:05.400> but<00:07:05.759> it<00:07:05.940> cannot<00:07:06.449> take<00:07:06.750> a<00:07:06.810> hit

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 
amazing range but it cannot take a hit

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:09.230 
amazing range but it cannot take a hit
this<00:07:07.620> is<00:07:07.860> basically<00:07:08.219> a<00:07:08.340> ranged<00:07:08.759> stealth

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 
this is basically a ranged stealth

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.029 
this is basically a ranged stealth
bomber<00:07:09.509> and<00:07:09.810> it's<00:07:09.960> extremely<00:07:10.319> expensive<00:07:10.560> too

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 
bomber and it's extremely expensive too

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.990 
bomber and it's extremely expensive too
and<00:07:11.280> I've<00:07:12.240> got<00:07:12.479> low<00:07:12.629> attack<00:07:12.930> rate<00:07:13.169> um<00:07:13.349> but<00:07:14.069> the

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
and I've got low attack rate um but the

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.420 
and I've got low attack rate um but the
cargo<00:07:15.360> plane<00:07:15.629> can<00:07:15.990> pick<00:07:16.229> up<00:07:16.379> a<00:07:16.500> lot<00:07:16.860> of<00:07:16.889> units

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
cargo plane can pick up a lot of units

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.010 
cargo plane can pick up a lot of units
and<00:07:17.639> it<00:07:17.729> can<00:07:17.849> pick<00:07:17.969> up<00:07:18.029> units<00:07:18.419> that<00:07:18.690> other

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 
and it can pick up units that other

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.649 
and it can pick up units that other
units<00:07:19.440> cannot<00:07:19.770> pick<00:07:19.949> up<00:07:20.099> and<00:07:20.340> then<00:07:21.180> over<00:07:21.509> here

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:21.659 
units cannot pick up and then over here

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:23.959 
units cannot pick up and then over here
we<00:07:22.050> have<00:07:22.080> the<00:07:22.409> gunship<00:07:22.919> which<00:07:23.279> is<00:07:23.430> essentially

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:23.969 
we have the gunship which is essentially

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:28.459 
we have the gunship which is essentially
a<00:07:24.000> long<00:07:24.300> ranged<00:07:24.870> plane<00:07:26.060> useful<00:07:27.349> so<00:07:28.349> yeah

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:28.469 
a long ranged plane useful so yeah

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:29.899 
a long ranged plane useful so yeah
