00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.190 
course we give the the angle of heel of
the<00:01:58.700> boat<00:01:58.880> meaning<00:01:59.300> how<00:01:59.479> far<00:01:59.720> away<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.140> from

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
the boat meaning how far away it is from

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.760 
the boat meaning how far away it is from
vertical<00:02:01.030> relatively<00:02:02.030> constant<00:02:02.530> right<00:02:03.530> now

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
vertical relatively constant right now

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.649 
vertical relatively constant right now
we<00:02:03.830> see<00:02:04.190> that<00:02:04.310> it's<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:04.610> ceiling<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.240> little<00:02:05.539> bit

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
we see that it's in ceiling a little bit

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.969 
we see that it's in ceiling a little bit
more<00:02:05.840> which<00:02:05.990> means<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.380> either<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.800> wind

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
more which means that either the wind

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.800 
more which means that either the wind
has<00:02:07.159> increased<00:02:07.580> sort<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:07.970> trim<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.330> sails<00:02:08.569> on

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
has increased sort of trim the sails on

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.110 
has increased sort of trim the sails on
a<00:02:08.840> bit<00:02:09.050> more<00:02:09.259> this<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.100> powering<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.670> boat<00:02:10.850> up

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
a bit more this is powering the boat up

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.390 
a bit more this is powering the boat up
and<00:02:11.390> wanting<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.840> push<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.260> over<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.800> the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
and wanting to push it over and the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.009 
and wanting to push it over and the
reaction<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.480> just<00:02:14.660> turn<00:02:14.870> the

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
reaction to that is to just turn the

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.840 
reaction to that is to just turn the
boat<00:02:15.200> ever<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:15.590> slightly<00:02:15.920> away<00:02:16.280> from<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.640> wind

fact that it's healing just tells you

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.690 
fact that it's healing just tells you
