little<00:01:19.369> bit<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.670> shortening<00:01:19.970> will<00:01:20.179> make<00:01:20.330> it<00:01:20.479> so

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
little bit of shortening will make it so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.240

dust<00:02:13.239> looks<00:02:14.239> pretty<00:02:14.540> too<00:02:14.810> but<00:02:15.080> pearl<00:02:15.890> the

dust looks pretty too but pearl the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.490 
dust looks pretty too but pearl the
super<00:02:17.000> pole<00:02:17.209> actually<00:02:17.540> makes<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.080> look<00:02:18.110> a

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
super pole actually makes it look a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.440 
super pole actually makes it look a
little<00:02:19.190> more<00:02:19.370> like<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.379> lace<00:02:21.379> fabric

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.760 

I<00:02:24.510> make<00:02:24.720> sure<00:02:24.750> I've<00:02:24.989> got<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.230> nice<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:25.410> covered

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
I make sure I've got it nice and covered

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:34.360 
I make sure I've got it nice and covered
on<00:02:26.010> here<00:02:26.310> going<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:28.670> rip<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.700> off

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.640 

see<00:02:34.910> how<00:02:34.970> nicely<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.540> peels<00:02:35.840> away<00:02:36.050> and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
see how nicely that peels away and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.089 
see how nicely that peels away and
that's<00:02:36.800> because<00:02:37.129> of<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.340> shortening<00:02:39.099> it's

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
that's because of the shortening it's

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.369 
that's because of the shortening it's
just<00:02:40.280> got<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.459> real<00:02:40.730> subtle<00:02:41.200> different<00:02:42.200> look

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
just got a real subtle different look

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:48.610 
just got a real subtle different look
with<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.950> pearl<00:02:43.849> dust<00:02:44.120> on<00:02:44.390> there<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:48.290> then

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
with the pearl dust on there and then

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.039 
with the pearl dust on there and then
lift<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.280> fondant<00:02:49.819> up<00:02:49.940> carefully<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:51.019> I

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
lift the fondant up carefully so that I

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.240 
lift the fondant up carefully so that I
don't<00:02:51.170> distort<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.920> design<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.799> place<00:02:55.040> it

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
don't distort the design and place it

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.020 
don't distort the design and place it
over<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.879> cake<00:02:57.370> I'm<00:02:58.370> going<00:02:58.549> to<00:02:58.610> be<00:02:58.670> covering

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
over the cake I'm going to be covering

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.770 
over the cake I'm going to be covering
all<00:02:59.299> sides<00:02:59.660> here<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:01.000> then<00:03:02.000> just<00:03:02.410> attach<00:03:03.410> it

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
all sides here and then just attach it

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.410 
all sides here and then just attach it
gently<00:03:05.780> without<00:03:06.410> again<00:03:06.769> without<00:03:07.420> distorting

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
gently without again without distorting

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.720 
gently without again without distorting
the<00:03:08.660> design<00:03:09.079> I<00:03:12.010> don't<00:03:13.010> like<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.340> move<00:03:13.489> my

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
the design I don't like to move my

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.289 
the design I don't like to move my
fondant<00:03:14.269> cakes<00:03:15.519> until<00:03:16.519> after<00:03:16.819> I<00:03:16.849> have<00:03:17.000> trimmed

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
fondant cakes until after I have trimmed

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.610 
fondant cakes until after I have trimmed
because<00:03:17.799> if<00:03:18.799> you<00:03:19.190> turn<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.670> then<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.299> will

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
because if you turn it then you will

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.390 
because if you turn it then you will
some<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:21.739> this<00:03:21.860> will<00:03:22.040> attach<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:23.000> surface

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
some of this will attach to the surface

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.420 
some of this will attach to the surface
and<00:03:25.420> pull
