stops<00:00:12.660> being<00:00:13.410> funny<00:00:14.280> well<00:00:14.759> not<00:00:15.360> until<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:15.719> run

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
stops being funny well not until we run

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.420 
stops being funny well not until we run
out<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.020> helium<00:00:16.289> which<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.830> happening<00:00:17.250> and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
out of helium which is happening and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.820 
out of helium which is happening and
it's<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.300> much<00:00:18.480> scarier<00:00:18.810> proposition<00:00:19.590> than<00:00:19.740> you

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
it's a much scarier proposition than you

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.540 
it's a much scarier proposition than you
might<00:00:20.010> think

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
might think

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.670 
might think
see<00:00:20.970> most<00:00:21.300> people<00:00:21.449> think<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.930> balloons<00:00:22.320> when

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
see most people think of balloons when

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.019 
see most people think of balloons when
they<00:00:22.769> think<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.039> helium<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.519> balloons<00:00:23.880> are

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
they think of helium and balloons are

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.480 
they think of helium and balloons are
fun<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.600> that's<00:00:25.289> good<00:00:25.560> let's<00:00:25.890> think<00:00:26.010> about<00:00:26.130> fun

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
fun so that's good let's think about fun

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.029 
fun so that's good let's think about fun
things<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:27.300> helium<00:00:27.570> actually<00:00:28.170> has<00:00:28.349> much<00:00:28.740> more

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
things but helium actually has much more

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.160 
things but helium actually has much more
important<00:00:29.519> uses<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.630> only<00:00:30.810> thing

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
important uses it's the only thing

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.410 
important uses it's the only thing
capable<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.769> cooling<00:00:32.219> some<00:00:32.520> electromagnets

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
capable of cooling some electromagnets

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.630 
capable of cooling some electromagnets
like<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.989> ones<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.440> MRI<00:00:34.800> machines<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.579> the

it<00:00:37.140> also<00:00:37.320> takes<00:00:37.649> huge<00:00:38.100> amounts<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.489> helium<00:00:38.879> to

it also takes huge amounts of helium to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.790 
it also takes huge amounts of helium to

fiber optic cabling the universe is
nowhere<00:00:45.210> near<00:00:45.270> running<00:00:45.719> out<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.930> helium<00:00:46.350> it's

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
nowhere near running out of helium it's

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.170 
nowhere near running out of helium it's
actually<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> second<00:00:47.309> most<00:00:47.430> common<00:00:47.820> element

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
actually the second most common element

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.080 
actually the second most common element
there<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.730> rare

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
there is it's just really really rare

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.450 
there is it's just really really rare
here<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.690> earth<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.829> mined<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
here on earth see we mined for it in the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
here on earth see we mined for it in the
ground<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.969> natural<00:00:54.420> gas<00:00:54.449> mostly<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> US

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
ground like natural gas mostly in the US

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.709 
ground like natural gas mostly in the US
and<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.309> started<00:00:56.610> stockpiling<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and we started stockpiling it in the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.139 
and we started stockpiling it in the
United<00:00:58.050> States<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.469> 1925<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.730> place<00:00:59.910> called

the federal helium reserve basically

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.740 
the federal helium reserve basically
because<00:01:02.340> back<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:02.609> everyone<00:01:03.270> thought<00:01:03.480> we'd

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
because back then everyone thought we'd

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.750 
because back then everyone thought we'd
be<00:01:03.870> using<00:01:04.019> dirigibles<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.979> transportation

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
be using dirigibles as transportation

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.100 
be using dirigibles as transportation
after<00:01:05.970> holding<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> hope<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
after holding on to the hope that a

after holding on to the hope that a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
Zeppelin powered future was coming for

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.270 
Zeppelin powered future was coming for
70<00:01:09.450> years<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.960> u.s.<00:01:10.200> unloaded<00:01:10.799> all<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
70 years the u.s. unloaded all that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.219 
70 years the u.s. unloaded all that
helium<00:01:11.549> onto<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> open<00:01:12.240> market<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.720> 90s

where most of the population used it for

I<00:01:42.479> wonder<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.259> situation<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.890> actually

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
I wonder if this situation is actually

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.830 
I wonder if this situation is actually
as<00:01:44.399> dire<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:44.880> they're<00:01:45.060> making<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.420> out<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> be

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
as dire as they're making it out to be
