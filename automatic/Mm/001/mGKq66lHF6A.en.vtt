00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
that i had was on takeoff on grass

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.430 
that i had was on takeoff on grass
there's<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:08.849> many<00:00:08.940> bumps<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.690> lumps<00:00:10.139> are<00:00:10.320> on

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
there's so many bumps and lumps are on

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.660 
there's so many bumps and lumps are on
there<00:00:10.620> that<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.980> gear<00:00:11.190> doors<00:00:11.400> have<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
there that the gear doors have a

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.450 
there that the gear doors have a
tendency<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.179> get<00:00:12.929> knocked<00:00:13.170> around<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.889> LX

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
tendency to get knocked around and LX

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.450 
tendency to get knocked around and LX
ended<00:00:14.849> up<00:00:14.969> doing<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.450> good<00:00:15.630> job<00:00:15.859> with<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.010> style

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
ended up doing a good job with the style

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.550 
ended up doing a good job with the style
of<00:00:17.640> gears<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.090> make<00:00:18.210> them<00:00:18.359> close<00:00:18.600> properly<00:00:18.960> but

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
of gears to make them close properly but

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.550 
of gears to make them close properly but
the<00:00:20.279> springs<00:00:20.580> weren't<00:00:20.880> strong<00:00:21.119> enough<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.660> i

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
the springs weren't strong enough and i

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.830 
the springs weren't strong enough and i
found<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> doors<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.279> shift<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.699> too<00:00:23.820> much<00:00:24.029> so

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
found the doors to shift it too much so

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.120 
found the doors to shift it too much so
what<00:00:25.140> I've<00:00:25.260> done<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.800> see<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
what I've done and you can see in the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.740 
what I've done and you can see in the
other<00:00:26.279> pictures<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.060> I've<00:00:27.570> actually

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
other pictures is I've actually

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.769 
other pictures is I've actually
installed<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.670> magnetic<00:00:29.670> system<00:00:30.179> that

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
installed a magnetic system that

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.709 
installed a magnetic system that
actually<00:00:30.929> causes<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.740> doors<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.489> open<00:00:32.820> up

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
actually causes the doors to open up

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.229 
actually causes the doors to open up
properly<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.559> landing<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.880> see<00:00:36.120> if

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
properly on landing so as you can see if

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.780 
properly on landing so as you can see if
I<00:00:36.329> let<00:00:36.540> go<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:37.079> they<00:00:37.829> open<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.309> an<00:00:38.430> absolute

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
I let go here they open with an absolute

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.170 
I let go here they open with an absolute
snap<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:40.410> stay<00:00:40.770> open<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.309> mean<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.910> I

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
snap and they stay open I mean I can I

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.139 
snap and they stay open I mean I can I
can<00:00:42.809> move<00:00:43.020> them<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.800> realistically<00:00:44.670> they

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
can move them but realistically they

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.330 
can move them but realistically they
aren't<00:00:45.539> going<00:00:45.809> anywhere<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.860> works<00:00:47.100> really

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
aren't going anywhere it works really

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
aren't going anywhere it works really
well<00:00:49.129> just<00:00:50.129> decided<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.789> instead<00:00:51.440> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
well just decided to do that instead it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.240 
well just decided to do that instead it
it<00:00:52.860> works<00:00:53.629> really<00:00:54.629> good<00:00:54.960> I've<00:00:55.410> also<00:00:55.860> done<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
it works really good I've also done the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.160 
it works really good I've also done the
same<00:00:56.430> thing<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> front<00:00:57.030> door<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.809> still

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
same thing on the front door I'm still

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.340 
same thing on the front door I'm still
using<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.710> rope<00:00:58.980> system<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.789> they<00:01:00.230> have<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
using the rope system that they have you

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.470 
using the rope system that they have you
installed<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.920> hold<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> door<00:01:02.489> closed<00:01:02.789> but

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
installed to hold the door closed but

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.450 
installed to hold the door closed but
I've<00:01:03.570> also<00:01:03.840> installed<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.379> secondary<00:01:04.860> magnet

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
I've also installed a secondary magnet

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.789 
I've also installed a secondary magnet
and<00:01:05.689> as<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:06.990> see<00:01:07.020> what<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.500> does<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.770> it

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
and as you can see what it does is it

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.149 
and as you can see what it does is it
will<00:01:08.340> ride<00:01:08.580> up<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.909> down<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:10.080> strut<00:01:10.619> not

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
will ride up and down on the strut not

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.530 
will ride up and down on the strut not
as<00:01:11.310> things<00:01:11.549> close<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:12.930> here<00:01:17.540> now

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
as things close as you can see here now

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.899 
as things close as you can see here now
it<00:01:18.750> positively<00:01:19.290> locks<00:01:19.650> when<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.280> closed<00:01:20.610> if

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
it positively locks when it's closed if

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.670 
it positively locks when it's closed if
they're<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.270> opening<00:01:21.659> up<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.470> put<00:01:22.590> as

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
they're not opening up you can put as

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.109 
they're not opening up you can put as
much<00:01:22.799> air<00:01:23.009> flow<00:01:23.189> over<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.729> want<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
much air flow over it as you want the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.080 
much air flow over it as you want the
e-flite<00:01:24.479> retracts<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.530> very<00:01:26.430> strong<00:01:26.850> very

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
e-flite retracts are very strong very

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.149 
e-flite retracts are very strong very
strong<00:01:27.360> they're<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:28.020> anywhere<00:01:28.409> now

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
strong they're not going anywhere now

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.450 
strong they're not going anywhere now
notice<00:01:29.369> when<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> open<00:01:29.909> them<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:31.079> doors

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
notice when I open them up the doors

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.130 
notice when I open them up the doors
instead<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.610> being<00:01:32.820> pushed<00:01:33.090> open<00:01:33.390> by<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.720> gear

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
instead of being pushed open by the gear

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.170 
instead of being pushed open by the gear
are<00:01:34.350> actually<00:01:35.040> being<00:01:35.310> pulled<00:01:35.640> open<00:01:35.850> by<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
are actually being pulled open by the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.210 
are actually being pulled open by the
magnet<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> there's<00:01:39.659> no<00:01:39.900> worries<00:01:40.710> about<00:01:40.890> those

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
magnet so there's no worries about those

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.359 
magnet so there's no worries about those
things<00:01:41.400> closing<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.090> getting<00:01:42.299> blown<00:01:42.570> closed

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
things closing or getting blown closed

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.789 
things closing or getting blown closed
what<00:01:44.369> tended<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> happen<00:01:45.390> before<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:46.290> if<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.590> had

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
what tended to happen before is if I had

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.880 
what tended to happen before is if I had
without<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.610> magnet<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.500> say<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.740> got

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
without the magnet and say it got

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.280 
without the magnet and say it got
knocked<00:01:50.130> by<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.460> wind<00:01:50.729> or<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> lump<00:01:51.299> it'd<00:01:52.140> be

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
knocked by the wind or a lump it'd be

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.840 
knocked by the wind or a lump it'd be
like<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.340> course<00:01:53.369> when<00:01:53.759> you

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
like this and then of course when you

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.260 
like this and then of course when you
put<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> gear<00:01:54.329> up

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
put the gear up

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.870 
put the gear up
well<00:01:57.259> all<00:01:57.469> of<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.680> sudden<00:01:57.710> oh<00:01:58.130> we<00:01:58.700> have<00:01:58.850> a

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
well all of a sudden oh we have a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.429 
well all of a sudden oh we have a
problem<00:02:00.579> but<00:02:01.579> now<00:02:01.640> with<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.149> new<00:02:02.179> system<00:02:02.450> they

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
problem but now with the new system they

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.550 
problem but now with the new system they
close<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:03.950> open<00:02:03.979> perfectly<00:02:05.320> there's<00:02:06.320> never

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
close and open perfectly there's never

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.710 
close and open perfectly there's never
any<00:02:06.829> risk<00:02:07.159> there<00:02:07.909> they're<00:02:08.209> not<00:02:08.360> going<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.539> open

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
any risk there they're not going to open

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.300 
any risk there they're not going to open
up<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:08.959> flight<00:02:09.229> it's<00:02:09.560> hard<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.890> see<00:02:10.039> here<00:02:10.250> but

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
up in flight it's hard to see here but

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.369 
up in flight it's hard to see here but
they're<00:02:10.640> actually<00:02:10.819> you<00:02:11.750> couldn't<00:02:12.110> pry<00:02:12.319> this

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
they're actually you couldn't pry this

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.229 
they're actually you couldn't pry this
open<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.920> it's<00:02:13.250> really<00:02:13.640> strong<00:02:13.879> Stanton

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
open it it's really strong Stanton

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.660

pushing<00:02:14.599> here<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:14.959> just<00:02:15.620> won't<00:02:15.799> move<00:02:15.950> so<00:02:16.519> it's

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
pushing here and just won't move so it's

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.410 
pushing here and just won't move so it's
works<00:02:16.910> really<00:02:17.360> well<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.730> as<00:02:19.730> well<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420
