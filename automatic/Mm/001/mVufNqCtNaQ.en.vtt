00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:11.280
 Mr. Kawai also received various information 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:16.289
 I thought about things and felt various things, but I think 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:23.390
 Also we do I not also oriented to'll speak toward the microphone thing 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.390
 Kawai I think that I really have had a long and long relationship with Senna . 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.810
 A word of a word 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.070
 I talked to you, though 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.110
 I would say he did not show me until now 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.350
 that 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.379
 End Lee 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.379
 And I want a great monitor thank showed me to us 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.150
 It's a lie 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.450
 After the accident of Rattsuenbaga especially Ya of function 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.630
 Senna is pretty 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.140
 It's had become nervous 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.140
 That's right- 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.380
 Looking at his complexion 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.000
 You now what Kaguro 1 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.909
 Small accessories 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.340
 I was a little hesitant, but I also showed the expression, but on the grid 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:36.250
 But because he chooses them 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:36.250
 It is the translation that I chose, but as a result I end up with such a result. 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.560
 Well what I was me really giving up that he has it now in our 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.640
 Just thank for this and that already 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.640
 Al is Umer 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:05.780
 If I face the line in peace I 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:09.619
 I think it's okay with water , but we only have to paint it 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.480
 I'm sorry I'm sorry that I was really upset by this one 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.540
 We thought that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.360
 Mr. Imamiya's composition ratio that Senna really left 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:24.370
 Also just now everyone and that also led from now Kawai's 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:28.959
 You said, but again this is not the only one 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.739
 I felt that I felt something for the first time I tried to lose him now, the size of what Senna left 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.860
 I do not 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.060
 Still 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.060
 I do not believe Nee 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.000
 Well from now 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.890
 After all the next people are yes 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.920
 To the island leader 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.950
 I think I want to go too hard 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.930
 Yes 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.180
 that is 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.710
 for the i don system 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.760
 Biggest 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.750
 Can be said 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.750
 I think it 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:12.200
 Japanese fans also have this TV in line 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:17.510
 I think many do think of Irassharu which was a logarithmic thought to rounding 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:21.769
 As a matter of fact, we must also accept it, and the thought for the generation 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.890
 Next in Brazil or zeebra may be dead white 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:28.210
 That's why Japanese fans were so passionate about Ayrton Senna 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.040
 That 7 f 9 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:37.410
 By all means everyone's also I would like to ride in front of the TV 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.410
 Alton cellar has gone away like this 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:51.250
 Again this is Imura Circuit 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.640
 During the commercials, we also want to relive our feelings and still tell 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.640
 But I think 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.330
 I do not know what good is fired How so 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.819
 Here is another canceller 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.000
 That 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:09.940
 While talking with you in various ways 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.380
 I would like to have a high time while remembering Senna 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.780
 Mr. Imamiya is first and foremost Senna and yes 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:20.709

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.650
 I'm Khan 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.639
 From the fact that 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.639
 I that aim with no reduction 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:48.310
 Ayrton Senna March 21, 1960 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.690
 Born in Sao Paulo, Brazil 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:56.249
