00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.330
 hello here we are with a new video today 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.270
 I 'm going to show you how you can do 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.000
 the feathers using only a little 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.880
 of paper and a good wire and some 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.359
 adhesive and scissors the tests are very 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.340
 fashionable 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.369
 you can also find them in stores 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.590
 but if what you want is a craft 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.480
 do it yourself with pride 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.699
 what it means to have done yourselves 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.580
 something decoration because you can do it 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.590
 with this technique and has used paper 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.230
 kraft you can use any paper 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.820
 that is fine and can be cut 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.460
 easily 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.220
 what it's about is getting two 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.680
 equal pen shapes to stick a 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.190
 over another and introduce it before a 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.820
 wire that will be the nerve of the pen 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.559
 then it's about cutting small cuts 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.660
 on the sides of the pen to 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.120
 cool to create those typical pilots 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.340
 who have the forms 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.770
 as I say I used kraft paper 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.350
 because I also really like the color and 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.180
 it's very easy what I've done is very 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.100
 easy to treat what I have done to 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.100
 get several pens because I wanted 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.860
 several is to fold the kraft paper several 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.020
 times one on one of another 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.350
 then draw a pen shape on the 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.020
 upper part trimmed so that 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.390
 with a single cut I get several 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.090
 pen forms and also the same because 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.700
 how do we have to put a pen sheet 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.289
 on another pen sheet and fit 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.470
 perfectly well it is much easier 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.240
 then once done that I have cut the 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.210
 piece of wire who will fit 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.410
 perfectly in the size of the pen and 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.470
 I have stuck it like I have explained 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.929
 before choosing on the one hand a sheet 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.550
 on the other hand another sheet paste them without 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.250
 forget us before introducing the 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.350
 wire inside and then you know already 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.690
 from the edge of ya are seeing it 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.000
 sorry from the edge of the pen until 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.369
 the interior to the nerve in this case 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.709
 in front of the pen you have to do 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.940
 a few small cuts a day that 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.620
 simulate the spirits 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.720
 of the pen 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.430
 You can use these pens form 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.200
 individual to decorate to decorate 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.060
 any part of the house a 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.340
 bookshelf or leave any detail 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.520
 on a table you can join several pens 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.740
 of these and create centers to decorate 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.960
 a table a shelf any 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.780
 any furniture that you have or even 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.380
 You can use them as bookmarks that 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.120
 one of these feathers pulls me on the sheet 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.430
 of reading where you have removed from a 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.260
 book will remind you of the next time 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.710
 reid the book where the reverse care with 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.710
 that reading
