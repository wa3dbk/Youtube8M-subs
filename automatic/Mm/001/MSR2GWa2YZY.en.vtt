00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.040
 in this video we will learn to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.720
 easily multiply by 10 100,000 or 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.720
 any number that ends with zeros 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:17.380
 let's start 54 by 10 to make this 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.570
 easy multiplication the only thing that 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:26.510
 we do is add zero from 10 to 54 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.710
 with what we have left 540 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.710
 it's that simple 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:37.130
 11% here you have to do something similar 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:42.190
 we simply add these two zeros to 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.190
 11 with what we would have left 1100 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.449
 here equal in the first simply 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:53.219
 we add 0 out of 10 234 with what we 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.219
 it's 2,340 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.780
 here at 332 we will add 4 zeros 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.869
 in this way 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.090
 as you see here are the four zeros of 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.420
 10,000 with which we multiply 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.110
 and that's how easy multiplication is 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.850
 here at 45 we add these three zeros 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.610
 that we have this number 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.200
 and finally to 72 we will add 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.290
 these four zeros 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.270
 with what we have left of this number 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.540
 then as you see when we multiply 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.860
 for 10 100,000 or any number of 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.880
 these is a 1 with many zeros 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.590
 you simply have to add zeros to 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.590
 final and you're done 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.650
 now let's see what happens when we have a 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:49.440
 number with a decimal point like here 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.450
 2.34 for 10 good here we are not going to 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.510
 add 0 at the end when we have a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.390
 decimal point the decimal point is going 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.520
 going to the right the amount 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.520
 of times you tell us the number here 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.480
 then how here this number has a 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.140
 only zero let's go through the point 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:13.510
 decimal one time to the right 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.510
 with what we will have left 23.4 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.620
 now for example here we are 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.410
 multiplying by 100 you have two 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.150
 zeros let's go through the decimal point 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:28.220
 two places to the right 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.260
 with what we will have left 500 22.1 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.510
 then as you see the point you go through the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.909
 Number of times 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.930
 be the same as the number of zeros that 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.930
 has the number here 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.010
 in this the decimal point would be crossed 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.080
 three times because we have three zeros 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.140
 but as you can see when we go through the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.630
 decimal point twice is already in the 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.030
 last position as well since 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.590
 we went through the decimal point those two 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.880
 times 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.819
 the remaining time missing here 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.249
 it will simply open a zero 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.409
 staying this result then the 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.849
 top point was toured twice and 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.689
 How we still lack one 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.689
 we add a set 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.300
 here the decimal point must be traversed 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.030
 four times but when we remember it 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.099
 once the end is over then the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.000
 three times they would simply miss the 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:28.350
 add zeros and it would be like that 15 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.819
 with 3 zeros 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.359
 Well, I hope it was clear 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.109
 try to perform mentally 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.109
 these operations here
