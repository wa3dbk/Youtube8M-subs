 but maybe that is family 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:12.199
 could be 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.899

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.349
 and I third year that I continue with conservatories and 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.989
 I started it 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.180
 after just 9 the conifer church here during the week first co 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.150

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.290
 Piet read three and a half 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.950
 that is what the radio called 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.390
 one went central 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.020
 see every Sunday are the most do 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.520
 and then I didn't get 4 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.879
 and then already got a food year to my father's right 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.479
 6 and 6 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.940
 as with the cor group park cell 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.210
 imane technique and niels van der kooi and who has 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.710
 and then called and asked if it's a lesson from a contract with he has this kind 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.440
 settled 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.450
 and then 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.450
 and set weeks before this on the large organ 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.440
 beautiful in Ostend 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.140
 and then the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.490
 because we actually wanted to get through another teachers you will not notice it 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.310
 jos ted piss 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.630
 He is teaching himself 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.979
 yes because it is quite unique race for someone young to be out too much 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.860
 colleagues as tall as you are 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.530
 after park live 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.420
 nobody knows 9 a bit mean maybe that question but I thought so 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.090
 organ also has all of those foot pedals 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.119
 and people who are not as big as driving sometimes get a commercial 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.119
 mothers make it on the pedals too 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.260
 I just wait until that 12 and then I can start playing 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.690
 m and if you are in now 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.950
 have a piece of music where your own deep troughs have to be served by you 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.430
 that you can do that already a blow four I have no idea how a bus how loose 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.210
 you put that on 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.670
 NL 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.490
 bit everything along with Jos van der Kooi who says that he is right with that 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.020
 seems to have to play what do you say nomination that I can only get my 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.379
 new bailly 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.969
 have to go touring 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.359
 know your hands 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:24.649
 yes only the amateurs alpenetappe should start playing that that with capital 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:25.689
 pick up 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.629
 if you are only on the pedals when you are tall enough 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.469
 but you have to give the farmers a bit of money 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:37.059
 saw legs off the couch are also lower pfff for the church want to do 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.719
 The joke to take a small bench in 2009 became Jos 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.309
 then I think then hey 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:45.549
 and cda 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.909
 you can no longer beat the way in which you have become too high 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:49.869
 keyboard 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.630
 with a fourth stage I have four 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.630
 say you could also play the large organ in the western church 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.139
 the above the large organ 2 yes quite often 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.899
 let there is much they go 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.899
 then I get raffled cards 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:10.699
 after that i am allowed to predict and say that there are clues for it 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:12.819
 aspen have their own composition 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.389
 made then 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:15.589
 this job 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.349
 an own composition 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.909
 so you write that is never 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.519
 and what kind of music do you write then 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.519
 arjen conceivable 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.350
 so don't ask in any of the ali b 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.930
 in addition to organ roots, he also tried to play with some modern music 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.319
 as improvisation but that is not the case 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.769
 yes it is and year after a small one too 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.420
 news that it is nothing 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.919
 day and then go into it 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.340
 the real old music he remained excellent through the ages 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:49.459
 people present people
