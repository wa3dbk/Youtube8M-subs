00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
they go up though because actually

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.030

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
we're leaving just small parts when we

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.729 
we're leaving just small parts when we
use<00:03:32.750> blender<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:34.280> make<00:03:34.489> that<00:03:34.790> transition

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
use blender to make that transition

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.929 
use blender to make that transition
radiant<00:03:36.739> that<00:03:37.189> we<00:03:37.400> usually<00:03:39.129> make<00:03:40.129> when<00:03:40.730> we

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:40.939 
radiant that we usually make when we

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.000 
radiant that we usually make when we
draw<00:03:41.180> like<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.590> general<00:03:42.590> like<00:03:43.400> smooth<00:03:44.060> leather

so we'll choose where there is the most

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.300 
so we'll choose where there is the most
light<00:05:53.860> you<00:05:54.860> say<00:05:55.250> no<00:05:55.669> that<00:05:55.940> is<00:05:56.270> on<00:05:56.570> the<00:05:56.780> right

the<00:05:58.990> shoes<00:05:59.990> at<00:06:00.169> the<00:06:00.320> back<00:06:01.240> more<00:06:02.240> shadows<00:06:02.750> and

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
the shoes at the back more shadows and

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:35.940 
the shoes at the back more shadows and
then<00:06:06.760> you<00:06:07.760> will<00:06:08.030> just<00:06:08.510> throw<00:06:09.470> some<00:06:09.889> details

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.360 

okay<00:06:36.950> so<00:06:37.010> I<00:06:37.960> think<00:06:38.960> it's<00:06:39.350> part<00:06:39.650> number<00:06:39.710> three

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
okay so I think it's part number three

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.200 
okay so I think it's part number three
of<00:06:41.080> less<00:06:42.080> than<00:06:42.320> 20<00:06:42.980> and<00:06:43.280> actually<00:06:43.820> there<00:06:44.060> is

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
of less than 20 and actually there is

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:50.230 
of less than 20 and actually there is
part<00:06:44.540> four<00:06:45.040> so<00:06:46.600> see<00:06:47.600> you<00:06:47.690> in<00:06:47.750> the<00:06:47.870> next
