second<00:01:13.619> set<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:15.170> think<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.229> would<00:01:16.470> be

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
second set I think that would be

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.620 
second set I think that would be
intimidating<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.399> an<00:01:17.640> opponent<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.270> he<00:01:18.390> did

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
intimidating to an opponent if he did

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.149 
intimidating to an opponent if he did
