00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 audibility we will accelerate a zone decided to remove 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.000
 several videos of those equipment which 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.910
 we make repairs in particular the first 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.440
 equipment equipment equipment 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.410
 devices this device for 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.590
 pumping is worth like here and we have 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.210
 presented two gas oil racks in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.830
 principle that is working stand only 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.779
 unity they deny at the moment that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.430
 there is no gas inside 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.170
 This here can be observed next 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.630
 answer omit that okunev to him 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.510
 become does not return to crushed 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.760
 very slowly rises as well as external 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.700
 the way external stands and totally working 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.690
 see has no failures 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.030
 no problems whatsoever 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.430
 about work there is no plus besides that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.800
 despite delivering we are not specifically 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.079
 began to feel all in the sand 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.149
 nowhere oil drips here this 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.910
 on top of this hour is just here 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.309
 did it start to fail 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.710
 sebaceous keeps massive crying 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.290
 all different next time even a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.890
 need to update when it means pumping 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.369
 this state is worth a thing here too 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.630
 it is clear that no curve 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.869
 delays in the stock was no mirror in principle 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.070
 field polishing on stock is present 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.380
 that's how much disintegration is possible 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.479
 subject it to pumping exactly 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.340
 distributors nobody repackage anyone 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.650
 no there are no olive supplements 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.440
 pumping ie restoration of properties 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.600
 as they need 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.290
 work here he is trying to point us 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:46.030
 presented the same already cleansed skin 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.940
 that's completely empty for correct 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.040
 work stand should be ours 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:57.760
 under pressure and we have for these things 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.010
 Savior because there are clay relief 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.370
 sold on the Internet can be fine 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.920
 buy for a certain amount of money we will not 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.630
 what dry looked did it yourself on 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.430
 local time what when pumping racks 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.650
 need to know the pressure of what under 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.570
 working pressure is on the rack well 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.520
 unless of course calves movie tell 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.240
 we will not be because there firmwares 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.480
 themselves identified this case now show 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.300
 another important moment for mean 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.700
 rack work under pressure and inside 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.740
 rack is located inert gas nitrogen 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.800
 particulars that is, we also use here 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.070
 for pumping are using gas 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.520
 nitrogen tight empty cylinder under pressure 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.780
 nitrogen balance 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:50.940
 how the whole thing happens we take our 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:53.140
 devices off and turn on the ball 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.570
 in general, ours was hooked up 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.660
 fitting simple cylinders with nitrogen 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.170
 then our action is what is needed 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:09.060
 lubricate 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:09.060
 as for our generation to go 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.510
 we fill 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.230
 In general, as shown do 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.780
 adaptation of us know that 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:34.300
 exhibiting working pressure is the answer 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.300
 that is, we pump up the rack 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.560
 honest bonus nitrogen 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:02.690
 we are after 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.730
 general refueling baby escapes for 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.730
 so that the Lord himself checked inspection 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:23.990
 Well, that's the way the rack is pumped 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.580
 but the compressive force has increased somewhere 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.199
 there is back that he comes back 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.199
 delivers the same standing 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:45.259
 Here it is pumping costs 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:48.560
 thereby prolonging the life of the rack and 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:51.139
 just return operational 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.370
 characteristics which should be in 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.770
 principle all in the next video 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.789
 We also tell you how to fix it. 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.789
 use for repair
