into the middle of the bite so we took a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.990 
into the middle of the bite so we took a
lot<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.440> idea<00:00:55.770> Unleashed<00:00:56.550> visible

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
different times mind since the world and

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.030 
different times mind since the world and
then<00:03:53.250> explode<00:03:53.670> them<00:03:53.970> up<00:03:54.150> we'll<00:03:54.840> really<00:03:55.709> fun

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
then explode them up we'll really fun

and gratifying weapon just totally

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.869 
and gratifying weapon just totally
obliterates<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.440> orcs

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.270 

there's<00:04:04.879> no<00:04:05.060> books<00:04:05.360> or<00:04:05.569> comics<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.799> support<00:04:07.159> it

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
there's no books or comics to support it

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.699 
there's no books or comics to support it
but<00:04:07.459> I<00:04:07.519> will<00:04:08.030> say<00:04:08.239> that<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.569> narrative<00:04:09.530> in<00:04:09.620> the

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
but I will say that the narrative in the

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.250 
but I will say that the narrative in the
game<00:04:09.920> is<00:04:10.099> very<00:04:10.549> rich<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.330> you<00:04:11.900> know<00:04:12.019> I<00:04:12.049> don't

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
game is very rich so you know I don't

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.509 
game is very rich so you know I don't
see<00:04:12.500> why<00:04:12.620> we<00:04:12.709> couldn't<00:04:12.830> do<00:04:13.099> those<00:04:13.280> kind<00:04:13.489> of

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
see why we couldn't do those kind of

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.970 
see why we couldn't do those kind of
spin-offs<00:04:13.940> in<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.180> future<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:15.379> the<00:04:15.709> story

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
spin-offs in the future the the story

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.379 
spin-offs in the future the the story
that<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.280> go<00:04:16.400> on<00:04:16.430> with<00:04:16.699> science<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.180> very

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
that you go on with science is very

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.300 
that you go on with science is very
unique<00:04:17.570> it's<00:04:18.260> unusual<00:04:18.859> for<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:19.070> Space

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310
