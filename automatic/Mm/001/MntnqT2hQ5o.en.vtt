that<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.750> also<00:01:56.200> just<00:01:56.710> one<00:01:56.979> capsule<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.490> day

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
that and also just one capsule a day

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.640 
that and also just one capsule a day
it's<00:01:58.390> basically<00:01:58.780> megadose<00:01:59.260> now<00:01:59.409> I'm<00:01:59.470> going<00:01:59.590> to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
it's basically megadose now I'm going to

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.230 
it's basically megadose now I'm going to
go<00:01:59.740> into<00:01:59.920> some<00:02:00.100> chemicals<00:02:00.610> in<00:02:00.760> this<00:02:01.000> project

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
go into some chemicals in this project

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.179 
go into some chemicals in this project
because<00:02:01.900> they<00:02:02.080> give<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.350> chemical<00:02:02.799> names<00:02:03.010> of

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
because they give the chemical names of

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.570 
because they give the chemical names of
it<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:04.409> I'm<00:02:05.409> gonna<00:02:05.680> just<00:02:05.890> actually<00:02:06.130> know<00:02:06.460> what

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
it and I'm gonna just actually know what

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.440 
it and I'm gonna just actually know what
I'm<00:02:06.729> just<00:02:06.790> gonna<00:02:07.030> say<00:02:07.590> what<00:02:08.590> they<00:02:08.740> do<00:02:09.450> chemical

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
I'm just gonna say what they do chemical

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.400 
I'm just gonna say what they do chemical
one<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:11.110> starts<00:02:11.950> with<00:02:12.069> a<00:02:12.099> three
