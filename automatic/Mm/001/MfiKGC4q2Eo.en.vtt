00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
confused about how to do it and this one

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.849

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
who seems to have trouble reading so I

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.929 
who seems to have trouble reading so I
thought<00:00:19.529> maybe<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.800> video<00:00:20.310> might<00:00:20.640> help<00:00:20.820> him

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939

is Russian and since I know his

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.110 
is Russian and since I know his
coordinates<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.610> gonna<00:00:35.730> go<00:00:35.910> ahead<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
coordinates I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
coordinates I'm just gonna go ahead and
punch<00:00:36.360> them<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:39.770> we're<00:00:40.770> all<00:00:40.890> familiar<00:00:41.040> with

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
punch them in we're all familiar with

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.450 
punch them in we're all familiar with
this<00:00:41.550> function<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:43.829> there<00:00:44.040> he<00:00:44.100> is

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
this function and there he is

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.360 
this function and there he is
Oh<00:00:44.899> unfortunately<00:00:45.899> his<00:00:46.500> planet<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> green

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
Oh unfortunately his planet is a green

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.040 
Oh unfortunately his planet is a green
shielded<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.030> when<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> try<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.420> attack<00:00:48.780> him<00:00:48.930> it

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
shielded so when I try to attack him it

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.400 
shielded so when I try to attack him it
says<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.469> target<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.890> currently<00:00:50.190> protected

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
says that target is currently protected

what<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> bummer

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
what a bummer

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.150 
what a bummer
so<00:00:53.550> how<00:00:53.699> do<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.850> get<00:00:53.940> around<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.449> well<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.350> know

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
so how do I get around this well I know

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.209 
so how do I get around this well I know
his<00:00:56.460> planet<00:00:56.789> coordinates<00:00:57.239> are<00:00:59.270> 436<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:01.980> can

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
his planet coordinates are 436 and I can

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.709 
his planet coordinates are 436 and I can
still<00:01:02.460> attack<00:01:02.699> his<00:01:02.910> moon<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.510> probably

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
still attack his moon and I can probably

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.090 
still attack his moon and I can probably
attack<00:01:04.080> his<00:01:04.229> planet<00:01:04.650> too

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
attack his planet too

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.620 
attack his planet too
and<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.430> green<00:01:05.700> shield<00:01:05.909> might<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.270> gone<00:01:06.450> by

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
and this green shield might be gone by

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.780 
and this green shield might be gone by
the<00:01:06.689> time<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.900> get<00:01:07.020> there<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:08.040> really<00:01:08.490> I'm<00:01:08.760> just

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the time I get there but really I'm just

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.810 
the time I get there but really I'm just
gonna<00:01:08.970> go<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.360> his<00:01:09.450> moon<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.580> I'm<00:01:11.640> gonna

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
gonna go for his moon so I'm gonna

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.200 
gonna go for his moon so I'm gonna
attack<00:01:12.060> 436<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.500> back<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> my<00:01:14.280> planet<00:01:14.580> screen<00:01:15.000> I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
attack 436 so back to my planet screen I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.630 
attack 436 so back to my planet screen I
don't<00:01:16.080> even<00:01:16.380> need<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.799> into<00:01:17.159> my<00:01:17.280> system

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
don't even need to go into my system

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.480 
don't even need to go into my system
screen<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.030> order<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:19.189> you<00:01:20.189> go<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> my

fleet window my dispatch window and here

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.620 
fleet window my dispatch window and here
I<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.189> these<00:01:23.340> little<00:01:23.460> zeros<00:01:23.909> down<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.450> I

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
I have these little zeros down here I

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.179 
I have these little zeros down here I
can<00:01:25.439> punch<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.450> change<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.659> numbers

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
can punch on this change the numbers

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.200 
can punch on this change the numbers
they<00:01:29.189> show<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.460> down<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.880> bottom<00:01:30.000> of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
they show up down here at the bottom of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.649 
they show up down here at the bottom of
