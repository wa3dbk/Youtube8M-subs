enjoyed this video and I actually do

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.899 
enjoyed this video and I actually do
have<00:06:31.789> another<00:06:32.270> review<00:06:32.840> of<00:06:32.930> this<00:06:33.110> and<00:06:33.669> it<00:06:34.669> was

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:34.909 
have another review of this and it was

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:38.170 
have another review of this and it was
on<00:06:35.120> my<00:06:35.330> camera<00:06:36.009> so<00:06:37.009> if<00:06:37.460> you<00:06:37.639> want<00:06:37.849> me<00:06:37.940> to<00:06:38.060> upload

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
on my camera so if you want me to upload

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.600 
on my camera so if you want me to upload
that<00:06:38.630> one<00:06:38.930> too<00:06:39.229> but<00:06:39.620> I<00:06:39.680> think<00:06:39.919> this<00:06:40.009> one's<00:06:40.280> a

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
that one too but I think this one's a

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:48.360 
that one too but I think this one's a
bit<00:06:41.240> more<00:06:41.449> straightforward<00:06:42.440> so

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.479 

why<00:06:49.030> why
