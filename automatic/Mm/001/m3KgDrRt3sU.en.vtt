on<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> flush<00:00:14.700> surface<00:00:15.299> with<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.660> table<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.379> saw

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
on a flush surface with the table I saw

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.730 
on a flush surface with the table I saw
an<00:00:17.369> enormous<00:00:18.029> difference<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.869> my<00:00:19.260> free<00:00:19.529> motion

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
an enormous difference in my free motion

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.950 
an enormous difference in my free motion
quilting<00:00:20.369> when<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.760> started<00:00:21.270> quilting<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
quilting when I started quilting on the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.349 
quilting when I started quilting on the
same<00:00:22.260> surface<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.789> simply<00:00:24.180> because

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
same surface and it's simply because

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.330 
same surface and it's simply because
you're<00:00:24.720> fighting<00:00:25.170> less<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> drag<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
you're fighting less of the drag and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.970 
you're fighting less of the drag and
pull<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.910> quilt<00:00:27.300> when<00:00:28.109> everything's<00:00:28.710> on

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
pull of the quilt when everything's on

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.849 
pull of the quilt when everything's on
the<00:00:29.189> same<00:00:29.400> level<00:00:29.820> surface<00:00:30.380> so<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> little<00:00:31.710> bit

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the same level surface so a little bit

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.520 
the same level surface so a little bit
about<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.279> table<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.149> table<00:00:33.480> actually<00:00:33.989> is

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
about this table this table actually is

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.069 
about this table this table actually is
identical<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.670> another<00:00:35.700> table<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.750> have

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
identical to another table that I have

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.979 
identical to another table that I have
and<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.559> called<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> Gidget<00:00:38.250> one<00:00:38.989> there

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and that's called the Gidget one there

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.750 
and that's called the Gidget one there
are<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> few<00:00:40.379> main<00:00:40.590> differences<00:00:41.160> between<00:00:41.340> them

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
are a few main differences between them

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.389 
are a few main differences between them
but<00:00:42.030> row<00:00:42.600> basically<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> footprint<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.190> this

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
but row basically the footprint of this

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.860 
but row basically the footprint of this
table<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.969> around<00:00:45.539> 20<00:00:46.230> inches<00:00:46.530> deep<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.870> all

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
table is around 20 inches deep so all

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.139 
table is around 20 inches deep so all
the<00:00:48.989> way<00:00:49.110> back<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.649> 20<00:00:50.129> inches<00:00:50.460> deep<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.969> way

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the way back so 20 inches deep that way

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.580 
the way back so 20 inches deep that way
and<00:00:51.449> around<00:00:52.140> 40<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.070> quarter<00:00:53.610> inches<00:00:54.210> long

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
and around 40 and a quarter inches long

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.849 
and around 40 and a quarter inches long
it's<00:00:55.590> gonna<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.920> 28<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.390> tall<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.230> there

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it's gonna be 28 and just tall and there

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.799 
it's gonna be 28 and just tall and there
is<00:00:59.010> not<00:00:59.250> an<00:00:59.430> adjustable<00:01:00.149> height<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.660> this

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
is not an adjustable height on this

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.680 
is not an adjustable height on this
table<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.199> can't<00:01:01.500> make<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.800> any<00:01:02.070> taller<00:01:02.420> but<00:01:03.420> I

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
table you can't make it any taller but I

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.390 
table you can't make it any taller but I
found<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.379> usually<00:01:04.710> give<00:01:05.100> or<00:01:05.250> take

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
machine on a level surface with the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.010 
machine on a level surface with the
table<00:01:31.170> top<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.460> adjustable<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.479> many

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
table top and this is adjustable so many

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.359 
table top and this is adjustable so many
different<00:01:34.439> machines<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.979> different

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so you can adjust that simply by moving

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.100 
so you can adjust that simply by moving
a<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:43.170> single<00:01:43.680> bolt<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.880> screw<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.739 
going to be really complicated and there
to<00:01:54.649> do<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.799> lot<00:01:55.039> of<00:01:55.070> screwing<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:55.999> drilling<00:01:56.479> and

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
to do a lot of screwing and drilling and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.749 
to do a lot of screwing and drilling and
hammering<00:01:57.319> in<00:01:57.890> order<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.219> get<00:01:58.340> their<00:01:58.460> table

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
hammering in order to get their table

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.779 
hammering in order to get their table
together<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.299> it<00:01:59.749> actually<00:02:00.020> arrives<00:02:00.859> from

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
together and it actually arrives from

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.779 
together and it actually arrives from
the<00:02:02.659> distribution<00:02:03.469> center<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:03.920> dropships<00:02:04.579> to

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
the distribution center it dropships to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.599 
the distribution center it dropships to
you<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:05.119> arrives<00:02:05.750> fully<00:02:06.200> assembled<00:02:06.859> so<00:02:07.340> all

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
you it arrives fully assembled so all

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.330 
you it arrives fully assembled so all
you<00:02:07.759> have<00:02:07.939> to<00:02:07.969> do<00:02:08.239> is<00:02:08.569> pop<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.349> legs<00:02:09.619> open<00:02:10.190> and

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
you have to do is pop the legs open and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.280 
you have to do is pop the legs open and
stand<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.819> up<00:02:10.910> that's<00:02:11.209> it<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.750> don't<00:02:11.959> have<00:02:12.140> to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
stand it up that's it you don't have to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.650 
stand it up that's it you don't have to
do<00:02:12.440> anything<00:02:12.680> complicated<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:14.299> don't<00:02:14.510> even

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
do anything complicated you don't even

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.539 
do anything complicated you don't even
have<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.080> pick<00:02:15.260> up<00:02:15.379> a<00:02:15.530> screwdriver<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:16.370> it's

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
have to pick up a screwdriver and it's

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.789 
have to pick up a screwdriver and it's
really<00:02:16.790> really<00:02:16.879> nice<00:02:17.260> now<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.319> main

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
really really nice now the main

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.979 
really really nice now the main
difference<00:02:19.340> between<00:02:19.519> this<00:02:20.090> table<00:02:20.629> on<00:02:20.840> the

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
difference between this table on the

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.380 
difference between this table on the
other<00:02:21.019> table<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.890> gadget<00:02:22.250> one<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.120> size

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
other table the gadget one is the size

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.199 
other table the gadget one is the size
of<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.690> cutout<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:25.129> so<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.519> hole<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:26.000> can

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
of the cutout and so this hole you can

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.289 
of the cutout and so this hole you can
see<00:02:26.450> in<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.989> video<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.290> very<00:02:27.620> very<00:02:28.220> big<00:02:28.549> it's

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
see in the video is very very big it's

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.650 
see in the video is very very big it's
24<00:02:30.230> inches<00:02:30.260> by<00:02:30.890> 12<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.549> a<00:02:31.610> half<00:02:31.640> inches<00:02:32.390> and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
24 inches by 12 and a half inches and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.410 
24 inches by 12 and a half inches and
that<00:02:33.379> is<00:02:33.650> enormous<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.819> reason<00:02:35.239> for<00:02:35.269> that

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
that is enormous and the reason for that

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.539 
that is enormous and the reason for that
is<00:02:35.629> many<00:02:35.959> sewing<00:02:36.410> machines<00:02:36.769> are<00:02:36.950> going<00:02:37.280> really

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
is many sewing machines are going really

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.940 
is many sewing machines are going really
really<00:02:37.819> big<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.540> they<00:02:38.599> absolutely<00:02:38.780> won't<00:02:39.560> fit

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
really big and they absolutely won't fit

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.819 
really big and they absolutely won't fit
into<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.400> smaller<00:02:40.700> holes<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.660> course<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.680> is

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
into the smaller holes of course this is

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.770 
into the smaller holes of course this is
going<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.099> leave<00:02:43.280> really<00:02:43.790> big<00:02:44.000> gaps<00:02:44.390> all

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
going to leave really big gaps all

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.539 
going to leave really big gaps all
around<00:02:45.170> your<00:02:45.290> sewing<00:02:45.620> machine<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:46.069> mean<00:02:46.310> some

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
around your sewing machine I mean some

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.729 
around your sewing machine I mean some
of<00:02:46.579> the<00:02:46.790> gaps<00:02:47.030> in<00:02:47.359> this<00:02:47.750> area<00:02:48.140> are<00:02:48.319> two<00:02:48.590> to

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
of the gaps in this area are two to

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.099 
of the gaps in this area are two to
three<00:02:49.010> inches<00:02:49.370> big<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:50.510> certainly<00:02:50.750> want

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
three inches big and you certainly want

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.479 
three inches big and you certainly want
to<00:02:51.200> leave<00:02:51.349> one<00:02:51.620> when<00:02:51.799> they<00:02:51.920> leave<00:02:52.069> those<00:02:52.250> gaps

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
to leave one when they leave those gaps

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.220 
to leave one when they leave those gaps
because<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.150> defeats<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.660> purpose<00:02:53.750> of

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
because that defeats the purpose of

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.650 
because that defeats the purpose of
being<00:02:54.410> on<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.709> flush<00:02:54.980> surface<00:02:55.329> so<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:56.450> cool

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
being on a flush surface so the cool

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.300 
being on a flush surface so the cool
thing<00:02:56.690> about<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.200> table<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:57.920> has<00:02:58.129> an

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
thing about this table is it has an

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.089 
thing about this table is it has an
optional<00:02:58.970> acrylic<00:02:59.540> insert<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.290> that<00:03:00.769> is<00:03:00.920> this

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
optional acrylic insert and that is this

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.449 
optional acrylic insert and that is this

a<00:03:45.799> nice<00:03:46.069> level<00:03:46.370> flush<00:03:46.849> surface<00:03:47.150> with<00:03:47.989> no<00:03:48.290> gaps

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
a nice level flush surface with no gaps

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.449 
a nice level flush surface with no gaps
and<00:03:49.329> it<00:03:50.329> really<00:03:50.840> just<00:03:51.410> makes<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:52.190> table

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
and it really just makes the table

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.170 
and it really just makes the table
perfect<00:03:53.389> for<00:03:53.690> your<00:03:53.900> machine<00:03:54.519> now<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.579> table

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
perfect for your machine now the table

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.610 
perfect for your machine now the table
itself<00:03:56.750> just<00:03:57.319> the<00:03:57.379> table<00:03:57.859> not<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.069> acrylic

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
itself just the table not the acrylic

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.880 
itself just the table not the acrylic
so<00:03:58.799> at<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:58.980> table<00:03:59.489> itself<00:03:59.879> costs<00:04:00.209> 160<00:04:01.019> 999

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
so at the table itself costs 160 999

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.820 
so at the table itself costs 160 999
it's<00:04:02.640> still<00:04:02.909> very<00:04:03.239> affordable<00:04:03.810> for<00:04:04.379> a<00:04:04.440> table

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
it's still very affordable for a table

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.770 
it's still very affordable for a table
that<00:04:05.010> does<00:04:05.190> what<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.640> does<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:06.269> that's

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
that does what it does and that's

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.420 
that does what it does and that's
getting<00:04:07.230> your<00:04:07.379> machine<00:04:07.500> on<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:07.890> flush<00:04:08.190> surface

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
getting your machine on a flush surface

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.940 
getting your machine on a flush surface
it's<00:04:09.120> hard<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.480> find<00:04:09.720> machine<00:04:10.200> tables<00:04:10.769> like

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
it's hard to find machine tables like

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.500 
it's hard to find machine tables like
this<00:04:10.980> for<00:04:11.610> any<00:04:11.730> less<00:04:12.030> than<00:04:12.060> three<00:04:12.480> hundred

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
this for any less than three hundred

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.440 
this for any less than three hundred
dollars<00:04:13.110> so<00:04:13.799> that's<00:04:14.040> why<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.280> really<00:04:14.879> liked<00:04:15.269> it

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
dollars so that's why I really liked it

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.479 
dollars so that's why I really liked it
when<00:04:15.569> I<00:04:15.629> found<00:04:16.019> these<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.380> how<00:04:16.739> sturdy<00:04:17.100> and

when I found these and how sturdy and

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.629 
when I found these and how sturdy and
durable<00:04:17.760> they<00:04:18.180> are<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:19.320> acrylic<00:04:20.040> insert

durable they are the acrylic insert

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.439 
durable they are the acrylic insert
costs<00:04:21.209> another<00:04:21.919> 59.99<00:04:22.919> because<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.729> is<00:04:23.880> custom

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
costs another 59.99 because it is custom

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.600 
costs another 59.99 because it is custom
cut<00:04:24.720> for<00:04:24.750> your<00:04:25.229> machine<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.979> to<00:04:26.250> fit<00:04:26.430> this

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
table so the two together cost to $29.99

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.950 
table so the two together cost to $29.99
which<00:04:32.100> is<00:04:32.490> still<00:04:32.820> affordable<00:04:33.360> it's<00:04:33.510> under

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
it this acrylic insert in this table

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.050 
it this acrylic insert in this table
will<00:04:43.860> last<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.310> for<00:04:44.550> years

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
pay off years down the road now this

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.890 
pay off years down the road now this
table<00:04:50.250> has<00:04:50.550> something<00:04:51.000> special<00:04:51.479> that<00:04:51.510> the

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
table has something special that the

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.260 
table has something special that the
digit<00:04:52.800> one<00:04:53.010> table<00:04:53.340> doesn't<00:04:53.639> have<00:04:53.789> and<00:04:54.060> that<00:04:54.240> is

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
digit one table doesn't have and that is

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.750 
digit one table doesn't have and that is
wheels<00:04:54.750> there<00:04:55.530> are<00:04:55.680> two<00:04:55.979> wheels

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
wheels there are two wheels

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.400 
wheels there are two wheels
I<00:04:56.820> think<00:04:57.210> it's<00:04:57.330> on<00:04:57.449> that<00:04:57.570> side<00:04:57.780> got<00:04:58.020> down<00:04:58.289> on

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
I think it's on that side got down on

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.950 
I think it's on that side got down on
the<00:04:58.530> end<00:04:58.710> of<00:04:58.919> the<00:04:59.039> table<00:04:59.449> and<00:05:00.449> so<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:00.750> can

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
the end of the table and so you can

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.469 
the end of the table and so you can
collapse<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.800> table<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.430> then<00:05:02.940> wheel<00:05:03.270> it

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
collapse the table and then wheel it

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.210 
collapse the table and then wheel it
around<00:05:03.750> your<00:05:03.930> house<00:05:04.110> if<00:05:04.380> you<00:05:04.500> want<00:05:04.710> to<00:05:04.800> go<00:05:04.950> so
