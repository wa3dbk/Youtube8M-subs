00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.780 
take some superglue I think it was
actually<00:02:11.760> my<00:02:11.940> fault<00:02:12.000> why<00:02:12.420> they

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
actually my fault why they

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.059 
actually my fault why they
I<00:02:12.819> had<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.239> on<00:02:13.329> you<00:02:14.260> know<00:02:14.379> low<00:02:14.590> part<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:14.950> my

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
I had it on you know low part of my

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.640 
I had it on you know low part of my
wrist<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.459> want<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.670> flex<00:02:15.939> my<00:02:16.090> wrist<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.719> puts<00:02:17.590> a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
wrist I want to flex my wrist it puts a

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.229 
wrist I want to flex my wrist it puts a
lot<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:17.829> stress<00:02:18.219> on<00:02:18.370> those<00:02:18.549> bands<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.180> they

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
lot of stress on those bands and they

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.209 
lot of stress on those bands and they
break<00:02:19.480> off<00:02:19.689> but<00:02:20.319> otherwise<00:02:20.590> other<00:02:20.859> than<00:02:21.069> that

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219 
break off but otherwise other than that

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.380 
break off but otherwise other than that
I've<00:02:21.489> never<00:02:21.700> had<00:02:21.969> a<00:02:22.000> problem<00:02:22.269> with<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.569> watch

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
I've never had a problem with this watch

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.800 
I've never had a problem with this watch
but<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:26.109> is<00:02:26.700> solar-powered<00:02:27.700> if<00:02:28.329> you<00:02:28.569> look

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
but it is solar-powered if you look

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.720 
but it is solar-powered if you look
right<00:02:29.079> here<00:02:31.439> you'll<00:02:32.439> see<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:33.280> there's<00:02:33.670> a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
right here you'll see the there's a

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.509 
right here you'll see the there's a
there's<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.180> there's<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.989> meter<00:02:35.489> right<00:02:36.489> here

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
there's a there's a meter right here

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.970 
there's a there's a meter right here
it's<00:02:36.819> got<00:02:36.970> high<00:02:37.180> medium<00:02:38.079> and<00:02:38.200> low<00:02:38.290> tells<00:02:38.859> you

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
it's got high medium and low tells you

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.670 
it's got high medium and low tells you
what<00:02:39.099> your<00:02:39.250> battery<00:02:39.549> status<00:02:39.879> is<00:02:40.500> over<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.590> this

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
what your battery status is over in this

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.129 
what your battery status is over in this
corner<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.069> tells<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.540> when<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:43.689> updating

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.139 
corner it tells you when it's updating

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:45.780 
corner it tells you when it's updating
that<00:02:44.230> along<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.709> being<00:02:44.859> solar-powered<00:02:45.639> it

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
that along with being solar-powered it

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.539 
that along with being solar-powered it
also<00:02:46.109> updates<00:02:47.109> automatically<00:02:47.889> so<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.250> times

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
also updates automatically so the times

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.199 
also updates automatically so the times
accurate<00:02:49.090> within<00:02:49.239> 1/10<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:50.079> second<00:02:51.209> from

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
accurate within 1/10 of a second from

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.379 
accurate within 1/10 of a second from
the<00:02:52.239> atomic<00:02:52.750> clock<00:02:53.939> so<00:02:54.939> that's<00:02:55.090> pretty<00:02:55.239> cool

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
the atomic clock so that's pretty cool

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:56.610 
the atomic clock so that's pretty cool
you<00:02:55.510> never<00:02:55.689> really<00:02:55.900> have<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.109> set<00:02:56.319> it<00:02:56.349> unless

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
you never really have to set it unless

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.280 
you never really have to set it unless
you<00:02:56.739> change<00:02:57.010> time<00:02:57.370> zones<00:02:58.079> that's<00:02:59.079> another

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
you change time zones that's another

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.319 
you change time zones that's another
thing<00:02:59.500> that's<00:02:59.620> cooling<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.099> watch<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.760> has<00:03:00.909> a

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
thing that's cooling this watch it has a

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.659 
thing that's cooling this watch it has a
bunch<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.599> different<00:03:01.659> time<00:03:02.109> zones<00:03:02.439> you<00:03:03.340> can<00:03:03.370> go

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
bunch of different time zones you can go

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.780 
bunch of different time zones you can go
through<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.900> set<00:03:05.799> whatever<00:03:06.069> time<00:03:06.459> zone

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
through and set whatever time zone

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.920 
through and set whatever time zone
you're<00:03:07.030> in<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.689> also<00:03:08.500> daylight<00:03:08.980> savings<00:03:09.459> time

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
you're in and also daylight savings time

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.300 
you're in and also daylight savings time
see<00:03:10.930> if<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:11.109> can<00:03:11.290> see<00:03:11.500> any<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.769> this<00:03:11.889> I'll<00:03:12.129> run

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
see if you can see any of this I'll run

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.869 
see if you can see any of this I'll run
through<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.669> modes<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:14.889> I<00:03:15.159> guess<00:03:15.579> you<00:03:15.730> can

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
through the modes the I guess you can

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.599 
through the modes the I guess you can
set<00:03:16.150> two<00:03:16.359> different<00:03:16.750> modes<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:17.260> time<00:03:18.099> this<00:03:18.549> is

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
set two different modes of time this is

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.240 
set two different modes of time this is
like<00:03:18.909> China<00:03:19.209> time<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:20.379> other<00:03:20.500> one<00:03:20.769> was<00:03:20.979> New

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
like China time the other one was New

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.240 
like China time the other one was New
York<00:03:21.519> time<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.590> that's<00:03:23.709> kind<00:03:23.949> of<00:03:23.979> a<00:03:24.069> cool

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
York time so that's kind of a cool

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.219 
York time so that's kind of a cool
option<00:03:24.699> it<00:03:24.879> shows<00:03:25.150> down<00:03:25.510> this<00:03:25.750> corner<00:03:26.169> it

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:26.229 
option it shows down this corner it

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:30.629 
option it shows down this corner it
shows<00:03:26.530> your<00:03:28.769> you<00:03:29.769> know<00:03:29.889> your<00:03:30.069> local<00:03:30.310> time

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
shows your you know your local time

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.300 
shows your you know your local time
maybe<00:03:30.970> if<00:03:31.150> you're<00:03:31.359> away<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.889> could<00:03:33.069> put

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
maybe if you're away you could put

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.250 
maybe if you're away you could put
whatever<00:03:33.729> time<00:03:34.090> zone<00:03:34.329> you're<00:03:34.569> in<00:03:34.599> on<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:35.019> one

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
whatever time zone you're in on this one

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.890 
whatever time zone you're in on this one
and<00:03:35.470> then<00:03:36.310> you're<00:03:36.519> back<00:03:36.849> home<00:03:37.090> time<00:03:37.449> zone<00:03:37.750> on

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
and then you're back home time zone on

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.909 
and then you're back home time zone on
this<00:03:38.049> one<00:03:38.290> comes<00:03:39.220> in<00:03:39.340> pretty<00:03:39.519> handy<00:03:39.760> if<00:03:40.150> you're

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
this one comes in pretty handy if you're

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.640 
this one comes in pretty handy if you're
you<00:03:41.919> know<00:03:41.949> across<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:43.049> across<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.260> country

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
you know across the across the country

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.270 
you know across the across the country
or<00:03:44.799> even<00:03:44.859> a<00:03:45.190> across<00:03:45.639> the<00:03:45.729> globe<00:03:46.769> but<00:03:47.769> you<00:03:48.069> have

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
or even a across the globe but you have

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.390 
or even a across the globe but you have
your<00:03:48.900> can<00:03:49.900> set<00:03:50.079> your<00:03:50.229> alarm<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.979> do<00:03:51.129> for

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
your can set your alarm you do for

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.210 
your can set your alarm you do for
alarms<00:03:51.849> on<00:03:52.000> this<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.449> it<00:03:53.199> even<00:03:53.680> allows<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:53.919> to

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
alarms on this and it even allows you to

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.899 
alarms on this and it even allows you to
set<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.489> snooze<00:03:54.879> time<00:03:54.909> so<00:03:55.810> that's<00:03:55.930> kind<00:03:56.139> of<00:03:56.169> cool

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
set a snooze time so that's kind of cool

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.960 
set a snooze time so that's kind of cool
stopwatch<00:03:59.129> and<00:04:00.129> then<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.370> go<00:04:00.459> back<00:04:00.669> to<00:04:00.699> your

stopwatch and then you go back to your

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.490 
stopwatch and then you go back to your
time

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
time

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.700

option I think to turn off all the sound
on<00:05:32.770> this<00:05:32.979> and<00:05:33.690> then<00:05:34.690> you<00:05:34.870> also<00:05:35.020> have<00:05:35.770> options

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
just a few you know few words about this

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.200 
just a few you know few words about this
is<00:05:50.590> the<00:05:51.190> casio<00:05:51.669> g-shock<00:05:53.340> GW<00:05:54.340> 300<00:05:54.760> i<00:05:54.850> think<00:05:55.090> they

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
is the casio g-shock GW 300 i think they

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.670 
is the casio g-shock GW 300 i think they
make<00:05:55.390> this<00:05:55.540> or<00:05:55.720> anymore<00:05:56.020> but<00:05:56.229> they<00:05:56.350> do<00:05:56.410> make

other versions I think that'd probably

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.080 
other versions I think that'd probably
be<00:05:58.990> just<00:05:59.260> as<00:05:59.410> good<00:06:00.210> waterproof<00:06:02.250> to<00:06:03.250> 200<00:06:03.760> meters
