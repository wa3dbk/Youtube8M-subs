working off of a Tim Holtz craft sheet
here<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.050> all<00:00:39.590> I'm<00:00:39.770> doing<00:00:39.800> is<00:00:40.190> taking<00:00:40.430> they

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
here and all I'm doing is taking they

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.450 
here and all I'm doing is taking they
come<00:00:41.600> in<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.780> variety<00:00:41.900> of<00:00:42.229> colors<00:00:42.650> this<00:00:43.220> one<00:00:43.430> I

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
come in a variety of colors this one I

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.979 
come in a variety of colors this one I
believe<00:00:43.580> is<00:00:43.879> called<00:00:44.000> sunny<00:00:44.300> yellow<00:00:44.540> and<00:00:44.870> I'm

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
believe is called sunny yellow and I'm

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.930 
believe is called sunny yellow and I'm
basically<00:00:45.409> just<00:00:45.530> gooping<00:00:46.129> them<00:00:46.280> out<00:00:46.400> onto<00:00:46.820> the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
basically just gooping them out onto the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.729 
basically just gooping them out onto the
craft<00:00:47.150> sheet<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:48.019> can<00:00:48.229> create<00:00:48.500> all<00:00:48.710> different

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
craft sheet you can create all different

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.640 
craft sheet you can create all different
sizes<00:00:49.370> big<00:00:49.909> ones<00:00:50.150> small<00:00:50.479> ones<00:00:50.510> I<00:00:50.960> wouldn't<00:00:51.559> go

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
sizes big ones small ones I wouldn't go

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.530 
sizes big ones small ones I wouldn't go
too<00:00:51.710> small<00:00:52.190> because<00:00:52.550> it's<00:00:52.729> hard<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.030> put<00:00:53.330> some

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
too small because it's hard to put some

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.060 
too small because it's hard to put some
adhesive<00:00:53.989> on<00:00:54.049> the<00:00:54.199> back<00:00:54.350> of<00:00:54.530> them<00:00:54.680> if<00:00:54.830> you<00:00:54.949> get

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
adhesive on the back of them if you get

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.729 
adhesive on the back of them if you get
really<00:00:55.610> small<00:00:55.909> but<00:00:56.720> that's<00:00:57.170> basically<00:00:57.440> all

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
really small but that's basically all

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.259 
really small but that's basically all
you<00:00:57.890> do<00:00:58.100> you<00:00:58.220> just<00:00:58.430> kind<00:00:58.519> of<00:00:58.670> goop<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:59.000> out<00:00:59.120> the

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
you do you just kind of goop it out the

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.479 
you do you just kind of goop it out the
different<00:00:59.570> sizes<00:00:59.780> that<00:00:59.960> you<00:01:00.110> want<00:01:00.470> I<00:01:00.680> usually

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
different sizes that you want I usually

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.189 
different sizes that you want I usually
do<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:01.760> at<00:01:01.850> night<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:02.089> the<00:01:02.420> next<00:01:02.540> morning<00:01:02.720> I

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
do it at night and the next morning I

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.680 
do it at night and the next morning I
come<00:01:04.129> in<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.489> peel<00:01:04.850> them<00:01:05.030> up<00:01:05.180> they're<00:01:05.479> very

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
come in and peel them up they're very

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.880 
come in and peel them up they're very
easy<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.080> could<00:01:06.200> just<00:01:06.380> flick<00:01:06.560> them<00:01:06.680> up<00:01:06.770> with

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
easy you could just flick them up with

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.460 
easy you could just flick them up with
your<00:01:07.010> finger<00:01:07.840> but<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:09.080> think<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.409> would

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
your finger but I think it would

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.260 
your finger but I think it would
probably<00:01:09.710> take<00:01:09.860> at<00:01:10.159> least<00:01:10.340> a<00:01:10.520> couple<00:01:10.729> hours<00:01:10.909> to

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
probably take at least a couple hours to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.900 
probably take at least a couple hours to
get<00:01:11.390> them<00:01:11.540> good<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:11.780> dry<00:01:12.460> anyway<00:01:13.460> I<00:01:13.490> just<00:01:13.580> put

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
get them good and dry anyway I just put

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.840 
get them good and dry anyway I just put
a<00:01:13.940> bunch<00:01:14.000> down<00:01:14.800> just<00:01:15.800> like<00:01:15.950> this<00:01:16.190> this<00:01:16.670> is

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
a bunch down just like this this is

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.600 
a bunch down just like this this is
pretty<00:01:17.030> much<00:01:17.150> a<00:01:17.300> no-brainer<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:18.490> then<00:01:19.490> you

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
pretty much a no-brainer and then you

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.100 
pretty much a no-brainer and then you
can<00:01:19.730> have<00:01:19.880> your<00:01:20.030> very<00:01:20.210> own<00:01:20.300> enamel<00:01:20.780> dots<00:01:20.870> I

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
can have your very own enamel dots I

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.750

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.630 
that white so it was kind of tough
getting<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.200> out<00:01:42.290> at<00:01:42.440> first<00:01:42.680> but<00:01:43.250> it's<00:01:43.430> just

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
getting it out at first but it's just

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.130 
getting it out at first but it's just
the<00:01:43.730> same<00:01:43.940> process<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.570> just<00:01:44.750> scoop<00:01:44.960> out<00:01:45.080> some

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
the same process you just scoop out some

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.730 
the same process you just scoop out some
that<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:45.650> want<00:01:45.860> on<00:01:46.640> your<00:01:46.700> craft<00:01:47.060> sheets<00:01:47.390> and

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
that you want on your craft sheets and

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.170 
that you want on your craft sheets and
the<00:01:48.740> next<00:01:49.010> morning<00:01:49.190> I<00:01:49.490> didn't<00:01:49.790> film<00:01:49.970> me

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
the next morning I didn't film me

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.880 
the next morning I didn't film me
actually<00:01:50.360> getting<00:01:51.140> them<00:01:51.260> up<00:01:51.409> which<00:01:51.740> I

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
actually getting them up which I

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.110 
actually getting them up which I
probably<00:01:52.159> should<00:01:52.520> have<00:01:52.550> but<00:01:52.790> they're

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
probably should have but they're

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.670 
probably should have but they're
completely<00:01:53.659> dry<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.900> just<00:01:54.140> flick<00:01:54.380> them<00:01:54.530> up

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
completely dry you just flick them up

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.890 
completely dry you just flick them up
with<00:01:54.830> your<00:01:54.860> finger<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.570> you're<00:01:56.570> good<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.870> go
