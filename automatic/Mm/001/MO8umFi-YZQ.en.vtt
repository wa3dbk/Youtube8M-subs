00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
pretty adventurous um odd in that it

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.520 
pretty adventurous um odd in that it
doesn't<00:02:29.550> belong<00:02:29.940> dude<00:02:30.360> it's<00:02:30.630> dialed<00:02:31.170> up<00:02:31.260> in

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530

certain<00:02:32.310> parts<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.880> flavor<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.690> just

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
certain parts of this flavor that just

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.300 
certain parts of this flavor that just
doesn't<00:02:34.019> belong<00:02:34.470> with<00:02:34.530> other<00:02:34.890> parts<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.250> the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
doesn't belong with other parts of the

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.949 
doesn't belong with other parts of the
flavor<00:02:35.580> maybe<00:02:36.090> because<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.510> Pringles<00:02:36.870> is

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
flavor maybe because the Pringles is

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.600 
flavor maybe because the Pringles is
kind<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.290> reconstituted<00:02:37.890> potato<00:02:38.310> taste
