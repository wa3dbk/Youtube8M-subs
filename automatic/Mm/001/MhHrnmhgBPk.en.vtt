00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
student asked me how to paint tree and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.450 
student asked me how to paint tree and
since<00:00:19.930> that's<00:00:20.259> in<00:00:20.470> British<00:00:20.770> Columbia<00:00:21.189> we'd

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
since that's in British Columbia we'd

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.750 
since that's in British Columbia we'd
have<00:00:21.670> a<00:00:21.700> lot<00:00:22.119> of<00:00:22.150> birch<00:00:22.450> tree<00:00:22.840> so<00:00:23.710> I<00:00:24.250> took<00:00:24.369> some

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
have a lot of birch tree so I took some

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.439 
have a lot of birch tree so I took some
photograph<00:00:25.359> of<00:00:25.990> birch<00:00:26.350> tree<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:28.029> can<00:00:28.240> see

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
photograph of birch tree and you can see

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.960 
photograph of birch tree and you can see
that<00:00:28.660> my<00:00:29.590> final<00:00:29.859> product<00:00:30.220> it's<00:00:30.550> actually<00:00:30.699> a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
that my final product it's actually a

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.110 
that my final product it's actually a
little<00:00:31.150> bit<00:00:31.300> different<00:00:31.720> from<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.410> fragrance

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
little bit different from the fragrance

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.049 
little bit different from the fragrance
material<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:35.010> because<00:00:36.010> I've<00:00:36.460> many<00:00:36.820> many

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
material and because I've many many

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.390 
material and because I've many many
artists<00:00:37.720> that's<00:00:37.900> when<00:00:38.170> we<00:00:38.410> actually<00:00:38.800> paint

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
artists that's when we actually paint

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.899 
artists that's when we actually paint
away<00:00:39.670> actually<00:00:40.680> design<00:00:41.680> redesign<00:00:42.040> we<00:00:42.699> don't

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909 
away actually design redesign we don't

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.829 
away actually design redesign we don't
paint<00:00:43.360> exactly<00:00:43.960> like<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.290> photograph<00:00:44.920> I<00:00:45.839> give

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
paint exactly like the photograph I give

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.910 
paint exactly like the photograph I give
private<00:00:47.320> SN<00:00:47.830> group<00:00:48.309> session<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:49.210> I<00:00:49.330> also<00:00:49.920> go

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
private SN group session and I also go

00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:01.680 
private SN group session and I also go
out<00:00:51.220> of<00:00:51.370> British<00:00:52.059> Columbia<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.750> give<00:00:53.049> workshop

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.200 

before<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:02.810> start<00:01:03.110> doing<00:01:03.260> your<00:01:03.380> watercolor

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
before you start doing your watercolor

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.830 
before you start doing your watercolor
you<00:01:05.229> should<00:01:06.229> do<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.410> little<00:01:06.650> bit<00:01:06.800> of<00:01:06.890> sketch<00:01:07.220> and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
you should do a little bit of sketch and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.620 
you should do a little bit of sketch and
you<00:01:09.130> what<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.250> saw<00:01:10.520> there<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.970> yellow<00:01:11.270> color

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
you what you saw there the yellow color

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.910 
you what you saw there the yellow color
that's<00:01:11.960> also<00:01:12.320> frisky<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.960> frisket<00:01:15.530> would

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
that's also frisky and the frisket would

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.290 
that's also frisky and the frisket would
prevent<00:01:16.640> my<00:01:17.030> water<00:01:17.330> from<00:01:17.810> going<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.350> and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
prevent my water from going in and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.910 
prevent my water from going in and
therefore<00:01:20.300> that<00:01:20.570> would<00:01:20.840> retain<00:01:21.290> that<00:01:21.560> people

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
therefore that would retain that people

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.719 
therefore that would retain that people
white<00:01:22.100> color

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
white color

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.530 
white color
I<00:01:23.229> gave<00:01:24.229> a<00:01:24.530> little<00:01:24.740> bit<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:25.070> coding<00:01:25.479> for<00:01:26.479> the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
I gave a little bit of coding for the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.219 
I gave a little bit of coding for the
back<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.110> tree<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.820> also<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.720> tree<00:01:29.990> are

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
back of the tree and also the tree are

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.620 
back of the tree and also the tree are
the<00:01:30.380> sky<00:01:31.750> now<00:01:32.750> between<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:34.670> snow<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.450> the

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
the sky now between the snow and the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.940 
the sky now between the snow and the
treeline<00:01:36.140> it<00:01:36.530> should<00:01:36.740> be<00:01:36.860> wet<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:39.500> it's<00:01:39.770> not

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
treeline it should be wet and it's not

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.380 
treeline it should be wet and it's not
witty<00:01:40.250> enough<00:01:40.399> it<00:01:40.850> should<00:01:40.970> go<00:01:41.119> back<00:01:41.149> and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
witty enough it should go back and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:51.310 
witty enough it should go back and
breathe<00:01:41.810> with<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:42.080> again

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.899 

you

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.320 

okay<00:01:54.909> so<00:01:54.970> once<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:56.470> have<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.890> general<00:01:57.330> face

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
okay so once you have a general face

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.320 
okay so once you have a general face
color<00:01:59.100> and<00:02:00.100> now<00:02:00.430> we<00:02:00.490> can<00:02:00.729> be<00:02:00.850> literally<00:02:01.300> a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
color and now we can be literally a

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:11.260 
color and now we can be literally a
little<00:02:01.540> bit<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.870> fun<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.950> background<00:02:03.460> treat

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.330 

and<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.020> should<00:02:12.230> constantly<00:02:12.590> changing<00:02:13.310> the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
and you should constantly changing the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.500 
and you should constantly changing the
color<00:02:15.010> allow<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.070> tree<00:02:16.640> from<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.060> park<00:02:17.300> or

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
color allow the tree from the park or

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:27.550 
color allow the tree from the park or
run<00:02:17.870> freely

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.890 

now<00:02:28.560> if<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.430> tilt<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.940> paper<00:02:30.150> you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
now if you like to tilt the paper you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.660 
now if you like to tilt the paper you
can<00:02:31.050> kill<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.470> paper<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.830> little<00:02:32.130> bit<00:02:32.250> also

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.920 

right<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.910> now<00:02:39.060> I'm<00:02:39.180> going<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.330> come<00:02:39.540> back<00:02:39.750> to

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
right so now I'm going to come back to

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.680 
right so now I'm going to come back to
the<00:02:40.020> front<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.880> make<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.090> one<00:02:42.300> that's<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:42.660> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
the front and make the one that's in the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.309 
the front and make the one that's in the
front<00:02:43.020> it's<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.260> little<00:02:43.500> bit<00:02:43.590> more<00:02:43.770> darker<00:02:45.319> and

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
front it's a little bit more darker and

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.370 
front it's a little bit more darker and
you<00:02:46.410> can<00:02:46.620> see<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.250> it's<00:02:47.489> running<00:02:47.819> by<00:02:48.060> itself

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
you can see that it's running by itself

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.559 
you can see that it's running by itself
and<00:02:49.380> that's<00:02:49.530> what<00:02:49.800> we<00:02:49.950> want<00:02:53.300> sometimes<00:02:54.300> you

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
and that's what we want sometimes you

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.390 
and that's what we want sometimes you
will<00:02:54.780> find<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.319> it<00:02:55.590> doesn't<00:02:55.920> run

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
will find it that it doesn't run

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.080 
will find it that it doesn't run
that's<00:02:57.440> smoothly<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.860> can<00:02:58.980> actually<00:02:59.400> put<00:02:59.970> it

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
that's smoothly you can actually put it

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.680 
that's smoothly you can actually put it
just<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.450> little<00:03:00.660> bit<00:03:00.750> more<00:03:00.870> concentrated<00:03:05.690> it

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
just a little bit more concentrated it

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.970 
just a little bit more concentrated it
would<00:03:06.810> give<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.140> much<00:03:07.320> more<00:03:07.350> put<00:03:07.800> in<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
would give you a much more put in the

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.100 
would give you a much more put in the
look<00:03:10.550> and<00:03:11.550> if<00:03:11.819> you<00:03:11.850> see<00:03:12.150> anywhere<00:03:12.600> that's<00:03:12.900> got

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
look and if you see anywhere that's got

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.979 
look and if you see anywhere that's got
hard<00:03:13.380> edge<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:14.670> can<00:03:14.819> actually<00:03:15.000> read<00:03:15.450> wet<00:03:15.720> or

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989
