00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
playing a long time ago actually this is

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.039 
playing a long time ago actually this is
a<00:00:05.700> lot<00:00:05.879> variant<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.629> was<00:00:06.750> playing<00:00:06.870> with

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
a lot variant that I was playing with

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.410 
a lot variant that I was playing with
triple<00:00:07.500> magic<00:00:07.799> cylinders<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:09.090> know<00:00:09.210> it's

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
triple magic cylinders and you know it's

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.060 
triple magic cylinders and you know it's
not<00:00:09.570> it's<00:00:10.019> not<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.230> meta<00:00:10.469> deck<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:10.889> probably

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
not it's not a meta deck and it probably

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.379 
not it's not a meta deck and it probably
won't<00:00:11.340> get<00:00:11.460> hit<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.120> know<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.330> just

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
won't get hit and you know it's just

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.299 
won't get hit and you know it's just
something<00:00:12.660> fun<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.679> mess<00:00:13.799> around<00:00:13.920> with<00:00:14.160> just

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
something fun to mess around with just

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.499 
something fun to mess around with just
because<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.759> know<00:00:14.849> with<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.120> marshals

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
because you know with the marshals

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.790 
because you know with the marshals
coming<00:00:15.599> around<00:00:15.809> we<00:00:15.960> got<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.170> wait<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.740> see

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
coming around we got to wait and see

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.290 
coming around we got to wait and see
what's<00:00:17.070> actually<00:00:17.310> going<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.730> be<00:00:17.760> meta<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
what's actually going to be meta and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.570 
what's actually going to be meta and
this<00:00:18.810> deck<00:00:18.990> probably<00:00:19.650> won't<00:00:19.770> get<00:00:19.949> touched<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
this deck probably won't get touched and

very sad but that said we'll get into

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.930 
very sad but that said we'll get into
the<00:00:49.530> deck<00:00:49.620> profile<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.460> definitely<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the deck profile and it is definitely a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.260 
the deck profile and it is definitely a
bunch<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.930> tech-<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.559> Thunder<00:00:52.860> see<00:00:53.010> yours<00:00:53.270> but

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
bunch of tech- the Thunder see yours but

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.490 
bunch of tech- the Thunder see yours but
you<00:00:54.360> know<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.480> don't<00:00:54.660> think<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.960> card's<00:00:55.230> that

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you know I don't think this card's that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.770 
you know I don't think this card's that
expense<00:00:55.949> i'm<00:00:56.070> sure<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.820> pick<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.300> place

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
expense i'm sure you can pick up a place

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.189 
expense i'm sure you can pick up a place
f<00:00:58.020> relatively<00:00:58.500> inexpensive<00:00:59.010> because<00:00:59.129> i<00:01:00.199> don't

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
f relatively inexpensive because i don't

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.500 
f relatively inexpensive because i don't
think<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> hunter<00:01:01.890> archetype<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.640> exactly

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
think the hunter archetype is exactly

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.850 
think the hunter archetype is exactly
topping<00:01:03.960> at<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> moment<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.589> any

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
topping at the moment like any

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.190 
topping at the moment like any
large-scale<00:01:05.189> tournaments<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.090> Thunder<00:01:06.960> sears

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
large-scale tournaments so Thunder sears

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.330 
large-scale tournaments so Thunder sears
probably<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> only<00:01:07.619> expensive<00:01:08.040> card<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
probably the only expensive card in the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.460

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:03.420 
it's just rank fours and then if for

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.170 
it's just rank fours and then if for
whatever<00:07:03.570> reason<00:07:04.020> you<00:07:04.620> need<00:07:05.610> to<00:07:05.760> make<00:07:05.880> this

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
whatever reason you need to make this

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.210 
whatever reason you need to make this
because<00:07:06.750> you<00:07:06.930> have<00:07:07.080> to<00:07:07.230> wat<00:07:07.410> hopper<00:07:07.800> hey<00:07:07.980> you

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
because you have to wat hopper hey you

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.980 
because you have to wat hopper hey you
know<00:07:08.340> it's<00:07:08.550> there<00:07:08.730> it's<00:07:08.880> an<00:07:09.030> option<00:07:09.180> might<00:07:09.840> as

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
know it's there it's an option might as

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.050 
know it's there it's an option might as
well<00:07:10.140> right<00:07:10.320> and<00:07:10.590> then<00:07:11.070> there's<00:07:11.460> a<00:07:11.700> random

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 
well right and then there's a random

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.580 
well right and then there's a random
temtempo<00:07:12.420> in<00:07:12.780> there<00:07:12.960> and<00:07:13.140> the<00:07:13.410> off<00:07:13.560> chance

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
temtempo in there and the off chance

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.710 
temtempo in there and the off chance
that<00:07:14.100> your<00:07:15.060> part<00:07:15.270> gives<00:07:15.480> you<00:07:15.570> a<00:07:15.600> little

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
that your part gives you a little

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.880 
that your part gives you a little
through<00:07:15.930> monster<00:07:16.320> and<00:07:16.470> you<00:07:16.530> were<00:07:16.650> born

another level 3 monster which
realistically<00:07:18.390> probably<00:07:18.780> is<00:07:18.990> never<00:07:19.170> gonna

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.320 
realistically probably is never gonna

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.810 
realistically probably is never gonna
happen<00:07:19.380> but<00:07:19.860> it's<00:07:20.310> just<00:07:20.550> there<00:07:20.700> because
