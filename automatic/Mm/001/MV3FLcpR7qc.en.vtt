00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.560 

weirdly<00:01:07.979> enough<00:01:08.009> that<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.909> most<00:01:09.090> emotional

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
weirdly enough that the most emotional

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.240 
weirdly enough that the most emotional
shot<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.470> film<00:01:10.500> was<00:01:10.799> probably<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> last

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
shot of the film was probably the last

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.149 
shot of the film was probably the last
one<00:01:11.490> which<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:11.970> not<00:01:12.180> an<00:01:12.360> emotional<00:01:12.720> scene<00:01:13.159> but

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
one which was not an emotional scene but

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.670 
one which was not an emotional scene but
it<00:01:14.250> was<00:01:14.399> here<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:16.289> scene<00:01:17.250> where<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.030> I

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
it was here it was a scene where I and I

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.560 
it was here it was a scene where I and I
literally<00:01:19.680> was<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.860> shot<00:01:20.039> of<00:01:20.159> me<00:01:20.310> jumping<00:01:20.640> into

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
literally was a shot of me jumping into

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.810 
literally was a shot of me jumping into
a<00:01:21.689> fireplace<00:01:22.079> home<00:01:23.009> at<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.520> end<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
a fireplace home at the end of the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
a fireplace home at the end of the
Ministry<00:01:24.149> of<00:01:24.179> Magic<00:01:24.360> chasing<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.350> after

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
Ministry of Magic chasing and then after

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.710 
Ministry of Magic chasing and then after
that<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.830> was<00:01:25.920> all<00:01:25.979> I'll<00:01:26.130> shot<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.399> film<00:01:26.720> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that that was all I'll shot on film and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.300 
that that was all I'll shot on film and
so<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.380> was<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.500> was<00:01:28.710> how<00:01:28.830> he<00:01:28.860> ended<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.189> I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
so that was that was how he ended up I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.060 
so that was that was how he ended up I
think<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> other<00:01:30.710> emotional<00:01:31.710> scene<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:31.979> this

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
think the other emotional scene in this

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
think the other emotional scene in this
film<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.399> that<00:01:32.670> though<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.539> one<00:01:33.659> that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
film is that though and the one that

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.999 
film is that though and the one that
I've<00:01:33.869> been<00:01:33.990> most<00:01:34.170> looking<00:01:34.350> forward<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.740> as

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
I've been most looking forward to as

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.580 
I've been most looking forward to as
well<00:01:35.479> was<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> scene<00:01:36.810> where<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.020> walk<00:01:37.320> into<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
well was the scene where I walk into the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
well was the scene where I walk into the
forest<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.130> find<00:01:38.399> and<00:01:39.080> suddenly<00:01:40.080> I<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:40.610> my

the character bloop and dying for me is
one<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.200> most<00:02:04.259> upsetting<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:05.069> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
one of the most upsetting in all the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.609 
one of the most upsetting in all the
books<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:05.670> i<00:02:05.700> love<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.119> character<00:02:06.619> and

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
books because i love that character and

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.410 
books because i love that character and
so<00:02:08.099> yeah<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.459> same<00:02:08.670> was<00:02:08.849> was<00:02:09.119> pretty

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
so yeah that same was was pretty

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:20.330 
so yeah that same was was pretty
emotional<00:02:09.630> i<00:02:09.929> think<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.619> should<00:02:10.799> be<00:02:10.829> anyway

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
and they would at that stage sort of

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.630 
and they would at that stage sort of
design<00:03:16.599> dry<00:03:16.719> much<00:03:16.870> older<00:03:17.349> audience<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:18.459> might

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.830 

it<00:04:39.150> was<00:04:39.389> him<00:04:39.660> no<00:04:40.080> it<00:04:40.139> was<00:04:40.319> it<00:04:40.590> was<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.800> was<00:04:41.190> quite

it was him no it was it was it was quite
sad<00:04:42.840> but<00:04:42.990> it<00:04:43.050> was<00:04:43.169> I<00:04:43.349> think<00:04:43.530> more<00:04:43.949> than<00:04:43.979> letting

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
sad but it was I think more than letting

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.550 
sad but it was I think more than letting
ourselves<00:04:45.150> be<00:04:45.509> stopping<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.139> nostalgic

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
ourselves be stopping and nostalgic

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.320 
ourselves be stopping and nostalgic
about<00:04:46.680> it<00:04:46.979> I<00:04:47.039> think<00:04:47.099> we<00:04:47.310> just<00:04:47.340> used<00:04:47.759> that<00:04:47.879> the

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
about it I think we just used that the

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.610 
about it I think we just used that the
pressure<00:04:48.720> we<00:04:48.870> felt<00:04:49.050> because<00:04:49.169> we<00:04:49.289> knew<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.530> was

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
pressure we felt because we knew it was

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.050 
pressure we felt because we knew it was
the<00:04:49.680> last<00:04:49.770> one<00:04:50.009> to<00:04:50.039> spur<00:04:50.370> us<00:04:50.550> on<00:04:50.669> to<00:04:50.819> try<00:04:50.970> and

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
the last one to spur us on to try and

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.670 
the last one to spur us on to try and
make<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.330> best<00:04:51.419> one<00:04:51.659> we<00:04:51.750> could<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:52.080> think<00:04:52.590> I

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
make it the best one we could I think I

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.339 
make it the best one we could I think I
think<00:04:52.860> we<00:04:53.090> we<00:04:54.090> channel<00:04:54.449> that<00:04:54.599> energy<00:04:54.750> into<00:04:54.990> her

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
think we we channel that energy into her

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:56.600 
think we we channel that energy into her
into<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.680> more<00:04:55.860> positive<00:04:56.039> sort<00:04:56.550> of

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
into a more positive sort of

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.569 
into a more positive sort of
constructive<00:04:57.150> frame<00:04:57.360> of<00:04:57.479> mind
