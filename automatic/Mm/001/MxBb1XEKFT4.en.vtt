notice<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.309> sequence<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.120> i'm<00:00:57.270> using<00:00:57.300> these

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
notice the sequence that i'm using these

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.630 
notice the sequence that i'm using these
covers<00:00:59.030> the<00:01:00.030> blue<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.510> I'm<00:01:00.600> use<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.640> it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
covers the blue that I'm use then it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.660 
covers the blue that I'm use then it
sets<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> tone<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.930> gray<00:01:04.199> sets<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> base<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
sets the tone the gray sets the base and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.750 
sets the tone the gray sets the base and
this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.900> darkening<00:01:07.320> agent<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.369> goes<00:01:08.580> on

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
this is the darkening agent that goes on

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.300 
this is the darkening agent that goes on
top<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.170> end<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.619> when<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.040> Payne's

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
top so you end up when this is Payne's

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.969 
top so you end up when this is Payne's
gray<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> end<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> kind<00:01:13.890> of

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
gray so you end up really with a kind of

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.789 
gray so you end up really with a kind of
very<00:01:14.790> dark<00:01:16.009> roof<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> little<00:01:18.360> bit<00:01:18.659> of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
whole thing because it would take too

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.770 
whole thing because it would take too

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.680 
long and I just going to show you how it
actually<00:02:13.930> works<00:02:14.580> put<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.670> base<00:02:15.849> E<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.630> then

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
actually works put the base E and then

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.130 
actually works put the base E and then
instead<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.110> blue<00:02:17.730> we're<00:02:18.730> going<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:18.940> put<00:02:19.030> brown

on<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.829> screen<00:04:09.130> but<00:04:09.310> just<00:04:09.519> makes<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.850> that's<00:04:10.239> a

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
on the screen but just makes it that's a

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.120 
on the screen but just makes it that's a
little<00:04:10.510> bit<00:04:10.750> more<00:04:10.870> attractive<00:04:11.350> I've<00:04:11.920> always

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
little bit more attractive I've always

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.850 
little bit more attractive I've always
started<00:04:12.639> it<00:04:12.760> off<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.329> I'm<00:04:13.420> going<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.860> probably

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
started it off and I'm going to probably

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.800 
started it off and I'm going to probably
from<00:04:15.159> the<00:04:15.250> inevitable<00:04:15.670> grave

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
from the inevitable grave

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.040 
from the inevitable grave
that<00:04:16.959> goes<00:04:17.200> in<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:18.489> for<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.790> whole<00:04:19.000> thing

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.379 

after<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.169> you<00:04:24.010> can<00:04:24.190> add<00:04:24.430> quite<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.180> variety

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
after that you can add quite a variety

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.010 
after that you can add quite a variety
of<00:04:25.690> different<00:04:25.930> colors<00:04:27.030> thinking<00:04:28.030> of<00:04:28.090> this<00:04:28.270> all

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
of different colors thinking of this all

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.760 
of different colors thinking of this all
being<00:04:29.230> as<00:04:29.440> one<00:04:29.680> for<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.550> moment<00:04:31.680> little<00:04:32.680> bit

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
being as one for the moment little bit

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:50.670 
being as one for the moment little bit
of<00:04:32.860> ochre<00:04:37.350> yellow<00:04:38.350> ochre<00:04:45.000> ok<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.750> little

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
of ochre yellow ochre ok and a little

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.030 
of ochre yellow ochre ok and a little
bit<00:04:50.979> of<00:04:51.040> brown<00:04:54.479> that<00:04:55.479> would<00:04:55.660> produce<00:04:56.290> quite<00:04:56.979> a

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
bit of brown that would produce quite a

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.150 
bit of brown that would produce quite a
rich<00:04:57.340> color<00:04:57.729> when<00:04:58.270> we<00:04:58.419> put<00:04:58.600> it<00:04:58.690> together<00:04:59.160> okay

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
rich color when we put it together okay

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.140 
rich color when we put it together okay
a<00:05:00.190> little<00:05:00.340> bit<00:05:00.550> more<00:05:00.669> dark<00:05:01.060> green<00:05:01.810> there

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
a little bit more dark green there

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.110 
a little bit more dark green there
that's<00:05:04.150> it<00:05:04.300> okay<00:05:04.960> now<00:05:05.320> do<00:05:05.979> its<00:05:06.669> blend<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.030> with

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
that's it okay now do its blend it with

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.060 
that's it okay now do its blend it with
a<00:05:07.180> blender<00:05:07.570> I<00:05:07.750> don't<00:05:08.320> worry<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.650> rough<00:05:08.800> fact

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
a blender I don't worry the rough fact

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.560 
a blender I don't worry the rough fact
that<00:05:09.220> i've<00:05:09.340> got<00:05:09.490> some<00:05:09.700> dark<00:05:10.000> color<00:05:10.240> on<00:05:10.389> there

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
that i've got some dark color on there

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.320 
that i've got some dark color on there
and<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:11.290> blend<00:05:11.680> all<00:05:11.830> of<00:05:12.010> that<00:05:12.160> in<00:05:15.030> well<00:05:16.030> that's

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
and I blend all of that in well that's

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330 
and I blend all of that in well that's
them<00:05:16.630> to<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:16.930> general<00:05:17.410> color<00:05:17.650> but<00:05:17.889> now<00:05:18.040> we<00:05:18.100> need

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
them to a general color but now we need

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.950 
them to a general color but now we need
to<00:05:18.400> darken<00:05:18.729> it<00:05:19.060> so<00:05:19.210> I'm<00:05:19.330> going<00:05:19.479> to<00:05:19.510> put<00:05:19.690> them<00:05:19.780> a

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
to darken it so I'm going to put them a

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.790 
to darken it so I'm going to put them a
bit<00:05:20.229> superion<00:05:24.720> it<00:05:25.720> all<00:05:25.840> has<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.050> be<00:05:26.169> solid

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
bit superion it all has to be solid

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.990 
bit superion it all has to be solid
although<00:05:27.250> bonusing<00:05:27.850> places<00:05:28.780> i<00:05:29.340> bet<00:05:30.340> a<00:05:30.729> little

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
although bonusing places i bet a little

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.200 
although bonusing places i bet a little
bit<00:05:31.210> more<00:05:32.039> around<00:05:35.460> and<00:05:36.460> then<00:05:36.700> I<00:05:36.760> add<00:05:36.910> a<00:05:36.940> little

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
bit more around and then I add a little

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.200 
bit more around and then I add a little
bit<00:05:37.390> of<00:05:37.450> brute<00:05:37.690> here<00:05:37.930> too<00:05:41.580> as<00:05:42.580> if<00:05:42.850> you<00:05:42.970> also

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
bit of brute here too as if you also

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.529 
bit of brute here too as if you also
then<00:05:43.570> add<00:05:43.990> a<00:05:44.050> little<00:05:44.260> bit<00:05:44.410> of<00:05:44.520> okay<00:05:45.520> you'll<00:05:46.419> end

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
then add a little bit of okay you'll end

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.540 
then add a little bit of okay you'll end
up<00:05:46.630> with<00:05:46.780> a<00:05:46.810> slightly<00:05:47.650> different<00:05:47.919> color<00:05:48.250> green

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
up with a slightly different color green

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.730 
up with a slightly different color green
and<00:05:49.539> then<00:05:49.690> you<00:05:49.930> see<00:05:50.110> how<00:05:50.139> that's<00:05:50.500> sup

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
and then you see how that's sup

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.029 
and then you see how that's sup
beginning<00:05:51.100> to<00:05:51.190> work<00:05:52.440> now<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.500> most<00:05:53.770> crucial

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
beginning to work now the most crucial

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:09.070 
beginning to work now the most crucial
part<00:05:54.600> is<00:05:55.600> to<00:05:55.750> get<00:05:55.900> this<00:05:56.020> right

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.139
