00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 today we will play with the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.120
 light and it's going to be cool and it's going to be 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.150
 supra cool and it'll be just mega cool 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.360
 it's like my mustache is cool or 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.360
 not 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.880
 hello and welcome to the corner of f1 4 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.590
 we will play with the light we 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.539
 let's work mostly with the 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.669
 graded filters you will see that the 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.630
 free filters will be able to save you 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.130
 life on a lot of things 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.960
 What is a graduated filter? 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.680
 start with that imagine actually a 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.989
 gradient of black green white you have the 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.879
 white or has acted thoroughly you have the 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.710
 black where it does not work at all and you 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.809
 have the grids or it acts according 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.640
 of the shade of gray that we have over the 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.260
 grilling make these people know how to act more 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.239
 the light gray over it will act and so there 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.619
 imagine it's by black gradients 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.860
 to the white 

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:55.960
 so you see that before this limit 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.729
 the sagi namely after this limit there 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.879
 it does not work at all is between 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.769
 two that comes from 100% to 0% of shares 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.420
 the graduated filter is really going to 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.920
 allow to play with light and 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.479
 especially also to play with effects 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.070
 of color or with effects of 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.200
 a lot to be able to play 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.820
 in this figure climbs with the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.650
 temperature the hue 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.329
 the exhibition the neo- light contrast 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.850
 we put clarity saturation and 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.100
 adapt it to the noise look at this 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.170
 episode so the episode on so the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.790
 localized retouching there are about 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.950
 same things ie you see here 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.080
 when we create one there is a pin 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.450
 pin you can here the posted 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.159
 always selected ever she is in 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.950
 auto I could you have the shortcut 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.420
 keyboard h that lets you do them 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.830
 appear or make it disappear 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.750
 when you click for the first time 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.270
 you define where it will act 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.710
 at 100% it take off your click what you 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.740
 doing a click and drag you 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.510
 set a place where you know at 0% 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.220
 and you see that it turns on 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.040
 from the place of the first place 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.250
 ok you clicked the further you go away 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.540
 the more the degrade will be huge will be long 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.380
 so it will be less visible 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.000
 I loose and you see here we go by 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.830
 night pin that we can move that we 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.810
 can also reduce by coming back on a 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.909
 edges to be able to click 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.430
 to increase it or not and you can 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.930
 so the trick is not to avoid the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.310
 take right next to the pinned this 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.299
 what does it mean that revolves around 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.120
 spain 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.129
 take it away on the middle focus and there 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.599
 you can turn it around more easily 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.459
 I will show you some small 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.170
 tips for parents to change the 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.890
 light so imagine this picture I 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.990
 am going to 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.430
 I met said here is this picture I 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.350
 just call it black and white black and 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.190
 white not beautiful that I just came 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:41.770
 contrast is a little bit there hop fast 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.120
 do we have here in black and white that there is 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.640
 a little bit more correct but who is 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.380
 not very very good either so there we 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.959
 let's celebrate the light for the light 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.390
 in fact comes from there the sun was 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.650
 by that and I'm going to accentuate it 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.910
 since I'm going to do it is that here I 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.410
 want it to be darker so I 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.820
 just click slide I can go down 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.600
 my show I do the same here and 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.370
 when I told you that it could be 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.930
 coupled with a new lightroom tool 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.430
 that adjusts super convenient is the tool 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.260
 who's next to who's the filter 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.510
 radial which is exactly in fact the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.150
 same thing except that instead of acting on a 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.540
 gradient in length will act on a 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.320
 gradient in radial that is to say I do 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.700
 a round I'm doing a round I'm going down my 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.810
 exposure and you see that 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.300
 the exhibition is removed outside so 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.250
 the 100% are outside the circle unless 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.260
 you click here on invert the mask 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.340
 where that just anvers the mask and you 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.400
 can play on your contour 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.019
 progressive here yes we have when we 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.209
 progressive which is more progressive so 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.430
 more fun he sees a lot less 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.470
 more and progressive - it shows me there 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.070
 can couple it with since in fact I 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.040
 can also come and turn it then 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.400
 yes something so this tool is there you 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.920
 to be able to isolate your subject 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.420
 in your image 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.860
 it's super convenient it works very very 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.560
 well I am used I used it 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.100
 a lot now except that it's like 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.670
 intensive vignetting does not make 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.230
 too much 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.049
 that's all I'm asking you about 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.329
 do not do too much if it shows you it's not 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.410
 good it must remain my visible 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.359
 that's all I ask you he 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.549
 just have to remain invisible there 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.419
 for example if I gathered cialis in fact 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:25.360
 my graduated filter and that I'm going back here 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.640
 in my radial filter you see that here 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.280
 if I do that it shows because in 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.650
 did we lose all the black but by 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.630
 against if I put them just a little 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.450
 like that 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.330
 it's hardly seen in fact 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.130
 see up before after necessarily with the 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.780
 after we see it but that's it 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.670
 could seem plausible in fact so 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.810
 it works for me anyway you 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.490
 so what is the light 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.080
 also with this graduated filter I'm going 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.880
 show you how 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.690
 reset so we said that the 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.770
 light came from above 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.470
 and if we want the light come 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.030
 from here, well, yes, because 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.460
 you do here and there you go down 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.760
 your exhibition thoroughly it's all 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.470
 well placed in the right place 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.150
 on the other side you come to put your 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.010
 exhibition a little higher 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.600
 so you can also put a 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.940
 other here and in three clicks in case of 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.710
 click I suddenly made believe that the 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.120
 light came from the other side it works 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.410
 obviously not quite because the 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.940
 light does not come so the zombies 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.100
 are not really very good 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.210
 place but it can work that you 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.530
 gives a little idea that it can hurt 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.630
 how can it work you have 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.210
 also the cost of access to 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.040
 precepts here and you have plenty of price 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.860
 this is where you can suddenly change 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.330
 that will allow you to be able to 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.860
 change some things so I you 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.710
 let play with you can blow 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.450
 sure a color picture changes and the 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.950
 white balance for example on a 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.200
 place it's great owl hard 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.910
 initialize and I come for example 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.270
 change here the white balance I the 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.350
 want a little stronger here a little bit more 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.490
 hot here is for example a little bit more 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.200
 cold here the story of making a moment 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.060
 and you see we have a picture and colorful 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.890
 who exchange a last little trick 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.200
 and I'll let you do a new one 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.820
 game is initialized you see here this is 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.530
 a net but I would like it to be more 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.210
 crazy it's a little crazy already but 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.740
 I would like you to be more blurred 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.080
 can add some blur like that in 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.000
 playing on the sharpness 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.830
 see this part there that was just a 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.510
 little bit naji zoom in on 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.510
 the zoom here and you see the before after 

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:28.099
 we have a blur that is pretty good 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.120
 obviously do not overdo it I'm coming back 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.069
 on what I said in the bad 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.779
 practices do not abuse the less you 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:34.639
 abuse it better pass the filter 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:36.199
 graduated will really allow you to 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.169
 work your photos on lightroom 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:41.120
 quite easily and without too much 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.499
 difficulties and I tell you so at the 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:53.059
 next week for a new episode 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:55.189
 without a mustache or no no it's really 

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:58.339
 no cool mount sees that I stop a 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:07:02.599
 little bit maybe I stop I know 

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:07.749
 not yeah ok ok for next time 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:07.749
 I cut it have not
