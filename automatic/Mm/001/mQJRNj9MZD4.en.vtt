00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
okay it's not a trial version I had mine

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.690 
okay it's not a trial version I had mine
for<00:01:40.869> about<00:01:41.200> 4<00:01:41.560> years<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.979> it<00:01:42.220> still<00:01:42.460> hasn't

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
for about 4 years and it still hasn't

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.430 
for about 4 years and it still hasn't
let<00:01:43.690> up<00:01:43.810> on<00:01:43.960> me<00:01:44.080> so<00:01:45.539> this<00:01:46.539> is<00:01:46.600> still<00:01:46.960> step<00:01:47.200> one

you<00:01:47.860> got<00:01:48.039> to<00:01:48.190> figure<00:01:48.520> out<00:01:48.789> which<00:01:49.090> bit<00:01:49.899> type<00:01:50.200> you

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
you got to figure out which bit type you

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.310 
you got to figure out which bit type you
have<00:01:50.590> or<00:01:50.860> archetype<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:52.270> one<00:01:52.899> way<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.080> find
