00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.760
 and with the health of markets and believers to Lohan and Felipe Herrera but we are 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.260
 Seeing that week ago we had done an opening account management 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.419
 with 200 dollars of a real account 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:16.550
 let's look 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.320
 in a week 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.500
 that attitude how much performance could have generated us 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.950
 and what were the benefits with yesterday's we make a report 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.810
 we looked at it and as I mentioned to you is what they ask the most is that if one 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.109
 You can really get it out 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.850
 returns to the market or if only a lot of people entering the market are a myth 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.280
 it only enters through an advertisement on the internet but does not even know what it is 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.430
 a candle does not know what is technical analysis 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.240
 velasquez fundamental analysis does not know what it is 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.600
 some interest rates like 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.250
 how interest rates affect the world economy then many 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.829
 Sometimes it is difficult 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.829
 have yields you do not have with the minimum knowledge 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.139
 she who failed us initial deposit of 200 dollars 

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:59.879
 then we see how 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.719
 orders have been opened 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.719
 based on technical analysis and fundamental analysis 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.460
 and here toads like all the reporter that keep working 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.680
 gains and losses solved spend the day yesterday 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.610
 - that 100% winner what I know how to do these operations 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.430
 winners are way above 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.250
 of the floating losers in functions 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.340
 in pits 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.430
 well he had that report as in everything there is love opening or the account with 200 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.240
 Dollars 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.930
 pakistan the day before yesterday we make the report 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.930
 and to this day we have in Cunene closed 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.840
 total 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.900
 like oscar subtraction that well of one thousand 82 dollars are the 72 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.890
 d of operations and I think $ 10 that he noticed the broker for opening a 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.650
 account 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.950
 I remain in that before gains and losses still and open laces 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.539
 Canaanite own four for $ 77 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.009
 in liquid value of $ 559 annual dollars to what we are 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.720
 to June 14 then we have a week of operation we have seven days 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:05.530
 we use the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.709
 Monday of the previous week if we are in the report 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.759
 today, Monday, June 14, 2010 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.889
 in the question also a lot for our system 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.839
 of work in our system this one of the terms nor in the miners 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.139
 and workshops 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.180
 more than anything 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.180
 we rely on the part of generating learning modules 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.089
 per cent you see on the internet what country many courses resources 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:34.649
 that when ura run day or two days and impersonal patrons put 150 people 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.620
 I do not know how feasible it is that they do not waver 3 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.029
 to a course of 100 of 120 people 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.810
 learn aop the market isaura taking efficiency 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.249
 possibly comes out knowing that there is a market where you can invest 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:52.059
 Well, since of investments I understood currencies in shares in other assets 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.150
 but really 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.370
 the possibility 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.120
 d mere yields can be known may not know why so the pce 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.080
 the percentage of people who call to have one in a seminar of 100 people 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.450
 there are other seminars that last one month two months three months 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:08.979
 in excesses not a schedule 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.279
 two hours three hours daily 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:15.109
 seminars are interesting you learn a lot and a lot of information 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.379
 but there are accounts in the university go five years but because although 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.549
 five years to go out to have the best position or satan to crawl 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:24.779
 for a lot of money 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.219
 more than everything depends on your ability 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:28.459
 what do you start 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.910
 to show results 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.989
 then this maestrelli with its system of seminar workshops 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.610
 is based on a weekend weekend or are proposed to carry out in 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:38.870
 week attending 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.990
 the people who attend many do not put weekend then try to 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.349
 accommodate schedules 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.109
 nicholas of the weekend 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.899
 they wonder why not even market is open 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:52.179
 is the work module do not need an open market to learn to analyze 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:52.900
 the market 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.179
 learn to analyze 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:58.559
 just enter that they looked at a graph I would be able to analyze if 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:00.080
 You can upload if you can download 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.199
 it depends on a technical analysis and a fundamental analysis 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.330
 there are many races dictates seminars not all in which the capabilities 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.679
 between what we do that is to try to develop those capabilities 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:14.470
 because why if one blackout still workshop a seminar 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.429
 service 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:18.909
 postpone something between seven and a half the morning and 9 and a half 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.629
 many of those people take a vacation 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:24.150
 osaka a certain time prot 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.240
 a job already when they see their work 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.530
 it can not continue operating between its schedules 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.850
 then what they learned from how the good American session works 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.909
 illes a wind 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:34.750
 so 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.400
 Elmer coast constantly changing and you have to be percent 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.020
 ee uu lucena 130 then 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.150
 was sergio neave duret two three months but when you go out you go to look at the 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.140
 market change those three months and almost that what apprentices no longer works 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.520
 that's why the system is working modules 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.770
 where we see some special features 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.410
 d of what capital markets do like their current 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.069
 today that the supply and demand is based and how can you move 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.389
 the market, either up or down, is a long-term benefit 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.819
 the short 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.070
 Here we show modules 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.779
 in very simple 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:16.069
 and very common is what it is 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.669
 everyone knows 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.839
 what we do the metal a little 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:22.710
 d knowledge or experience 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.199
 because you search on the internet you can find 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.199
 my courses do not exist and comic in fundamental analysis 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.610
 then it is also based a little on what has been our experience 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.680
 and how to generate a return that you a 200 dollar account 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.870
 muti the minister 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.130
 for a week you can achieve my maybe that moment or a liquid value 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.310
 of 1500 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.590
 62 dollars an interesting data for one for a week of 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.580
 of work 10 30 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.659
 as I say 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.339
 who invited them to visit triplo dot markets and keirin dotcom 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:58.639
 so that they know our system of work so much in singles as in 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.119
 workshops and conferences 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:04.160
 and so that before the form among others we try to do our 30 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.409
 it is seen the intra-day scavenger of the medium term 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.539
 we must also look at where we are capable and the best country in the world 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.699
 based on our capital and our psychological level as well 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:17.060
 that we can work 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.389
 entel envidos invited itatÃ­ but dot markets and pekin puntocom 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.189
 percent to register for the free courses 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:28.559
 to register talents sticks workshops and conferences that is a payment 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.980
 percent 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.490
 are costs really benefits 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.900
 the cole said normally they are seminars 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.250
 between the competitions etc 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.699
 after twenty people 30 people 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:42.570
 there are similar that are almost 100 people out of 120 I do not know how possible 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.260
 To manage 20 30 people and everyone to go 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.999
 to have benefits 

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:51.279
 that's why we give body kasper hides zones between five and ten in in 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.839
 bones 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.819
 seminars and workshops 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:57.110
 Florentine seminar at the moment in the market of 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.490
 d derivatives are spoken that 75 percent opposition on issues 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.899
 are operators that enter losing in the market then 

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:07.319
 small groups to get out 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.879
 attracts the possibility of being a professional workshop and a trailer that is 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:11.580
 winning 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.600
 distorm rescue these markets 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.309
 then remember mixed temple point markets and dotcom technicians 

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:20.680
 laughs of the oscos or theaters that to be pending 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.110
 the mic of seminar workshops conferences that we can dictate those that 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.930
 you can attend 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.770
 either in a virtual way in person 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.129
 ducks a happy day kim a good stretch
