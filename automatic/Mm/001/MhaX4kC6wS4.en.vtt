i'd have to say mayweather cuz he's done

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.670 
i'd have to say mayweather cuz he's done
it<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:20.970> many<00:00:21.000> times<00:00:21.119> before<00:00:21.449> i<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.500> i<00:00:22.650> think

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
it so many times before i just i think

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.380 
it so many times before i just i think
he's<00:00:22.980> got<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.220> run<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.850> think<00:00:23.939> he's<00:00:24.119> an<00:00:24.240> out

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
he's got to run and I think he's an out

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.970 
he's got to run and I think he's an out
point<00:00:24.660> him<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.080> think<00:00:25.140> he<00:00:25.529> might<00:00:25.650> even<00:00:25.800> get

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
point him and I think he might even get

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.150 
point him and I think he might even get
a<00:00:27.230> controversial<00:00:28.230> decision<00:00:28.470> from<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> judges

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
a controversial decision from the judges

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.529 
a controversial decision from the judges
but<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.490> think<00:00:29.670> Mayweather<00:00:29.820> win<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
but I think Mayweather win it on the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.939 
but I think Mayweather win it on the
cards<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:30.960> 12<00:00:31.170> him<00:00:31.349> though<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> hate<00:00:31.740> saying

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949
