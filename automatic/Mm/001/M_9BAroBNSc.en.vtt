00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.400
 from news.de and I have one here 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.710
 sandwich microcar from tobi rich 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.529
 remote-controlled vehicle that little 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.430
 you can control with your iphone and 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.199
 Let's take a look 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.910
 a little closer 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.400
 the whole thing works with the ipod 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.380
 iphone or ipad and then we need 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.519
 only the app available for free and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.590
 already we can start 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.360
 I 've got something with me 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.149
 we will have it here 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.530
 small car really nice small then 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.930
 we have a USB cable here too 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.910
 micro-usb the car always has to 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.190
 be charged and we have here 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.180
 a few more hats with these little hats 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.809
 Then we can just do ours 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.449
 staking off the race track 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.530
 with which we drive by car 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.239
 Let's have a look at the car 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.530
 back here the usb port to charge 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.690
 in front there are even the lights 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.890
 The car does not work honking too 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.570
 I'll show you all the features 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.659
 then if we do it with the iphone 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.860
 connected to the micro cards 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.350
 you need to use the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.939
 free apps e mails the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.460
 is easy in the app store 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.040
 Download and then you can yours 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.450
 bind micro forces and get started and to 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.259
 of course you have to connect it first 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.210
 turn it on 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.520
 on the back we have a lot here 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.320
 power button is just in the blood 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.890
 then search for the menu and then you 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.840
 connect 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.070
 after we have connected we can 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.810
 then start with the app right now 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.650
 You see, this works is wonderful 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.750
 let's go 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.500
 you still have those up here too 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.500
 possibility to blink 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.040
 they can also be groups and we have them 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.100
 that's cool, but how do you see it? 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.790
 only underground in the dark 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.649
 Lighting is not so good now 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.240
 see this evening very cool to 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.570
 blink and catch a little bit 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.570
 Come on 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.490
 that really very funny and good though 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.690
 I'm not such a bad driver who will 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.040
 it also look very cool 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.840
 you have to be a little bit 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:29.080
 get used to it but then it works 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.760
 also and makes a lot of fun there 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.450
 also different possibilities too 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.180
 control 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.730
 with the app that was now the standard 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.520
 Cockpit you can easily by means 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.520
 control the gyroscope of the vehicle 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.830
 that is in my opinion even 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.950
 still a little getting used to 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.790
 as with the other control what me 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:01.840
 like it here 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:06.720
 the twin joystick control should use it 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.720
 especially know about consoles freaks 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:17.230
 almost flown from the edge of the table and you 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.040
 you see racetruck has staked out for 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.530
 this video 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.420
 it's been destroyed but it has 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.320

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.840

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.170

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.190

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.530
