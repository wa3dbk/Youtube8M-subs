probably not going to cost that much to
be<00:03:59.180> fair<00:03:59.389> it's<00:03:59.569> probably<00:03:59.810> going<00:03:59.930> to<00:03:59.989> be<00:04:00.049> quite

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
be fair it's probably going to be quite

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.680 
be fair it's probably going to be quite
cheap<00:04:00.739> for<00:04:01.669> the<00:04:01.730> majority<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.269> stuff<00:04:02.540> that

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690
