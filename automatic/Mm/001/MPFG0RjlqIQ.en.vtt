for<00:01:52.470> them<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.619> cook<00:01:52.829> properly<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.720> this<00:01:54.720> is

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
for them to cook properly and this is

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.899 
for them to cook properly and this is
the<00:01:55.020> cheats<00:01:55.259> version<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.130> were<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.759> do

the cheats version so if you were to do

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.670 
the cheats version so if you were to do
it<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.240> cold<00:01:57.570> water<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.200> would<00:01:58.350> need<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
it with cold water you would need the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.819 
it with cold water you would need the
entire<00:01:58.920> evening<00:01:59.369> because<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.079> put<00:02:01.079> boiling<00:02:01.409> hot

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829

entire evening because I put boiling hot
water<00:02:01.890> over<00:02:02.250> them<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.810> makes<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.020> quick<00:02:04.229> and

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
water over them that makes it quick and

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:04.880 
water over them that makes it quick and
easy

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
easy

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.980

nutrient absorption you actually do need

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.950

digestive<00:02:23.750> upset<00:02:24.850> so<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.180> might<00:02:26.330> sound<00:02:26.510> like

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
digestive upset so that might sound like

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.390 
digestive upset so that might sound like
the<00:02:26.870> super<00:02:27.170> long<00:02:27.320> period<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:27.860> time<00:02:28.010> however

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
the super long period of time however

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.620 
the super long period of time however
you<00:02:28.580> can<00:02:28.790> do<00:02:28.880> this<00:02:29.030> in<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.240> morning<00:02:29.480> before

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
you can do this in the morning before

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.330 
you can do this in the morning before
you<00:02:29.840> head<00:02:29.960> out<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.110> work<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.950> can<00:02:31.100> do<00:02:31.190> this

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
you head out to work you can do this

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.150 
you head out to work you can do this
before<00:02:31.760> bed<00:02:32.380> soaks<00:02:33.380> overnight<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.010> there's

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
before bed soaks overnight so there's

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.880 
before bed soaks overnight so there's
really<00:02:34.310> not<00:02:34.520> any<00:02:34.790> super<00:02:35.720> hands-on<00:02:36.320> like<00:02:36.710> that

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
long it's been in this package if you're

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.820 
long it's been in this package if you're
doing<00:03:44.840> chickpeas

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
doing chickpeas

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.970 
doing chickpeas
I<00:03:45.860> recommend<00:03:46.700> doubling<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.720> amount<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:48.140> acid

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
I recommend doubling the amount of acid

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.070 
I recommend doubling the amount of acid
so<00:03:49.160> if<00:03:49.280> you're<00:03:49.460> doing<00:03:49.550> 1<00:03:50.390> cup<00:03:50.690> of<00:03:50.720> chickpeas

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
so if you're doing 1 cup of chickpeas

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.010 
so if you're doing 1 cup of chickpeas
it'll<00:03:51.500> take<00:03:51.650> 2<00:03:51.980> tablespoons<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:53.120> acid<00:03:53.840> and

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
it'll take 2 tablespoons of acid and

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.380 
it'll take 2 tablespoons of acid and
that's<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.740> is<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.010> easy<00:03:55.580> if<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:56.060> want<00:03:56.270> you

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
that's it is that easy if you want you

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.700 
that's it is that easy if you want you
can<00:03:56.540> actually<00:03:56.720> add<00:03:56.990> a<00:03:57.020> little<00:03:57.290> pinch<00:03:57.500> of

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
can actually add a little pinch of

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.560 
can actually add a little pinch of
baking<00:03:57.830> soda<00:03:58.160> to<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.550> water<00:03:58.820> while<00:03:59.540> it's

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
baking soda to the water while it's

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.080 
baking soda to the water while it's
cooking<00:03:59.990> but<00:04:00.380> you<00:04:00.650> know<00:04:00.950> that's<00:04:01.070> optional<00:04:01.730> so
