it for you looking at the curve I still

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.010 
it for you looking at the curve I still

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.289 
think it's a great feature it helps
reduce<00:01:55.289> glare<00:01:55.709> and<00:01:56.039> I<00:01:56.490> think<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.849> makes<00:01:56.999> a

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
reduce glare and I think it makes a

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.209 
reduce glare and I think it makes a
