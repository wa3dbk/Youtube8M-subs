00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.340 
and the reason why you want sharpies
you're<00:02:11.990> gonna<00:02:12.230> be<00:02:12.410> using<00:02:12.620> these<00:02:13.210> to<00:02:14.210> like<00:02:14.930> draw

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
you're gonna be using these to like draw

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.580 
you're gonna be using these to like draw
the<00:02:15.410> outlines<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.190> these<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.780> then<00:02:18.110> go<00:02:18.440> in

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
the outlines of these and then go in

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.310 
the outlines of these and then go in
with<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.890> fabric<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.459> then<00:02:19.760> cover<00:02:20.060> it

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
with the fabric and then cover it

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.449 
with the fabric and then cover it
basically<00:02:21.320> you're<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:21.650> using<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.400> for

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
basically you're just using this for

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.660 
basically you're just using this for
like<00:02:22.970> outlines<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:23.990> so<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:24.950> can<00:02:25.160> know<00:02:25.340> where

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
like outlines and so you can know where

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:49.810 
like outlines and so you can know where
your<00:02:26.240> stuff<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:27.170> your<00:02:27.320> travel<00:02:27.740> go<00:02:48.820> so

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
your stuff and your travel go so

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.510 
your stuff and your travel go so
basically<00:02:50.330> now<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.690> start<00:02:51.370> doing<00:02:52.370> your

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
basically now you start doing your

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.820 
basically now you start doing your
design<00:02:52.910> in<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.239> outlines<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:54.170> so<00:02:54.530> then<00:02:54.709> you

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
design in the outlines of it so then you

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.820 
design in the outlines of it so then you
can<00:02:55.010> fill<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.610> with<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:56.000> fabric<00:02:56.420> paint<00:02:56.830> you

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
can fill it in with the fabric paint you

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.380 
can fill it in with the fabric paint you
could<00:02:58.010> also<00:02:58.870> do<00:02:59.870> all<00:03:00.290> your<00:03:00.760> patterns<00:03:01.760> on<00:03:02.060> and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
could also do all your patterns on and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.810 
could also do all your patterns on and
then<00:03:02.660> sell<00:03:02.989> them<00:03:03.080> in<00:03:03.260> or<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:04.220> can<00:03:04.430> fill<00:03:04.610> them

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
then sell them in or you can fill them

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.000 
then sell them in or you can fill them
in<00:03:04.970> as<00:03:05.239> you<00:03:05.269> go<00:03:05.570> it<00:03:05.780> all<00:03:05.870> depends<00:03:06.320> on<00:03:06.410> how<00:03:06.980> you

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
in as you go it all depends on how you

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.190 
in as you go it all depends on how you
want<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.610> did<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.269> way<00:03:08.330> so<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.870> could

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
want so I did it this way so it could

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:53.420 
want so I did it this way so it could
dry<00:03:09.380> faster

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:17.720
