00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.680
 very rounded drink is present 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.420
 natural sweetness also I feel 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.600
 easy cookies such Lenko 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.399
 carbonated with a light drink but it 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.449
 apparently comes off only from freshness 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.930
 roasting him yet 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:38.670
 a day or two and it all goes away very good 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.649
 harmonious drink with nut 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.989
 aftertaste try drink sugar i 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.329
 immediately a little tricks took advantage 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.910
 Immediately put a piece of sugar in the cup and 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.770
 there pro was extracted from the press and so not 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.870
 it seems he will quickly dissolve will give 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.559
 more interesting dense flavor on the ground 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.239
 the place is very strong sweetness for me 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.100
 a little bit unnecessarily a little less 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.810
 sugar put in general this coffee 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.380
 evened out became ordinary coffee for 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.469
 ordinary consumer 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.650
 I'll put four with a small minus for 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:16.420
 pure coffee and hard sugar 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.180
 dense saturated with chocolate 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.780
 shades pleasant stress this is my 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.850
 stress I put this mouse just 5 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.550
 sugar is very nice and balanced 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.460
 taste but I liked more sugar free 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.310
 sugar free chocolate felt more 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.440
 notes and sugar appear fruit 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.650
 acidity so my score is 4 with 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.650
 by half 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.910
 very nicely activated everything 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.110
 the receptors are quite powerful sourness I would 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.350
 told me not to like that 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.240
 utorrent bitterness here I would say that 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.660
 a little bit of it for me a lot I would like 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.280
 so that it was a little less sugar painting 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.290
 aligned it turns out pretty 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.660
 balanced picture is not like this 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.760
 option Honduras quite like it very much 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.990
 and did not become that it is the perfect espresso 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.390
 for me I would like a little more 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.180
 floral notes but quite 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:18.660
 i set sugar free mind race 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.660
 three plus sugar 4 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.650
 said some dark chocolate 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:27.819
 nutty very dense but rich 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.189
 strong bitterness for me such a demand and 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.599
 somewhere around 4 with a minus because i don't 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.599
 I like when you speak online 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.260
 Sahara 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.970
 sugar, I'm sure it will be better because sugar 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.970
 removes talk 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.890
 yes and there is bitterness gone he became more 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.430
 round more balanced more 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.780
 chocolate is at 4 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.060
 but this is not my coffee though if you want 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.530
 simple classic coffee great 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.530
 choice honduras 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.390
 he
