00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
like a normal mode but it just it just

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.529 
like a normal mode but it just it just
tweaks<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.399> thinks<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:57.270> P

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539
