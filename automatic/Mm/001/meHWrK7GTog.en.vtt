00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.670
 the expectation is that we have more 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.250
 cold fronts 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.559
 in the next two weeks 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.049
 advancing to the south of Brazil and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.539
 arriving to the southeast region 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.820
 then in southern Brazil the next to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.320
 cold front should already start to bring 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.869
 changes in time 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.359
 on Monday and this cold front will 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.740
 then help form rain areas of 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.170
 strong intensity 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.719
 The south of Brazil then passes an end to 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.850
 week with a relatively dry time 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.610
 but already the expectation then of more rain 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.070
 for Monday and that right front 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.559
 then it will also advance to the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.710
 southeast region so I already have a 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.110
 cold front coming to rio de janeiro and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.930
 would have another cold front in the week 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.539
 which also comes to the river 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.370
 so with this I will keep these areas 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.760
 of instability will maintain the conditions 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.059
 for rain in the southeast region now notice 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.979
 that the rain areas the volumes of 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.950
 bigger rain né 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.140
 are actually planned for areas in the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.060
 debt of São Paulo mines and Rio de 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.060
 January for the state of são paulo 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.670
 south and west of mines does not have the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.100
 rain for the holy spirit and the north of 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.830
 mines very little rain in these areas 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.409
 another thing we have there important 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.810
 the maintenance of these large areas of 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.220
 instability on the north center of the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 Brazil 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.900
 This has to do with this whole 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.909
 movement of winds over Brazil 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.869
 these cold fronts are not 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.750
 this humidity channel is organized 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.680
 between the north of Brazil and the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.600
 southeast 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.810
 so we have two more ahead of us 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.360
 weeks where these rain showers 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.909
 these areas of rain will be frequent 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.619
 still on top of mato grosso mato grosso 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.810
 South of Brasilia 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.049
 is from the entire northern region and a rainfall 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.719
 often voluminous and 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.750
 this will then leave the large 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.910
 accumulated there are more than 100 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.940
 millimeters from 100 to 200 millimeters 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.710
 accumulated in practically the whole 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.650
 amazon para 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.640
 It's even more rain for Rondônia and 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.730
 also acre 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.440
 note that more rain for the tocantins and 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.360
 It is also interesting to note that 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.280
 Northeast looks just right. 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.290
 we will also have an increase in 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.110
 instability and the convergence zone 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.750
 increasing the conditions of 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.090
 rainforest to maranhão to piauí and also 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.520
 for the ceará, then there are the three states 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.280
 which will be privileged with the rain 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.800
 in the next 15 days that does 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.110
 feeling right because so at that time by 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.900
 example the one who gives it rains very little in 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.060
 east coast the rain really tends to 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.610
 concentrate but here calling me to 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.830
 attention to this increase in the 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.810
 that occur in the southern region of 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.270
 Brazil from Monday 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.730
 we are going to have the after rain events 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.730
 and several areas in southern Brazil 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.170
 can re-accumulate the image of 100 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.540
 millimeters of rain 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.540
 already starting next monday
