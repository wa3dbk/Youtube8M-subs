a<00:00:00.060> political<00:00:00.810> office<00:00:01.230> why<00:00:01.500> do<00:00:01.560> you<00:00:02.100> take<00:00:02.429> the

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
a political office why do you take the

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.170 
a political office why do you take the
measure<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.240> his<00:00:04.080> business<00:00:04.620> experience<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.879> do

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
measure of his business experience I do

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.500 
measure of his business experience I do
not<00:00:06.509> think<00:00:06.569> at<00:00:07.020> all<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.410> disqualifies<00:00:07.770> him<00:00:08.510> but

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
not think at all it disqualifies him but

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.169 
not think at all it disqualifies him but
I<00:00:09.750> also<00:00:10.050> think<00:00:10.410> it's<00:00:10.650> important<00:00:11.190> if<00:00:11.759> that's

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
I also think it's important if that's

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.099 
I also think it's important if that's
his<00:00:12.450> main<00:00:12.660> calling<00:00:13.200> card<00:00:14.179> if<00:00:15.179> his<00:00:15.630> basic

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
his main calling card if his basic

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.970 
his main calling card if his basic
premise<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.449> I'm<00:00:18.449> mr.<00:00:19.170> Fixit<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
premise is that I'm mr. Fixit on the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800 
premise is that I'm mr. Fixit on the
economy<00:00:20.279> because<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.000> made<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> lot<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.539> money

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
economy because I made a lot of money

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.990 
economy because I made a lot of money
but<00:00:22.680> did<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.890> know<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.160> he<00:00:23.220> seemed<00:00:23.460> well<00:00:23.730> no

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
but did I know what he seemed well no

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.730 
but did I know what he seemed well no
that<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.510> some<00:00:24.869> degree<00:00:24.990> what<00:00:25.439> he<00:00:25.560> what<00:00:25.710> he

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
that is to some degree what he what he

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.920 
that is to some degree what he what he
says<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.279> he<00:00:26.460> understands<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> economy<00:00:27.810> and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
says is he understands the economy and

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.240 
says is he understands the economy and
the<00:00:27.990> private<00:00:28.349> sector<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.830> they<00:00:29.039> built

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the private sector and they built

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.970 
the private sector and they built
businesses<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:30.000> they<00:00:30.090> got<00:00:30.740> better<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
businesses and they got better and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.709 
businesses and they got better and
that's<00:00:32.130> invested<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.850> made<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.059> exactly<00:00:33.180> so

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
that's invested in made it exactly so

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.170 
that's invested in made it exactly so
that's<00:00:34.260> his<00:00:34.559> premise<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.130> think<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.149> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that's his premise I think it is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.880 
that's his premise I think it is
entirely<00:00:36.570> appropriate<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.260> look<00:00:37.530> at<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
entirely appropriate to look at that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.110 
entirely appropriate to look at that
record<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:40.020> whether<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.920> fact<00:00:40.950> his<00:00:41.820> focus

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
record and see whether in fact his focus

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.500 
record and see whether in fact his focus
was<00:00:42.329> creating<00:00:42.870> jobs<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:44.160> he<00:00:44.969> successfully

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
was creating jobs and he successfully

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.000 
was creating jobs and he successfully
did<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.050> when<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.260> look<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> record

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
did that and when you look at the record

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.529 
did that and when you look at the record
their<00:00:47.370> questions<00:00:47.850> there<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> be

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
their questions there that have to be

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.240 
their questions there that have to be
asked<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:50.129> well<00:00:51.260> look<00:00:52.260> you

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
asked like and like what well look you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.389 
asked like and like what well look you
know<00:00:53.750> as<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.899> said<00:00:54.930> when<00:00:55.860> some<00:00:56.129> people

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
know as I said when some people

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.819 
know as I said when some people
questioned<00:00:56.789> why<00:00:56.969> i<00:00:57.000> would<00:00:57.500> challenge<00:00:58.500> his

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
questioned why i would challenge his

jobs have been out sourced and so it is

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
jobs have been out sourced and so it is
not<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.670> he<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.540> disqualified<00:01:39.960> because<00:01:40.560> of

what he's done it is if that's your main

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.469 
what he's done it is if that's your main
claim<00:01:43.610> since<00:01:44.610> he<00:01:44.700> doesn't<00:01:44.970> talk<00:01:45.060> about<00:01:45.119> the

for four years very much and Iran Nealon
then<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.670> want<00:01:51.500> us<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.740> make<00:01:53.310> sure<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:54.290> we<00:01:55.290> know

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
then I want us to make sure that we know

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.709 
then I want us to make sure that we know
