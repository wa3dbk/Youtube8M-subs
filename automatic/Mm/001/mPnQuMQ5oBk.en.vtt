sea level and you can actually see just

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.840 
sea level and you can actually see just
in<00:00:52.350> front<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.770> us<00:00:52.890> were<00:00:53.130> about<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.640> walk

seepage coming through enormous and
meters<00:01:03.330> of<00:01:03.660> stone<00:01:05.299> and<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.479> that

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
meters of stone and it's that

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.590 
meters of stone and it's that
combination<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.909> you<00:01:08.909> know<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> thick<00:01:09.360> walls

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
which keep the temperature constant

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.130 
which keep the temperature constant
throughout<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> year<00:01:14.400> followed<00:01:14.970> between
