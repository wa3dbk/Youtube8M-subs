00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.190
 in the apocalypse chapter 13 versus a 10 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.349
 we learn about the beast that rises from the sea 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.110
 now from verse 11 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.000
 we see another power another beast 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.360
 but rising from the earth 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.180
 Who is this beast in the prophecy? 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.810
 means people multitudes nations languages 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.150
 What does this beast mean? 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.059
 rises from the earth it rises to support the 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.210
 first beast whose deadly wound had 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.519
 been healed who is this power and what 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.820
 he will do on the religious stage in time 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.820
 of the end 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.409
 Hello friends 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:29.319
 welcome to study again 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.659
 from the book of the apocalypse 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:36.049
 in our last study we learned that the 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.770
 beast that rises from the sea is in rome 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.590
 its two imperial and papal phases 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.209
 today we are going to study the beast that rises from the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.359
 Earth 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:50.240
 if the sea in the bible means people 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:52.959
 nations multitudes and tongues to land by 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.479
 other side will mean a location 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:59.689
 depopulated here in Chapter 13 of 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.329
 apocalypse from the 11th verse I read 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.140
 about this second power so says the 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:09.259
 bible saw yet another beast emerged 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.459
 had two horns looking like 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.250
 lamb spoke more like the dragon is 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.750
 Beast has two horns and it emerges 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.090
 from the earth 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.430
 we identify this power in prophecy 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.220
 like the united states of america 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.799
 the United States were 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.599
 organized finally conquered 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.790
 its independence in the year 1776 came 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.400
 as a nation on the spot that was once 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.190
 depopulated do you remember john 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.980
 robinson who led the pilgrim parents 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.500
 on board the ship half flower and says 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.099
 across the Atlantic Ocean until they 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.239
 in 1620 on the beaches of the North Continent 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.549
 American 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.590
 because it was this depopulated place that 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.840
 this great power was born 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.480
 preaching civil liberty and freedom 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.290
 religion represented by these two 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.630
 horns 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.500
 they intended to establish a state 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.230
 no king and a church without a pope 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.870
 so this power of chapter 13 verse 11 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.419
 will play an important role in 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.030
 final scenes of the history of this world 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:21.200
 accompany me in Chapter 13 now 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.389
 verse 14 to seduce those who dwell 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.709
 on the ground because of the signs that 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.329
 was given to perform before the beast 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.390
 saying to them that dwell on the earth 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:36.950
 to make an image to the beast that which 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.050
 sword wound survived which will be 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.610
 this image will be made the first 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.970
 view will undoubtedly honor some 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.410
 creation of the first beast 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.800
 when we look at history we 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.680
 we realize that the papal system has changed 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.590
 the sanctity of the fourth commandment of the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.709
 Saturday for the first day of the week 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.319
 what the united states will do precisely 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.840
 will be to bring the inhabitants of the 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.870
 go to sanctify the first day of 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.730
 This week we call in prophecy the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.970
 Sunday law 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.790
 right here in Chapter 13 presents a 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.579
 decree that will reach all 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.919
 inhabitants of the land law with the medium with the 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:26.450
 attention that is written in the apocalypse 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:28.790
 chapter 13 verse 16 to all 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.120
 the big the rich and the poor 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.100
 the books and the slaves makes them 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.500
 be given a certain mark on the hand 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.900
 right on the forehead so that no one 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.660
 may buy or sell other than the one 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.990
 Has the mark the name of the beast or the number 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.790
 of your name 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.120
 the time of trial will arrive for the faithful 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.000
 people of God a brand will be given to a 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.910
 type of identification will be granted to 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.850
 all people who accept Sunday 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.490
 as a day of custody and you know what's going on. 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.410
 we will not be able to buy and 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.460
 nor sell unless we have this 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.830
 brand 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.229
 This will be the difficult time for 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.260
 God's people but his promise to 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:15.890
 it is we who will give our bread and the 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.760
 waters will be certain, ie the states 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.729
 United 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.010
 this second power of apocalypse 13 goes 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.830
 give strength to the papacy and we will 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.690
 experience coercion with that 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.600
 experienced in the middle ages 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.240
 the decree will be made looking for 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.030
 restricting religious freedom and 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.979
 taking all the inhabitants of the earth 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.460
 Worship God on the first day of the week. 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.430
 but this action that is already prophesied 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.200
 is in opposition to the truth taught in 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.140
 God's word, that's why you are 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.960
 we must be secure and firm in this 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.340
 and knowing that the law of God is 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.440
 in effect and needs to be observed 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.990
 before this panorama of chapter 13 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.990
 we understand that these two powers 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.810
 they will unite against the sincere and faithful 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.540
 God's people but you and me 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.880
 we have nothing to fear because God 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.330
 will be on our side and as the 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.330
 psalmist thou shalt fall by thy side ten thousand 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.420
 your right and you will not be hit 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.820
 you do not like today's a time 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.150
 We still have religious freedom. 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.900
 under the cover of the almighty 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.350
 if this is your wish look with me now 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.630
 dad 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.030
 Thank you for the assurance we have in your 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.400
 word that you always go 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.980
 take care of us when we saw these 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.980
 ecumenical movements that will be against 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.310
 thy law against thy truth is that we 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.770
 we have the power of the high heavens for us 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:52.770
 position next to your word is the 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:55.370
 our prayer in name for love of jesus 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.370
 amen
