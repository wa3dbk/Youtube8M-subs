my<00:00:04.480> dissertation<00:00:04.690> is<00:00:05.609> investigating<00:00:06.609> the

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:06.729 
my dissertation is investigating the

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.390 
my dissertation is investigating the
effects<00:00:07.029> of<00:00:07.240> music<00:00:07.660> in<00:00:08.440> the<00:00:08.650> stress<00:00:08.920> levels<00:00:09.250> of

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
effects of music in the stress levels of

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.129 
effects of music in the stress levels of
cats<00:00:09.610> in<00:00:09.849> a<00:00:10.000> veterinary<00:00:10.240> environment<00:00:10.900> and

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139 
cats in a veterinary environment and

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.009 
cats in a veterinary environment and
what<00:00:11.950> I<00:00:11.980> did<00:00:12.340> and<00:00:12.550> to<00:00:13.090> start<00:00:13.300> off<00:00:13.510> with<00:00:13.690> is<00:00:13.809> I

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
what I did and to start off with is I

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.259 
what I did and to start off with is I
had<00:00:14.230> a<00:00:14.260> little<00:00:14.410> bit<00:00:14.590> mridu<00:00:14.920> round<00:00:15.250> and<00:00:15.550> some

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:16.269 
had a little bit mridu round and some

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:17.790 
had a little bit mridu round and some
half<00:00:16.539> students<00:00:16.960> in<00:00:17.019> the<00:00:17.109> past<00:00:17.260> have<00:00:17.560> looked

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
half students in the past have looked

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.669 
half students in the past have looked
into<00:00:18.010> music<00:00:18.580> and<00:00:18.849> stress<00:00:19.150> in<00:00:19.449> cats<00:00:19.929> in<00:00:20.470> a

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:20.679 
into music and stress in cats in a

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.979 
into music and stress in cats in a
kateri<00:00:21.489> environment<00:00:22.029> and<00:00:22.179> because<00:00:22.900> of

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:22.989 
kateri environment and because of

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.149 
kateri environment and because of
veterinary<00:00:23.289> environments<00:00:23.800> a<00:00:23.859> lot<00:00:24.009> more

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:24.159 
veterinary environments a lot more

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:25.919 
veterinary environments a lot more
stressful<00:00:24.460> because<00:00:24.849> they're<00:00:25.509> getting<00:00:25.569> poked

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
stressful because they're getting poked

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.599 
stressful because they're getting poked
and<00:00:26.140> prodded<00:00:26.289> and<00:00:26.739> they're<00:00:27.039> not<00:00:27.159> used<00:00:27.339> to<00:00:27.460> that

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
and prodded and they're not used to that

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.849 
and prodded and they're not used to that
so<00:00:28.480> if<00:00:28.599> we<00:00:28.720> could<00:00:28.839> find<00:00:28.989> out<00:00:29.259> whether<00:00:29.470> music

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
so if we could find out whether music

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.829 
so if we could find out whether music
could<00:00:30.310> make<00:00:30.579> them<00:00:30.729> more<00:00:30.880> relaxed<00:00:31.419> then<00:00:31.749> it

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
could make them more relaxed then it

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.270 
could make them more relaxed then it
would<00:00:31.929> be<00:00:32.020> beneficial<00:00:32.169> to<00:00:32.560> the<00:00:32.770> cats<00:00:32.980> that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
would be beneficial to the cats that

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.310 
would be beneficial to the cats that
would<00:00:33.370> be<00:00:33.460> less<00:00:33.640> upset<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.570> also<00:00:34.960> it<00:00:35.200> would<00:00:35.290> be

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
would be less upset and also it would be

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.530 
would be less upset and also it would be
beneficial<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.220> staff<00:00:36.460> because<00:00:36.940> it<00:00:37.240> cats

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
beneficial to the staff because it cats

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.720 
beneficial to the staff because it cats
the<00:00:37.660> less<00:00:37.810> stress<00:00:38.290> they're<00:00:38.680> more<00:00:38.920> less<00:00:39.400> likely

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
the less stress they're more less likely

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.940 
the less stress they're more less likely
to<00:00:39.760> get<00:00:39.970> violent<00:00:40.210> or<00:00:40.570> upset<00:00:41.320> there'll<00:00:41.560> be<00:00:41.590> best

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
to get violent or upset there'll be best

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.410 
to get violent or upset there'll be best
patients<00:00:42.490> so<00:00:42.760> all-round

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
patients so all-round

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.170 
patients so all-round
it<00:00:43.570> would<00:00:43.720> benefit<00:00:44.130> everyone<00:00:45.130> involved<00:00:45.520> I<00:00:45.910> had

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
it would benefit everyone involved I had

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.760 
it would benefit everyone involved I had
a<00:00:46.210> control<00:00:46.510> group<00:00:46.630> of<00:00:46.870> cats<00:00:47.080> and<00:00:47.320> this<00:00:47.620> is<00:00:47.740> a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
a control group of cats and this is a

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.380 
a control group of cats and this is a
group<00:00:47.950> of<00:00:48.070> cats<00:00:48.310> I<00:00:48.490> didn't<00:00:48.700> play<00:00:48.790> any<00:00:48.940> music<00:00:49.270> to

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
group of cats I didn't play any music to

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.840 
group of cats I didn't play any music to
it<00:00:49.510> so<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:50.080> secondary<00:00:50.890> group<00:00:51.010> was<00:00:51.640> blade

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
it so the secondary group was blade

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.590 
it so the secondary group was blade
relaxation<00:00:52.360> CDs<00:00:52.840> and<00:00:53.050> I<00:00:53.890> used<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:54.610> results

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
relaxation CDs and I used the results

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.930 
relaxation CDs and I used the results
from<00:00:55.780> this<00:00:56.020> to<00:00:56.500> see<00:00:56.650> who's<00:00:56.950> which<00:00:57.520> group<00:00:57.850> was

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
from this to see who's which group was

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.819 
from this to see who's which group was
most<00:00:58.180> stressed<00:00:58.450> and<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:59.140> way<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.290> did<00:00:59.530> this<00:00:59.680> is

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
most stressed and the way I did this is

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.130 
most stressed and the way I did this is
I<00:00:59.920> measured<00:01:00.280> my<00:01:00.700> body<00:01:00.910> posture<00:01:01.480> and<00:01:01.660> the

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
I measured my body posture and the

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.920 
I measured my body posture and the
change<00:01:02.380> over<00:01:02.560> time<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:04.329> so<00:01:04.540> but<00:01:04.780> when

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
change over time and this so but when

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.819 
change over time and this so but when
they<00:01:05.049> first<00:01:05.259> came<00:01:05.439> in

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
they first came in

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.950 
they first came in
I<00:01:06.030> measured<00:01:07.030> how<00:01:07.180> stressed<00:01:07.509> they<00:01:07.659> were<00:01:07.720> I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
I measured how stressed they were I

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.260 
I measured how stressed they were I
looked<00:01:08.350> at<00:01:08.499> where<00:01:08.799> there<00:01:08.979> is<00:01:09.100> where<00:01:09.369> how<00:01:09.640> where

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
looked at where there is where how where

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.910 
looked at where there is where how where
the<00:01:10.359> eye<00:01:10.390> position<00:01:10.630> was<00:01:11.079> what<00:01:11.710> they<00:01:11.859> were

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
the eye position was what they were

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.069 
the eye position was what they were
saying<00:01:12.219> what<00:01:12.520> they<00:01:12.640> were<00:01:12.729> doing<00:01:13.090> or<00:01:13.420> activity

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
saying what they were doing or activity

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.169 
saying what they were doing or activity
levels<00:01:14.380> were<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.979> what<00:01:15.249> the<00:01:15.369> respiration<00:01:15.789> was

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
levels were and what the respiration was

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.080 
levels were and what the respiration was
and<00:01:16.479> then<00:01:17.229> after<00:01:17.710> 40<00:01:18.009> minutes<00:01:18.039> the<00:01:18.549> cats<00:01:18.969> that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
and then after 40 minutes the cats that

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.879 
and then after 40 minutes the cats that
were<00:01:19.210> exposed<00:01:19.509> to<00:01:19.630> music<00:01:19.929> I<00:01:20.049> recorded<00:01:20.649> again

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:20.889 
were exposed to music I recorded again

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:22.620 
were exposed to music I recorded again
similarly<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.609> control<00:01:21.969> group<00:01:22.210> I'd<00:01:22.359> record

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
similarly the control group I'd record

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.270 
similarly the control group I'd record
again<00:01:22.929> but<00:01:23.079> they<00:01:23.200> hadn't<00:01:23.499> heard<00:01:23.590> me<00:01:23.829> music<00:01:24.159> at

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
again but they hadn't heard me music at

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.010 
again but they hadn't heard me music at
this<00:01:24.490> time<00:01:24.729> again<00:01:25.179> I<00:01:25.509> looked<00:01:25.810> at<00:01:25.929> their

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
this time again I looked at their

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.020 
this time again I looked at their
behavior<00:01:26.439> and<00:01:26.560> their<00:01:26.679> postures<00:01:27.159> and<00:01:27.909> I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
behavior and their postures and I

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.330 
behavior and their postures and I
assigned<00:01:28.359> them<00:01:28.509> a<00:01:28.539> number<00:01:28.960> this<00:01:29.649> is<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.920> cat

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
assigned them a number this is a cat

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.520 
assigned them a number this is a cat
stress<00:01:30.609> score<00:01:30.819> and<00:01:31.060> it's<00:01:31.600> been<00:01:32.139> around<00:01:32.289> since

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
stress score and it's been around since

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.550 
stress score and it's been around since
about<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:32.859> 90s<00:01:33.689> which<00:01:34.689> is<00:01:34.929> used<00:01:35.259> for

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
about the 90s which is used for

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.590 
about the 90s which is used for
behavioral<00:01:36.429> purposes<00:01:36.999> it<00:01:37.179> just<00:01:37.329> means<00:01:37.509> that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
behavioral purposes it just means that

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.789 
behavioral purposes it just means that
you<00:01:37.719> don't<00:01:37.840> have<00:01:37.959> to<00:01:38.139> touch<00:01:38.259> the<00:01:38.439> cats<00:01:38.649> or

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
you don't have to touch the cats or

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.249 
you don't have to touch the cats or
interfere<00:01:39.130> with<00:01:39.280> them<00:01:39.399> at<00:01:39.490> all<00:01:39.639> and<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:40.810> then

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
interfere with them at all and I then

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.370 
interfere with them at all and I then
rechecks<00:01:42.100> them<00:01:42.369> later<00:01:42.999> on<00:01:43.149> in<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:43.420> day<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.899> so

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
rechecks them later on in the day and so

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.859 
rechecks them later on in the day and so
I<00:01:44.469> could<00:01:44.649> work<00:01:44.889> out<00:01:45.130> how<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:46.119> music<00:01:46.329> affected

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
I could work out how the music affected

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.300 
I could work out how the music affected
them<00:01:46.990> abital<00:01:47.459> what<00:01:48.459> I<00:01:48.490> did<00:01:48.700> find<00:01:48.969> out<00:01:49.240> was<00:01:49.630> that

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
them abital what I did find out was that

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.649 
them abital what I did find out was that
behaviorally<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:51.850> music<00:01:52.329> made<00:01:52.479> no

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
behaviorally and the music made no

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:53.760 
behaviorally and the music made no
difference<00:01:52.869> at<00:01:53.109> all<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.439> didn't<00:01:53.649> make<00:01:53.709> the

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
difference at all it didn't make the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.069 
difference at all it didn't make the
cats<00:01:54.009> more<00:01:54.189> upset<00:01:54.549> or<00:01:54.700> less<00:01:54.850> upset<00:01:55.240> but<00:01:55.749> I<00:01:55.810> did

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
cats more upset or less upset but I did

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.349 
cats more upset or less upset but I did
notice<00:01:56.289> that<00:01:56.700> respiration<00:01:57.700> rates<00:01:57.909> for<00:01:58.240> the

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
notice that respiration rates for the

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.599 
notice that respiration rates for the
cats<00:01:58.569> in<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.170> music<00:01:59.529> group<00:01:59.709> so<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.279> cats<00:02:00.490> that

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
cats in the music group so the cats that

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.129 
cats in the music group so the cats that
have<00:02:00.759> played<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.149> relaxation<00:02:01.599> music

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
have played the relaxation music

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.949 
have played the relaxation music
dropped<00:02:02.679> a<00:02:02.799> lot<00:02:02.979> more<00:02:03.310> quickly<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:04.509> a<00:02:04.539> relaxed

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
dropped a lot more quickly so a relaxed

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.749 
dropped a lot more quickly so a relaxed
level<00:02:05.289> than<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.740> cats<00:02:05.950> who<00:02:06.159> won't<00:02:06.369> play<00:02:06.549> the

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
level than the cats who won't play the

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.440 
level than the cats who won't play the
music<00:02:07.259> which<00:02:08.340> would<00:02:09.340> suggest<00:02:09.580> perhaps<00:02:10.030> that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
music which would suggest perhaps that

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.900 
music which would suggest perhaps that
cats<00:02:10.869> in<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.560> veterinary<00:02:11.770> practice<00:02:12.250> don't<00:02:12.640> want

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
cats in a veterinary practice don't want

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.310 
cats in a veterinary practice don't want
to<00:02:13.030> like<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.360> know<00:02:13.510> need<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.020> know<00:02:14.140> that

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
to like you know need to know that

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.630 
to like you know need to know that
they're<00:02:14.470> stressed<00:02:14.800> or<00:02:15.270> relaxed<00:02:16.270> they<00:02:16.390> will

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
they're stressed or relaxed they will

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.910 
they're stressed or relaxed they will
to<00:02:16.819> look<00:02:16.970> like<00:02:17.210> they're<00:02:17.390> alert<00:02:17.720> they<00:02:18.110> want<00:02:18.290> you

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
to look like they're alert they want you

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.380 
to look like they're alert they want you
to<00:02:19.069> think<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.370> they're<00:02:19.670> gonna<00:02:19.790> jump<00:02:20.090> out<00:02:20.240> on

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
to think that they're gonna jump out on

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.720 
to think that they're gonna jump out on
you<00:02:23.230> but<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.740> would<00:02:24.980> be<00:02:25.100> an<00:02:25.190> area<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.520> further

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
you but it would be an area for further

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.590 
you but it would be an area for further
research<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.240> see<00:02:26.690> if<00:02:26.750> this<00:02:26.990> is<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.260> case<00:02:28.600> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
research to see if this is the case the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.660 
research to see if this is the case the
place<00:02:29.780> where<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.260> sample<00:02:30.650> cats<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:31.040> was<00:02:31.280> using

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
place where the sample cats I was using

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.090 
place where the sample cats I was using
was<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.880> quite<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.569> local<00:02:33.020> country<00:02:33.410> practice<00:02:33.860> it

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
was a quite a local country practice it

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.920 
was a quite a local country practice it
might<00:02:34.370> be<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.820> in<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.330> different<00:02:35.600> sort<00:02:35.750> of

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
might be that in a different sort of

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.150 
might be that in a different sort of
practice<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.560> music<00:02:36.860> would<00:02:36.980> have<00:02:37.130> a

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
practice the music would have a

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.550 
practice the music would have a
different<00:02:37.459> effect
