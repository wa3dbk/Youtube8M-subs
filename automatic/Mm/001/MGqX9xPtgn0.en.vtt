become extremely powerful in my view now

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.770 
become extremely powerful in my view now
in<00:00:42.420> previous<00:00:43.820> editions<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> update<00:00:45.600> of

you scoped in with the ACOG he it didn't

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.849 
you scoped in with the ACOG he it didn't
show<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.800> whole<00:00:56.340> sort<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> random<00:00:57.510> or

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
show you that whole sort of random or

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.799 
show you that whole sort of random or
random<00:00:58.859> placement<00:00:59.609> of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> shot<00:01:00.510> which

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
random placement of the shot which

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.660 
random placement of the shot which
happened<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> first<00:01:01.620> couple<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.160> seconds

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
happened for the first couple of seconds

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.429 
happened for the first couple of seconds
as<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.570> when<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.989> zoom<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
as you know when you zoom in with a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.350 
as you know when you zoom in with a
regular<00:01:04.890> scale<00:01:05.129> goes<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.060> random

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
regular scale goes to that random

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.149 
regular scale goes to that random
position<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.140> then<00:01:07.320> into<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> normal

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
position and then into the normal

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.219 
position and then into the normal
position<00:01:08.310> with<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> call<00:01:09.479> they<00:01:09.630> didn't<00:01:10.020> do

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
position with the a call they didn't do

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.219 
position with the a call they didn't do
that<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.790> bullet<00:01:12.150> still<00:01:12.479> went<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
that but the bullet still went to a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.620 
that but the bullet still went to a
random<00:01:13.740> place<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.250> really<00:01:14.909> difficult<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
random place so really difficult to

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.050 
random place so really difficult to
snipe<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.170> because<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:17.250> know<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.400> didn't

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
snipe with because you know you didn't

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.999 
snipe with because you know you didn't
actually<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:19.080> where<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.830> were

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
actually get to see where you were

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.130 
actually get to see where you were

well then answer some of these guys on
you<00:02:10.599> can<00:02:10.720> see<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.290> actually

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
you can see that it is actually

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.960 
you can see that it is actually
effective<00:02:13.349> in<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.560> normal<00:02:15.160> situation<00:02:15.310> in

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
effective in a normal situation in

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.510 
effective in a normal situation in
general<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.390> against<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.260> complete<00:02:17.920> bunch<00:02:18.310> of

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
general just against a complete bunch of

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.370 
general just against a complete bunch of
retards<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.670> only<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.420> only<00:02:22.450> downside<00:02:23.349> is

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
retards the only the only downside is

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.040 
retards the only the only downside is
and<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.190> is<00:02:24.310> unfortunate<00:02:25.090> but<00:02:25.239> with<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.599> ACOG

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
and it is unfortunate but with the ACOG

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.059 
and it is unfortunate but with the ACOG
there<00:02:26.319> is<00:02:26.440> quite<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> quite<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> heavy<00:02:28.060> idle<00:02:28.780> sway

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
there is quite a quite a heavy idle sway

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.670 
there is quite a quite a heavy idle sway
so<00:02:30.069> people<00:02:30.910> at<00:02:31.030> longer<00:02:31.239> range<00:02:31.510> are<00:02:31.840> gonna<00:02:32.470> be

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
so people at longer range are gonna be

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.430 
so people at longer range are gonna be
harder<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.190> actually<00:02:33.550> quickscope<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.900> be<00:02:35.230> if

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
harder to actually quickscope and be if

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.559 
harder to actually quickscope and be if
you<00:02:35.620> do<00:02:35.830> go<00:02:36.099> for<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.489> for<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:36.910> hardscoping

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
you do go for that for the hardscoping

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.210 
you do go for that for the hardscoping
if<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.870> do<00:02:38.019> try<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.260> aim<00:02:38.500> in<00:02:38.680> on<00:02:38.830> them<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.100> is

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
if you do try and aim in on them it is

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.710 
if you do try and aim in on them it is
going<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.489> be<00:02:39.580> harder<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:39.940> take<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.480> shot

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
going to be harder to take that shot

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.430 
going to be harder to take that shot
because<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.260> will<00:02:41.440> be<00:02:41.560> swearing<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:42.040> lot<00:02:42.069> more

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
because it will be swearing a lot more

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.590 
because it will be swearing a lot more
it<00:02:44.440> will<00:02:44.680> be<00:02:44.890> harder<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.310> get<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.090> precise

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
it will be harder to get the precise

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.710 
it will be harder to get the precise
obviously<00:02:47.530> although<00:02:48.340> unlike<00:02:49.299> in<00:02:49.480> modern

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
obviously although unlike in modern

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.140 
obviously although unlike in modern
warfare<00:02:49.840> 2<00:02:50.080> where<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:51.160> ACOG<00:02:51.580> scope<00:02:51.760> was

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
warfare 2 where the the ACOG scope was

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.449 
warfare 2 where the the ACOG scope was
strangely<00:02:53.080> an<00:02:53.319> actor<00:02:53.769> it's<00:02:54.130> actually

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
strangely an actor it's actually

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.150 
strangely an actor it's actually
accurate<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.150> where

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
accurate to where

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.830 
accurate to where
I<00:02:57.160> don't<00:02:57.849> know<00:02:57.940> however<00:02:58.180> since<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.480> means

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
I don't know however since that means

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.900 
I don't know however since that means
but<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.470> basically<00:02:59.920> means<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:00.549> even<00:03:00.670> with

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
but it basically means that even with

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.759 
but it basically means that even with
the<00:03:01.090> iris<00:03:01.450> way<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.780> will<00:03:01.930> shoot<00:03:02.319> where<00:03:02.590> you're

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
the iris way it will shoot where you're

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.580 
the iris way it will shoot where you're
aiming<00:03:02.950> at<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:03.610> as<00:03:04.599> long<00:03:04.780> as<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.019> climb<00:03:05.290> it

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
aiming at so as long as you climb it

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.320 
aiming at so as long as you climb it
correctly<00:03:06.069> and<00:03:06.280> you've<00:03:06.700> got<00:03:06.819> a<00:03:06.849> good<00:03:07.060> shot

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
correctly and you've got a good shot

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.449 
correctly and you've got a good shot
with<00:03:07.390> your<00:03:07.660> smaller<00:03:07.930> then<00:03:08.319> you<00:03:08.590> should<00:03:09.310> be

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
with your smaller then you should be

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.849 
with your smaller then you should be
fairly<00:03:09.790> safe

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
fairly safe

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.830 
fairly safe
so<00:03:12.370> yeah<00:03:12.549> that's<00:03:12.760> that's<00:03:12.940> all<00:03:13.150> I've<00:03:13.269> got<00:03:13.299> saves

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
so yeah that's that's all I've got saves
