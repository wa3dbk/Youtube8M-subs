kill<00:00:33.830> streak<00:00:34.070> or<00:00:34.250> scorestreak<00:00:34.760> because<00:00:35.000> we

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
kill streak or scorestreak because we

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.210 
kill streak or scorestreak because we
don't<00:00:35.360> know<00:00:35.510> anything<00:00:36.230> about<00:00:36.470> how<00:00:36.860> score

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
don't know anything about how score

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.620

sheets<00:00:37.460> or<00:00:37.550> kill<00:00:37.730> streets<00:00:37.970> are<00:00:38.120> going<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.480> work

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
sheets or kill streets are going to work

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.300 
sheets or kill streets are going to work
and<00:00:38.810> call<00:00:38.990> duty<00:00:39.320> ghost<00:00:39.650> multiplayer<00:00:39.740> I'm

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
and call duty ghost multiplayer I'm

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.830 
and call duty ghost multiplayer I'm
hoping<00:00:40.520> they<00:00:40.790> go<00:00:40.910> back<00:00:41.060> to<00:00:41.210> score<00:00:41.420> streaks<00:00:41.690> I'm

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
hoping they go back to score streaks I'm

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.420 
hoping they go back to score streaks I'm
hoping<00:00:42.110> it<00:00:42.260> doesn't<00:00:42.440> go<00:00:42.620> back<00:00:42.770> down<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.010> point

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
hoping it doesn't go back down to point

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.250 
hoping it doesn't go back down to point
streaks<00:00:43.700> as<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:43.940> wasn't<00:00:44.090> mw3<00:00:44.570> but<00:00:44.930> who<00:00:45.080> knows

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
streaks as it wasn't mw3 but who knows

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.810 
streaks as it wasn't mw3 but who knows
now<00:00:45.740> the<00:00:45.800> perfect<00:00:46.010> example<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.790> demonstrate

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
now the perfect example to demonstrate

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.140 
now the perfect example to demonstrate
this<00:00:47.630> score<00:00:47.930> streak<00:00:48.230> would<00:00:48.500> be<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:48.980> RC<00:00:49.460> XD<00:00:49.610> is

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
this score streak would be the RC XD is

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.940 
this score streak would be the RC XD is
the<00:00:50.330> closest<00:00:50.690> resemblance<00:00:50.990> to<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.560> player

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
the closest resemblance to a player

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.470 
the closest resemblance to a player
controlled<00:00:52.400> school<00:00:52.760> street<00:00:52.970> that<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:53.300> then

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
controlled school street that you then

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.900 
controlled school street that you then
control<00:00:53.930> around<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.350> map<00:00:54.560> obviously<00:00:55.490> a<00:00:55.520> dog

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
control around the map obviously a dog

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.550 
control around the map obviously a dog
would<00:00:56.120> be<00:00:56.270> a<00:00:56.300> much<00:00:56.540> higher<00:00:56.780> score<00:00:57.110> streak<00:00:57.350> seen

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
would be a much higher score streak seen

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.260 
would be a much higher score streak seen
as<00:00:57.740> it<00:00:57.860> can<00:00:58.070> pray<00:00:58.250> take<00:00:58.460> down<00:00:58.730> multiple

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
as it can pray take down multiple

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.030 
as it can pray take down multiple
enemies<00:00:59.720> if<00:00:59.900> you<00:01:00.079> can<00:01:00.230> get<00:01:00.380> behind<00:01:00.740> them<00:01:00.890> etc

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
enemies if you can get behind them etc

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.100 
enemies if you can get behind them etc
where's<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.670> RC<00:01:01.940> XD<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:02.390> only<00:01:02.600> get<00:01:02.870> one<00:01:02.900> shot

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
where's the RC XD you only get one shot

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.800 
where's the RC XD you only get one shot
the<00:01:03.800> RC<00:01:04.159> XD<00:01:04.250> is<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.640> horrible<00:01:05.180> scorestreak<00:01:05.659> it

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
the RC XD is a horrible scorestreak it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.540 
the RC XD is a horrible scorestreak it
takes<00:01:06.050> one<00:01:06.290> bullet<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.740> destroy<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:07.370> you've

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
takes one bullet to destroy and you've

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.980 
takes one bullet to destroy and you've
only<00:01:07.670> got<00:01:07.940> one<00:01:07.970> chance<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.570> get<00:01:08.720> someone

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
only got one chance to get someone

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.570 
only got one chance to get someone
that's<00:01:09.230> why<00:01:09.380> I<00:01:09.409> think<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.800> dog<00:01:10.040> could<00:01:10.280> actually

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
that's why I think a dog could actually

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.520 
that's why I think a dog could actually
work<00:01:10.970> it<00:01:11.240> may<00:01:11.390> take<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:11.750> couple<00:01:11.870> bullets<00:01:12.290> to

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
work it may take a couple bullets to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.020 
work it may take a couple bullets to
take<00:01:12.710> down<00:01:12.860> obviously<00:01:13.100> not<00:01:13.370> just<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.670> one-hit

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
take down obviously not just a one-hit

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.030 
take down obviously not just a one-hit
kill<00:01:14.300> but<00:01:14.630> you'll<00:01:14.750> be<00:01:14.900> chasing<00:01:15.140> after<00:01:15.440> enemies

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
kill but you'll be chasing after enemies

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.740 
kill but you'll be chasing after enemies

killing them basically as you can see in

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.490 
killing them basically as you can see in
the<00:01:19.520> gameplay<00:01:19.880> as<00:01:20.090> four<00:01:20.570> points<00:01:20.900> required<00:01:21.170> to

a lot of people now I like the idea of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.940 
a lot of people now I like the idea of
one<00:01:38.330> player<00:01:38.630> controlled<00:01:39.080> dog<00:01:39.320> rather<00:01:39.590> than

one player controlled dog rather than

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
the dog score shoot we've already seen

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.600 
the dog score shoot we've already seen
in<00:01:41.690> world<00:01:41.900> at<00:01:42.049> war<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.470> black<00:01:42.680> ops<00:01:42.860> 2<00:01:43.100> I<00:01:43.130> find

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
in world at war and black ops 2 I find

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.789 
in world at war and black ops 2 I find
them<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.790> little<00:01:43.970> bit<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.630> opie<00:01:45.140> they<00:01:45.409> kill<00:01:45.650> you

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
them a little bit to opie they kill you

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.770 
them a little bit to opie they kill you
in<00:01:45.950> one<00:01:45.979> lunch<00:01:46.520> sometimes<00:01:47.150> there's<00:01:47.420> too<00:01:47.600> many

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
in one lunch sometimes there's too many

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.570 
in one lunch sometimes there's too many
of<00:01:47.900> them<00:01:48.020> on<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.350> map<00:01:48.380> at<00:01:48.710> one<00:01:48.860> time<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:49.549> you

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
of them on the map at one time and you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.609 
of them on the map at one time and you
have<00:01:49.970> no<00:01:50.180> chance<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:50.840> I'm<00:01:50.930> guessing<00:01:51.170> that<00:01:51.380> this

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
have no chance so I'm guessing that this

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.320 
have no chance so I'm guessing that this
one<00:01:51.830> could<00:01:52.100> actually<00:01:52.340> potentially<00:01:52.670> be<00:01:53.119> a

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
one could actually potentially be a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.880 
one could actually potentially be a
school<00:01:53.630> street<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.170> I'd<00:01:54.290> personally<00:01:54.560> like<00:01:54.740> to

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
school street and I'd personally like to

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.990 
school street and I'd personally like to
see<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.310> would<00:01:55.400> be<00:01:55.490> quite<00:01:55.640> fun<00:01:55.850> and

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
see it would be quite fun and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.730 
see it would be quite fun and
interesting<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.750> seen<00:01:57.080> this<00:01:57.200> it's<00:01:57.409> already

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
interesting and seen this it's already

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.109 
interesting and seen this it's already
an<00:01:57.799> aspect<00:01:58.220> in<00:01:58.369> single<00:01:58.700> player<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:58.909> the

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
an aspect in single player and the

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.000 
an aspect in single player and the
campaign<00:01:59.630> it<00:02:00.140> wouldn't<00:02:00.439> surprise<00:02:00.530> me<00:02:00.740> if<00:02:00.979> they

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
campaign it wouldn't surprise me if they

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.620 
campaign it wouldn't surprise me if they
did<00:02:01.280> bring<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.580> into<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.820> multiplayer<00:02:02.330> now<00:02:02.479> what

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
did bring it into a multiplayer now what

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.880 
did bring it into a multiplayer now what
are<00:02:02.689> your<00:02:02.840> thoughts<00:02:03.049> on<00:02:03.200> this<00:02:03.260> do<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.650> think

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
are your thoughts on this do you think

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.770 
are your thoughts on this do you think
that<00:02:04.010> they<00:02:04.130> could<00:02:04.189> actually<00:02:04.520> be<00:02:04.850> potential

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
that they could actually be potential

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.149 
that they could actually be potential
for<00:02:06.260> this<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.409> be<00:02:06.590> bought<00:02:06.799> in<00:02:06.950> as<00:02:07.070> a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
for this to be bought in as a

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.859 
for this to be bought in as a
multiplayer<00:02:07.610> school<00:02:07.909> street<00:02:08.119> obviously<00:02:08.720> this

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
multiplayer school street obviously this

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.900 
multiplayer school street obviously this
is<00:02:09.020> just<00:02:09.229> my<00:02:09.349> ideas<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:09.860> speculation<00:02:10.670> but

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
is just my ideas and speculation but

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.490 
is just my ideas and speculation but
there<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.180> solid<00:02:11.510> reasoning<00:02:11.930> for<00:02:12.140> them<00:02:12.260> to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
there is solid reasoning for them to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.230 
there is solid reasoning for them to
bring<00:02:12.740> this<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.130> as<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.430> score<00:02:13.730> streak

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
bring this in as a score streak

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.790 
bring this in as a score streak
