00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
 already 

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.759
 good morning colleagues from the tutorial 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.990
 commented I am and louis again here in 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.610
 pyxel arts voucher 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.820
 It seemed like we were going to upload a video 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.490
 never again of this channel and good sometimes 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.999
 A comment is not good morning at all 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.419
 colleagues has simply commented 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:24.439
 it is a short something is worth to explain 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.109
 what has happened with skewer 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.050
 because two months ago we did not go up 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.460
 no video and what will happen to 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.819
 Next, what will happen after 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.819
 From now 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.100
 well simply 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.989
 two months ago we filled the equipment not 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.460
 the five before we have a team 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.230
 quite complete that is still there 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.360
 then in that moment I decided to create 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.879
 some kind of shifts is worth that already 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.970
 we had including the new people that 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.500
 had joined word leaving 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.989
 clear that this was the job to which 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.019
 we all do it for a hobby that 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.610
 it's just to help you do that 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.120
 tutorials do your mounts 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.640
 your hits 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.390
 and well I do not want to judge anyone 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.160
 ok these words do not help us 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.100
 bases that are lazy is that I do not know 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.720
 that is not worth I want to say is that 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.580
 I started with the two shifts 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.680
 I started saying the people of you touch your 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.180
 real and such and good since they were not in 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.040
 home that they had things to do that they did not 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.810
 I know I do not know how many then a 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.120
 little worth I got fed up with everything because I was 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.420
 a little tired of carrying this channel 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.560
 basically absolutely me 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.740
 and also something happened in my life with these 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.740
 things 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.260
 time I think better than to 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.760
 to use it on it and that's why I decided 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.350
 Only stay with your finger to 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.080
 youtube goes the explanation for fun 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.750
 is the one that I keep doing for fun 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.680
 that I keep going up to gameplays every day 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.900
 in case you do not know it, I also do 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.060
 gameplays are worth down the channel 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.190
 of the a by the description of the channel and 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.440
 so then this leaves this aside and 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.820
 as sporadic it is with the second 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.940
 bachelor I know I'm very fucked 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.020
 ok you have to do the selectivity and 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.910
 all that 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.880
 it's a very huge playground, I understand it 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.830
 because last year he went through that 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.270
 and then the channel was there in 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.580
 suspension 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.770
 I left him aside and I told him I was not going to 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.700
 do more why why not 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.790
 because I did not feel like it and that's how it was 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.650
 until today worth every other day 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.440
 I recommended to take it up again not from 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.750
 April start again those virtual 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.700
 and he told me it was worth it so perfect so 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.950
 from now on I'll take it this month 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.380
 April I will take it absolutely me 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.360
 what I 'm going to do is comment to 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.530
 team people are worth if they want 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.440
 follow and if not then 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.300
 thanks for all in the channel this 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.440
 I already talked personally with each one 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.650
 of them 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.330
 So what he comes to do is look 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.940
 some more regular rhythm that is by 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.250
 example as the Thursdays of and places and 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.200
 that every Thursday without fail have a 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.670
 tutorial or 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.110
 or if not for people who can not 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.150
 follow that pace is worth staying 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:18.280
 simply from members out there is 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.440
 follow a rhythm basically 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.560
 regular that is like a tutorial every 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.500
 two days the rhythm that I intend to carry and 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.870
 we will see in increasing eo or what has 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.010
 that diminish with the passage of time 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.940
 according to what you see this month and 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.000
 basically that's worth I will not keep 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.790
 me when these people can not do 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.410
 I'll do it and nothing else in that 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.350
 will define the channel voucher 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.470
 I hope you continue there I hope you continue 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.810
 wanting to learn what is this is 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.940
 does exclusively for you is worth and 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.310
 the only thing we ask in return is a like 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.810
 at most they are worth a like so that the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.050
 magic inside there more people can 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.970
 learn and it's basically already in that 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.350
 I wanted to comment on cleaning up this 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.150
 I do not know what the implication is, it's what 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.560
 I first found as already 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.500
 I still partly black 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.210
 Well, that's what I wanted to tell you, that's what 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.730
 this is how the channel will go from 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.920
 now and see you in the next video 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.920
 with him and a tutorial explaining 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.870
 It is something and nothing else what you have 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.870
 liked a greeting and until next time
