got a long extended wrist with a cuff on

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.790 
got a long extended wrist with a cuff on
it<00:00:27.349> to<00:00:27.950> keep<00:00:28.279> wind<00:00:28.610> and<00:00:28.820> everything<00:00:29.239> out<00:00:29.800> when

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.070 

so<00:00:36.190> they<00:00:36.400> come<00:00:36.640> down<00:00:36.670> pretty<00:00:37.180> far<00:00:37.480> so<00:00:37.810> that<00:00:37.960> you

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
so they come down pretty far so that you

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.600 
so they come down pretty far so that you

is intended to you know fly aircraft and

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.470 
is intended to you know fly aircraft and
things<00:00:53.890> like<00:00:54.040> that<00:00:54.100> gives<00:00:54.910> you<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.060> pretty<00:00:55.330> good

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.260 
the Magpul and hand trigger guard here
which<00:01:38.860> gives<00:01:39.100> me<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.250> little<00:01:39.430> bit<00:01:39.580> more<00:01:39.789> room<00:01:40.030> to

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
which gives me a little bit more room to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.169

fit gloves and everything in here as far

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.930 
fit gloves and everything in here as far
as<00:01:43.360> getting<00:01:43.660> my<00:01:43.899> trigger<00:01:44.649> finger<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:45.160> there<00:01:45.340> it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
as getting my trigger finger in there it

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.820 
as getting my trigger finger in there it
does<00:01:46.179> you<00:01:46.450> know<00:01:46.539> it<00:01:46.690> is<00:01:46.810> something<00:01:47.110> extra<00:01:47.649> in

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
does you know it is something extra in

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.540 
does you know it is something extra in
the<00:01:48.039> back<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.149> trigger<00:01:49.890> guard<00:01:50.890> area<00:01:51.340> there

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
the back the trigger guard area there

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.309 
the back the trigger guard area there
but<00:01:52.149> it<00:01:52.240> really<00:01:52.270> doesn't<00:01:52.780> seem<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.140> interfere

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
but it really doesn't seem to interfere

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.469 
but it really doesn't seem to interfere
too<00:01:53.679> much<00:01:53.710> with<00:01:53.940> getting<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.000> globe<00:01:55.210> in<00:01:55.330> there

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
too much with getting the globe in there

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.080 
too much with getting the globe in there
but<00:01:55.690> now<00:01:56.020> we<00:01:56.080> can<00:01:56.380> run<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.590> Mac<00:01:56.860> change<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:57.580> see

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
but now we can run a Mac change and see

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.260 
but now we can run a Mac change and see
if<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.330> can<00:01:58.539> make<00:01:58.690> short<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.759> mean<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.090> doesn't

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
if I can make short so I mean it doesn't

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.150 
if I can make short so I mean it doesn't
seem<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.660> really<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:05.229> then<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.619> lock<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:06.009> bolt

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
seem to really and then to lock the bolt

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.620 
seem to really and then to lock the bolt
open<00:02:06.610> I<00:02:08.039> could<00:02:09.039> still<00:02:09.280> get<00:02:09.399> my<00:02:09.580> my<00:02:10.210> finger<00:02:10.600> on

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
open I could still get my my finger on

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.340 
open I could still get my my finger on
there<00:02:10.960> so<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:13.150> doesn't<00:02:13.360> appear<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.750> mean<00:02:14.020> just<00:02:14.230> a

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
there so it doesn't appear I mean just a

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.770 
there so it doesn't appear I mean just a
