00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.920
 vincent who loved to see the 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.780
 barca matches when arrived young 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.030
 1 no, but it's true that this club is 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.530
 incredible is when you knew everywhere 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.309
 in europe and even more when in the 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.930
 South of France 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.330
 the barça means something 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.699
 it's a club that radiates 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.980
 Spanish but which shines in France in 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.079
 europe everywhere but since always they 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.369
 have a story in addition they have 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.069
 forged a story about the six 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.109
 had then then to the opponents it's 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.909
 to say to madrid after with this war 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.710
 of Spain between Republicans 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:34.240
 Spain where it concerns is 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.920
 the history of Spain has been made 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.880
 and in addition they made the board to 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.710
 tickets ie that even in a 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.780
 spain in crisis he gets to have some 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.340
 hyper budgets therefore that their 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.440
 allow to have the players the 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.390
 the world's best players and 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.010
 to be able to preserve them serves no one 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.110
 can compete with the barca 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.610
 in addition they have a technicality 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.680
 I think they wear very very hard 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.010
 the culture of football a technicality a 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.790
 a lead on this sport that is when 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.440
 even formidable 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.690
 I believe it's the drops are 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.160
 often the champions of europe and madrid 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.420
 who clings behind who is in the process 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.340
 to move to a championship that has passed 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.289
 maybe in front but what are you 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.549
 use the barça it's a story 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.039
 that we can not control there are 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.049
 clubs like that there occurred football 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.310
 american there will be the frci niners of 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.829
 san francisco but it lasted a 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.909
 decade the barca that makes it a 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:23.950
 century that lasts celtic glasgow 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.499
 excuse me I have some guys who laughed 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.479
 of course the celtic is a little stupid because 

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:30.670
 that I mean if there are things there 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.159
 there are entities there are cultures in 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.959
 this club who does that as there is 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.280
 irresistible that it never lasts 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:36.899
 falling moments never lasts very 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.950
 long time 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.659
 Sebastian knew you 're not a fan 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.420
 absolute football is what the barça when 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.670
 even that it speaks to you that causes you 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.439
 something deep inside of you it's talking to me 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.310
 because when you talk about a club 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.770
 usually who is talking about a big 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.139
 family and there we can talk about a real 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.600
 beautiful and big family by his 

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:57.849
 structure with his socios what they 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.479
 elect their president who have had this 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:00.429
 they have a 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.079
 a very very powerful voice to 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.560
 inside this club 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:08.050
 so already 22 by this specificity you 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.880
 can you can say that this club and is 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.530
 unique in the world 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.810
 that's after when you're not fond of 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.540
 football like me I like like I do not 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.430
 am not sure that I will look 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.230
 in addition when the psg I watched this 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.030
 match with attention 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.040
 and when we see that the feats they 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.770
 accomplish every year necessarily 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.040
 you do not have attachment but you 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.200
 respect the work and you respect this 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.370
 that they do it is is obliged and obliges 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.200
 dismissed because such a little sport you 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.270
 evolve to respect because what this 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.800
 that releases this team but that's when 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.200
 even someone who does not like 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.310
 athleticism helpful and I plow on 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.110
 relies very nice interview you 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.430
 look at the final of the 100 m but even 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.220
 when they are still 15 crowns 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.030
 150 m on the beach of tulle 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.030
 of course it's the same
