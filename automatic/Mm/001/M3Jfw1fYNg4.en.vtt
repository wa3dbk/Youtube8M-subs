that<00:03:23.480> stuff<00:03:24.049> really<00:03:24.680> helped<00:03:24.859> me<00:03:24.950> get<00:03:25.099> there<00:03:25.340> um

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:25.939 
that stuff really helped me get there um

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.170 
that stuff really helped me get there um
I<00:03:26.709> used<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:27.920> just<00:03:27.950> for<00:03:28.310> faster<00:03:29.000> hair<00:03:29.150> growth

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
I used it just for faster hair growth

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.390 
I used it just for faster hair growth
obviously<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:32.030> average<00:03:32.299> it<00:03:32.930> grew<00:03:33.109> about<00:03:33.409> an

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
obviously so on average it grew about an

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.280 
obviously so on average it grew about an
inch<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:35.150> month<00:03:35.920> for<00:03:36.920> me<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.930> know<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.200> average

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
inch a month for me I know that average

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.349 
inch a month for me I know that average
is<00:03:39.530> half<00:03:39.709> an<00:03:39.829> inch<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:40.069> that<00:03:40.190> was<00:03:40.430> I<00:03:40.760> thought

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
is half an inch so that was I thought

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.360 
is half an inch so that was I thought
that<00:03:41.540> was<00:03:41.690> pretty<00:03:41.900> good<00:03:42.109> so<00:03:42.319> I<00:03:42.889> was<00:03:43.099> quite
