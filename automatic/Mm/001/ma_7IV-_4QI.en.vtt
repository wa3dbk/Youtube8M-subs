00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.330 
here hopefully that will hopefully
hopefully<00:06:24.450> take<00:06:25.290> him<00:06:25.410> to<00:06:25.590> pretty<00:06:26.070> reasonably

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.560 

what<00:06:33.070> is<00:06:33.190> the<00:06:33.250> next<00:06:33.460> on<00:06:33.700> the<00:06:33.850> agenda<00:06:33.970> well<00:06:34.420> this

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
what is the next on the agenda well this

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.420 
what is the next on the agenda well this
is<00:06:34.720> wave<00:06:34.930> six<00:06:35.320> so<00:06:35.710> we<00:06:35.830> don't<00:06:36.070> really<00:06:36.160> have<00:06:36.340> to

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
is wave six so we don't really have to

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.740 
is wave six so we don't really have to
worry<00:06:36.580> about<00:06:36.700> using<00:06:37.000> our<00:06:37.090> lightning<00:06:37.270> too<00:06:37.510> late

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
worry about using our lightning too late

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.980 
worry about using our lightning too late
or<00:06:37.900> anything<00:06:39.480> just<00:06:40.480> got<00:06:40.600> to<00:06:40.690> use<00:06:40.780> it<00:06:40.810> up

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
or anything just got to use it up

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.390 
or anything just got to use it up
whenever<00:06:41.260> we<00:06:41.470> see<00:06:41.800> fit

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
whenever we see fit

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.970 
whenever we see fit
I<00:06:43.020> think<00:06:44.020> katha<00:06:44.290> honestly<00:06:44.590> is<00:06:44.650> probably<00:06:44.860> not

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 
I think katha honestly is probably not

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.670 
I think katha honestly is probably not
needed<00:06:45.280> over<00:06:45.460> here<00:06:45.610> at<00:06:45.670> the<00:06:45.760> moment<00:06:46.680> I'll

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
needed over here at the moment I'll

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.080 
needed over here at the moment I'll
probably<00:06:47.860> move<00:06:48.070> here<00:06:48.250> up<00:06:48.340> to<00:06:48.460> the<00:06:48.550> top<00:06:48.580> here<00:06:49.060> so

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
probably move here up to the top here so

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.820
