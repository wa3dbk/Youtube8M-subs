I didn't get it it's really hard to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.310 
I didn't get it it's really hard to
critique<00:00:33.120> because<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.570> didn't<00:00:33.870> really<00:00:34.020> do

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
critique because you didn't really do

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.860 
critique because you didn't really do
anything<00:00:34.500> apart<00:00:34.680> from<00:00:34.890> staying<00:00:35.329> character<00:00:36.360> so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
is one of my favorite choreographers I'm

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.830 
is one of my favorite choreographers I'm
just<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.559> sure<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.520> occasion<00:00:56.840> he's

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
just not sure that on this occasion he's

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.709 
just not sure that on this occasion he's
captured<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> right<00:00:59.039> time<00:00:59.520> to<00:01:00.210> experiment

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
captured the right time to experiment

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.860 
captured the right time to experiment
with<00:01:01.109> his<00:01:01.230> choreography<00:01:01.699> so<00:01:02.699> my<00:01:03.090> problem<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.660> I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
with his choreography so my problem is I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.690 
with his choreography so my problem is I
find<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.530> difficult<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:05.010> critique<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
find it difficult to critique the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.899 
find it difficult to critique the
dancers<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.869> routine<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> have

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
dancers with that routine so I have

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.520 
dancers with that routine so I have

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
Nigel said how do we critique that how

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219 
Nigel said how do we critique that how
do<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.320> judge<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.909> think<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> did<00:01:30.750> what

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
do we judge that I think you did what

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.969 
do we judge that I think you did what
was<00:01:31.350> asked<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.009> by<00:01:32.250> Wade<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.259> think

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
was asked of you by Wade so and I think

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:45.050 
was asked of you by Wade so and I think
you<00:01:35.189> were<00:01:35.310> pretty<00:01:35.520> good<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.850> Fox's<00:01:43.700> well<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> I

you were pretty good in Fox's well I I
think<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.380> think<00:01:46.439> you'll<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:46.920> people<00:01:47.100> who

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
think I think you'll have people who

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.219 
think I think you'll have people who
will<00:01:47.490> absolutely<00:01:47.790> love<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.960> then

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
will absolutely love this and then

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.130 
will absolutely love this and then
you'll<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.500> people<00:01:49.920> who

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.280

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.320 

you're<00:01:57.560> gonna<00:01:57.710> get<00:01:57.950> both<00:01:58.160> sides<00:01:58.490> of<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:58.820> you're

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330

danced it which is more important to me
is<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.580> think<00:02:04.850> your<00:02:05.210> attention<00:02:05.660> to<00:02:05.750> detail<00:02:06.230> was

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
is I think your attention to detail was

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.130 
is I think your attention to detail was
really<00:02:07.070> good<00:02:07.580> I<00:02:07.790> think<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:08.600> know<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.840> little

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
really good I think you know the little

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.560 
really good I think you know the little
things<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.619> guys<00:02:09.830> did<00:02:10.250> was<00:02:11.060> interesting

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
things that you guys did was interesting

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.030 
things that you guys did was interesting
I<00:02:11.720> thought<00:02:11.900> like<00:02:12.170> there<00:02:12.320> was<00:02:12.440> one<00:02:12.470> moment<00:02:12.800> in

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
I thought like there was one moment in

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.200 
I thought like there was one moment in
the<00:02:13.130> beginning<00:02:13.520> where<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.760> kind<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.060> went

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
the beginning where you kind of went

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.030 
the beginning where you kind of went
slow<00:02:14.510> rather<00:02:15.320> than<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.500> went<00:02:15.650> quick<00:02:15.800> again

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
slow rather than you went quick again

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.260 
slow rather than you went quick again
