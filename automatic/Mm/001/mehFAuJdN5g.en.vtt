00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello friends and in this video I want you 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.259
 show another model from my 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.090
 collections that have suffered from the process 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.200
 the so-called zinc plague 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.520
 This model VAZ 2102 from the manufacturer 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.010
 agate and this model was bought in 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.199
 the beginning of the two thousandth's and the date 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.230
 making this model is likely 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.050
 this is the end of the 90s and the beginning 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.240
 two-thousand years I have preserved 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.520
 box from this model but to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.290
 Unfortunately, there is no date on it 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.450
 making drink this box is already new 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.870
 sample 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.930
 so who is on the box or on the model 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.289
 can determine the date of manufacture 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.140
 write in the comments and all this time 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.329
 the model was kept in a box and when i 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.030
 pulled out of the box in front of me opened 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.609
 very interesting picture as you can see 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.930
 body model is completely covered 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:08.159
 cracked his swollen arched cover 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.220
 the hood arched the bottom of the model and the model 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.710
 changed clearance back she 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.020
 sagged because when I bought that 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.970
 model body relative to the surface he 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.040
 stood exactly and now is such 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.890
 impression as if by car in 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.890
 For ten years they drove very heavy 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.869
 weights and rear spring are not just sunk 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.960
 the starboard is also covered with cracks 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.860
 and what's interesting is that the cap 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.640
 trunk 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.159
 she is in very good condition 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.790
 there are no signs of it 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.430
 zinc plague while bodywork like 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.640
 see he is cracked and folded 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.119
 the impression as if the body is cast 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.860
 from a single metal alloy while 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.040
 other parts are cast from another 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.040
 alloy 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.810
 opens the trunk lid see in 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.410
 very good condition 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.280
 Of course, one of the downsides is that 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:20.540
 car all set in the clip obliquely 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:25.570
 which is typical not only for products 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.020
 Agate firms but for all products 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.400
 AvtoVAZ companies 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.810
 so nothing much to be surprised about 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 model hood opens 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.900
 I will try to open 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.610
 there is an imitation 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:49.910
 engine and as you see 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:54.470
 the cover itself she became famous in two 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:58.970
 parts and even surprising like a cap 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:03.709
 the hood still rests on the model and from that 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.890
 that the metal deformed broke 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.950
 grille see the lower part 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:16.100
 she cracked and a little piece 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:19.870
 he performed when he bought a model of it 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:26.170
 there was not another sign that 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:32.959
 body he has changed in size this is what 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.820
 windshield and sweat seats 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.950
 as you can see here was formed very 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.580
 a large network of about one and a half 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.709
 millimeters and it clearly shows 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.780
 that the body model has changed in size 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:51.620
 he was inflated because when he bought something 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.410
 glass models, it is very close 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.100
 to the beginning of the hood 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.100
 here is a big gap 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.620
 Of course , the models are already simplified disks. 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.989
 on earlier versions the wheels were 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:19.370
 chrome plated on later just 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:25.100
 cast from gray matte plastic such 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.940
 interesting model but unfortunately it is already 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.990
 spoiled 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.919
 although the bottom does not have any visible 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:39.260
 defects but she still arched 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:43.190
 even see the front landing itself 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.010
 place she dropped by 2 or 3 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.680
 millimeter 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:52.669
 relation to the body and many I have 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:56.419
 asked about such models if 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:05:00.350
 can the model be able to somehow save her 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:02.450
 or somehow restore I will say that if 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.950
 this process has already gone then you are nothing 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.180
 save this model, many have tried 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.760
 many tried to glue the details 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.750
 epoxy resin 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.940
 but still if the metal expands 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.960
 somewhere tapers it will still give 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.060
 crack and may be in another place or 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.729
 in the place where you stuck the model 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.070
 she will eventually crumble at me 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.220
 there was a model cute i was doing a video on her 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.310
 review and i tried to stop her i 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.169
 and tried to glue but he is so metal 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.600
 fragile that in the end she doesn't care 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:41.870
 crumbled into small pieces so 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.500
 if you collect Soviet models 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.680
 cars 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.620
 if you collect products from the company 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.780
 agate then be very attentive and 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:56.300
 try to buy models 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:58.490
 since the Soviet Union model before the release of up to 90 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.580
 years because later models 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.760
 they are almost all exposed and 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.280
 zinc plague and most 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.960
 collectors they just scatter 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.310
 Of course it is very offensive and 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.960
 it is a pity that such models are 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:19.470
 and crumble but no matter the process he 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.840
 therefore, all that remains is not reversible. 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.290
 do with this model model this 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.140
 let her in for parts and thanks for 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:31.310
 attention it was a review of the model VAZ 2102 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.310
 bye everyone
