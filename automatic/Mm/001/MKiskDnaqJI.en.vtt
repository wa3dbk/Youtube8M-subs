00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.069
 no no 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.430
 our countries have great wealth 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:23.669
 natural water fertile lands forests 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.669
 biodiversity and also minerals 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:34.360
 from nature we get oxygen water 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.640
 food medicine dresses 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.050
 to survive living beings 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.880
 we depend on each other when we lose 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.660
 biodiversity we also lose quality 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.770
 of life any alteration in the middle 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.770
 it affects us all 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.780
 several mining companies are coming to 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.670
 our countries in search of silver gold and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.769
 other metals 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 they take advantage of the weakness of 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.840
 environmental laws of our countries and 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.399
 of the poverty of the inhabitants for 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.530
 offer health education jobs 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:17.299
 work and development in exchange for that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.299
 accept the mining project 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.439
 let's show you what a mine is 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.930
 gold and what has happened in several 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.930
 places where mining projects operate 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.470
 let's see how a mining project starts 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.280
 does not have 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.159
 the company asks the government for permission 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.700
 to explore a territory in order 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.429
 to investigate the amount of gold there 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.789
 that permission is called permission of 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.789
 exploration 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.490
 the mining company takes pieces of rock 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.220
 which is on the surface and in the background 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.250
 of the earth to analyze them and detect 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.770
 the places where there is more gold 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.080
 If the study indicates that there is 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.899
 enough gold for the mine to be a 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.600
 good business then the mining company 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.740
 asks the government for permission to remove 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.030
 the gold to that permit is called permission 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.580
 of exploitation 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.620
 Once approved impact study 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.500
 environmental and complied with others 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.980
 legal requirements the company builds 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.160
 the mine, let's see how they build a mine 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.380
 if the studies carried out indicate that 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.110
 the rock that contains the gold is in the 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.560
 surface then build the mine to 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.590
 open sky is also called a cut 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.590
 open 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.250
 to build the open pit mine 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.860
 cut all the trees in ras with the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.150
 vegetable layer leaving the rock uncovered 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.879
 that contains gold 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.310
 let's see how they get the gold out of 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.069
 clothes 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.830
 the gold is stuck and the rock in pieces 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.310
 so much but so small that you can not 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.920
 see at a glance 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.890
 to extract a gram of gold is required 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.230
 up to one and a half tons of material for 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.020
 make a ring they need a lot 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.360
 tons of rock to get the 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.440
 tiny particles of gold that are 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.510
 tucked into the rock do the following 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.340
 out on the rock using dynamite or 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.410
 heavy machinery 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.800
 there is no place where the material and they do 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.840
 huge sales 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.130
 the material is passed through a first 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.130
 mill to fine tune it 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.860
 and then move on to a second mill where 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.569
 it remains like dust by means of strips 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.090
 transports in the dust up huge 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.760
 Shelves 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.890
 in the tanks they form a pasty mixture 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.769
 that they throw in the courtyards where they have 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.140
 placed plastics on top of 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.620
 plastics layer with the mixture 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.540
 pasty and for several days or months 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.209
 depending on the size of the cluster they 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.849
 they spray water with cyanide which is a 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.769
 very toxic chemical or a little bit of 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:19.180
 Cyanide the size of a grain of rice 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:22.030
 it is enough to kill a person the 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.610
 water made look soak the lumps the 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.070
 cyanide begins to act like a magnet 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.969
 that attracts microscopic particles 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.849
 of gold and that broth begins to drain 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:36.189
 as below the hub is plastic 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.949
 broth that contains water with cyanide and 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:41.709
 gold is covered up the batteries in the 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:44.679
 candles made in coal coal separates 

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:46.419
 the gold of the cyanide heats up in the coal 

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:48.579
 that has gold until it separates 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:52.769
 remaining in a yellowish paste that 

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:52.769
 then they transform it into ingots 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.940
 There is another type of gold wine that does not 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.550
 it is open to the sky but within the 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.830
 land of the rocks that contain the gold 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.960
 they are very deep in the earth 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.360
 then they build the underground mine 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.000
 or through tunnels 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.250
 to build the tunnels they use 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.979
 heavy machinery and explosives that 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.080
 pollute and affect the deposits of 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.139
 water that are below the earth 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.419
 In addition they should also cut the forest and 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.210
 clean the land to build the 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.360
 patios and gaps because after 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.939
 that take out the rock either in the open or 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.610
 the process is underground to obtain 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:38.159
 the gold is the same 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.830
 communities have the right to 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:43.379
 Learn freely and what is 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.439
 a gold mine and the consequences that 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:48.599
 you can bring before the approval is 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.849
 project once they have the 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:54.289
 knowledge they have the right to decide 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:57.090
 freely whether or not they accept the project 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.729
 many mining projects have stopped 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.729
 because people are informed and organized 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:05.430
 other communities have not had the 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:09.530
 the opportunity to make decisions 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.530
 projects were imposed
