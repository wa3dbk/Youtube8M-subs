00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
abstractions to the point where you as a

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.190 
abstractions to the point where you as a
developer<00:01:36.520> just<00:01:37.030> need<00:01:37.210> to<00:01:37.359> focus<00:01:37.600> on<00:01:38.020> your

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
developer just need to focus on your

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.920 
developer just need to focus on your
application<00:01:38.409> whereas<00:01:39.159> we<00:01:39.430> focus<00:01:39.880> on<00:01:40.180> like<00:01:40.840> you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
application whereas we focus on like you

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.810 
application whereas we focus on like you
know<00:01:41.020> how<00:01:41.500> do<00:01:41.560> we<00:01:41.799> actually<00:01:41.950> get<00:01:42.340> your<00:01:42.399> code

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
know how do we actually get your code

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.999
