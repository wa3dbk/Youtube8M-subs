bat<00:02:02.450> but<00:02:03.100> again<00:02:04.100> some<00:02:04.280> people<00:02:04.310> like<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:04.880> but

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
bat but again some people like that but

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.529 
bat but again some people like that but
to<00:02:05.690> me<00:02:05.930> I<00:02:06.290> like<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.159> be<00:02:07.310> heard<00:02:07.580> when<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.060> hit<00:02:08.330> the

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
to me I like to be heard when I hit the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.080 
to me I like to be heard when I hit the
ball<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.990> it's<00:02:09.830> almost<00:02:10.039> I<00:02:10.369> feel<00:02:10.459> like<00:02:10.880> I'm

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
ball and it's almost I feel like I'm

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.520 
ball and it's almost I feel like I'm
missing<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.660> ball<00:02:11.810> or<00:02:11.990> I<00:02:12.020> feel<00:02:12.230> like<00:02:12.350> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
missing the ball or I feel like the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.220 
missing the ball or I feel like the
balls<00:02:12.910> mushy<00:02:13.910> keep<00:02:14.630> trying<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.959> fill<00:02:15.110> them

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
balls mushy keep trying to fill them

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.470 
balls mushy keep trying to fill them
blue<00:02:15.350> balls<00:02:15.620> with<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.240> demarinis<00:02:17.240> but

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
blue balls with the demarinis but

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.030 
blue balls with the demarinis but
performance<00:02:18.470> wise<00:02:18.650> distance<00:02:19.220> wise<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:21.040> didn't

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
performance wise distance wise I didn't

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.560 
performance wise distance wise I didn't
I<00:02:22.250> mean<00:02:22.489> I<00:02:22.610> felt<00:02:22.970> like<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.150> was<00:02:23.300> getting<00:02:23.390> the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
I mean I felt like I was getting the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.330 
I mean I felt like I was getting the
same<00:02:23.780> distance<00:02:24.260> out<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.680> demarini<00:02:24.980> as

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
same distance out of the demarini as

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.559 
same distance out of the demarini as
some<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.580> other<00:02:25.730> guys<00:02:25.940> were<00:02:26.150> swinging<00:02:26.480> this

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
some the other guys were swinging this

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.479 
some the other guys were swinging this
week<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:28.310> know<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.489> think<00:02:28.700> that<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:31.280> that

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
week you know I think that that so that

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.130 
week you know I think that that so that
that<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.790> maybe<00:02:31.970> four<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.750> guess<00:02:33.020> any

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
that is maybe four I guess any

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.690 
that is maybe four I guess any
compression<00:02:33.440> balls<00:02:33.770> okay<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.489> we<00:02:34.580> were

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
compression balls okay and we were

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.790 
compression balls okay and we were
swinging<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.060> locomotion<00:02:35.420> balls<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.650> hit

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
swinging the locomotion balls and I hit

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.670 
swinging the locomotion balls and I hit
the<00:02:36.890> Dalton<00:02:37.100> grapes<00:02:37.519> right<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.930> mean

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
the Dalton grapes right and so I mean

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.320 
the Dalton grapes right and so I mean
one<00:02:39.830> who<00:02:39.980> assumes<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.489> with<00:02:40.700> an<00:02:40.910> actual

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
one who assumes that with an actual

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.470 
one who assumes that with an actual
heart<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.690> all<00:02:41.840> say<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:43.180> horse<00:02:44.180> full<00:02:44.360> of

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
heart of all say the horse full of

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.009 
heart of all say the horse full of
extremes<00:02:44.930> or<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.519> thunders<00:02:46.820> ians<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.870> could

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
extremes or the thunders ians it could

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.479 
extremes or the thunders ians it could
be<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.170> different<00:02:48.500> package<00:02:48.620> completely<00:02:49.130> for<00:02:49.430> a

whole different gear yeah and what he's

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.350 
whole different gear yeah and what he's
referring<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.739> is<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.010> demarini<00:02:52.880> African

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
made for the low compression balls and

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.030 
made for the low compression balls and
they<00:02:59.480> actually<00:02:59.840> say<00:03:00.050> not<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.530> hit<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.860> higher

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
they actually say not to hit the higher

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.890 
they actually say not to hit the higher
compression<00:03:01.370> ball<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.970> back<00:03:02.180> when<00:03:02.720> they're

dozen harder balls with teeth CL 22 I

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.440 
dozen harder balls with teeth CL 22 I
like<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.160> that<00:03:34.310> felt<00:03:34.670> get<00:03:34.790> my<00:03:34.910> hands<00:03:35.120> it<00:03:35.299> did

devil massive you know they take like

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.730 
devil massive you know they take like
five<00:03:45.240> ounces<00:03:45.600> out<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.930> demo<00:03:46.080> bat<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:46.650> you

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
five ounces out of the demo bat so you

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.870 
five ounces out of the demo bat so you
make<00:03:47.070> sure<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.280> hot<00:03:47.580> right<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:48.720> anyway<00:03:49.680> so

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
make sure the hot right so anyway so

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.720 
make sure the hot right so anyway so
