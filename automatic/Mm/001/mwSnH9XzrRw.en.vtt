00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
it's basically like a pressure loop sort

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.900 
it's basically like a pressure loop sort
of<00:00:33.940> trap<00:00:34.180> thing<00:00:34.450> and<00:00:35.250> going<00:00:36.250> inside<00:00:36.550> of<00:00:36.760> it<00:00:36.850> and

of like a news position and you will be

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.590 
of like a news position and you will be
trapped<00:00:41.250> snares<00:00:42.250> are<00:00:42.460> only<00:00:42.579> so<00:00:42.880> small<00:00:43.270> so<00:00:43.510> they

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
trapped snares are only so small so they

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.150 
trapped snares are only so small so they
only<00:00:43.720> work<00:00:43.930> for<00:00:44.140> rabbits<00:00:44.469> as<00:00:44.590> we<00:00:44.829> can<00:00:44.980> see<00:00:45.129> here

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
only work for rabbits as we can see here

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.549 
only work for rabbits as we can see here
like<00:00:45.460> he<00:00:45.609> says<00:00:45.850> rabbit<00:00:46.269> snare<00:00:46.510> on<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:47.350> thing

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
like he says rabbit snare on the thing

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:48.900 
like he says rabbit snare on the thing
so<00:00:47.710> we<00:00:47.800> know<00:00:47.920> it's<00:00:47.980> gonna<00:00:48.129> be<00:00:48.280> for<00:00:48.429> rabbits<00:00:48.760> and

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
so we know it's gonna be for rabbits and

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.279 
so we know it's gonna be for rabbits and
there's<00:00:49.480> probably<00:00:49.570> gonna<00:00:49.809> be<00:00:49.899> a<00:00:50.019> way<00:00:50.170> of

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
there's probably gonna be a way of

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:51.869 
there's probably gonna be a way of
baiting<00:00:50.739> them<00:00:50.859> as<00:00:51.010> well<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:51.399> as<00:00:51.550> we<00:00:51.730> all<00:00:51.760> know

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
baiting them as well and as we all know

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.660 
baiting them as well and as we all know
from<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.239> mod<00:00:52.449> because<00:00:53.440> rabbits<00:00:53.920> were<00:00:54.250> harder

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
from the mod because rabbits were harder

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.700 
from the mod because rabbits were harder
to<00:00:54.760> catch<00:00:54.940> Robert<00:00:55.780> me<00:00:55.899> was<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.289> best<00:00:56.440> for

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
to catch Robert me was the best for

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.950 
to catch Robert me was the best for
restoring<00:00:57.190> blood<00:00:57.519> I'm<00:00:58.449> not<00:00:58.629> sure<00:00:58.780> if<00:00:58.839> they're

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
restoring blood I'm not sure if they're

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.509 
restoring blood I'm not sure if they're
gonna<00:00:59.050> carry<00:00:59.320> that<00:00:59.379> on<00:00:59.499> into<00:00:59.649> dayz<00:01:00.280> standalone

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
gonna carry that on into dayz standalone

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.310 
gonna carry that on into dayz standalone
but<00:01:01.089> maybe<00:01:01.300> they<00:01:01.480> will<00:01:01.570> maybe<00:01:01.809> they<00:01:01.989> won't<00:01:02.109> I'm

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
but maybe they will maybe they won't I'm

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.860 
but maybe they will maybe they won't I'm
not<00:01:02.829> too<00:01:02.980> sure<00:01:03.190> so<00:01:03.699> that's<00:01:04.180> pretty<00:01:04.330> cool<00:01:04.420> also
