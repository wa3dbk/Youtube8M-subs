00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.500
 the extraordinary cases not only 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.180
 occur in britain we have searched 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.420
 all over the world the most cases 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.420
 amazing 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.230
 on the other side of the Atlantic the plans of 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.360
 a man is arre the afternoon under the sun 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.760
 of texas became the most 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.349
 Surrealist of the tragedies when it fell 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.770
 in the trap of the deadliest of the 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.770
 bees 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.940
 911 my father is eating it 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.710
 bees had a black face and like 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.730
 five centimeters thick of bees 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.530
 dad has difficulty breathing another 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.129
 every time I tried to move it shut up 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.140
 and they made room for him to attack him more 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.140
 they are killing he believed he was dead 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.160
 the sea the house is a barber of texas a 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.380
 fan of john wayne fond of throwing the 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.989
 tie and now a survivor of a 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.059
 bee attack last summer after 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.220
 a morning dedicated to cutting hair to 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.270
 his clients decided to start some 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.270
 weeds of your land 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.850
 the sea did not know it but it had 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.850
 neighbors from hell 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.500
 on the edges of his property there was a 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.369
 old rusty heater that housed 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.440
 70,000 African bees us the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.900
 we call killer bees are some bugs 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.150
 very dangerous the attacks of the bees 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.850
 they can be caused by some noise 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.659
 strange or vibrations as we say a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.180
 tractor I did not see one or two bees 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.060
 They appeared all at once 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.820
 a dense black and lethal cloud of bees 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.980
 he attacked the sea en bloc 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.470
 More than 2,000 bees attacked the sea in 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.830
 your head focusing on the heat of your 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.110
 breathing he had in his nose 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.910
 He was breathing hard to leave 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.670
 then I tried to breathe and they entered me 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.190
 the mouth and I had to spit the the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.610
 kamikaze colony of killer bees left 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.500
 more than 2,000 stings on his skin 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.680
 I could open my eyes because I 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.420
 It stung me itched in the ears and 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.940
 in the nose I tried to crush them and 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.100
 set aside the sea lost the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.260
 knowledge when the devastating dose 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.950
 of poison from the bees brought him closer every 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.260
 more time to death I told myself that I could not 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.410
 lose consciousness because if it happened 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.090
 they would enter through my mouth and nose and 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.090
 suffocate would kill me 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.030
 the son of the sea started a search for 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.950
 90 minutes to find his father he 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.950
 had collapsed with his head against the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.319
 fence and I thought he was dead 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.060
 when nurses and firefighters 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.000
 they found the sea covered with 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.250
 bees feared lÃ³pez did not move neither 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.430
 it even seemed that breathing was 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.040
 totally motionless 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.469
 the firemen threw foam to kill 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.689
 to the bees although they feared that everything 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:09.060
 It would be useless until they heard that the sea 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.609
 he complained I remember looking at my 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.340
 partner and say goodbye is still alive 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.739
 with the body overflowing with toxic poison 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.590
 and barely breathing they carried the sea to 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.719
 seton medical center his wife saw as 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.969
 the emergency team surrounded him for 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.219
 save your life I only heard a doctor 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.590
 giving orders a nurse punctured him and 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:31.290
 he put a serum on him someone was 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.750
 cutting the jeans another doctor will 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.000
 He asked questions but he did not answer 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.700
 well he said he gets a bee from the 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.829
 ear more than two thousand stings had 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.739
 let the head of the sea cover 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.079
 bruises blisters and black dots what 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.389
 that seemed his city were stingers 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.519
 covering his head and shoulders and the 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.620
 neck the auditory canal in the 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.389
 throat the neck in the eyes the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.040
 to separate the eyelids we saw that he had 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.500
 the line of the lashes covered in 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.569
 sting his head looked like a pincushion the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.939
 sting has like a sack of poison in 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.650
 the end so you grab the tweezers and 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.770
 you approach everything you can to the skin 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.290
 and strips of the sting 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.900
 trying not to squeeze too much so that 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.060
 not to get more venom told them 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.670
 I thought I had some in the veil of 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.100
 palate took some pints and sack eight 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.320
 more of the palate is not that I had a 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.670
 so that there when we finished 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.670
 extract was black 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.689
 the medical staff had difficulties 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.789
 find the number of stingers the 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:35.449
 sea lost the account when they arrived 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:37.490
 to 1200 for many the pain of a single 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.020
 sting is enough but it is the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.000
 poison that can threaten life 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.669
 How do I find the ugliest and puffing going 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.550
 more and more and in the morning not even 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.560
 I saw 50 bites can cause 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.870
 cramps respiratory problems and 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.569
 tachycardia in his condition was still serious and 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.699
 In fact, the poison of 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.710
 100 bees can paralyze the system 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.400
 respiratory system and in certain cases the 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.909
 death 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.129
 Lamar had 20 times that amount started 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.530
 to bleed through the eyes the nose the 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.599
 ears and it's a couple of days after 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.330
 enter the hospital when it should 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:14.530
 go improving 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.240
 I said neymar I love you but he does not 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.430
 he answered 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.460
 the poison also affected the 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.740
 muscles and organs of the sea had damage 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.979
 in the heart muscle in the body in 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.750
 general and also in the kidneys against 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.599
 all forecast the sea started to 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:36.729
 recover but his progress was very 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:39.250
 slow his recovery lasted seven days the 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.680
 dialysis helped eliminate the poison the 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.900
 swelling was subsiding and one after another 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.470
 their organs regained their functionality 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.259
 in the hospital they saved my life after 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.909
 a week in intensive care the sea 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.889
 he was able to return home 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:57.340
 the killer bees did not get away with 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.819
 yours but the attack left its marks a 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.520
 night I woke up fighting against some 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:06.229
 bees 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.229
 Now I have nervous tics 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.200
 and I slaps a beekeeper welcomed 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.600
 70,000 bees from the old hive 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.120
 getting 13 giant honeycombs from 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.370
 1000 I call it the honey of the bees 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.670
 killers had a beautiful color and 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:26.500
 I also knew to glory we were glad 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.500
 that the sea still likes honey
