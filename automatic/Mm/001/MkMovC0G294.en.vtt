00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
active it's ruggedized version as you

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.140 
active it's ruggedized version as you
can<00:00:11.219> see<00:00:11.400> they<00:00:11.969> look<00:00:12.000> almost<00:00:12.660> identical<00:00:17.150> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
can see they look almost identical the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.810 
can see they look almost identical the
main<00:00:18.300> difference<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.230> front<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:20.369> we

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
main difference on the front is that we

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.420 
main difference on the front is that we
have<00:00:20.970> three<00:00:21.720> actual<00:00:22.289> hardware<00:00:22.980> buttons<00:00:23.279> right

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
have three actual hardware buttons right

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.450 
have three actual hardware buttons right

backs is going to be a little bit

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.459 
backs is going to be a little bit
difficult<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.239> there's<00:00:48.690> also<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.079> difference

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
difficult but there's also a difference

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.000 
difficult but there's also a difference
right<00:00:49.649> here<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:51.390> galaxy<00:00:51.899> s<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.620> s4

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
right here the galaxy s this is the s4

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.459 
right here the galaxy s this is the s4
right<00:00:53.219> now<00:00:53.399> has<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.940> 13<00:00:54.510> megapixel<00:00:54.660> camera<00:00:55.440> on

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
right now has a 13 megapixel camera on

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.580 
right now has a 13 megapixel camera on
the<00:00:55.620> back<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.670> galaxy<00:00:57.059> s4<00:00:57.449> active<00:00:57.660> has<00:00:58.230> an

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the back and the galaxy s4 active has an

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.689 
the back and the galaxy s4 active has an
8<00:00:58.980> megapixel<00:00:59.460> sensor<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:01.170> aside<00:01:01.649> there's<00:01:02.070> 2

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
8 megapixel sensor that aside there's 2

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.910

gigs<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.090> RAM<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.510> each<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.199> these<00:01:04.320> these

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
gigs of RAM on each of these these

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.520 
gigs of RAM on each of these these
storage<00:01:05.280> options<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.390> active<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.900> 16

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
storage options on the active are 16

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.100 
storage options on the active are 16
gigabytes<00:01:07.920> expandable<00:01:08.520> via<00:01:08.549> micro<00:01:09.000> SD<00:01:09.420> but

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
gigabytes expandable via micro SD but

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.690 
gigabytes expandable via micro SD but
probably<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.950> main<00:01:11.130> difference<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.640> that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
probably the main difference is that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.120 
probably the main difference is that
while<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.150> would<00:01:12.510> probably<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.890> drop

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
while I would probably not like to drop

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.999 
while I would probably not like to drop
my<00:01:14.400> galaxy<00:01:14.820> s4<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.420> tank<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.840> water<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.799> can

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
my galaxy s4 in a tank of water you can

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.980 
my galaxy s4 in a tank of water you can
drop<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> galaxy<00:01:17.850> s4<00:01:18.150> active<00:01:18.330> because<00:01:18.689> it's

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
drop the galaxy s4 active because it's

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.820 
drop the galaxy s4 active because it's
been<00:01:19.259> rated<00:01:19.850> ip67<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.600> 30<00:01:21.930> minutes

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
been rated ip67 for up to 30 minutes

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.720 
been rated ip67 for up to 30 minutes
up<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.880> meter<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.840> water<00:01:25.260> so<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:26.580> it

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
up to one meter of water so this was it

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.840 
up to one meter of water so this was it
a<00:01:26.880> very<00:01:27.180> short<00:01:27.570> comparison<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.010> galaxy<00:01:29.430> s4

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
a very short comparison of the galaxy s4

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.170 
a very short comparison of the galaxy s4
vs<00:01:30.480> the<00:01:30.600> galaxy<00:01:30.960> s4<00:01:31.290> active<00:01:31.730> here<00:01:32.730> we<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.000> see

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
vs the galaxy s4 active here we can see

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.740 
vs the galaxy s4 active here we can see
a<00:01:33.210> how<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.020> looked<00:01:34.230> side<00:01:34.440> by<00:01:34.620> side<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.750> in

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
a how they looked side by side and in

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.170 
a how they looked side by side and in
terms<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.110> thickness<00:01:37.530> they<00:01:37.890> look<00:01:38.100> almost<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
terms of thickness they look almost the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.980 
terms of thickness they look almost the
same<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.870> in<00:01:40.050> terms<00:01:40.260> of<00:01:41.630> I'd<00:01:42.630> say<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
same and in terms of I'd say that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.960 
same and in terms of I'd say that
they're<00:01:43.140> about<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.650> same<00:01:43.800> that<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.940> for

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
they're about the same that was it for

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.730 
they're about the same that was it for
now<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:45.840> an<00:01:45.990> time<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> pocket<00:01:46.620> now

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
now this was an time for a pocket now

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.250 
now this was an time for a pocket now
taking<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> look<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.030> s4<00:01:48.420> vs<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.900> s4<00:01:49.140> active

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
taking a look at the s4 vs the s4 active

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.080 
taking a look at the s4 vs the s4 active
