00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
you too much because most of the tools

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.110 
you too much because most of the tools
and<00:00:09.540> everything<00:00:09.809> else<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.969> proprietary<00:00:11.969> or

and everything else is proprietary or

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.610 
and everything else is proprietary or
secretive<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.840> lot<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.139> companies<00:00:13.380> do

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
secretive and a lot of the companies do

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.259 
secretive and a lot of the companies do
not<00:00:13.769> like<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.099> being<00:00:14.280> shown<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> wide<00:00:15.000> web

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
not like it being shown on the wide web

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.330 
not like it being shown on the wide web
but<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.020> thought<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.379> you'd<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.920> bit<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
but I thought it you'd like a bit of a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.620 
but I thought it you'd like a bit of a
look<00:00:17.490> at<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.890> 550<00:00:19.890> ton<00:00:20.100> me

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
look at the 550 ton me

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.140 
look at the 550 ton me
I<00:00:21.660> think<00:00:22.290> it's<00:00:22.380> 550<00:00:23.100> ton<00:00:23.310> plant<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.090> us

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
I think it's 550 ton plant for us

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.790 
I think it's 550 ton plant for us
Toshiba<00:00:25.430> that<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.700> the<00:00:27.330> injector<00:00:27.930> unit<00:00:28.350> or

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
Toshiba that is the injector unit or

Toshiba that is the injector unit or
barrel<00:00:30.800> much<00:00:31.800> bigger<00:00:32.099> than<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.279> baton<00:00:32.550> Feld

working<00:01:03.590> properly

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
working properly

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.070

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
yeah

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.820 
yeah
that's<00:01:11.570> pretty<00:01:11.750> straightforward<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.440> set<00:01:12.620> up

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
that's pretty straightforward to set up

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.320 
that's pretty straightforward to set up
we<00:01:14.310> go

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.840 

that's<00:01:18.330> off<00:01:18.480> at<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.690> back<00:01:19.670> though<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
that's off at the back though the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.390 
that's off at the back though the
temperature<00:01:21.330> controls<00:01:21.690> for<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.190> us<00:01:23.190> on<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
temperature controls for the us on the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.790 
temperature controls for the us on the
paternal<00:01:23.610> yep

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
paternal yep

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.640 
paternal yep
so<00:01:25.800> each<00:01:25.950> design<00:01:26.220> has<00:01:26.460> its<00:01:26.580> own<00:01:26.760> heating<00:01:27.030> for

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
so each design has its own heating for

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.810 
so each design has its own heating for
specific<00:01:28.650> materials<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.520> sort<00:01:29.760> of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
specific materials and that sort of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.390 
specific materials and that sort of
thing<00:01:30.140> that's<00:01:31.140> an<00:01:31.290> example<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.680> material<00:01:32.280> it's

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
thing that's an example of material it's

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.240 
thing that's an example of material it's
been<00:01:32.550> purred<00:01:36.470> only<00:01:37.470> does<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.620> get<00:01:37.770> heated<00:01:38.010> in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
been purred only does it get heated in

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.920 
been purred only does it get heated in
the<00:01:38.340> barrel<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.730> it<00:01:38.850> also<00:01:38.970> gets<00:01:39.180> heated<00:01:39.450> in

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the barrel but it also gets heated in

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.080 
the barrel but it also gets heated in
certain<00:01:40.320> parts<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> tool<00:01:41.610> are<00:01:41.760> kept<00:01:41.940> at

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
certain parts of the tool are kept at

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.860 
certain parts of the tool are kept at
predetermined<00:01:42.390> temperatures<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:44.870> allow

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
predetermined temperatures to allow

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.240 
predetermined temperatures to allow
other<00:01:45.990> material<00:01:46.410> to<00:01:46.440> flow<00:01:46.650> instead<00:01:47.130> of

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
other material to flow instead of

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.980 
other material to flow instead of
shorting<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.760> creating<00:01:48.270> missing<00:01:48.840> from

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
shorting in creating missing from

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690 
shorting in creating missing from
basically<00:01:49.470> missing<00:01:49.800> parts<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> molding

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
basically missing parts of the molding

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700 
basically missing parts of the molding
and<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.750> back<00:01:51.900> of<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.080> die<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.260> cannot

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and that's the back of the die I cannot

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.450 
and that's the back of the die I cannot
show<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.130> die<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.750> big<00:01:54.900> machine

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
show you the die but it's a big machine

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.430 
show you the die but it's a big machine
you<00:01:56.460> sort<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.700> get<00:01:56.790> an<00:01:56.910> idea<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:58.050> see<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.260> bit<00:01:58.410> of

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
you sort of get an idea and see a bit of

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.850 
you sort of get an idea and see a bit of
the<00:01:58.560> tool<00:01:58.740> shop<00:01:58.979> at<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.190> end<00:01:59.310> but

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
the tool shop at the end but

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.040 
the tool shop at the end but
that's<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.520> very<00:02:01.730> long<00:02:01.970> machine<00:02:02.360> I'll<00:02:02.780> see<00:02:02.900> if<00:02:02.990> I

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
that's a very long machine I'll see if I

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.290 
that's a very long machine I'll see if I
get<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.230> view<00:02:03.440> from<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.680> back<00:02:04.060> it's<00:02:05.060> just<00:02:05.210> this

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
get a view from the back it's just this

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.580 
get a view from the back it's just this
stuff<00:02:05.480> on<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.720> floor<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.020> can't<00:02:06.350> show<00:02:06.560> you

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
stuff on the floor I can't show you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.260 
stuff on the floor I can't show you
however<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:07.220> being<00:02:07.520> careful<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.090> back

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
however so being careful in the back

I've got you'll have a look and see what

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.590 
I've got you'll have a look and see what
that<00:06:32.510> looks<00:06:32.720> like<00:06:32.780> just<00:06:33.199> a<00:06:33.650> smaller<00:06:33.919> version

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600
