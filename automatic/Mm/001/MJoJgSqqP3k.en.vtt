00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
look at these roads these roads are

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.230 
look at these roads these roads are
immaculate<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.760> supposed<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> be

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
immaculate this is a supposed to be

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.330 
immaculate this is a supposed to be
bombed<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.840> under<00:00:19.050> attack<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.740> not<00:00:20.160> really

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
bombed and under attack and not really

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.010 
bombed and under attack and not really
well<00:00:20.460> maintained<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.000> these<00:00:21.600> roads<00:00:21.840> look

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
well maintained and these roads look

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.630 
well maintained and these roads look
better<00:00:22.170> than<00:00:22.350> every<00:00:22.710> single<00:00:22.740> Road<00:00:23.190> in<00:00:23.310> Welland

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
better than every single Road in Welland

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.010 
better than every single Road in Welland
and<00:00:23.760> probably<00:00:24.270> in<00:00:24.359> whatever<00:00:24.510> town<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.900> live

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
and probably in whatever town you live

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.179 
and probably in whatever town you live
in<00:00:25.170> too<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.650> we're<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.980> make<00:00:26.039> them<00:00:26.130> look

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
in too so we're going to make them look

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.040 
in too so we're going to make them look
just<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.699> little<00:00:26.820> bit<00:00:27.029> more<00:00:27.150> messed<00:00:27.390> up<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
just a little bit more messed up the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.859 
just a little bit more messed up the
crater<00:00:28.289> helps<00:00:28.970> and<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.420> still<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.630> little<00:00:30.720> more

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
crater helps and we still a little more

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.209 
crater helps and we still a little more
work<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.199> over<00:00:31.320> there<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:32.039> what<00:00:32.129> we're

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
work to do over there but what we're

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.410 
work to do over there but what we're
going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.519> actually<00:00:32.669> had<00:00:32.969> some<00:00:33.149> cracks

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
going to do is actually had some cracks

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.939 
going to do is actually had some cracks
to<00:00:33.569> the<00:00:33.659> pavement<00:00:33.809> now<00:00:34.379> we<00:00:34.440> could<00:00:34.710> take<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
to the pavement now we could take a

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.219 
to the pavement now we could take a
sharp<00:00:35.429> knife<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.850> cut<00:00:36.449> cracks<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:36.960> over<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:37.229 
sharp knife and cut cracks all over the

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:39.169 
sharp knife and cut cracks all over the
place<00:00:37.460> that's<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.670> take<00:00:38.699> a<00:00:38.789> really<00:00:39.030> long

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
place that's going to take a really long

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.569 
place that's going to take a really long
time<00:00:39.569> there's<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.019> whole<00:00:40.199> lot<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.409> road<00:00:40.620> here<00:00:40.649> so

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
time there's a whole lot of road here so

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.529 
time there's a whole lot of road here so
what<00:00:41.699> instead<00:00:41.909> we're<00:00:42.089> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.269> do<00:00:42.359> is<00:00:42.449> we're

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
what instead we're going to do is we're

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.569 
what instead we're going to do is we're
gonna<00:00:42.629> use<00:00:42.809> Reaper<00:00:43.079> grey<00:00:43.319> liner<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.399> little

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
gonna use Reaper grey liner and a little

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.250 
gonna use Reaper grey liner and a little
bit<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.699> flow<00:00:44.909> improver<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.989> we're<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.199> to

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
bit of flow improver and we're going to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.860 
bit of flow improver and we're going to
paint<00:00:46.409> our<00:00:46.530> cracks<00:00:46.799> on<00:00:47.539> just<00:00:48.539> need<00:00:48.659> a<00:00:48.690> few

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
paint our cracks on just need a few

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.009 
paint our cracks on just need a few
drops<00:00:49.109> of<00:00:49.260> each<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.959> just<00:00:51.959> mix<00:00:52.139> that<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:54.019> and

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
drops of each and just mix that up and

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.619 
drops of each and just mix that up and
just<00:00:55.440> starting<00:00:55.709> at<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:55.859> edges<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> road

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
just starting at the edges of the road

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.149 
just starting at the edges of the road
going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> bring<00:00:57.959> out<00:00:58.170> basically<00:00:58.709> just<00:00:58.920> little

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
going to bring out basically just little

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.939 
going to bring out basically just little
jagged<00:00:59.399> lines<00:01:00.350> taking<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:01.409> up<00:01:01.529> a<00:01:01.619> little<00:01:01.649> bit

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
jagged lines taking them up a little bit

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:23.150 
jagged lines taking them up a little bit
towards<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.339> back

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.770 

remember<00:01:24.160> roads<00:01:24.400> crack<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:25.000> most<00:01:25.270> at<00:01:25.540> the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
remember roads crack the most at the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.530 
remember roads crack the most at the
edges<00:01:25.930> of<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.170> road<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:26.650> then<00:01:27.310> any<00:01:28.030> cracks

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
edges of the road and then any cracks

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.620 
edges of the road and then any cracks
really<00:01:28.840> kind<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.020> run<00:01:29.230> along<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.860> road<00:01:30.630> they

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
really kind of run along the road they

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.670 
really kind of run along the road they
don't<00:01:31.780> really<00:01:31.870> crack<00:01:32.140> in<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.320> direction<00:01:32.470> of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
don't really crack in the direction of

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.370 
don't really crack in the direction of
traffic<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.160> much<00:01:33.280> they<00:01:33.430> crack<00:01:33.610> against<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.380> so

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
traffic so much they crack against it so

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.110 
traffic so much they crack against it so
we<00:01:35.530> had<00:01:35.680> cracks<00:01:35.950> out<00:01:36.160> here<00:01:36.400> they<00:01:36.580> probably<00:01:36.820> run

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
we had cracks out here they probably run

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.740 
we had cracks out here they probably run
sort<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.870> this<00:01:38.020> way<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:39.330> cracks<00:01:40.330> going<00:01:40.540> across

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
sort of this way and cracks going across

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.210 
sort of this way and cracks going across
the<00:01:40.960> road<00:01:41.080> tend<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.320> be<00:01:41.410> really<00:01:41.650> quite<00:01:41.890> long

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
the road tend to be really quite long

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.760 
the road tend to be really quite long
and<00:01:42.460> narrow<00:01:43.170> unless<00:01:44.170> there's<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.410> pothole

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
and narrow unless there's a pothole

00:01:44.770 --> 00:02:03.770 
and narrow unless there's a pothole
involved

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.520 

another<00:02:04.780> thing<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:05.079> that<00:02:05.140> when<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.380> get<00:02:05.500> a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
another thing is that when you get a

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.899 
another thing is that when you get a
like<00:02:05.920> I'm<00:02:06.100> sort<00:02:06.460> of<00:02:06.490> making<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> bit<00:02:06.789> of<00:02:06.820> a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
like I'm sort of making a bit of a

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.960 
like I'm sort of making a bit of a
pothole<00:02:07.329> here<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:08.580> pavement<00:02:09.580> towards<00:02:09.849> the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
pothole here and pavement towards the

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.490 
pothole here and pavement towards the
edge<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.300> potholes<00:02:10.629> tends<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:11.050> crumble<00:02:11.349> a

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
edge of the potholes tends to crumble a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.170 
edge of the potholes tends to crumble a
little<00:02:11.709> bit<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.640> easiest<00:02:12.849> way<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.060> do

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
little bit and the easiest way to do

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.369 
little bit and the easiest way to do
that<00:02:13.209> is<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:13.480> do<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.840> whole<00:02:14.080> lot<00:02:14.110> of

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
that is just do it a whole lot of

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.949 
that is just do it a whole lot of
smaller<00:02:14.860> lines<00:02:15.450> make<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.569> look<00:02:16.660> like<00:02:16.780> things

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
smaller lines make it look like things

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.009 
smaller lines make it look like things
are<00:02:17.050> kind<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.230> falling<00:02:17.349> apart<00:02:18.629> even<00:02:19.629> cross

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
are kind of falling apart even cross

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.710 
are kind of falling apart even cross
hatch<00:02:20.230> them<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.470> little<00:02:20.590> bit<00:02:21.299> big<00:02:22.299> locate<00:02:22.569> some

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
hatch them a little bit big locate some

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.970 
hatch them a little bit big locate some
of<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.870> pavements<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.170> little<00:02:23.319> bit<00:02:23.410> loose

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.949 

that's<00:02:30.730> really<00:02:30.970> all<00:02:31.060> there<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.569> making<00:02:31.659> a

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
that's really all there is to making a

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.470 
that's really all there is to making a
good<00:02:32.500> low<00:02:32.709> road<00:02:33.129> look<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.790> little<00:02:33.909> more<00:02:34.030> beat<00:02:34.330> up

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
good low road look a little more beat up

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:43.210 
good low road look a little more beat up
adding<00:02:35.290> lots<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.590> little<00:02:35.709> thin<00:02:35.890> lines

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.290 

and<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.400> here<00:02:44.550> we've<00:02:44.700> got<00:02:44.730> an<00:02:44.940> area<00:02:45.150> we've

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
and so here we've got an area we've

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.900 
and so here we've got an area we've
already<00:02:45.450> finished<00:02:45.900> we've<00:02:46.860> got<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.070> few<00:02:47.370> bigger

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
already finished we've got a few bigger

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.420 
already finished we've got a few bigger
potholes<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.930> there's<00:02:49.710> lots<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.010> cracking

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
potholes and there's lots of cracking

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.490 
potholes and there's lots of cracking
along<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.760> edges<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.330> saying<00:02:52.290> all<00:02:52.380> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
along the edges and saying all the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500 
along the edges and saying all the
cracks<00:02:52.740> do<00:02:52.950> kind<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.280> really<00:02:53.520> run<00:02:53.730> along<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
cracks do kind of really run along the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.270 
cracks do kind of really run along the
length<00:02:54.660> or<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.080> width<00:02:55.740> of<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.920> road<00:02:56.070> rather

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
length or the width of the road rather

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.810 
length or the width of the road rather
than<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.580> length<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:58.220> more<00:02:59.220> cracks<00:02:59.490> towards

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
than the length and more cracks towards

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.360 
than the length and more cracks towards
the<00:02:59.910> edges<00:03:00.060> just<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:01.680> pavement<00:03:01.950> tends<00:03:02.250> to

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
the edges just to this pavement tends to

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:10.370 
the edges just to this pavement tends to
break<00:03:02.520> up<00:03:02.730> away<00:03:03.030> from<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.270> edge

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.280 

that's<00:03:11.100> it
