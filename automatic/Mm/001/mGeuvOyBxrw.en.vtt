stake<00:01:04.920> um<00:01:05.280> well<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> mean<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:07.590> all

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
stake um well I mean we all have we all

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.920 
stake um well I mean we all have we all
have<00:01:07.950> real<00:01:08.490> jobs<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.360> we've<00:01:09.540> kind<00:01:09.690> of<00:01:09.810> been

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
have real jobs and so we've kind of been

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.780 
have real jobs and so we've kind of been
doing<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.259> in<00:01:10.380> our<00:01:10.500> part-time<00:01:10.800> four<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.640> five

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
doing it in our part-time four or five

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.090 
doing it in our part-time four or five
weeks<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.330> guess<00:01:12.509> has<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.200> really<00:01:13.440> grown<00:01:13.830> in

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
weeks I guess has this really grown in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.800 
weeks I guess has this really grown in
you<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.940> one<00:01:15.119> fifth<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:15.690> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you know the one fifth and all the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.660 
you know the one fifth and all the
different<00:01:16.110> divisions<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.950> we're<00:01:17.250> up

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
different divisions for this we're up

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.450 
different divisions for this we're up
just<00:01:18.090> over<00:01:18.210> 70<00:01:18.750> entries<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:20.039> I<00:01:20.070> mean<00:01:20.280> for

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
just over 70 entries so so I mean for

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.340 
just over 70 entries so so I mean for
fifth<00:01:20.670> scale<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.910> think<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.509> that's<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
fifth scale I think that that's that's a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
fifth scale I think that that's that's a
good<00:01:22.740> attendance<00:01:23.160> we<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.610> some<00:01:23.789> Americans

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
good attendance we have some Americans

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
about durability are they a lot more

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.530 
about durability are they a lot more
durable<00:01:51.689> well<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> mean<00:01:52.590> yes<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.820> guess<00:01:54.119> they<00:01:54.360> are

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
durable well I mean yes I guess they are

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.929 
durable well I mean yes I guess they are
but<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:55.890> when<00:01:56.130> you're<00:01:56.280> racing<00:01:56.490> stuff

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
but you know when you're racing stuff

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.090 
but you know when you're racing stuff
there's<00:01:57.240> there's<00:01:57.750> some<00:01:57.990> heavy<00:01:58.200> crashes<00:01:58.799> and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
there's there's some heavy crashes and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.160 
there's there's some heavy crashes and
you<00:01:59.850> know<00:01:59.939> they<00:02:00.090> get<00:02:00.240> knocked<00:02:00.479> around<00:02:00.630> so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you know they get knocked around so

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.740 
you know they get knocked around so
sometimes<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:02.939> are<00:02:03.090> durable<00:02:03.360> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
sometimes I think they are durable and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.319 
sometimes I think they are durable and
other<00:02:03.869> times<00:02:04.200> not<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.250> much<00:02:05.579> that's<00:02:05.969> all<00:02:06.180> mine

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
other times not so much that's all mine

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.730 
other times not so much that's all mine
this<00:02:06.659> depends<00:02:06.960> how<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.140> tried<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.619> well

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
this depends how you tried it well

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.440 
this depends how you tried it well

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
a lot of fun to get into oh yeah like

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.980 
a lot of fun to get into oh yeah like
like<00:02:55.610> it's<00:02:55.790> explain<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.360> little<00:02:56.600> bit<00:02:56.780> how<00:02:56.930> you

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
like it's explain a little bit how you

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.880 
like it's explain a little bit how you
got<00:02:57.320> into<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.740> I<00:02:58.240> did<00:02:59.240> used<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.750> do<00:03:00.320> motocross
