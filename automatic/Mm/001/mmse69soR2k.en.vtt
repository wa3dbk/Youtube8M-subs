good way to learning stuff so now that

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.560 
good way to learning stuff so now that
that's<00:03:12.780> done<00:03:12.959> we<00:03:13.290> can<00:03:13.680> put<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.920> sail<00:03:14.130> up<00:03:14.570> and

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
that's done we can put the sail up and

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.720 
that's done we can put the sail up and
start<00:03:15.870> getting<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.170> lines<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.550> right

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
start getting the lines in the right

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:40.670 
start getting the lines in the right
places

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680

mean we're sailing some pretty crazy

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.530 
mean we're sailing some pretty crazy
places<00:04:34.639> so<00:04:34.880> like<00:04:35.090> behind<00:04:35.840> huge<00:04:36.380> cliffs<00:04:36.830> and

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
places so like behind huge cliffs and

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.180 
places so like behind huge cliffs and
stuff<00:04:38.540> like<00:04:38.660> that<00:04:38.840> in<00:04:38.960> Lake<00:04:39.440> Garda<00:04:39.800> this<00:04:39.950> year

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
stuff like that in Lake Garda this year

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.629 
stuff like that in Lake Garda this year
we<00:04:40.310> had<00:04:40.490> a<00:04:40.729> race<00:04:41.450> it<00:04:41.750> was<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:43.040> wind<00:04:43.220> I've<00:04:43.400> never

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
we had a race it was the wind I've never

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.570 
we had a race it was the wind I've never
seen<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:43.970> wind<00:04:44.180> shift<00:04:44.540> so<00:04:44.840> much<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.410> puff<00:04:46.370> in

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
seen the wind shift so much and puff in

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.440 
seen the wind shift so much and puff in
and<00:04:46.790> out<00:04:46.910> so<00:04:47.180> much<00:04:48.100> shifts<00:04:49.100> close<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.580> 180

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
and out so much shifts close to 180

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.690 
and out so much shifts close to 180
degrees<00:04:50.840> within<00:04:51.229> races<00:04:51.770> certainly<00:04:52.280> that's

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
degrees within races certainly that's

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.230 
degrees within races certainly that's
pretty<00:04:53.000> crazy<00:04:53.180> late<00:04:54.490> so<00:04:55.490> this<00:04:55.610> first<00:04:55.790> line<00:04:55.940> I'm

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
pretty crazy late so this first line I'm

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.200 
pretty crazy late so this first line I'm
sitting<00:04:56.600> up<00:04:56.720> here<00:04:58.990> this<00:04:59.990> controls<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:01.210> shape

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
sitting up here this controls the shape

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.080 
sitting up here this controls the shape
at<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.479> bottom<00:05:02.510> of<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:02.930> sail<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:03.770> sight

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
at the bottom of the sail and the sight

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.460 
at the bottom of the sail and the sight
you<00:05:05.090> cannot<00:05:05.360> be<00:05:05.510> loosing<00:05:05.840> it<00:05:05.960> to<00:05:06.110> make<00:05:06.290> it

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
you cannot be loosing it to make it

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.900 
you cannot be loosing it to make it
deeper<00:05:07.100> and<00:05:07.520> tighten<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.389> to<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:10.520> make<00:05:10.669> it<00:05:10.790> more

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
deeper and tighten it to to make it more

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:21.760 
deeper and tighten it to to make it more
flat

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.740 

this<00:05:22.770> second<00:05:23.130> one<00:05:23.270> this<00:05:24.270> is<00:05:24.390> called<00:05:24.600> the

kicker and this just

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:38.199 
kicker and this just
slots<00:05:31.159> into<00:05:31.369> the<00:05:31.550> boom<00:05:31.729> here<00:05:37.059> and<00:05:38.059> what<00:05:38.179> that

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:38.209 
slots into the boom here and what that

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:42.299 
slots into the boom here and what that
does<00:05:38.539> is<00:05:39.369> affects<00:05:40.369> how<00:05:40.580> bent<00:05:41.419> the<00:05:41.539> mast<00:05:41.749> is<00:05:42.019> and

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:42.309 
does is affects how bent the mast is and

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:46.479 
does is affects how bent the mast is and
how<00:05:43.309> tight<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:43.789> back<00:05:43.939> of<00:05:44.089> the<00:05:44.149> sail<00:05:44.360> is<00:05:45.399> so<00:05:46.399> it

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:46.489 
how tight the back of the sail is so it

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:55.620 
how tight the back of the sail is so it
gives<00:05:46.639> the<00:05:46.759> sail<00:05:46.969> more<00:05:47.179> shape

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630

downwind you have it at 90 degrees to
the<00:06:13.580> boat<00:06:15.580> and<00:06:16.580> this<00:06:16.700> is<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:17.140> the<00:06:18.140> main<00:06:18.350> the

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.540 

and<00:06:34.250> this<00:06:34.400> last<00:06:34.639> one<00:06:34.759> is<00:06:35.120> called<00:06:35.300> the<00:06:35.570> downhill

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
and this last one is called the downhill

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.990 
and this last one is called the downhill
and<00:06:37.550> that<00:06:38.289> adjusts<00:06:39.289> how<00:06:39.620> tight<00:06:39.949> the<00:06:40.550> sail<00:06:40.789> is

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
and that adjusts how tight the sail is

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.740 
and that adjusts how tight the sail is
on<00:06:41.300> the<00:06:41.570> mast<00:06:41.780> up<00:06:42.050> here<00:06:42.759> it<00:06:43.759> helps<00:06:43.880> take<00:06:44.300> take

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
on the mast up here it helps take take

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.950 
on the mast up here it helps take take
the<00:06:44.840> creases<00:06:45.229> up<00:06:45.410> and<00:06:46.060> when<00:06:47.060> it<00:06:47.180> gets<00:06:47.300> windy<00:06:47.479> it

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
the creases up and when it gets windy it

00:06:47.960 --> 00:07:07.950 
the creases up and when it gets windy it
helps<00:06:48.229> to<00:06:48.410> detail<00:06:48.800> with<00:06:48.979> the<00:06:49.070> sail

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.660 

and<00:07:08.960> it's<00:07:09.080> that<00:07:09.230> quick<00:07:09.410> to<00:07:09.650> rigors<00:07:10.280> rigor

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:10.670 
and it's that quick to rigors rigor

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.390 
and it's that quick to rigors rigor
laser<00:07:10.910> up<00:07:11.710> we've<00:07:12.710> got<00:07:12.800> a<00:07:12.830> couple<00:07:13.130> of<00:07:13.190> extra

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
laser up we've got a couple of extra

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.180 
laser up we've got a couple of extra
bits<00:07:13.640> that<00:07:13.880> this<00:07:14.390> is<00:07:14.540> the<00:07:14.660> center<00:07:15.020> board<00:07:15.200> which

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.190 
bits that this is the center board which

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.700 
bits that this is the center board which
are<00:07:16.460> slots<00:07:17.180> down<00:07:17.390> here<00:07:17.660> and<00:07:17.840> that<00:07:18.320> stops<00:07:18.620> the

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710 
are slots down here and that stops the

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.810 
are slots down here and that stops the
boat<00:07:18.920> from<00:07:19.130> drifting<00:07:19.520> against<00:07:20.420> the<00:07:20.570> wind<00:07:20.780> and

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820 
boat from drifting against the wind and

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.700 
boat from drifting against the wind and
otherwise<00:07:22.820> without<00:07:23.150> that<00:07:23.360> the<00:07:23.840> wind<00:07:24.050> the<00:07:24.530> wind

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710 
otherwise without that the wind the wind

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.960 
otherwise without that the wind the wind
would<00:07:24.860> just<00:07:25.040> take<00:07:25.220> you<00:07:25.250> down<00:07:25.520> when<00:07:25.730> you'd

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:25.970 
would just take you down when you'd

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.020 
would just take you down when you'd
never<00:07:26.150> make<00:07:26.360> any<00:07:26.570> progress<00:07:26.840> into<00:07:27.230> it<00:07:27.440> and<00:07:28.030> when

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.030 
never make any progress into it and when

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.130 
never make any progress into it and when
I<00:07:29.120> get<00:07:29.270> onto<00:07:29.390> the<00:07:29.570> water<00:07:30.310> this<00:07:31.310> just<00:07:31.960> goes<00:07:32.960> down

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.140 
I get onto the water this just goes down

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.850 
I get onto the water this just goes down
like<00:07:33.290> that<00:07:33.350> and<00:07:33.940> you<00:07:34.940> use<00:07:35.120> this<00:07:35.330> to<00:07:36.280> steer<00:07:37.280> very

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:38.860 
like that and you use this to steer very

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:55.300 
like that and you use this to steer very
simple<00:07:42.610> that's<00:07:43.610> it

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:55.310 

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.370
