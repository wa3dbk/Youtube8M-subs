and<00:01:18.140> who<00:01:19.140> he<00:01:19.290> lost<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.740> too<00:01:19.890> i<00:01:19.920> think<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and who he lost it too i think is the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.370 
and who he lost it too i think is the
biggest<00:01:20.729> problem<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:22.080> how<00:01:22.320> do

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
biggest problem with this because how do

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.109 
biggest problem with this because how do
