00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
invented the Pringles can I thought this

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.750 
invented the Pringles can I thought this
was<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:05.940> joke<00:00:06.299> but<00:00:06.569> uh<00:00:06.899> it<00:00:07.589> happened<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.400> guy

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.070 
that invented the Pringles can doesn't
seem<00:00:11.730> like<00:00:11.910> that's<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.179> great<00:00:12.450> they're<00:00:12.809> saying

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
about Pringles can you think every

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.870 
about Pringles can you think every
Christmas<00:01:19.560> every<00:01:19.740> gift<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.640> Pringles

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
Christmas every gift was in a Pringles

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120 
Christmas every gift was in a Pringles
can<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.689> see<00:01:21.810> everything<00:01:22.229> wrapped<00:01:22.530> up<00:01:22.799> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.850 
can just see everything wrapped up that
round<00:01:23.460> stupid<00:01:24.210> cylinder<00:01:24.720> enough<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
round stupid cylinder enough with the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.710 
round stupid cylinder enough with the
stupid<00:01:25.920> round<00:01:26.580> cylinder<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.450> size

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
stupid round cylinder with this size

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.030 
stupid round cylinder with this size
because<00:01:28.049> there's<00:01:28.229> no<00:01:28.350> good<00:01:28.530> way<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> wrap

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
because there's no good way to wrap

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.620 
because there's no good way to wrap
something<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> sides<00:01:30.390> are

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
something like that so the sides are

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.280 
something like that so the sides are
like<00:01:31.259> browning<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.220> full<00:01:32.610> their<00:01:33.299> twisted<00:01:33.720> yeah
