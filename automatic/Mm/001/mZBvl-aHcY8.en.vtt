00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
take a hit if that makes sense

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.809 
take a hit if that makes sense
so<00:02:16.120> originally<00:02:16.690> he<00:02:17.170> was<00:02:17.319> he<00:02:18.250> was<00:02:18.430> planning<00:02:18.790> to

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
so originally he was he was planning to

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.520 
so originally he was he was planning to
upload<00:02:19.060> mid-july<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:19.930> was<00:02:20.080> planning<00:02:20.500> to

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
upload mid-july and I was planning to

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.710 
upload mid-july and I was planning to
upload<00:02:20.830> at<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.280> end<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.549> July<00:02:21.790> 2<00:02:21.849> weeks<00:02:22.239> gap<00:02:22.540> I

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
upload at the end of July 2 weeks gap I

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.059 
upload at the end of July 2 weeks gap I
think<00:02:23.019> is<00:02:23.170> pretty<00:02:23.379> good<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:23.769> honest<00:02:23.980> with

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
think is pretty good to be honest with

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.130 
think is pretty good to be honest with
you<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.790> allows<00:02:24.909> it<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.239> die<00:02:25.480> down<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:26.049> then

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
you it allows it to die down and then

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.380 
you it allows it to die down and then
everyone's<00:02:26.590> ready<00:02:26.799> for<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.980> next<00:02:27.190> montage<00:02:27.400> so

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
everyone's ready for the next montage so

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.660 
everyone's ready for the next montage so
two<00:02:28.450> weeks<00:02:28.959> was<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.470> good<00:02:30.069> little<00:02:30.250> break<00:02:30.489> I

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
two weeks was a good little break I

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.270 
two weeks was a good little break I
think<00:02:30.700> but<00:02:31.660> he's<00:02:32.110> got<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.349> new<00:02:32.500> editor<00:02:32.799> now<00:02:32.950> I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
think but he's got a new editor now I

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.550 
think but he's got a new editor now I
think<00:02:33.610> it's<00:02:33.849> phased<00:02:34.090> SLP<00:02:34.750> who's<00:02:34.930> doing<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.290> who

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
think it's phased SLP who's doing it who

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.559 
think it's phased SLP who's doing it who
you<00:02:35.799> know<00:02:35.980> that's<00:02:36.190> going<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.370> be<00:02:36.430> crazy<00:02:36.700> but

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
you know that's going to be crazy but

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:38.640 
you know that's going to be crazy but
he's<00:02:37.750> obviously<00:02:37.900> going<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.230> take<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.440> lot

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
he's obviously going to take a lot

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.259 
he's obviously going to take a lot
longer<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.250> because<00:02:39.549> he's<00:02:39.849> one<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.090> those

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
longer on it because he's one of those

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.970 
longer on it because he's one of those
editors<00:02:40.569> who<00:02:40.750> just<00:02:40.989> takes<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.349> lot<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.530> time<00:02:41.709> and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
editors who just takes a lot of time and

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.869 
editors who just takes a lot of time and
makes<00:02:42.159> it<00:02:42.310> look<00:02:42.400> awesome<00:02:42.579> so<00:02:43.569> he's<00:02:44.260> obviously

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
makes it look awesome so he's obviously

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.770 
makes it look awesome so he's obviously
going<00:02:45.879> to<00:02:45.940> take<00:02:46.120> his<00:02:46.239> time<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.569> I<00:02:46.629> think

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
going to take his time and I think

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.910 
going to take his time and I think
that's<00:02:46.959> going<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.110> take<00:02:47.200> over<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.590> wants<00:02:47.799> to

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
that's going to take over and wants to

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.759 
that's going to take over and wants to
do<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.310> we<00:02:48.549> decided<00:02:49.109> we'd<00:02:50.109> probably<00:02:50.500> switch

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
do so we decided we'd probably switch

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.619 
do so we decided we'd probably switch
spots<00:02:51.129> so<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.459> think<00:02:51.910> my<00:02:52.030> I'm<00:02:52.329> going<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.540> be

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
spots so I think my I'm going to be

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:53.970 
spots so I think my I'm going to be
blown<00:02:52.870> in<00:02:52.989> mid-july<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.440> he's<00:02:53.650> going<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:53.859> be

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
blown in mid-july and he's going to be

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.830 
blown in mid-july and he's going to be
learning<00:02:54.190> late<00:02:54.459> July<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.090> that's<00:02:55.540> if<00:02:55.720> all

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
learning late July so that's if all
