headphones I think they look awesome
when<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:17.790> they<00:02:18.450> did<00:02:18.630> include<00:02:18.750> a

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
when you do that so they did include a

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.360 
when you do that so they did include a
gray<00:02:19.050> cable<00:02:19.260> now<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.890> doesn't<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
gray cable now it doesn't have the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.160 
gray cable now it doesn't have the
inline<00:02:20.700> mic<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.209> do<00:02:21.390> have<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> trade<00:02:22.019> off

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
inline mic so you do have a trade off

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.930 
inline mic so you do have a trade off
but<00:02:22.560> they<00:02:23.130> also<00:02:23.250> give<00:02:23.519> you<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.700> one<00:02:23.819> right

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
but they also give you that one right

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.910 
but they also give you that one right
