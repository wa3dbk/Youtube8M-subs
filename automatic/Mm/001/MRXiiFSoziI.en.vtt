drummers<00:00:29.460> generally<00:00:30.210> get<00:00:30.750> hung<00:00:31.140> up<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
drummers generally get hung up what the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.430 
drummers generally get hung up what the
material<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> drum<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.809> company<00:00:34.410> that

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
material of the drum is a company that

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.860 
material of the drum is a company that
manufactures<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.579> many<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.450> them<00:00:36.719> don't

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
manufactures it many of them don't

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.260 
manufactures it many of them don't
understand<00:00:37.469> where<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.070> real<00:00:38.250> sound<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
understand where the real sound of the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.979 
understand where the real sound of the
drum<00:00:39.510> originates<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.550> where<00:00:42.329> drum

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
drum originates and that is where drum

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.869 
drum originates and that is where drum
head<00:00:43.230> meets<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.829> bearing<00:00:44.219> edge<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> drum

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
head meets the bearing edge of the drum

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.060 
head meets the bearing edge of the drum
when<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.539> drum<00:00:48.840> head<00:00:49.020> meets<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> shell<00:00:49.710> we

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
when the drum head meets the shell we

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.340 
when the drum head meets the shell we
want<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> flat<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.879> head<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.989> plane

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
want the flat of the head here the plane

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650 
want the flat of the head here the plane
to<00:00:52.829> meet<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.370> bearing<00:00:53.820> edge<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.449> what

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
to meet that bearing edge and what

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.020 
to meet that bearing edge and what
happens<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.379> other<00:00:55.590> companies<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.850> head

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
happens with other companies is the head

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.880 
happens with other companies is the head
is<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:57.870> sitting<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> bearing

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
is not really sitting on the bearing

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.709 
is not really sitting on the bearing
edge<00:00:59.070> then<00:00:59.430> what<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> drummer<00:01:00.000> has<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.359> do<00:01:00.539> is

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
edge then what the drummer has to do is

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
edge then what the drummer has to do is
puts<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.170> counter<00:01:01.500> hoop<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.100> he<00:01:02.250> tightens

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
puts the counter hoop on and he tightens

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.090 
puts the counter hoop on and he tightens
the<00:01:02.879> lugs<00:01:03.149> down<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> head<00:01:04.409> does<00:01:04.710> sit

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the lugs down so that the head does sit

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.820 
the lugs down so that the head does sit
flat<00:01:05.489> whereas<00:01:06.210> when<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.689> put<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.500> level

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
flat whereas when you put on the level

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.700 
flat whereas when you put on the level
360<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.090> head<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.479> level<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.320> bearing

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
360 the head is level on that bearing

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.910 
360 the head is level on that bearing
edge<00:01:11.000> 360<00:01:12.000> degrees

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.660 

so<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:15.550> 1995<00:01:16.450> I<00:01:16.780> kind<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.350> made<00:01:17.860> drum<00:01:18.159> heads<00:01:18.400> my

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
so in 1995 I kind of made drum heads my

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.550 
so in 1995 I kind of made drum heads my
life<00:01:18.909> like<00:01:19.210> I<00:01:19.360> made<00:01:19.540> strings<00:01:19.870> my<00:01:20.050> life<00:01:20.260> prior

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
life like I made strings my life prior

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.800 
life like I made strings my life prior
to<00:01:20.860> that<00:01:21.010> drum<00:01:21.880> heads<00:01:22.090> looked<00:01:22.360> like<00:01:22.510> a<00:01:22.540> very

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
to that drum heads looked like a very

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.899 
to that drum heads looked like a very
simple<00:01:23.260> thing<00:01:23.470> they're<00:01:23.830> made<00:01:24.520> from<00:01:24.760> a

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
simple thing they're made from a

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.260 
simple thing they're made from a
polyester<00:01:25.869> film<00:01:26.140> and<00:01:27.030> usually<00:01:28.030> in<00:01:28.150> an

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
polyester film and usually in an

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.600 
polyester film and usually in an
aluminum<00:01:28.540> hoop<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.140> if<00:01:30.010> you<00:01:30.130> look<00:01:30.310> at<00:01:30.460> it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
aluminum hoop and if you look at it

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.859 
aluminum hoop and if you look at it
you'd<00:01:30.850> probably<00:01:30.880> say<00:01:31.240> well<00:01:31.360> that<00:01:31.509> looks<00:01:31.540> like

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
you'd probably say well that looks like

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.270 
you'd probably say well that looks like
it's<00:01:32.020> easy<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.350> make<00:01:32.560> but<00:01:32.830> it<00:01:32.920> really<00:01:33.070> isn't

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
it's easy to make but it really isn't

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.160 
it's easy to make but it really isn't
the<00:01:33.490> fluted<00:01:33.820> molds<00:01:34.150> are<00:01:34.240> very<00:01:34.479> complicated

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
the fluted molds are very complicated

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.749 
the fluted molds are very complicated
they<00:01:35.500> made<00:01:35.680> out<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.860> a<00:01:35.920> special<00:01:36.100> cast<00:01:36.490> iron

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
they made out of a special cast iron

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.090 
they made out of a special cast iron
that<00:01:36.940> is<00:01:37.180> heat<00:01:37.330> stabilized<00:01:37.900> everything<00:01:38.860> this

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
that is heat stabilized everything this

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.980 
that is heat stabilized everything this
computer-controlled<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:40.119> all<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.390> molds<00:01:40.750> so

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
computer-controlled on all the molds so

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.899 
computer-controlled on all the molds so
over<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.350> last<00:01:41.710> few<00:01:41.950> years<00:01:42.040> we've<00:01:42.460> made<00:01:42.610> quite

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
over the last few years we've made quite

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.149 
over the last few years we've made quite
a<00:01:42.970> number<00:01:43.270> of<00:01:43.420> prototypes<00:01:43.750> we<00:01:44.590> made<00:01:44.740> aluminum

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
a number of prototypes we made aluminum

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.910 
a number of prototypes we made aluminum
molds<00:01:45.550> of<00:01:45.880> various<00:01:46.509> shapes<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:47.080> put<00:01:47.770> them

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
molds of various shapes and put them

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.400 
molds of various shapes and put them
through<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:48.100> rigorous<00:01:48.390> testing<00:01:49.390> we<00:01:50.110> ended<00:01:50.320> up

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
through a rigorous testing we ended up

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.680 
through a rigorous testing we ended up
with<00:01:50.680> about<00:01:50.860> six<00:01:51.340> iterations<00:01:51.520> over<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.539> last

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
with about six iterations over the last

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.690 
with about six iterations over the last
few<00:01:52.930> years<00:01:53.229> before<00:01:53.800> we<00:01:54.039> settled<00:01:54.340> on<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.550> one

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
few years before we settled on the one

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.980 
few years before we settled on the one
that<00:01:54.850> we're<00:01:55.149> using<00:01:55.300> now<00:01:55.539> that<00:01:55.750> we<00:01:55.869> are

we<00:03:11.510> just<00:03:11.660> want<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.870> play<00:03:11.930> from<00:03:12.230> Illinois<00:03:12.739> booms

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
we just want to play from Illinois booms

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.130 
we just want to play from Illinois booms
come<00:03:13.910> on<00:03:14.060> have<00:03:14.239> them<00:03:14.330> sound<00:03:14.540> good<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:14.989> this

will<00:03:15.290> do<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.620> our<00:03:16.010> DNA<00:03:16.760> is<00:03:17.180> about<00:03:17.480> continuous

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
will do that our DNA is about continuous

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.590 
will do that our DNA is about continuous
improvement<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:19.519> even<00:03:19.820> if<00:03:19.910> it's<00:03:20.090> something

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
that we're making a great version of

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.490 
that we're making a great version of
we're<00:03:23.269> gonna<00:03:23.390> be<00:03:23.600> looking<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:24.050> make<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.320> better

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
we're gonna be looking to make it better

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.010 
we're gonna be looking to make it better
