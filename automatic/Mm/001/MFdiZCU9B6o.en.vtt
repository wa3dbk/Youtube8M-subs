obtrusive it's not as thick as i'd say

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:17.069 
obtrusive it's not as thick as i'd say
like<00:04:13.689> an<00:04:13.840> otter<00:04:14.079> box<00:04:14.699> and<00:04:15.699> it<00:04:15.939> still<00:04:16.419> adds<00:04:16.659> a

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
like an otter box and it still adds a

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.240 
like an otter box and it still adds a
good<00:04:17.769> amount<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.340> protection<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.840> phone

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
good amount of protection to the phone

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.860 
good amount of protection to the phone
so<00:04:21.250> down<00:04:22.210> here<00:04:22.270> you<00:04:22.900> still<00:04:23.229> can<00:04:23.440> access<00:04:23.860> the
