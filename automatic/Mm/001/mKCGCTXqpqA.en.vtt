00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
dresser but then we thought well we

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.340 
dresser but then we thought well we
could<00:03:10.090> just<00:03:10.209> get<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.390> mount<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.900> mount<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.230> on

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
the wall and stick it out but if we do

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.390 
the wall and stick it out but if we do
this<00:03:13.959> painting<00:03:16.739> we<00:03:17.739> would<00:03:17.890> put<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.130> on<00:03:18.250> this

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400
