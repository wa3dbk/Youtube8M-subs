00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.519
 start from this time in all 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:52.940
 There are nine dragon masks 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:59.900
 everyone has a different power and these 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:05.600
 masks worn by priests are 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:10.670
 dragon states is nothing like that 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:14.000
 then now this barrel a gentleman 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.869
 supreme then that of 5 de oro and not 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.869
 in short, he knows nothing 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.930
 now I have to go outside for 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:28.730
 fight polsky I create seven faces 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.340
 game but surely we are not here 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.790
 dragon priests are hiding inside 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.810
 this photo is just the word the 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.340
 dragon usually 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:47.090
 the questions on board come out then they are 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.090
 certainly out of the others 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:59.810
 even if I don't catch you, here are these 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:04.670
 are the masks this once evolved 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.130
 he took all nine masks must 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:14.150
 go to the truth young the abi believes 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:16.220
 use that is under mortal and in this 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.870
 place we will have to go to get 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.530
 other types of masks and like the 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:29.090
 wooden mask I would always like to 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:31.430
 you have to get inside this kind of sum 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.800
 Musotti 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.360
 in short, this area 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.950
 you will find near the ground 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.590
 skeleton wooden mask with a 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.200
 sheet that will tell you that there were i 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.690
 priests of the dragon and all this then 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.500
 you will have to wear the wooden mask 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.420
 I understand with but it took a while is 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.300
 between wooden masks and would travel in the 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.210
 time this means and you will come back 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.310
 back in time where all the statues 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.760
 they were in their place to see how 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.750
 was before 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:11.780
 a nice thing to put the masks on 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:14.050
 each man once inserted all 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.400
 how many he iterates 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:24.260
 the mask 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:26.209
 that purpose here it is for this 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.709
 mask helps you when your health is 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.870
 low and there is a chance of 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.239
 damage the opponent with 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.720
 an explosion this mask is a lot 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.609
 helpful 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.720

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.989
