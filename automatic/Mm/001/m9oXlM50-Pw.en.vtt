00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello and welcome to my 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.160
 dear friends like today I have one 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.570
 new happiness for you in your grief and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.040
 it is in principle so that brings that 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.780
 same as the old only more 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.130
 So today I show you as you do not 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.680
 only be able to double your weapons 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.270
 but also items or only items 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.949
 but you also have on this one 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.350
 channel another one with which we 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.099
 could double weapons so you have 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.179
 basically enough choice here and me 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.800
 show you that just enough 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.739
 usually the things away so you for it 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.200
 he needs us second guy's worth 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.899
 so he speaks to the floor and 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.820
 Your friend picks it up very quickly 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.480
 and then she just leaves the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.370
 application so without ending somehow 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.840
 So without pressing on volumes in the game 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.570
 or so easy to use 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.190
 leave the game and then start 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.629
 Just go back directly and the thing is 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.039
 Now that the game has just not yet 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.960
 that you do not save things 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.399
 more means that means you are coming now 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.049
 back in and still have the stuff but 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:08.159
 Your friend also has the things we do 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.900
 has given him and that means in principle 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.570
 He now has the things that are given to him 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.580
 have and you still have the stuff 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.259
 she has not lost 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.420
 and then he can never give you back 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.619
 depending on if you now if it now 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.259
 this kind of you wanted to have then 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.520
 he gets the course but that can 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.830
 you keep on doing it again and again 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.939
 you can always make it up to you 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.409
 then the things again 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.250
 I recommend you though if you 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:36.479
 that often does what is called then comes 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.189
 he in your lobby and he gives him the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.920
 things and ended the game so that he 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.030
 is thrown out of the lobby so and 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.970
 then I recommend you if you are 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.259
 again meets in your lobby then comes 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.990
 he so he could do the europe now 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.430
 after you start here now 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.560
 By the way, it must excuse that one 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.180
 Internet packed that's why you see 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.579
 just like here my colleague melody 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.810
 Catastrophes packages exist and then 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.090
 he also throws the weapons 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.390
 upgrades in but then says outfluxed 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.320
 why could not to collect 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.960
 but definitely back to the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.899
 the topic always comes in yours 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.420
 lobby and then you have the things the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.940
 you have copied so then you push on 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.090
 start to be on hold what's the name 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.680
 single player so on 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.629
 He is on single player again 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.680
 So that speaks the second option there 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:32.599
 Can you separate the game or what is there? 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:34.340
 or get out and then he comes back 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.730
 and then you can repeat that 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.810
 So the thing is that we really 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.640
 after he did that to him 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.260
 you things come in there and you 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.760
 But then out of the lobby is out 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.680
 or you leave the lobby 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.980
 goes out and that's the easiest way 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.840
 if you play on it then run 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.680
 So start and then the second 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.360
 what it says 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.069
 I do not know as I said it anymore 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.569
 exactly because then it is at least at 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.709
 I'm sure that you 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.980
 saved that again 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.360
 you have the stuff again then is 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.190
 really saved that you too 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.110
 things he gave you again 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.940
 that are doubled that you then 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.230
 also in your inventory and otherwise 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.720
 it can happen that you if the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.380
 the direct makes again without her 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.180
 once you are in the trend 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.870
 then it can happen that you if you 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.670
 make it again then it will be like that 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.790
 still recognized that they are still 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.989
 just try these things from the first try 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.140
 then you do not have the doubled 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.510
 things but stop 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.190
 but only the first things and then 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.970
 he does not double anything then you have nothing 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.740
 lost and won nothing 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.060
 and yes or you have 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.640
 already won something but not so much 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.050
 like you are 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.520
 it gets more and more complicated all the more 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.720
 I explain so it's easy as I said 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.160
 Put it simply, I have it 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.550
 before I explain just hope have the 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.550
 now all understood 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.970
 as I said I try it now 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.030
 once short video and free too 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.819
 explain so you make the first time 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.120
 this is best for you again 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.880
 the things of the thing you 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.310
 double volt with it directly more 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.799
 have something doubled because of more 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.690
 you can also duplicate and have more 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:29.949
 then the second time more so then 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.180
 logically leave the game and 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.310
 go back in and you have the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.410
 things again so here it goes in 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.030
 your lobby purely on the character where you 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.690
 have given the things to your friend 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.970
 then he will join your game again 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:48.410
 and you are the things because he has 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.940
 also in the inventory and so then have 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.650
 you once doubled that way 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.300
 but then he keeps pushing 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.720
 you're not part of the game anymore 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.710
 him since then and then is seen like that 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.990
 saved that too 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.610
 Doubled things with you and have 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.090
 then he can step back and you 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:08.690
 can repeat it from the beginning so so 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.919
 that was explained twice times explained three times 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.770
 and I just hope it has you 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.180
 enough and I would like to tell you 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.090
 at the next luck at the next easter 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.200
 egg or hats have not seen and still have 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.200
 Have a nice evening children
