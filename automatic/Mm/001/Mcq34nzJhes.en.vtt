00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
asked us if we would set up a program to

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.600 
asked us if we would set up a program to
Train<00:00:33.320> Meat<00:00:33.590> Cutters<00:00:33.800> because<00:00:34.280> there<00:00:34.460> was<00:00:34.579> a

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
Train Meat Cutters because there was a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.150 
Train Meat Cutters because there was a
number<00:00:34.970> of<00:00:35.120> those<00:00:35.410> gentlemen<00:00:36.410> of<00:00:36.680> course<00:00:36.950> that

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
number of those gentlemen of course that

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.070 
number of those gentlemen of course that
were<00:00:37.280> out<00:00:37.430> of<00:00:37.580> work<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:37.970> they<00:00:38.210> wanted<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:38.570> give

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
were out of work and they wanted to give

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.600 
were out of work and they wanted to give
him<00:00:39.230> a<00:00:39.260> different<00:00:39.620> career<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:40.160> we<00:00:40.280> started

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
him a different career so we started

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.210 
him a different career so we started
training<00:00:41.390> program<00:00:41.930> in<00:00:42.110> fact<00:00:42.290> we<00:00:42.530> trained<00:00:42.890> 40

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
training program in fact we trained 40

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.520 
training program in fact we trained 40
some<00:00:43.430> of<00:00:43.550> those<00:00:43.670> laid<00:00:44.570> off<00:00:44.720> miners<00:00:45.110> at<00:00:45.350> that

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
some of those laid off miners at that

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.970 
some of those laid off miners at that
time<00:00:45.740> we<00:00:46.070> still<00:00:46.340> have<00:00:46.490> to<00:00:46.580> continue<00:00:47.740> for<00:00:48.740> most

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
time we still have to continue for most

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.740 
time we still have to continue for most
of<00:00:49.250> them<00:00:49.370> it's<00:00:49.430> difficult<00:00:49.970> because<00:00:50.330> the

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
of them it's difficult because the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.660 
of them it's difficult because the
terminology<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:52.010> things<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.400> they're

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
terminology and the things that they're

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.480 
terminology and the things that they're
doing<00:00:52.700> is<00:00:53.060> quite<00:00:53.300> different<00:00:53.680> so<00:00:54.680> what<00:00:55.010> we<00:00:55.220> do

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
doing is quite different so what we do

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.060 
doing is quite different so what we do
is<00:00:55.520> we<00:00:55.970> provide<00:00:56.450> them<00:00:56.750> with<00:00:56.780> some<00:00:57.620> handout

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
is we provide them with some handout

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
is we provide them with some handout
materials<00:00:58.220> that<00:00:58.850> discuss<00:00:59.420> carcass<00:01:00.410> parts

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
materials that discuss carcass parts

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.060 
materials that discuss carcass parts
terminology<00:01:02.090> with<00:01:02.990> the<00:01:03.140> idea<00:01:03.470> they<00:01:03.710> start<00:01:04.009> to

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
terminology with the idea they start to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.830 
terminology with the idea they start to
become<00:01:04.189> familiar<00:01:04.790> with<00:01:04.909> those<00:01:05.150> terms<00:01:05.509> and

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
become familiar with those terms and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.350 
become familiar with those terms and
then<00:01:05.990> we<00:01:06.229> put<00:01:06.979> them<00:01:07.189> in<00:01:07.430> on<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:07.700> hands-on

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
then we put them in on a hands-on

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.230 
then we put them in on a hands-on
situation<00:01:09.259> with<00:01:09.439> our<00:01:10.219> experienced<00:01:10.850> people

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
situation with our experienced people

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.539 
situation with our experienced people
and<00:01:11.630> they<00:01:11.899> start<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.380> learn<00:01:12.829> the<00:01:13.009> cuts<00:01:13.249> and<00:01:13.490> do

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
and they start to learn the cuts and do

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.160 
and they start to learn the cuts and do
the<00:01:13.700> cutting<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.179> then<00:01:14.600> they<00:01:14.780> start<00:01:15.049> to

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
the cutting and then they start to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.469 
the cutting and then they start to
progress<00:01:15.499> and<00:01:15.740> as<00:01:15.890> they<00:01:16.460> develop<00:01:16.939> what<00:01:17.450> we

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
progress and as they develop what we

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.069 
progress and as they develop what we
call<00:01:17.600> knife<00:01:18.049> skills<00:01:19.119> we<00:01:20.119> allow<00:01:20.479> them<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.869> do

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
call knife skills we allow them to do

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.489 
call knife skills we allow them to do
additional<00:01:21.859> things<00:01:22.369> on<00:01:22.789> to<00:01:23.630> learn<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:23.990> lot<00:01:24.319> more

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
additional things on to learn a lot more

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:28.389 
additional things on to learn a lot more
about<00:01:24.829> the<00:01:25.579> actual<00:01:25.850> processing<00:01:27.069> and<00:01:28.069> what<00:01:28.249> we

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
about the actual processing and what we

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.830 
about the actual processing and what we
try<00:01:28.429> to<00:01:28.670> do<00:01:28.999> is<00:01:29.359> set<00:01:29.749> it<00:01:29.780> up<00:01:30.109> so<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.679> particular

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
try to do is set it up so a particular

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.029 
try to do is set it up so a particular
trainee<00:01:32.840> would<00:01:33.140> work<00:01:33.380> with<00:01:33.590> one<00:01:33.799> of<00:01:33.920> our

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
trainee would work with one of our

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.999 
trainee would work with one of our
experience<00:01:34.639> people<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.679> basically<00:01:36.679> our

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
experience people and basically our

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.719 
experience people and basically our
program<00:01:37.549> is<00:01:37.939> five<00:01:38.749> days<00:01:39.049> a<00:01:39.079> week<00:01:39.460> for<00:01:40.460> four

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
program is five days a week for four

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.050 
program is five days a week for four
months<00:01:40.969> or<00:01:41.899> essentially<00:01:42.799> they<00:01:42.950> put<00:01:43.159> on<00:01:43.280> 100

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
months or essentially they put on 100

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.480 
months or essentially they put on 100
hire<00:01:44.210> 640<00:01:45.170> hours<00:01:45.469> in<00:01:45.679> the<00:01:45.770> training<00:01:46.009> program

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
hire 640 hours in the training program

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.419 
hire 640 hours in the training program
then<00:01:47.420> they're<00:01:47.689> certified<00:01:48.079> in<00:01:48.469> hassa<00:01:48.740> has<00:01:49.219> an

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
then they're certified in hassa has an

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.340 
then they're certified in hassa has an
announcement<00:01:49.639> critical<00:01:50.329> control<00:01:50.630> points<00:01:51.139> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
announcement critical control points and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.530 
announcement critical control points and
also<00:01:51.979> we<00:01:52.310> test<00:01:52.579> them<00:01:52.729> at<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.030> end<00:01:53.179> of<00:01:53.270> the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
also we test them at the end of the

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.350 
also we test them at the end of the
period<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.100> makes<00:01:55.280> them<00:01:55.430> ready<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.970> go<00:01:56.150> into

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
period so it makes them ready to go into

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.860 
period so it makes them ready to go into
the<00:01:56.690> retail<00:01:57.370> meat<00:01:58.370> trade<00:01:58.700> or<00:01:58.970> into<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.420> packing

the retail meat trade or into a packing

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.830 
the retail meat trade or into a packing
plant<00:02:00.170> what<00:02:01.100> he's<00:02:01.220> doing<00:02:01.640> now<00:02:01.820> is<00:02:02.150> removing

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
plant what he's doing now is removing

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.240 
plant what he's doing now is removing
the<00:02:03.020> kidney<00:02:03.410> pelvic<00:02:03.740> fat<00:02:04.250> because<00:02:05.240> we<00:02:05.420> have

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
the kidney pelvic fat because we have

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.440 
the kidney pelvic fat because we have
safety<00:02:07.250> regulations<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:08.000> they<00:02:08.179> have<00:02:08.300> to
