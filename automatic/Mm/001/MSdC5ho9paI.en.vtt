00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.100
[theme music]

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.500
[fizz, sip]

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.320
Aahhh!

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.700
[typing]

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.400
Well, I was looking around for some games

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.540
for my Atari ST the other day

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.620
and came across the most awesome little gem:

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.650
SkyStrike.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.180
There's precious little information on this game,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.500
but I had heard of its authors before:

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.480
Aaron and Adam Fothergill.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.260
This version of the game is actually the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.440
updated SkyStrike Plus.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.320
I just made my own disc really quick

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.040
I have no idea if it was released at retail or not,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.780
as I've read conflicting stories regarding

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.150
Atlantis software and such.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.450
All I know is that the game utilizes
rather simple graphics and sound

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.250
and was originally created as a
demo for the STOS programming kit

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.840
by some guys from the UK under
the name Shadow software in 1989,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.320
and this Plus version in 1990.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.900
[Atari ST music]

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.360
The game starts off with a dandy little tune

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.320
and the option to play the game,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.000
read the instruction manual or see the credits.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The manual is an absolute must

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.120
and I'm so glad it's included in-game.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.340
Not only does it tell you the
completely forgettable backstory,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.000
but also the very pertinent list
of controls and game mechanics.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.840
This is a must-read unless you

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.200
want to drive yourself crazy trying to figure it out.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.140
Starting the game gives you three options:

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.560
the obligatory easy, medium and hard.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.140
These should be pretty self-explanatory

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.760
and I chose easy for recording most of this footage,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.620
since it's, well, easier.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.520
You are immediately inducted into the Royal Air Force

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.700
and given your objectives for Mission 1.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.220
You start out on the runway in
your Mark 14 Supermarine Spitfire

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.880
in the year 1946.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.900
If you played BrÃ¸derbund's Wings of Fury
on the Apple II or other systems,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.280
you'll be right at home.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.220
It's a 2D combat flight game
with mostly arcade elements.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.840
The goal is to complete missions by

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.420
destroying enemy objects,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.400
avoiding civilian casualties and not dying.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.200
To increase throttle and take off,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.840
you can push right on the joystick

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.800
or press between 1 through 9 on the keyboard,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.380
and then press U to retract the
undercarriage landing gear

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.400
once you're in the air.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.380
And from here, it's all up to you.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.320
The game is completely open
and while you have objectives,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.200
you can largely ignore them if you want.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.740
which is unusual for many games of this time.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.960
The joystick button shoots your machine guns,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.860
left plus Fire drops a bomb,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.920
and right plus Fire shoots anti-tank rockets

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.160
and of course, hold up and down to pilot your plane.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.540
I'd really recommend just screwing around for a while,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.360
because that's not only incredibly fun,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.440
but it's also kind of required
to get a grip on the handling.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.440
Being used to flight sims myself,

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.840
holding up and down to climb and decend

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.180
or turn counterclockwise and
clockwise seems backwards to me.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.180
And there's no way to change it, to my knowledge,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.740
so you'll just have to get used to it.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.040
Or hold the joystick upside-down,
but then that makes everything else wrong.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.300
From the start, you'll be shooting down enemy planes

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.820
and trust me when I say this is stupidly fun.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.660
This is easily the most fun that
I've had on a retro dogfighting game.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.040
You can't see your bullets and there's
no way to tell how much ammo remains

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.720
or really if you're even shooting.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.520
so you'll have to rely on the sound
to know when you are shooting.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.840
Shoot a plane enough times or in the right spots

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.320
and you'll knock him out of the sky

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.700
with the pilot often escaping by parachute.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.300
But you'll have to pay careful attention

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.520
because the same exact thing can happen to you

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.600
and various systems will be destroyed,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.140
from guns to fuel lines to
the engine or even the wheels.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.320
If you get shot down, you will likely die

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.800
and that's the end of the game
and you have to start over

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.300
and there are no save points.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.140
Old school difficulty.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.100
But you're not dead because your plane is gone.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.860
No, you actually have five planes

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.940
and you can still have four left over
and have the game end on you.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.180
It's game over because you died.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.860
And you've only got one life.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.860
As long as your pilot is still alive

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.260
and you have a spare plane,
you can continue playing.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.780
This is just so cool

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.860
and is one of the biggest
reasons why this game is so rad.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.680
To not die, you'll want to try and land your plane

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.380
so you have four options.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.180
Option 1: Bail Out.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.440
No, not the government banking solution.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.740
Press Escape and you'll eject from the cockpit,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.360
flailing around in free fall,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.760
until you open your chute by pressing Return.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.460
If you don't do it in time, well...

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.140
Heh heh heh!

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.780
Ah, poor little guy.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.660
[sad music]

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.000
And yes, the game is made by
Englishmen, and it knows it.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.660
Option 2: Crash or Belly Land.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.840
If your wheels are destroyed
and you're on the way down

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.420
due to a failed engine or other such disability,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.660
it's possible to make a crash landing.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.360
Hopefully you'll survive and
hopefully you're in friendly territory.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.560
Option 3: Land Properly at Your Base

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.060
This is pretty simple, once you get the hang of it.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.480
But it's extremely hard to do if
your plane is shot halfway to hell.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.040
But if you land successfully, you can get repairs

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.520
and more ammo and fuel without losing a plane.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.620
And then there's Option 4,

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.760
the pansy way out: Auto-Land.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.700
This is only available on Easy and Medium difficulty.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.960
Press A over your base and it
will automatically land for you

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.820
but detract an increasing amount of points each time.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.120
And that's the gist of the game,
but there really is so much more to it.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.720
For instance, one of the biggest reasons to avoid dying,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.580
other than the whole dying thing,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.260
is to earn plane upgrades,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
which are shown at the top of the screen.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.060
The often drop from the sky
when you complete an objective

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.760
and range from more ammo, more fuel,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.820
and aids like repairs and fire extinguishers.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.280
There is also a bonus power-up
that sometimes appears

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.280
when you fly at very high altitudes.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.140
A UFO will show up and beam
you and your plane aboard their ship,

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.960
giving you the ability to teleport from danger.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.280
This game... wow!

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.220
I swear, this is the most fun
that I've had on my Atari ST â

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.440
and actually any retro computer game â in ages.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.300
My face was hurting, I was laughing
so much at the numerous absurdities,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.000
from the intentional humor in the game

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.240
to the unintentional fall gags.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.540
It's too bad it's exclusive to the ST

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.040
because it's criminally entertaining
and deserves a larger audience.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.620
It's just so fun to go flying around, pushing the limits,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.160
trying to get just *one* more plane
before you land for that next mission.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.800
Or bombing the crap out of random
mansions, just because you can.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.060
I've even managed to shoot down other planes

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.040
with my anti-tank rockets when I ran out of gun ammo.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.440
It's one of those games where you just think to yourself,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.140
I wonder if I can do this.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.960
And then you do it, and then you're smiling

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.360
for the next three hours.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.960
For instance, when I realized that the
world is completely destructible

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.180
and persistent,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.220
with the damage that you do
carrying over to the next mission.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.820
I mean, eventually, you won't have a base to go back to

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.940
if you don't repair it.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.460
And I still haven't even begun to scratch the surface.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.500
There are 56 freaking missions

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.140
and I've only reached Number 6!

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.600
You'll have missions where
you'll have to bomb buildings,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.940
destroy tanks, take down squadrons,

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.620
protect bases to be repaired, and on and on.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.260
It's loads of fun and I cannot recommend it enough.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.860
The only complaints I have are the odd-at-first controls

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.840
and the addition of some kind of
multiplayer could have been amazing.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.600
There were several other games that were similar,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.200
like the Wings of Fury games,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.820
the later sequel JetStrike,

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.000
and even Yomo has some similarities.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.840
But SkyStrike has a very unique and simplified feel

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.040
that has not been duplicated in my opinion.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.800
The limitations like no save points

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.000
and gameplay is only on one screen at a time

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.240
instead of side-scrolling

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.100
make it one of a kind experience.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.280
If you could find it in any way at all,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.640
especially if combat flight games interest you,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.500
then by all means, track it down and give it a try.
