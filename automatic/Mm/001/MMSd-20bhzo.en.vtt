00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.120
 the more serious you have been through 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.340

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.430

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.190
 to update 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.559
 accepting the download evolution can 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.899
 be caught by in some investigations 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.890
 lawrence found that there are cases of 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.379
 slow to update but the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.340
 problem is that it also had a 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.410
 problem in the long thin update of it 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.170
 I installed, I reinstalled 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.780
 ipad guidelines continues with the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.020
 cable symbol to be plugged in 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.090
 but connect bank to return all 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.979
 legislation or see what will be the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.710
 next command line 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.250
 hence the absence of a program or 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.780
 file is like mobile should I suggest 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.250
 the address folder however is not uncommon 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.360
 I have been for more than a week without any 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.530
 solution 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.530
 Can you help me 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:39.180
 thales I do not know if I understood much 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.220
 slow but it seems that in some way and 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.119
 I know if you should help in general a lot 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.670
 hot is filming what happens until 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:53.490
 help to understand better is more here says 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:57.570
 following the computer it does not have this 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.469
 folder is by mobile should if I go is 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.469
 access here 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.190
 this item is corumbÃ¡ the deficit is in 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.490
 computer service list 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.520
 I do not know what your version of 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.020
 windows but I think it's not much 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.480
 different from mine 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.130
 I'll stay here with the right button of the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.010
 mouse over the windows icon 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.820
 it will open here some options 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.100
 for example this specific option she 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:43.020
 is in the genesis of the 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:55.239
 computer and 3rd services and applications and 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:03:00.970
 services a little to him that you 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:03.430
 Find her, what is happening is I do not 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.209
 I know necessarily where you tried 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.620
 locate this option is okay but she's 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:14.380
 within services is applications and here 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.160
 I have an item called is just over 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.290
 10 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:23.110
 so maybe it's interesting you? 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.989
 stop the service and if it really does 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.790
 it's listed here 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.090
 usually this option becomes 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.959
 available as soon as you connect your 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:40.019
 ipad on your computer and you can 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:45.100
 install the ipad drivers on it then oh 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:49.980
 my case here a service he is at 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.980
 execution I can stop it 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:59.420
 and restart or restart services 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.420
 if it is not working 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.870
 I do not know if this is the doubt I hope you 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.569
 help if it does not help and really you 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.799
 do not have this option and need to understand 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:24.440
 Are you really able to accomplish this? 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:28.710
 update your ipad what causes 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.539
 his status always ask or enter 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.539
 connected horse in itunes 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.919
 I hope this has somehow 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.570
 helped 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:48.570
 send more information to one more detail 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.389
 important is if you really have 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.320
 this option here in the management 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:57.330
 computer and right-click 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.880
 and properties 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:06.960
 Can you tell which one is 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:10.129
 path in this run by not copying the 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:17.919
 beauty there is not enough 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:17.919
 Rolling it there take the champion of the river 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:32.399
 the dry performs the service we take away 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:39.209

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:39.209
 you can already 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:51.690
 to identify where he is here is 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:54.539

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.409
