00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 at 1-0 we think it can be good even 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.929
 if the psg not ultra in the mastery 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.570
 as they could have been to others 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.700
 moments in their recent existence and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.500
 then then after 1.0 then there I do not 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.730
 understand nothing at all we have a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.310
 coach who makes good changes 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.029
 who unbalance his team to go 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.430
 equalize 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.439
 jardim masters his subject speaks to his 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.029
 players replace them doing things then 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.980
 we have another one next to the viewer 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.179
 who wanted to act 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.730
 I said Tuesday night anyway 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.620
 after the fabulous performance of psg that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.120
 we had made tons of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.590
 the feat that it remains a hen match 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.420
 and that this team was primarily 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.950
 self-management that she had 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.600
 motivated for this event what's 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.070
 confirms but that white had nothing to 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.050
 see in history and tonight be the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.219
 ilaha illa he lost points 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.899
 his team because I do not know 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.160
 why pastore came out I do not know 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.570
 what brought the entry of cabaye I 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.829
 do not know why cavani stay 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.850
 long on the ground while he 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.620
 would need to blow because he 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.420
 is visibly cooked and in crisis 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.370
 of confidence even though the park continues 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.620
 many support him 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.760
 I do not understand anything that does 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.470
 laurent white we will come back and well no 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.590
 on this change because you're right 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.659
 it is exactly this point that that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.220
 mobilizes rising tweets and who you 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.200
 mobilizes at 32 16 in a few moments 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.430
 psg fans will have the floor 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.070
 you can also call us a 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.350
 Monegasque supporters at 32 16 sheriff 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.119
 you who has been telling us for a long time 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.689
 work jardim you'll see it's going 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.890
 take time 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.600
 it's true that tonight is a very good 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.750
 test because I said common sense 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.799
 falcao radamel obviously to pick up the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.970
 players who have gone and rivers 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.950
 especially the offseason but especially 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.780
 without berbatov and toulalan 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.090
 we were expecting a team that was going 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.829
 to suffer does not stop at all no because 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.049
 that tonight so as you say was playing 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.070
 without berbatov toulalan ie they 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.090
 were playing without their compass 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.659
 so it's a team at the base 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.490
 disoriented but as upstream there is a 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.079
 substantive work that was carried out ago 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.509
 a minimum of game background there is 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.740
 ambition in the game we even attack 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.960
 if it's a little messy like that 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.360
 was it tonight there is still a 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.590
 collective strength that makes that even when 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.119
 they are led 1-0 they continue to 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.110
 attack because we say yeah pariah 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.700
 recoil agrees but it's also 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.649
 monaco who attacks and I remember that 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.790
 on purpose they are practically 5 in 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.350
 the last 20 meters 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.220
 and when you look at the matches a little 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.819
 that they did that it was against 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.679
 leverkusen 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.010
 whether against the zenith but even 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.989
 a madness when they win in the 93rd 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.370
 a team that still seeks to 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.810
 go ahead it's not that yet 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.450
 it's not yet developed but the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.579
 intentions are good and so we're going 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.730
 also remember that if paris is a year 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.450
 tonight facing this team from Monaco 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.739
 they made a lot of draws 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.220
 it's true paris saint germain but there 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.769
 tonight 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.360
 there was 1 1 but there was when 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.010
 even two very clear opportunities for 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.180
 what did not others do 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.900
 to the opponents of Paris recalls 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.790
 especially that karzai jean ferrat 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.109
 carrasco but the huge box of kurzawa 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.049
 it was a mistake sirigu 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.430
 saved by van der linde on his line by 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.159
 his own nets it was a real 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.690
 opportunity and it's true that monaco 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.040
 this agent and the tactics of jardim 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.150
 since it was difficult to understand 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.470
 because she had put neither martial 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.239
 Nigerian at kickoff we will come back 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.799
 on monaco do not worry about anything 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.769
 the time but will also be emphasized 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.970
 because ferreira carrasco campos on 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.260
 hurt last year we at the internee 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.180
 fly gives reason and knowingly to 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.859
 daniel paris should have won this match 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.620
 but he was great and exactly when 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.239
 marry 1.8 points lost after leading 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.190
 at in the championship this season has 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.810
 left each time you will notice that 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.579
 it's always because the management of the 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.620
 match and do it upside down we do not understand 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.379
 nothing to changes that low in full 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.030
 many times he has he broke the bonds 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.280
 between media reaches that makes a 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.750
 change that causes three 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.849
 changes of positions on the ground there 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.949
 it is the attack and the sacked environment in 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.199
 few minutes what because between mid 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:35.720
 time will he have not chosen missed it 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:38.599
 the chosen by ok visible a week of 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.340
 count well yeah good game but but 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.930
 which he does not choose but he can do 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.699
 something else at that moment we are sure 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.799
 but above all that's why out of 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:47.989
 Pastore then just alone I make him the 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.980
 game in this team it's the only one that 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.750
 was the leader who had both 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.329
 guys in front of him had to continue acting 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.650
 in the sky or even the limit at the end m 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.169
 a middle of more and just let 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.760
 pastore and oukase meka basket maker kran and 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.319
 why do they keep it until then 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.349
 I think you figure he keeps him 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.549
 because when they leave it 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:08.690
 long in the end I said if I the 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:10.849
 go out now the savannah his people and 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.260
 that's it small club networks in 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.370
 a big club you do not do that kind of 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.750
 laws it's clear but it's the guy does not 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.919
 will also see themselves coming out to not many people 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.539
 on the bench once you've done 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.060
 go back beak instead of worm ati 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:24.409
 offensively to augustin to be as 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.270
 very clear to chanteloup kalouga in front 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.800
 with this buy backs did two attackers 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.440
 story that stays in 10 and u does not break 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.849
 everything we attack and especially why not 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.639
 this rate is especially it can not be 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.870
 to lure mathieu 75th there is more behind 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.300
 there is more movement there is a ball 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.460
 from against fair twice repaired 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.479
 cavani this game and that you back 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.229
 did that roll back a class he has 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.229
 finished right back
