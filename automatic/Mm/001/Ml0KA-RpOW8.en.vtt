what<00:00:01.710> you're<00:00:01.859> looking<00:00:02.160> at<00:00:02.280> here<00:00:02.340> is<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.820> wood

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
what you're looking at here is a wood

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.570 
what you're looking at here is a wood
window<00:00:04.200> sill<00:00:04.560> so<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:05.549> would<00:00:05.759> be<00:00:05.790> a

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
window sill so this would be a

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.140 
window sill so this would be a
wood-framed<00:00:08.580> sill<00:00:09.469> with<00:00:10.469> trim<00:00:11.190> around<00:00:11.460> a

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
wood-framed sill with trim around a

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.490 
wood-framed sill with trim around a
vinyl<00:00:12.630> window<00:00:13.280> so<00:00:14.599> problem<00:00:15.599> with<00:00:15.780> wood<00:00:16.110> if

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
vinyl window so problem with wood if

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.170 
vinyl window so problem with wood if
you've<00:00:16.800> watched<00:00:17.070> any<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.430> our<00:00:17.610> other<00:00:17.760> videos

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
you've watched any of our other videos

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.170 
you've watched any of our other videos
in<00:00:18.360> the<00:00:18.480> past<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.620> can<00:00:20.040> get<00:00:20.730> wet<00:00:21.180> and

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
in the past is that it can get wet and

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.820 
in the past is that it can get wet and
eventually<00:00:24.180> suffer<00:00:24.600> from<00:00:24.750> damage<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.590> arrow

eventually suffer from damage the arrow

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.970 
eventually suffer from damage the arrow
is<00:00:25.920> pointing<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.610> water<00:00:27.090> stain<00:00:27.620> these<00:00:28.620> water

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
is pointing to a water stain these water

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.749 
is pointing to a water stain these water
stains<00:00:29.310> are<00:00:29.490> usually<00:00:29.970> easy<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.510> see<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.759> of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
stains are usually easy to see and of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.540 
stains are usually easy to see and of
course<00:00:33.090> there<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.570> also<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:34.230> gap<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.190> between

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
course there is also a gap in between

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.330 
course there is also a gap in between
the<00:00:35.940> bottom<00:00:36.300> trim<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:36.990> window<00:00:37.710> sill<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the bottom trim and the window sill the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.280 
the bottom trim and the window sill the
window<00:00:38.640> sill<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.030> angled<00:00:39.510> for<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.810> reason<00:00:40.260> that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
window sill is angled for a reason that

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.690 
window sill is angled for a reason that
is<00:00:40.650> to<00:00:40.830> allow<00:00:40.980> any<00:00:41.220> water<00:00:41.580> to<00:00:42.480> flow<00:00:42.810> off<00:00:43.080> of<00:00:43.350> it

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
is to allow any water to flow off of it

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.580 
is to allow any water to flow off of it
usually<00:00:44.700> about<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.910> five<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.990> 10-degree

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
usually about a five to a 10-degree

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100 
usually about a five to a 10-degree
angle<00:00:46.620> eight<00:00:47.280> degrees<00:00:47.760> maybe<00:00:48.060> something<00:00:49.020> like

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
angle eight degrees maybe something like

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.280 
angle eight degrees maybe something like
that<00:00:49.140> works<00:00:49.560> out<00:00:49.800> great<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.989> course

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
that works out great and then of course

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.830 
that works out great and then of course
we<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.920> another<00:00:53.370> angle<00:00:53.880> of<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.270> water<00:00:54.480> stain

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
we have another angle of the water stain

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.479 
we have another angle of the water stain
here<00:00:55.200> anytime<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.670> stain<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.329> this

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
here anytime you see a stain like this

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.030 
here anytime you see a stain like this
discoloration<00:00:59.489> in<00:01:00.180> any<00:01:00.570> wood<00:01:00.930> wouldn't<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
discoloration in any wood wouldn't be a

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.680 
discoloration in any wood wouldn't be a
bad<00:01:02.280> idea<00:01:02.310> to<00:01:02.790> take<00:01:03.630> a<00:01:03.660> look<00:01:04.019> closer<00:01:04.589> look<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
bad idea to take a look closer look and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.250 
bad idea to take a look closer look and
see<00:01:06.690> if<00:01:07.490> there<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.670> anything<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.630> would<00:01:10.229> be

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
see if there is anything that would be

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.690 
see if there is anything that would be
leading<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:12.650> contributing<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> stain<00:01:14.310> so

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
leading to contributing to the stain so

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.070 
leading to contributing to the stain so
just<00:01:14.970> something<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.360> think<00:01:15.450> about<00:01:15.780> now

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
just something to think about now

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.990 
just something to think about now
another<00:01:16.440> thing<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.280> will<00:01:17.460> try<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> make<00:01:17.940> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
another thing and I will try to make a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.649 
another thing and I will try to make a
video<00:01:18.530> on<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.310> future<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
video on it in the future is at the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.690 
video on it in the future is at the
bottom<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.320> windowsill<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.430> can<00:01:23.580> always

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
bottom of a windowsill you can always

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.250 
bottom of a windowsill you can always
put<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.210> drip<00:01:24.630> cut<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:27.540> again<00:01:27.870> this<00:01:28.049> would

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
put a drip cut in and again this would

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.590 
put a drip cut in and again this would
run<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> entire<00:01:28.830> length<00:01:29.360> underneath<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
run the entire length underneath the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.980 
run the entire length underneath the
sill<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:32.190> can<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> skill<00:01:33.720> saw

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
sill and you can do it with a skill saw

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.020 
sill and you can do it with a skill saw
or<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> circular<00:01:34.890> saw<00:01:36.080> you<00:01:37.080> just<00:01:37.320> simply<00:01:37.560> go

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
or a circular saw you just simply go

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.510 
or a circular saw you just simply go
maybe<00:01:39.030> about<00:01:39.860> three<00:01:40.860> eighths<00:01:41.010> of<00:01:41.220> an<00:01:41.369> inch

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
maybe about three eighths of an inch

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.170 
maybe about three eighths of an inch
from<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> outside<00:01:43.260> bottom<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.909> window

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
from the outside bottom of the window

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.149 
from the outside bottom of the window
sill<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.930> cut<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.619> line<00:01:47.280> parallel<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:49.159> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
sill and cut a line parallel to the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.280 
sill and cut a line parallel to the
window<00:01:50.729> sill<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.600> outside<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:52.140> will

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
window sill be on the outside this will

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.760 
window sill be on the outside this will
allow<00:01:52.500> water<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.950> leak<00:01:53.369> over<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:55.350> outside

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
allow water to leak over the outside

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.929 
allow water to leak over the outside
edge<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.840> then<00:01:57.840> straight<00:01:58.470> off<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.580> sill

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
edge and then straight off of the sill

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.730 
edge and then straight off of the sill
the<00:02:00.210> drip<00:02:00.450> cut<00:02:00.659> actually<00:02:01.020> stops<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.500> water

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the drip cut actually stops the water

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.590 
the drip cut actually stops the water
from<00:02:02.070> flowing<00:02:02.430> back<00:02:03.000> water<00:02:03.360> will<00:02:03.570> actually

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
from flowing back water will actually

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.010 
from flowing back water will actually
roll<00:02:04.200> back<00:02:04.470> at<00:02:04.740> an<00:02:04.979> angle<00:02:05.250> trust<00:02:05.880> me<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
roll back at an angle trust me if the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.199 
roll back at an angle trust me if the
surface<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.530> flat<00:02:07.849> you're<00:02:08.849> going<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.149> have

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
surface is flat you're going to have

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.110 
surface is flat you're going to have
water<00:02:09.529> rolling<00:02:10.529> right<00:02:10.859> on<00:02:11.039> back<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:11.909> hard

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
water rolling right on back so it's hard

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.940 
water rolling right on back so it's hard
to<00:02:12.239> imagine<00:02:12.359> but<00:02:12.779> water<00:02:13.230> will

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
to imagine but water will

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.059 
to imagine but water will
roll<00:02:14.690> back<00:02:15.980> underneath<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.160> sill<00:02:17.580> and

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
roll back underneath the sill and

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.860 
roll back underneath the sill and
without<00:02:20.069> that<00:02:20.400> drip<00:02:20.670> cut<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.360> something<00:02:21.810> to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
without that drip cut so something to

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.660 
without that drip cut so something to
think<00:02:21.930> about<00:02:22.170> now<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.709> water<00:02:23.099> stain<00:02:23.430> here

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
think about now the water stain here

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.820 
think about now the water stain here
could<00:02:23.819> also<00:02:23.970> become<00:02:24.269> from<00:02:24.989> water<00:02:25.230> leaking

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
could also become from water leaking

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.589 
could also become from water leaking
around<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.819> outside<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:29.120> wood<00:02:30.120> window

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
around the outside of the wood window

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.500 
around the outside of the wood window
trim<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.260> then<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.040> course<00:02:32.069> leaking<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:33.360> know

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
trim and then of course leaking you know

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.040 
trim and then of course leaking you know
running<00:02:34.050> across<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.220> leaking<00:02:36.180> down<00:02:36.420> there<00:02:36.780> so

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
running across and leaking down there so

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.350 
running across and leaking down there so
again<00:02:37.410> something<00:02:37.709> like<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:39.030> know<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
again something like this you know the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.800 
again something like this you know the
gap<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.230> between<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:41.150> bottom<00:02:42.150> trim<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
gap in between the bottom trim and the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.259 
gap in between the bottom trim and the
window<00:02:43.319> sill<00:02:43.530> needs<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.129> be<00:02:44.280> filled<00:02:44.549> you<00:02:45.150> know

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
window sill needs to be filled you know

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.350 
window sill needs to be filled you know
this<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:45.690> another<00:02:45.959> area<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:47.150> could<00:02:48.150> be<00:02:48.330> a

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
this is another area that could be a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.720 
this is another area that could be a
problem<00:02:48.569> water<00:02:49.110> could<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.500> leaking<00:02:50.010> into<00:02:50.700> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
problem water could be leaking into the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.120 
problem water could be leaking into the
house<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.690> anytime<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.290> see<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> water<00:02:52.739> stain

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
house so anytime you see a water stain

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.210 
house so anytime you see a water stain
do<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> little<00:02:54.209> more<00:02:54.870> investigating<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.890> see

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
do a little more investigating and see

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.750 
do a little more investigating and see
what<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.940> problem<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:58.430> thought<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.549> another

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
what the problem is I thought of another

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.699 
what the problem is I thought of another
thing<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.269> apologize<00:03:00.720> for<00:03:00.959> making<00:03:01.079> this<00:03:01.349> video
