00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
that but apparently if you just take

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.259 
that but apparently if you just take
their<00:02:06.049> pellets<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.320> soak<00:02:07.740> them<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.340> water

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.420 
their pellets and soak them in water
long<00:02:09.929> enough<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.560> will<00:02:10.679> turn<00:02:10.920> into<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.190> mush

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
long enough they will turn into a mush

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.940 
long enough they will turn into a mush
that<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.940> syringe

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
that you can syringe

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.570 
see
hold<00:04:26.030> on<00:04:26.320> can<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.410> take<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.830> in<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.340> side

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
hold on can you take this in to the side

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.730 
hold on can you take this in to the side
because<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.540> teeth<00:04:29.750> are<00:04:29.990> in<00:04:30.140> the<00:04:30.260> front<00:04:30.530> so

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
because the teeth are in the front so

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.520 
because the teeth are in the front so
you<00:04:30.770> slip<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.310> in<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> side<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:32.180> you<00:04:32.530> go

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
you slip it in the side and you go

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.830 
you slip it in the side and you go
pretty<00:04:33.890> far<00:04:34.100> back<00:04:34.430> because<00:04:34.970> they're<00:04:35.450> back<00:04:35.630> of

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
pretty far back because they're back of

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.600 
pretty far back because they're back of
their<00:04:35.960> throat<00:04:35.990> is<00:04:36.410> actually<00:04:36.800> way<00:04:36.980> back<00:04:37.220> here

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
their throat is actually way back here

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.250 
their throat is actually way back here
so<00:04:37.790> you<00:04:37.820> make<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.240> syringe<00:04:38.570> go<00:04:38.750> way<00:04:38.960> far<00:04:39.230> back

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
so you make the syringe go way far back

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.110 
so you make the syringe go way far back
this<00:04:39.680> is<00:04:39.800> where<00:04:39.980> their<00:04:40.100> back<00:04:40.310> teeth<00:04:40.640> are<00:04:40.850> and

this is where their back teeth are and

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.150 
this is where their back teeth are and
that's<00:04:41.390> where<00:04:41.660> you<00:04:41.780> squish<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.290> out<00:04:42.410> if<00:04:42.710> you

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
squish it out up close to the lips

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.390 
squish it out up close to the lips
they'll<00:04:44.990> just<00:04:45.140> spit<00:04:45.470> it<00:04:45.560> right<00:04:45.710> back<00:04:45.920> out<00:04:46.130> at
