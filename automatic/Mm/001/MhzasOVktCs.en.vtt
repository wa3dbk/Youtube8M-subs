course<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.850> in

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
course that you can do that in

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
course that you can do that in
battlefield<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.810> well<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.619> only

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
battlefield as well the only

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.649 
battlefield as well the only
disappointment<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.509> use

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
disappointment is that if you don't use

disappointment is that if you don't use
the<00:01:15.960> suppressor<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.830> gun<00:01:17.100> in

the suppressor on this gun in
battlefield<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.390> bullet<00:01:18.930> velocity<00:01:19.049> doesn't

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
battlefield the bullet velocity doesn't

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.920 
battlefield the bullet velocity doesn't
increase<00:01:20.340> very<00:01:20.700> much<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.119> fact<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.570> has<00:01:21.689> got

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
increase very much in fact this has got

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.560 
increase very much in fact this has got
the<00:01:22.110> slowest<00:01:22.830> bullet<00:01:23.040> velocity<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.330> any

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the slowest bullet velocity out of any

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.690 
the slowest bullet velocity out of any
bolt-action<00:01:25.409> sniper<00:01:25.439> rifle<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> game

bolt-action sniper rifle in the game

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.510 
bolt-action sniper rifle in the game
without<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.630> suppressor<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.650> shoots<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.189> four

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
without a suppressor it shoots at four

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.340 
without a suppressor it shoots at four
hundred<00:01:30.030> meters<00:01:30.240> per<00:01:30.600> second<00:01:30.990> muzzle

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
hundred meters per second muzzle

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.440 
hundred meters per second muzzle
velocity<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> distance<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.150> see<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
velocity so a distance you can see in a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.429 
velocity so a distance you can see in a
lot<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.659> these<00:01:33.810> clips<00:01:34.170> here

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
lot of these clips here

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.010 
lot of these clips here
I<00:01:34.470> really<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.729> arc<00:01:35.939> my<00:01:36.150> bullets<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.810> makes

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
I really have to arc my bullets it makes

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.380 
I really have to arc my bullets it makes
it<00:01:37.140> very<00:01:37.560> difficult<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.670> get<00:01:38.820> precise

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
it very difficult to get precise

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.929 
it very difficult to get precise
headshots<00:01:39.960> at<00:01:40.140> very<00:01:40.409> long<00:01:40.740> range<00:01:41.159> meaning

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
headshots at very long range meaning

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.060 
headshots at very long range meaning
that<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.420> gun<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.350> mostly

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that this gun is going to be mostly

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.060 
that this gun is going to be mostly
effective<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.970> medium<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.869> even<00:01:46.229> close<00:01:46.619> range

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
effective in medium to even close range

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.980

damage in close quarters is certainly a

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.640

the<00:05:29.639> cs5<00:05:30.120> is<00:05:30.300> a<00:05:30.330> very<00:05:30.570> interesting<00:05:30.990> weapon<00:05:31.680> it

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
the cs5 is a very interesting weapon it

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.400 
the cs5 is a very interesting weapon it

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
seems to sort of fit the niche that the

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.409 
seems to sort of fit the niche that the
scout<00:05:34.710> elite<00:05:34.919> would<00:05:35.460> fit<00:05:35.729> except<00:05:36.180> that<00:05:36.300> it

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
scout elite would fit except that it

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.940 
scout elite would fit except that it
does<00:05:36.660> give<00:05:36.930> you<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.110> option<00:05:37.380> to<00:05:37.650> one-shot

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
that cool custom suppressor in there

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.080 
that cool custom suppressor in there
which<00:05:43.380> is<00:05:43.530> kind<00:05:43.740> of<00:05:43.800> a<00:05:43.919> nice<00:05:44.160> addition<00:05:44.910> it

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
which is kind of a nice addition it

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.480 
which is kind of a nice addition it
definitely<00:05:45.780> has<00:05:45.960> a<00:05:45.990> unique<00:05:46.680> look<00:05:46.889> to<00:05:47.310> it

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490

statistically<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:48.539> gun<00:05:48.720> seems<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.169> be

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
statistically the gun seems to be

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.350 
statistically the gun seems to be
begging<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:49.919> to<00:05:50.099> use<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.639> suppressor<00:05:51.210> on

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
begging you to use the suppressor on

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.629 
begging you to use the suppressor on
there<00:05:51.599> as<00:05:51.780> you<00:05:51.930> only<00:05:52.169> get<00:05:52.440> a<00:05:52.470> 100<00:05:53.190> meter<00:05:53.400> per

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
there as you only get a 100 meter per

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.430 
there as you only get a 100 meter per
second<00:05:54.030> downgrade<00:05:54.539> once<00:05:54.870> it's<00:05:55.080> equipped

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
second downgrade once it's equipped

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.080

compared<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.220> other<00:05:56.370> bolt-action<00:05:57.060> sniper

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
compared to other bolt-action sniper

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.870

rifles<00:05:57.720> that<00:05:57.900> get<00:05:58.110> a<00:05:58.260> huge<00:05:58.800> downgrade<00:05:59.430> it

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
rifles that get a huge downgrade it

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.460 
rifles that get a huge downgrade it
would<00:06:00.150> be<00:06:00.300> kind<00:06:00.570> of<00:06:00.630> cool<00:06:00.810> if<00:06:00.870> they<00:06:01.110> let<00:06:01.320> you

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
would be kind of cool if they let you

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.409 
would be kind of cool if they let you
shoot<00:06:01.770> bullets<00:06:02.250> a<00:06:02.370> little<00:06:02.700> bit<00:06:02.849> faster<00:06:03.300> with

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
shoot bullets a little bit faster with

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
the suppressor on this weapon I realize

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.370 
the suppressor on this weapon I realize
that<00:06:05.550> subsonic<00:06:06.389> ammo<00:06:06.690> is<00:06:06.810> only<00:06:06.960> supposed<00:06:07.260> to

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
that subsonic ammo is only supposed to

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.159 
that subsonic ammo is only supposed to
travel<00:06:07.710> a<00:06:07.979> certain<00:06:08.510> speed<00:06:09.510> or<00:06:09.810> a<00:06:09.840> certain

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
travel a certain speed or a certain

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.440 
travel a certain speed or a certain
velocity<00:06:10.500> but<00:06:11.340> it<00:06:11.460> would<00:06:11.610> be<00:06:11.760> kind<00:06:11.970> of<00:06:12.150> a<00:06:12.240> cool

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
velocity but it would be kind of a cool

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.450 
velocity but it would be kind of a cool
way<00:06:12.660> to<00:06:12.690> give<00:06:13.020> this<00:06:13.200> gun<00:06:13.470> maybe<00:06:13.860> a<00:06:13.979> slight

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
way to give this gun maybe a slight

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.850 
way to give this gun maybe a slight
benefit<00:06:15.030> for<00:06:15.270> using<00:06:15.539> the<00:06:15.660> suppressor<00:06:16.110> versus

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
benefit for using the suppressor versus

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.680 
benefit for using the suppressor versus
other<00:06:17.099> weapons<00:06:17.610> out<00:06:17.820> there<00:06:17.849> like<00:06:18.240> maybe<00:06:18.419> give

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
other weapons out there like maybe give

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.650 
other weapons out there like maybe give
it<00:06:18.810> 350<00:06:19.440> or<00:06:19.740> 400<00:06:20.130> meter<00:06:20.700> per<00:06:20.940> second<00:06:21.330> bullet

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660

it 350 or 400 meter per second bullet
velocity<00:06:21.780> I<00:06:22.470> get<00:06:22.919> that<00:06:23.099> it's<00:06:23.280> kind<00:06:23.490> of<00:06:23.550> messing

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
velocity I get that it's kind of messing

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.909 
velocity I get that it's kind of messing
with<00:06:23.940> physics<00:06:24.630> and<00:06:24.810> sonic<00:06:25.260> booms<00:06:25.500> and<00:06:25.830> all

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
little more interesting so at the same

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.240 
little more interesting so at the same
time<00:06:36.750> I<00:06:36.780> think<00:06:36.960> we<00:06:37.169> could<00:06:37.440> kind<00:06:37.620> of<00:06:37.710> bend<00:06:38.070> the

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
time I think we could kind of bend the

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.340 
time I think we could kind of bend the
rules<00:06:38.520> of<00:06:38.789> subsonic<00:06:39.570> ammo

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
rules of subsonic ammo

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.320 
rules of subsonic ammo
so<00:06:40.500> if<00:06:40.590> you've<00:06:40.770> already<00:06:40.920> used<00:06:41.130> the<00:06:41.490> cs5<00:06:42.060> I'd

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
so if you've already used the cs5 I'd

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.640 
so if you've already used the cs5 I'd
love<00:06:42.630> to<00:06:42.780> hear<00:06:42.930> what<00:06:43.050> you<00:06:43.200> guys<00:06:43.230> think<00:06:43.590> about
