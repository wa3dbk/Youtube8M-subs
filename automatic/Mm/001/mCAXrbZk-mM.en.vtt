00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
what about nutritional use and I'm like

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.490 
what about nutritional use and I'm like
there's<00:00:42.239> no<00:00:42.360> such<00:00:42.540> thing<00:00:42.750> as<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.960> nutritional

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
use that's like asking me about

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.549 
use that's like asking me about
nutritional<00:00:45.270> practical<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.200> cocaine

needs nutritional yeast is nutritional

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.010 
needs nutritional yeast is nutritional
of<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> east

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
of the east

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.630 
of the east
there's<00:00:55.020> no<00:00:55.170> yeast<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:56.039> fungus<00:00:56.489> that's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
there's no yeast or fungus that's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.590 
there's no yeast or fungus that's
nutritionally<00:00:57.329> humans<00:00:57.690> okay<00:00:58.699> what<00:00:59.699> yeast<00:01:00.359> is

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
nutritionally humans okay what yeast is

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
nutritionally humans okay what yeast is
everywhere<00:01:01.140> there's<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.800> reason<00:01:02.399> all<00:01:02.609> right

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
everywhere there's a reason all right

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.969 
everywhere there's a reason all right
because<00:01:03.390> there<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> different<00:01:04.710> phenotype

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
because there is a different phenotype

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.640 
because there is a different phenotype
that<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.640> creating<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> templates<00:01:07.140> will<00:01:07.350> help

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that is creating the templates will help

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.310 
that is creating the templates will help
and<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.430> phenotype<00:01:09.740> organically<00:01:10.740> shares

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
and that phenotype organically shares

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.830 
and that phenotype organically shares
genetic<00:01:13.320> past<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:14.280> yeast<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.000> rhesus

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
genetic past with yeast and rhesus

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.890 
genetic past with yeast and rhesus
monkeys<00:01:16.290> alright<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.790> now<00:01:18.000> why<00:01:18.390> people

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
monkeys alright this is now why people

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.289 
monkeys alright this is now why people
have<00:01:19.140> rhesus<00:01:19.710> monkeys<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.460> their<00:01:20.790> genetics

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
have rhesus monkeys in their genetics

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.810 
have rhesus monkeys in their genetics
all<00:01:21.810> right<00:01:21.990> anybody<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.650> has<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:23.220> positive

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
all right anybody that has be positive

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.940 
all right anybody that has be positive
any<00:01:24.270> positive<00:01:24.990> or<00:01:25.140> positive

any positive or positive

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.700 
any positive or positive
you<00:01:26.310> now<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.970> rhesus<00:01:27.570> monkey<00:01:28.020> genes<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you now have rhesus monkey genes and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.580 
you now have rhesus monkey genes and
your<00:01:29.220> body<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.720> look<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.320> what

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
your body right now and look out what

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
your body right now and look out what
the<00:01:31.740> rhesus<00:01:32.220> factor<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.329> right<00:01:33.540> that's

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the rhesus factor is all right that's

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.719 
the rhesus factor is all right that's
what<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.170> blood<00:01:34.380> type<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.829> we've<00:01:35.040> got<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.340> type

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
what your blood type is we've got a type

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.539 
what your blood type is we've got a type
a<00:01:35.970> positive<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:37.350> positive<00:01:38.100> means<00:01:38.340> you're

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
a positive that positive means you're

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.510 
a positive that positive means you're
positive<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.750> rhesus<00:01:40.320> monkey<00:01:40.950> proteins

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
positive for the rhesus monkey proteins

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.539 
positive for the rhesus monkey proteins
alright<00:01:42.450> those<00:01:42.930> proteins<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.770> become<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
alright those proteins have become a

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.420 
alright those proteins have become a
part<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.240> your<00:01:45.450> natural<00:01:46.259> blood<00:01:46.530> cell<00:01:46.860> all

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
part of your natural blood cell all

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.580 
part of your natural blood cell all
right<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.820> now<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.479> monkey<00:01:48.930> proteins<00:01:49.439> in

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
right so now you have monkey proteins in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.510 
right so now you have monkey proteins in
your<00:01:49.710> blood<00:01:49.979> cells

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
your blood cells

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.420 
your blood cells
we<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.790> mixed<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.509> monkeys<00:01:51.960> out<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.430> all

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
we have mixed with monkeys out here all

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.840 
we have mixed with monkeys out here all
right

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
right

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.649 
right
the<00:01:54.119> obvious<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.810> true<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:57.270> these<00:01:57.390> are<00:01:57.540> some

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the obvious is true so these are some

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.660 
the obvious is true so these are some
unpopular<00:01:58.500> things<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.040> people<00:01:59.189> don't<00:01:59.430> like

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
unpopular things that people don't like

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.340 
unpopular things that people don't like
to<00:01:59.790> talk<00:01:59.820> about<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.540> most<00:02:00.720> black<00:02:01.049> folks
