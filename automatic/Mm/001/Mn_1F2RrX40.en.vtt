00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.590 
I've always believed that there are
people<00:02:11.430> hungry<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.870> information<00:02:13.290> I

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
people hungry for that information I

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.360 
people hungry for that information I
taught<00:02:15.600> classes<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.290> workshops<00:02:16.470> for<00:02:16.980> years

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
taught classes and workshops for years

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.460 
taught classes and workshops for years
and<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.390> was<00:02:18.510> always<00:02:18.660> thinking<00:02:18.750> about<00:02:19.260> how<00:02:19.440> to

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
and I was always thinking about how to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.530 
and I was always thinking about how to
get<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.920> information<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:21.030> larger

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
get that information to a larger

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.640 
get that information to a larger

I thought about doing books and all of a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.660 
I thought about doing books and all of a
sudden<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:46.380> looked<00:02:46.590> up<00:02:46.739> at<00:02:46.860> each<00:02:46.980> other<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.520> in

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
sudden we looked up at each other and in

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.949 
sudden we looked up at each other and in
the<00:02:47.760> same<00:02:47.910> moment<00:02:48.270> said<00:02:48.450> DVD<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:51.120> was<00:02:51.450> so

the same moment said DVD it was so

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.190 
the same moment said DVD it was so
outside<00:02:52.500> my<00:02:52.709> comfort<00:02:52.890> zone<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.989> think<00:02:54.989> about

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
outside my comfort zone to think about

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.440 
outside my comfort zone to think about
branching<00:02:55.560> out<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:57.239> really

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
branching out like that and to really

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.720 
branching out like that and to really
put<00:02:57.720> myself<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.380> far<00:02:58.590> out<00:02:58.770> there<00:02:59.060> I<00:03:00.260> knew

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
put myself that far out there I knew

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.400 
put myself that far out there I knew
instantly<00:03:02.730> there<00:03:03.209> were<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.510> vast<00:03:03.810> amounts
