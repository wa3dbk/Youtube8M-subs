00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.840

 well explained there are different ranges I 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.130
 I'm in the third rank there the first 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.830
 that you can not do anything until you 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.100

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.450

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.259

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.740
 let me tell you to see the embassies this is 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.460

 and well I explain you there are different 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.430
 embassies that different cities in the 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.520
 forum and on the official website that finds 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.640
 in the description there is a dynamic map 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.790
 which is that you see everything from above as 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.470
 if a map on a website well 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.680
 the embassies that are places where 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.110
 you may want to transport yourself to the city 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.239
 this principle mainly not what 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.890
 you have until you do not pay a certain 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.000
 money that you can get that 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.000
 they call apes 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.739
 I thought I have four thousand right now 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.739
 I spent everything I had 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.280
 my mind 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.280
 warhammer at full volume 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.010
 let's see each city can have a 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.680
 building of these embassies now we will go 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.630
 to the city that I am that I some 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.020
 please if someone will sign up to come 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.970
 now it is explained from the area of ​​the city 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.819
 and as you see the iphone is all this there 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.400
 a market further 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.109
 many things that I will not explain that 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.599
 you can find on the official website 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.670
 because if it would not be very long it's worth 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.030
 she would say my city you have to pass 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.730
 through the portal you see we appear in a 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.890
 tower 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.110
 I already say this gets sick mind will not be 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.890
 always so we are going to change it 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.349
 we are building the building where 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.290
 appear you see well let's go in from 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.500

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.500
 all right 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.959
 before the flock we had to come 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.190
 walking but a faraway from afar 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.560
 it took us 10 minutes to come 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.030
 so well, the map is not loaded 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.840
 but it 's longer wall truth 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.040
 normal video settings partner 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.040
 to see it load 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.160
 Well, you can imagine that it is more 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.120
 long after the end of the video I'll leave 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.330
 an image of how the neckar viewing 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.299
 it is called aneca of this city I will leave the 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.570
 image of how to see it 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.390
 from afar 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.130
 like a map and well we enter here 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:28.410
 you see two pretty big doors and 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.210
 you appear in a square then the square 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.390
 of the market where there will be 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.450
 little shops and that 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.240
 and the source of all this are houses 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.820
 around are houses we are doing 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.300
 others or we're not getting a little 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.150
 the wall and now it was explained coming 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.010
 from there to the left you will find the 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.490
 house that we use at the moment that is the 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.920
 warehouse 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.140
 once here you see that they were the ovens 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.770
 an enchantment table with its 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.880
 shelves for potions and what 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.430
 they are being wolves to make copies 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.740
 we went up and here is the whole maz in de nk 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.569
 as you see up here are the chests 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.330
 private that 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.969
 whoever comes to the city can here 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.270
 save your congas and that nobody takes them 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:25.850
 from here everything that is trunks 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.850
 of audience that we can all use 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.480
 well as you see there are different houses that 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:36.820
 they are not inhabited yet because we are 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:40.530
 we are three from the city I think 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.530
 yes or two rather 2 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.170
 and as you can see many houses without occupying 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.330
 that you can come or help, I already say the 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.570
 houses we have to follow our rule and 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.660
 help us such as we do them 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.670
 we can not make you the house as 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.220
 you want nothing to follow 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:04.600
 rules that you will find there in the 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:07.930
 panels of the part of the panel that you 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.120
 I say also you can find it in the 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:14.180
 section of the forum that 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.250
 that I will leave you in the description of 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.280
 video that is where our city ​​is 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.020
 go better we look there not in the panel 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.660
 this that there is very well explained 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.820
 everything will center a video of the old 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.040
 city 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.330
 and well before I forgot to tell you 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:35.870
 that in the ranks what am I when 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:40.430
 You expect 30 hours and you can take home is 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:44.690
 press home bar home and you appear in the 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:46.210
 set home or the house that has added your 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.580
 before 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.670
 and you can also protect the chests at 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.760
 only one 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.580
 all right 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.470
 there's nothing more to explain if I've 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.680
 left something I would add in the 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.530
 description that I do not believe 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.330
 without anything I hope you liked it 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.639
 this server I already say is premium 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.699
 remember that if you do not have a 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:11.680
 bought you can not go in good 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:13.330
 I had forgotten a pretty thing 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.889
 important not to run your 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:19.229
 explained are the server rules 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:22.050
 I explain the basics that if you do 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:24.409
 You can obviously vare you can not 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.809
 to insult 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:29.239
 you can not leave trees of medium 

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:31.909
 cut I do not know why but it has a lot 

00:07:29.239 --> 00:07:34.489
 mania is served with this with this not 

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:38.179
 leave half-cut trees if you see it 

00:07:34.489 --> 00:07:42.709
 some less balearan and remember that in 

00:07:38.179 --> 00:07:45.020
 the pp and you can not destroy houses of the 

00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:48.050
 others or steal chests 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.970
 without anything I think this is all me 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.300
 dismissal already and see you in the next 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.300
 video 

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.420
 and you
