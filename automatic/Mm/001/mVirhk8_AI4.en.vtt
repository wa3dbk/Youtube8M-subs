00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.950
 we do not continue here in our second 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.500
 day of the fifteenth day of 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.420
 lighting of the aie section mexico and 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.939
 We are now talking for a while 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.730
 liliana gonzÃ¡lez the president-elect and 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:23.390
 in a few minutes the president would be 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.920
 is currently active in the Mexico chapter 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.619
 of the mexico section that you can 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.080
 say what we can expect from 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.230
 this part of this new period of the and 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.329
 is with you as president thanks 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.910
 luis juan looks basically I think that 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.059
 I can summarize it in two points 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.030
 The first is to generate value 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.320
 generate value for the community to 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.480
 all members for 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.620
 sponsors so that all the people 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.890
 that approaches the Ies have something to 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.350
 change either through networking or 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.440
 to generate contact points obviously 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.840
 transmit knowledge and I another one of 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.960
 point of value you want because I want 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.610
 work is to be inclusive of 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.530
 good entry well our 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.930
 is unlike the previous ones is 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.190
 inclusive with women but also 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.350
 we are including young people more people 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.590
 young but also people who had never 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.130
 participated in laws obviously also 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.420
 of our vice president comes from 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.640
 monterrey and then we are 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.670
 decentralizing as you say 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.860
 we are opening to other areas and who 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.560
 have received the information of the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.870
 collaborators are very enthusiastic 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.940
 because they finally feel taken 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.880
 find and we are for that to add 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.610
 to listen to ideas to make them feel 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.220
 that this association belongs to all is 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.410
 our all and we put ourselves to 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.830
 work but together for tico 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.259
 teach the fine points already for the 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.350
 operative part so that things happen 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.790
 from here from intention to reality 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.640
 what do we need? 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.410
 a section that we belong to and is and 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.479
 the ies has very clear statutes 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.340
 so if we stick to what 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.709
 what the statutes say because there is already a 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.640
 structure and if we follow the path 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.520
 will do 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.170
 very easy for example there are committees and 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.390
 work through committees is going to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.700
 help a lot to give us direction by 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.110
 example is the membership committee and 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.620
 the person in charge of that committee 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.290
 will aim to offer value to 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.330
 the members and obviously increase the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.280
 number of affiliate members we have 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.650
 the sponsors committee so that 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.840
 also the sponsor feels 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.390
 listened to we have the education committee 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.680
 the university committee the committee that 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.450
 will have contact with other 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.370
 associations also took advantage of 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.520
 opportunity precisely to invite them 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.920
 to add join will learn approach is given 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.690
 our as good they share their ideas 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.870
 because many times those are 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.630
 comments in sobremesa hears a criticism 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.080
 or a very good idea and there it stays 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.790
 then it would be very valuable to us 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.920
 receive the hear them and put them in 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.050
 practice thank you so much practice 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.970
 with you at this time and we are going to 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.970
 covering activities with a lot
