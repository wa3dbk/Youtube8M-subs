and hard and nothing fall right on it

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.009 
and hard and nothing fall right on it
and<00:02:07.759> if<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.000> notice<00:02:08.300> that<00:02:08.330> it<00:02:08.569> isn't<00:02:08.840> hard

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
and if you notice that it isn't hard

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.690 
and if you notice that it isn't hard
enough<00:02:09.289> just<00:02:09.860> keep<00:02:10.129> it<00:02:10.250> in<00:02:10.340> there<00:02:10.489> a<00:02:10.550> little

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
enough just keep it in there a little

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.920 
enough just keep it in there a little

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
bit longer and then to top it off

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.869 
bit longer and then to top it off
typically<00:02:18.769> you<00:02:18.950> would<00:02:19.069> use<00:02:19.250> some<00:02:19.489> sort<00:02:19.760> of
