00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 hello guys what to do if 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.560
 after 1 computer starts with the button 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.300
 first you need to check the power supply 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.090
 So I connected the workers and interest 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.889
 worker power here is leon if you 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.440
 know how to use the tester then you 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.500
 can test on this do not 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.189
 I will be here a normal power supply I and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.660
 I hooked all that further yes I clamp 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.300
 the power button on my computer is not 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.460
 turned on well i start to look in 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.590
 okay is our all capacitor if 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.890
 capacitors and blown off and then you need it 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.590
 will replace after looking at 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.550
 battery test and and it should 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.390
 be 3 volts yah I basically it 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.949
 weaker but nothing here is a jumper 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:57.140
 here we mix we reset bios all 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:59.940
 The following turn on does not include Victor to them 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.699
 the video card does not turn on swing all 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.260
 boards completely disable all hard 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.110
 disk 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.850
 we take out completely random access memory 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.070
 all-all-all boards, only the block remains 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.000
 power and 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.009
 radiator process all turn on not 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.610
 turns on if it does not turn on well 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.119
 then remove our radiator under it will 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.229
 processes now carefully if you md 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.479
 processor then only four seconds 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.299
 turn on the power press the button 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.280
 connections if he started the processor 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.130
 warm up immediately century and yet i'm them 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.500
 processor power m item no more 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.680
 four seconds fill i mean i 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.759
 turned on the power here put your finger on 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.790
 the processor here put your finger on the processor 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.130
 and turned on if you started basking mean 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.229
 our processor works 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.750
 before it is better to take it out 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.240
 processor see if he is ok 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.670
 legs there is such that it oxidizes 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.590
 because of this just a bad contact and he 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.860
 computer does not start stub means 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.050
 First you can insert your finger 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.950
 turn on the computer just started to get warm 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.940
 all disconnect immediately from the outlet 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:20.810
 okay all smear again thermal grease 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.330
 we put in place we put everything one by one and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.379
 try the key well includes everything if everything 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.610
 it works fine for me 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.310
 so think this video will be useful to you 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.030
 if something is wrong, say write to 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.750
 comments I have more videos on 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:43.629
 Channel BIOS error signals that is out there 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:46.629
 post card here you can see all 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.629
 sitting
