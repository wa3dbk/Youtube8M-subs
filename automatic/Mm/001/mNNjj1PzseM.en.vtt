like<00:02:11.980> paint<00:02:12.430> at<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.030> moment<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:13.750> can<00:02:13.930> use

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
like paint at the moment you can use

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.830 
like paint at the moment you can use
this<00:02:14.260> for<00:02:14.500> glue<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:15.670> by<00:02:16.090> itself<00:02:16.450> or<00:02:16.690> if<00:02:16.750> you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
this for glue just by itself or if you

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.990 
this for glue just by itself or if you
need<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.020> stronger<00:02:17.380> glue<00:02:17.770> add<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.370> little<00:02:18.730> bit<00:02:18.970> of

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
need a stronger glue add a little bit of

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.600 
need a stronger glue add a little bit of
PVA<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.650> gives<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.010> bit<00:02:21.130> more<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.490> a

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
PVA and it gives it a bit more of a

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.260 
PVA and it gives it a bit more of a
typical<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.540> bit<00:02:22.720> less<00:02:22.960> tint<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.270> what

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
typical a bit less tint to it so what

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.910 
typical a bit less tint to it so what
we're<00:02:25.420> going<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.660> do<00:02:25.870> now<00:02:26.080> I'm<00:02:26.590> going<00:02:26.830> to

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
we're going to do now I'm going to

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.740 
we're going to do now I'm going to
divide<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.550> equally<00:02:27.910> between<00:02:28.120> my<00:02:28.480> glasses

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
divide it equally between my glasses

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.880 
divide it equally between my glasses
