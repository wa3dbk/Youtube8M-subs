00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
years ago back in 2008 this case came in

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.770 
years ago back in 2008 this case came in
with<00:00:39.309> previously<00:00:40.309> opened<00:00:40.789> by<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.090> general

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
with previously opened by the general

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.340 
with previously opened by the general
dentist<00:00:42.019> to<00:00:42.679> where<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:43.670> is<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:44.350> access

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
dentist to where this is the access

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.849 
dentist to where this is the access
opening<00:00:46.600> which<00:00:47.600> is<00:00:47.780> very<00:00:47.989> reasonable<00:00:48.170> access

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
opening which is very reasonable access

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.520 
opening which is very reasonable access
opening<00:00:49.370> I<00:00:49.519> like<00:00:50.089> the<00:00:50.239> fact<00:00:50.480> that<00:00:50.600> there<00:00:51.440> were

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
opening I like the fact that there were

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.860 
opening I like the fact that there were
very<00:00:53.980> conservative<00:00:54.980> on<00:00:55.460> axis<00:00:55.879> opening<00:00:56.329> but

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
very conservative on axis opening but

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.180 
very conservative on axis opening but
they're<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:57.109> little<00:00:57.260> bit<00:00:58.089> too<00:00:59.089> much<00:01:00.100> enamel<00:01:01.100> and

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
they're a little bit too much enamel and

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.450 
they're a little bit too much enamel and
dentin<00:01:01.519> was<00:01:01.730> removed<00:01:02.179> on<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.749> mesial<00:01:03.339> so<00:01:04.339> the

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
dentin was removed on the mesial so the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.950 
dentin was removed on the mesial so the
case<00:01:04.670> came<00:01:04.940> in<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:05.449> I'm<00:01:05.510> looking<00:01:05.659> at<00:01:05.870> this

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
case came in and I'm looking at this

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.440 
case came in and I'm looking at this
tooth<00:01:06.260> here<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:07.040> looking<00:01:07.610> at<00:01:07.729> it<00:01:07.939> seeing<00:01:08.210> oh

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
tooth here and looking at it seeing oh

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.020 
tooth here and looking at it seeing oh
my<00:01:08.869> god<00:01:09.110> is<00:01:09.259> this<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.310> I'm<00:01:10.369> gonna<00:01:10.579> perjure<00:01:10.970> in

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
my god is this a so I'm gonna perjure in

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.740 
my god is this a so I'm gonna perjure in
this<00:01:11.180> tooth<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:11.780> it<00:01:12.500> turned<00:01:12.799> out<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:12.950> be<00:01:13.220> a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
this tooth but it turned out to be a

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.969 
this tooth but it turned out to be a
paste<00:01:14.750> that<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.590> dentist<00:01:16.159> uses<00:01:16.509> for<00:01:17.979> interim

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
paste that the dentist uses for interim

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.969 
paste that the dentist uses for interim
cases<00:01:20.229> appointments<00:01:21.229> with<00:01:21.500> calcium

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
cases appointments with calcium

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.630 
cases appointments with calcium
hydroxide<00:01:22.130> calcium<00:01:23.090> hydroxide<00:01:23.719> is<00:01:23.990> a<00:01:24.170> paste

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
hydroxide calcium hydroxide is a paste

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.959 
hydroxide calcium hydroxide is a paste
with<00:01:25.640> high<00:01:25.850> pH<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:27.500> use<00:01:27.890> between<00:01:28.430> appointments

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
with high pH to use between appointments

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.300 
with high pH to use between appointments
so<00:01:31.600> that<00:01:32.600> would<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.990> get<00:01:33.200> eliminate<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:33.829> lot<00:01:34.130> of

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
so that would to get eliminate a lot of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.779 
so that would to get eliminate a lot of
act<00:01:34.490> area<00:01:34.850> inside<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.659> canals<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:36.530> makes<00:01:37.520> the

act area inside the canals and makes the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.510 
act area inside the canals and makes the
tooth<00:01:38.030> become<00:01:38.689> more<00:01:38.869> successful<00:01:39.189> or<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.340> case

tooth become more successful or the case
become<00:01:40.820> more<00:01:40.969> successful<00:01:41.799> this<00:01:42.799> is<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:44.469> calplus

or meta paste that makes it look like
this<00:01:54.560> very<00:01:55.340> radiopaque<00:01:56.270> if<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:57.200> take<00:01:57.380> a

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
this very radiopaque if you take a

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.740 
this very radiopaque if you take a
closer<00:01:57.740> look<00:01:57.890> at<00:01:58.189> this<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:58.729> thought<00:01:59.000> that<00:01:59.359> some

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
closer look at this I thought that some

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.889 
closer look at this I thought that some
of<00:01:59.869> that<00:01:59.960> overfill<00:02:00.560> from<00:02:01.840> originally<00:02:02.840> I

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
of that overfill from originally I

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.660 
of that overfill from originally I
thought<00:02:03.049> it<00:02:03.170> was<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.740> good<00:02:03.950> approach<00:02:04.250> on<00:02:04.520> the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
thought it was a good approach on the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.340 
thought it was a good approach on the
mesial-buccal<00:02:05.119> rule<00:02:05.479> because<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.869> looks<00:02:06.049> just

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
mesial-buccal rule because it looks just

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.900 
mesial-buccal rule because it looks just
so<00:02:06.560> perfect<00:02:07.130> on<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:09.259> fill<00:02:10.810> but<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:12.910> overfill

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
so perfect on the fill but it's overfill

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.330 
so perfect on the fill but it's overfill
looks<00:02:14.300> like<00:02:14.450> it's<00:02:14.630> on<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.900> sinus<00:02:15.320> floor<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
looks like it's on the sinus floor the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.650 
looks like it's on the sinus floor the
sinus<00:02:16.700> floor

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
sinus floor

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.050 
sinus floor
doesn't<00:02:18.140> have<00:02:18.230> too<00:02:18.350> much<00:02:18.470> blood<00:02:18.830> supply<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:19.940> we

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
doesn't have too much blood supply so we

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.910 
doesn't have too much blood supply so we
have<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.270> be<00:02:20.390> careful<00:02:20.840> as<00:02:21.020> far<00:02:21.050> as<00:02:21.290> any

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
have to be careful as far as any

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.730 
have to be careful as far as any
overfill<00:02:23.800> this<00:02:24.800> is<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:26.330> lingual<00:02:26.840> canal<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.680> I

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
overfill this is the lingual canal and I

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.020 
overfill this is the lingual canal and I
thought<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.040> was<00:02:28.160> coming<00:02:28.460> from<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.700> lingual

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
thought it was coming from the lingual

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.810 
thought it was coming from the lingual
canal<00:02:29.180> but<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.320> closer<00:02:30.650> look<00:02:30.980> he<00:02:31.190> looks<00:02:31.640> like

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
canal but on a closer look he looks like

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.070 
canal but on a closer look he looks like
it's<00:02:32.000> coming<00:02:32.330> from<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.660> mesial-buccal<00:02:33.050> canal

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
it's coming from the mesial-buccal canal

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.550 
it's coming from the mesial-buccal canal
and<00:02:33.830> extending<00:02:34.580> distally<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.960> sinus

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
and extending distally on the sinus

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.830 
and extending distally on the sinus
floor<00:02:36.830> this<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:38.000> got<00:02:38.240> aperture<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:38.810> I

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
floor this is the got aperture that I

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.560 
floor this is the got aperture that I
placed<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.740> finish<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.130> case<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.730> it

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
placed in and finish the case and it

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.750 
placed in and finish the case and it
looks<00:02:41.780> like<00:02:41.870> yeah<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.440> overfill<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.370> coming

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
looks like yeah the overfill is coming

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.700 
looks like yeah the overfill is coming
from<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.060> mesial-buccal<00:02:44.480> canal<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:45.470> it's

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
from the mesial-buccal canal and it's

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.970 
from the mesial-buccal canal and it's
filling<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.730> sinus<00:02:47.360> floor<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:48.740> wanted

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
filling the sinus floor and so I wanted

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.590 
filling the sinus floor and so I wanted
to<00:02:49.040> kind<00:02:49.580> of<00:02:49.610> keep<00:02:49.760> an<00:02:49.910> eye<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.060> let's<00:02:50.450> make

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
to kind of keep an eye on let's make

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.000 
to kind of keep an eye on let's make
sure<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:51.460> everything<00:02:52.460> is<00:02:52.730> absorbing<00:02:53.330> and

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
sure it's everything is absorbing and

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.310 
sure it's everything is absorbing and
biologically<00:02:55.010> sound<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:55.790> we<00:02:55.910> went<00:02:56.060> ahead<00:02:56.120> and

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
biologically sound so we went ahead and

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.560 
biologically sound so we went ahead and
finally<00:02:57.320> had<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.590> patient<00:02:57.950> back<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.580> this<00:02:59.510> is

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
finally had the patient back and this is

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.130 
finally had the patient back and this is
a<00:03:00.200> one-year<00:03:01.160> recall<00:03:01.760> on<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.420> case<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.050> it

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
a one-year recall on this case and it

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.930 
a one-year recall on this case and it
looks<00:03:03.320> like<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:05.260> calcium<00:03:06.260> oxide<00:03:06.710> paste<00:03:06.950> or

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
looks like that calcium oxide paste or

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.880 
looks like that calcium oxide paste or
calplus<00:03:08.690> is<00:03:09.050> all<00:03:10.030> absorbed<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.590> long-term<00:03:12.590> it

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
calplus is all absorbed and long-term it

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.700 
calplus is all absorbed and long-term it
should<00:03:13.370> be<00:03:13.490> no<00:03:13.670> problems<00:03:14.240> so<00:03:15.080> this<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.470> case

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
should be no problems so this is a case

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.150 
should be no problems so this is a case
that<00:03:15.740> shows<00:03:16.520> how<00:03:16.760> it<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.420> body<00:03:17.930> takes<00:03:18.890> care<00:03:19.130> of

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
that shows how it the body takes care of

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.450 
that shows how it the body takes care of
these<00:03:19.450> overfill
