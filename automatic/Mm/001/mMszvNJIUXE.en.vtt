you<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:29.910> not<00:00:30.240> I've<00:00:30.720> been<00:00:30.900> using<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.560> for

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
you know not I've been using it just for

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.650

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
video games every now and then so I

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.850 
video games every now and then so I
decided<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.719> saw<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.230> lightning<00:00:37.649> deal

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
decided I saw this on a lightning deal

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.479 
decided I saw this on a lightning deal
for<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.520> 30<00:00:38.850> percent<00:00:39.390> off<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> normal<00:00:39.660> price

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
for like 30 percent off the normal price

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.920

black flag whenever that releases

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.000 
black flag whenever that releases
because<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> laptop<00:01:04.110> comes<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> code<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
because the laptop comes with a code to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.740 
because the laptop comes with a code to
redeem<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.610> get<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> game<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.270> free<00:01:06.299> and

what<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:18.030> probably<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.620> most<00:02:19.770> Awkward

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
what this is probably the most Awkward

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:28.160 
what this is probably the most Awkward
unboxing<00:02:20.880> ever<00:02:21.470> what<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.650> heck<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:27.170> you

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
unboxing ever what the heck is this you

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.460 
unboxing ever what the heck is this you
know<00:02:28.260> what<00:02:28.500> who<00:02:28.710> cares<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:34.140> there's<00:02:34.320> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
know what who cares so there's the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.890 
know what who cares so there's the
actual<00:02:34.740> Mouse<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:35.430> got<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:38.720> guess<00:02:39.720> it's

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
actual Mouse it's got to I guess it's

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.730 
actual Mouse it's got to I guess it's
like<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.110> light

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
you got three four or five six and then

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.700 
you got three four or five six and then
you've<00:02:43.770> got<00:02:43.950> dpi<00:02:44.910> buttons<00:02:45.510> which<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:46.320> don't

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
you've got dpi buttons which I don't
