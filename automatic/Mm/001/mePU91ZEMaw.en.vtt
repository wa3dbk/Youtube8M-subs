00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
but it makes the colors appear way more

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.219 
but it makes the colors appear way more
vibrant<00:01:14.150> once<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:15.720> white<00:01:15.930> base

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
vibrant once you have the white base

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.680 
vibrant once you have the white base
down<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.950> you'd<00:01:17.190> let<00:01:17.430> them<00:01:17.610> completely<00:01:18.150> dry

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
it's time to begin marbling the concept

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.109 
it's time to begin marbling the concept
of<00:01:25.110> marbling<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.800> pretty<00:01:26.070> simple<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.640> take<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
of marbling is pretty simple you take a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.910 
of marbling is pretty simple you take a
room-temperature<00:01:27.600> cup<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.260> water<00:01:28.500> something

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.740 
when drying let's just sit it on top of
something<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.190> then<00:02:39.340> put<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.880> nail<00:02:40.330> polish

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
something and then put the nail polish

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.720 
something and then put the nail polish
angelee<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.290> top<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.710> key<00:02:41.920> with<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.580> edge

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
angelee on top of the key with the edge

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.910 
angelee on top of the key with the edge
hanging<00:02:43.330> off<00:02:43.510> another<00:02:44.200> way<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.680> could

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
hanging off another way that you could

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.610 
hanging off another way that you could
dry<00:02:45.190> them<00:02:45.400> is<00:02:45.580> by<00:02:45.970> putting<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.630> Bulldog<00:02:47.140> clip<00:02:47.410> I

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
dry them is by putting a Bulldog clip I

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.930 
dry them is by putting a Bulldog clip I
think<00:02:47.830> that's<00:02:48.040> what<00:02:48.190> they're<00:02:48.310> called<00:02:48.520> around

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
think that's what they're called around

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.550 
think that's what they're called around
the<00:02:49.060> place<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.810> sitting<00:02:49.990> it<00:02:50.170> there<00:02:50.380> and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
the place and just sitting it there and

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.740 
the place and just sitting it there and
look<00:02:50.920> all<00:02:51.190> your<00:02:51.490> kids<00:02:51.760> are<00:02:51.880> done<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.270> marveled

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
look all your kids are done and marveled

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.480 
look all your kids are done and marveled
and<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.050> looks<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:53.470> cool<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.890> they're<00:02:54.340> each

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
and it looks so cool and they're each

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.910 
and it looks so cool and they're each
just<00:02:55.150> typically<00:02:55.420> leave<00:02:55.600> their<00:02:55.750> own<00:02:55.900> okay<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:56.680> I

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
just typically leave their own okay so I

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.040 
just typically leave their own okay so I
have<00:02:57.250> two<00:02:57.489> house<00:02:57.730> keys<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.660> look<00:02:58.870> identical

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
have two house keys that look identical

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.229 
have two house keys that look identical
and<00:02:59.800> there's<00:02:59.980> no<00:03:00.130> way<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.310> tell<00:03:00.610> them<00:03:00.760> apart<00:03:00.850> so

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
and there's no way to tell them apart so

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.660 
and there's no way to tell them apart so
I<00:03:01.720> decided<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.260> do<00:03:02.560> two<00:03:02.860> different<00:03:03.040> things<00:03:03.430> to

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
I decided to do two different things to

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.420 
I decided to do two different things to
them<00:03:03.900> one<00:03:04.900> got<00:03:05.140> marbles<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.770> this<00:03:06.010> one<00:03:06.220> is

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
them one got marbles and this one is

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.130 
them one got marbles and this one is
getting<00:03:06.640> glittered<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:07.450> what<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.690> did<00:03:07.989> to

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
getting glittered so what I did to

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.170 
getting glittered so what I did to
achieve<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.739> was<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.310> painted<00:03:09.820> it<00:03:09.940> with<00:03:10.060> nail

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
achieve that was I painted it with nail

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.699 
achieve that was I painted it with nail
polish<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.690> then<00:03:10.780> dumped<00:03:11.080> glitter<00:03:11.380> on<00:03:11.560> it

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
polish and then dumped glitter on it

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:30.610 
polish and then dumped glitter on it
super-tough<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.730> know

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.050 

so<00:03:31.620> once<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.980> was<00:03:32.159> done<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.610> I'm<00:03:32.700> gonna<00:03:32.819> hand

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
so once I was done that I'm gonna hand

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.660 
so once I was done that I'm gonna hand
put<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.450> clip<00:03:33.840> onto<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.379> and<00:03:34.530> sat<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.099> down<00:03:35.310> so

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
put a clip onto it and sat it down so

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.960 
put a clip onto it and sat it down so
that<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.849> could<00:03:36.120> dry<00:03:40.310> okay<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.370> we<00:03:41.640> definitely

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
that I could dry okay so we definitely

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.910 
that I could dry okay so we definitely
don't<00:03:42.180> want<00:03:42.480> glitter<00:03:42.720> going<00:03:43.230> everywhere<00:03:43.650> and

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
don't want glitter going everywhere and

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.949 
don't want glitter going everywhere and
the<00:03:44.040> easiest<00:03:44.430> way<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.670> do<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.540> seal<00:03:45.780> it

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
the easiest way to do that is to seal it

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.780 
the easiest way to do that is to seal it
in<00:03:46.079> I<00:03:46.290> went<00:03:46.530> ahead<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.799> use<00:03:47.160> some<00:03:47.190> clear<00:03:47.760> nail
