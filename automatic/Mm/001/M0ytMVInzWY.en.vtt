initially um I finally I'd like to see

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.029 
initially um I finally I'd like to see
him<00:06:09.690> put<00:06:09.840> on<00:06:09.870> a<00:06:09.960> few<00:06:10.169> pounds<00:06:10.229> and<00:06:10.650> maybe<00:06:10.830> play<00:06:10.979> a

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
him put on a few pounds and maybe play a

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.469

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
on 15 to 20 mm more than safety I think

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.629 
on 15 to 20 mm more than safety I think
he<00:06:15.210> lacks<00:06:15.449> the<00:06:15.599> ideal<00:06:16.560> speed<00:06:16.949> to<00:06:17.130> be<00:06:17.250> a<00:06:17.280> safety

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
he lacks the ideal speed to be a safety

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.080 
he lacks the ideal speed to be a safety
um<00:06:18.030> in<00:06:18.930> the<00:06:18.990> NFL<00:06:19.440> I<00:06:19.740> can<00:06:20.159> agree<00:06:20.340> with<00:06:20.400> that<00:06:20.520> so

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
um in the NFL I can agree with that so

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.960 
um in the NFL I can agree with that so
he<00:06:21.449> can<00:06:21.630> hit<00:06:21.840> yes<00:06:22.500> he<00:06:22.650> can<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:23.130> he<00:06:23.310> looks<00:06:23.729> just

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
he can hit yes he can and he looks just

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.460 
he can hit yes he can and he looks just
