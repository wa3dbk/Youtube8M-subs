down with either a piece of straw of
ribbon<00:00:43.089> like<00:00:43.239> I<00:00:43.420> used<00:00:43.690> or<00:00:43.989> you<00:00:44.109> could<00:00:44.260> use<00:00:44.440> a

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
ribbon like I used or you could use a

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.799 
ribbon like I used or you could use a
sticky<00:00:45.129> dot<00:00:45.309> or<00:00:45.489> something<00:00:45.820> like<00:00:45.940> that<00:00:45.999> but

sticky dot or something like that but
the<00:00:47.499> point<00:00:47.739> of<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:47.920> matter<00:00:48.129> is<00:00:48.460> that<00:00:48.789> you

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
the point of the matter is that you

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.139 
the point of the matter is that you
don't<00:00:49.690> necessarily<00:00:49.929> need<00:00:50.499> to<00:00:50.710> have<00:00:51.039> the<00:00:51.550> Box<00:00:51.789> B

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
don't necessarily need to have the Box B

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.079 
don't necessarily need to have the Box B
Square<00:00:52.629> and<00:00:53.289> for<00:00:53.949> that<00:00:54.039> reason<00:00:54.100> what<00:00:54.940> we're

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
Square and for that reason what we're

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:56.189 
Square and for that reason what we're
going<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.329> be<00:00:55.420> doing<00:00:55.539> today<00:00:55.780> is<00:00:55.870> we're<00:00:56.079> going

the shortest measurement of your card

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.490 
the shortest measurement of your card
the<00:01:12.940> length<00:01:13.330> is<00:01:13.600> going<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.080> be<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.320> longest

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
the length is going to be the longest

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.120 
the length is going to be the longest
measurement<00:01:15.250> of<00:01:15.340> your<00:01:15.370> card<00:01:16.560> not<00:01:17.560> necessarily

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
measurement of your card not necessarily

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.370 
measurement of your card not necessarily
important<00:01:18.910> that<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.210> card<00:01:19.540> fit<00:01:19.840> into<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.170> box

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
important that the card fit into the box

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.530 
important that the card fit into the box
what's<00:01:20.980> important<00:01:21.610> is<00:01:21.760> that<00:01:21.790> the<00:01:22.060> envelope

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
what's important is that the envelope

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.290 
what's important is that the envelope
fit<00:01:22.840> into<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.170> box<00:01:23.410> and<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:24.030> envelope<00:01:25.030> tends

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
fit into the box and the envelope tends

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.750 
fit into the box and the envelope tends
to<00:01:25.420> be<00:01:25.540> just<00:01:25.900> slightly<00:01:26.020> larger<00:01:26.860> than<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.490> card

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
to be just slightly larger than the card

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.690 
to be just slightly larger than the card
so<00:01:28.360> when<00:01:28.960> you<00:01:29.140> are<00:01:29.170> creating<00:01:29.620> your<00:01:30.100> pizza<00:01:30.490> box

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
so when you are creating your pizza box

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.580 
so when you are creating your pizza box
the<00:01:30.970> first<00:01:31.180> thing<00:01:31.360> you<00:01:31.450> need<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.660> do<00:01:31.870> is<00:01:32.080> make<00:01:32.560> a

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
the first thing you need to do is make a

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.520 
the first thing you need to do is make a
template<00:01:33.160> for<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.730> top<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.990> bottom<00:01:35.170> of

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
template for the top and the bottom of

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.890 
template for the top and the bottom of
the<00:01:36.010> box<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:36.910> whatever<00:01:37.270> your<00:01:37.510> card

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
the box so whatever your card

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.840 
the box so whatever your card
measurement<00:01:38.500> is<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:38.950> in<00:01:39.010> this<00:01:39.130> case<00:01:39.370> four<00:01:39.730> and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
measurement is and in this case four and

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.880 
measurement is and in this case four and
a<00:01:39.880> quarter<00:01:40.060> by<00:01:40.360> five<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.870> half<00:01:40.930> we're<00:01:41.710> going

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
a quarter by five and a half we're going

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.340 
a quarter by five and a half we're going
to<00:01:41.980> add<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.280> quarter<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:42.910> an<00:01:43.120> inch<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.990> each<00:01:44.140> of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
to add a quarter of an inch to each of

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.560 
to add a quarter of an inch to each of
those<00:01:44.440> measurements<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:45.760> will<00:01:45.910> create<00:01:46.210> a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
those measurements so that will create a

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.740 
those measurements so that will create a
box<00:01:47.320> top<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.220> bottom<00:01:48.580> that<00:01:49.000> is<00:01:49.030> four<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.600> a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
box top and bottom that is four and a

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.320 
box top and bottom that is four and a
half<00:01:49.780> inches<00:01:50.290> by<00:01:51.190> five<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.760> three-quarter

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
half inches by five and three-quarter

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.900 
half inches by five and three-quarter
inches<00:01:52.660> now<00:01:53.320> I've<00:01:53.470> made<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.740> template<00:01:54.220> here<00:01:54.490> to

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
inches now I've made a template here to

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
bottom in addition we have to determine

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.000 
bottom in addition we have to determine
how<00:02:09.759> deep<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.269> box<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.690> going<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:11.019> be<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.440> the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
how deep the box is going to be and the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.830 
how deep the box is going to be and the
box<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:12.489> created<00:02:12.940> for<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.269> gift<00:02:13.480> cards

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
box that I created for the gift cards

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.540 
box that I created for the gift cards
was<00:02:14.050> three-quarters<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.650> an<00:02:14.830> inch<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.220> depth

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
was three-quarters of an inch in depth

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.089 
was three-quarters of an inch in depth
that<00:02:16.180> accommodated<00:02:16.840> six<00:02:17.230> cards<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.920> their

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
that accommodated six cards and their

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.460 
that accommodated six cards and their
envelopes<00:02:18.640> these

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
envelopes these

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.530 
envelopes these
were<00:02:19.710> not<00:02:19.890> heavily<00:02:20.250> embellished<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.390> they

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
were not heavily embellished so they

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.750 
were not heavily embellished so they
weren't<00:02:21.780> real<00:02:22.080> thick<00:02:22.470> I've<00:02:22.950> never<00:02:23.160> made<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.460> box

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
weren't real thick I've never made a box

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.760 
weren't real thick I've never made a box
that<00:02:23.880> was<00:02:24.060> much<00:02:24.270> thicker<00:02:24.780> or<00:02:24.930> much<00:02:25.230> deeper<00:02:25.740> i

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
that was much thicker or much deeper i

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.710 
that was much thicker or much deeper i
should<00:02:26.040> say<00:02:26.280> than<00:02:26.520> an<00:02:26.640> inch<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.570> might

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
should say than an inch so you might

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.750 
should say than an inch so you might
want<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.960> experiment<00:02:28.500> some<00:02:28.830> cardstock<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.580> not

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
want to experiment some cardstock is not

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.970 
want to experiment some cardstock is not
heavy<00:02:30.000> enough<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.750> support<00:02:31.170> boxes<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.950> are

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
heavy enough to support boxes that are

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.190 
heavy enough to support boxes that are
real<00:02:32.250> deep<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.480> next<00:02:33.600> thing<00:02:33.750> we<00:02:33.930> need<00:02:34.080> to

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
real deep so the next thing we need to

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.620 
real deep so the next thing we need to
add<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:34.980> we<00:02:35.400> need<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.640> add<00:02:35.790> our<00:02:36.090> depth

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
add to this is we need to add our depth

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.050 
add to this is we need to add our depth
and<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.860> this<00:02:38.010> box<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.580> are<00:02:38.700> going<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.940> be

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
and for this box we are going to be

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.400
