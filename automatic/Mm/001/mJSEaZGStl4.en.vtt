hey guys just giving you another video

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.629 
hey guys just giving you another video
here<00:00:08.330> getting<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.389> motor<00:00:09.600> installed<00:00:10.639> just

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
here getting this motor installed just

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.039 
here getting this motor installed just
got<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.880> sitting<00:00:12.059> in<00:00:12.180> there<00:00:12.330> now<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.480> started<00:00:12.959> to

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
got it sitting in there now I started to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.199 
got it sitting in there now I started to
connect<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.700> finish<00:00:14.700> connecting<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209 
connect the finish connecting the

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.150 
connect the finish connecting the
transmission<00:00:15.780> up<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.260> then<00:00:16.350> put<00:00:17.130> my

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
transmission up to it and then put my

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.340 
transmission up to it and then put my
cross<00:00:17.490> number<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.180> then<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.960> engine<00:00:19.230> will

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
cross number in and then the engine will

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.190 
cross number in and then the engine will
be<00:00:19.380> installed<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:21.210> then<00:00:21.360> I<00:00:21.720> could<00:00:22.020> probably

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
be installed and then I could probably

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.380 
be installed and then I could probably
throw<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.620> headers<00:00:22.860> in<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.370> some<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
throw the headers in and some of the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.100 
throw the headers in and some of the
odds<00:00:24.540> and<00:00:24.750> ends<00:00:24.900> on<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.260> thing<00:00:26.900> once<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.990> get

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
odds and ends on this thing once I get

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.620 
odds and ends on this thing once I get
that<00:00:28.230> done<00:00:28.290> I<00:00:28.500> could<00:00:28.770> probably<00:00:29.300> start<00:00:30.300> fitting

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
that done I could probably start fitting

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.610 
that done I could probably start fitting

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
anything polished yeah I thought about

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.430 
anything polished yeah I thought about
the<00:00:58.019> paint<00:00:59.719> looking<00:01:00.719> back<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.079> few<00:01:01.260> other

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the paint looking back on a few other

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.379 
the paint looking back on a few other
videos<00:01:01.909> the<00:01:02.909> only<00:01:02.969> thing<00:01:03.239> you're<00:01:03.359> really

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:03.389 
videos the only thing you're really

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:06.110 
videos the only thing you're really
gonna<00:01:03.719> see<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.700> alternator<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
gonna see is the alternator and the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.200 
gonna see is the alternator and the
intake<00:01:06.510> maybe<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:08.220> valve<00:01:08.460> covers<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> little

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
intake maybe the valve covers a little

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450 
intake maybe the valve covers a little
bit<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.079> don't<00:01:10.560> know<00:01:10.799> I'm<00:01:10.890> thinking<00:01:11.189> maybe<00:01:11.340> I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
bit so I don't know I'm thinking maybe I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.580 
bit so I don't know I'm thinking maybe I
just<00:01:11.700> might<00:01:11.880> paint<00:01:12.149> the<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:13.229> intake<00:01:13.560> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
just might paint the the intake a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.030 
just might paint the the intake a
different<00:01:14.040> color<00:01:14.219> or<00:01:14.310> leave<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.759> that<00:01:14.790> color

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
holding off doing my gas tank just

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.199 
holding off doing my gas tank just
because<00:02:01.859> they<00:02:01.950> don't<00:02:02.099> have<00:02:02.250> much<00:02:02.429> of<00:02:02.459> that

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
because they don't have much of that

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.020 
because they don't have much of that
director<00:02:03.929> mental<00:02:04.170> primer<00:02:04.409> left<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.030> I'd

director mental primer left so I'd

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.639 
director mental primer left so I'd
rather<00:02:06.299> save<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.079> fenders<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
happened once I blocked them I got most

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.500 
happened once I blocked them I got most
of<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.959> stuff<00:02:15.989> hooked<00:02:16.379> up<00:02:16.680> permanently<00:02:17.670> this

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
of the stuff hooked up permanently this

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.119 
of the stuff hooked up permanently this
header<00:02:18.720> does<00:02:19.019> have<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.440> come<00:02:19.590> off<00:02:19.739> one<00:02:19.950> more

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129
