00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.200 
the job done I didn't root the phone by
the<00:01:46.710> way<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.460> case<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.790> don't<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:48.030> that's

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the way in case you don't know that's

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.060 
the way in case you don't know that's
like<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> equivalent<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:49.229> kind<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
like the equivalent of kind of the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.620 
like the equivalent of kind of the
equivalent<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.549> jailbreaking<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:51.450> not

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
equivalent of jailbreaking but not

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.350 
equivalent of jailbreaking but not
exactly<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:53.130> allows<00:01:53.430> me<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.880> things<00:01:54.090> like

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
exactly it allows me to do things like

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600 
exactly it allows me to do things like
throttled<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.990> CPU<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> phone<00:01:56.159> down<00:01:56.399> so

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
throttled of CPU on the phone down so

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.940 
throttled of CPU on the phone down so
that<00:01:56.640> i<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:56.820> save<00:01:57.119> battery<00:01:57.540> life<00:01:57.570> on

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
that i can save battery life on

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.109 
that i can save battery life on
different<00:01:58.950> intervals<00:01:59.070> i<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.729> program

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
different intervals i have this program

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.050 
different intervals i have this program
called<00:02:00.329> setcpu<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.200> does<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.700> also<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:03.030> a

was<00:02:36.680> my<00:02:36.830> favorite<00:02:37.190> feature<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.489> android<00:02:37.670> and

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
was my favorite feature of android and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.119 
was my favorite feature of android and
since<00:02:38.959> then<00:02:39.170> Apple<00:02:39.709> is<00:02:39.739> going<00:02:39.799> to<00:02:39.980> come<00:02:40.099> out

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
since then Apple is going to come out

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.309 
since then Apple is going to come out
with<00:02:40.400> their<00:02:40.580> equivalent<00:02:41.299> to<00:02:41.420> this<00:02:41.540> sort<00:02:42.230> of

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
with their equivalent to this sort of

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.070 
with their equivalent to this sort of
the<00:02:42.440> similar<00:02:42.849> types<00:02:43.849> of<00:02:44.030> features<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:45.019> i

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
the similar types of features and i

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.990 
the similar types of features and i
think<00:02:45.349> is<00:02:45.410> long<00:02:45.650> overdue<00:02:45.920> for<00:02:46.160> iOS<00:02:46.580> because

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
think is long overdue for iOS because

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.449 
think is long overdue for iOS because
android<00:02:47.540> has<00:02:47.660> really<00:02:47.959> had<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> hella<00:02:48.890> jump<00:02:49.280> on

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459

android has really had a hella jump on
these<00:02:49.579> features<00:02:50.239> for<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.420> long<00:02:50.599> time<00:02:50.840> um<00:02:52.000> there

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
these features for a long time um there

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000 
these features for a long time um there
are<00:02:53.269> some<00:02:53.630> things<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.049> I<00:02:54.290> wish<00:02:54.739> could<00:02:54.950> be

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
are some things that I wish could be

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.300 
are some things that I wish could be
better<00:02:55.690> there<00:02:56.690> I<00:02:57.049> did<00:02:57.620> talk<00:02:57.739> about<00:02:57.799> speed

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
better there I did talk about speed
