personal<00:04:22.830> it's<00:04:23.830> easy<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.490> capture<00:04:24.639> images

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
personal it's easy to capture images

using<00:04:25.450> a<00:04:25.660> telephoto<00:04:26.080> lens<00:04:26.200> and<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:27.040> did<00:04:27.250> of

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
using a telephoto lens and I did of

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.570 
using a telephoto lens and I did of
course<00:04:27.480> but<00:04:28.480> it<00:04:28.720> has<00:04:28.900> been<00:04:29.050> done<00:04:29.230> before<00:04:29.350> so<00:04:30.040> my
