00:00:01.714 --> 00:00:03.714
Hello.

00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:04.414
Hello.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.260
Why are we here in Yeouinaru?

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:09.574
   We are here to ride bikes.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.660
Yes. I really like riding a bike.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.315
Me, too. I really really like it.

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:15.880
 Then shall we go?

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.480
Let's go!

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.560
Where will we have to rent the bikes?

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.820
When I was here before, I think I rented them at Yeouido station...

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.540
Kyung-hwa is talking by herself.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.040
She's strange.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.342
I see that she's good at talking by herself.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.460
Seokjin is saying that I am weird because I am talking by myself.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.080
 I want to ride a bike that has a basket.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.780
 Why?

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.115
Because it's pretty.

00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:40.954
Not because you are going to put food in it?

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.195
I haven't brought food. Have you?

00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:45.930
I haven't brought food.  

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.620
But since there are a lot of convenience stores, we can buy beer, which Kyung-hwa likes.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.180
Come on now, you are setting me up.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.574
You can buy soju, squid...

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:54.074
No.

00:00:55.607 --> 00:00:57.607
I really like riding bikes.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.040
We are going to rent bikes with baskets. Yay!

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.300
Yes. We must bring this back to get my ID card back. Now they have my ID card.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.053
Okay. Let's go.

00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:18.774
Wow!

00:01:18.774 --> 00:01:19.541
Let's go.

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:20.041
Let's go.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.620
I'll follow.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.600
I'm riding a bike again after a really long time. I'm so happy!

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.080
Seokjin is going slowly.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.980
Yes. In order to go with Kyung-hwa.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.555
Very good.

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:40.340
I'm matching my speed to yours.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.174
Very considerate.

00:01:41.174 --> 00:01:42.915
Call me Mr. Jin Manners from now on.

00:01:43.454 --> 00:01:45.454
I'll watch you a little more (in the future).

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:49.215
Just as I thought, since there aren't many people, it's very convenient to ride bikes.

00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:51.168
It's really good. The weather is nice, too.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.718
For real though, it's been a really long time since I've been to the Han River, and especially since I've ridden a bike by the Han River.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:00.460
When did you say was the last time you rode a bike?

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.380
I guess maybe the last time I rode a bike by the Han River was when I was a university student.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.400
When you were a university student.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.940
Yes.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.380
Then about 20 years ago?

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.120
What?!

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.100
I used to ride a bike a lot in my neighborhood, both when I was little and after I grew up.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.100
In your neighborhood?

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.500
Yes, I would start riding my bike in the neighborhood and then go far.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:28.100
Usually among guys, we would bring chicken and beer to the Han River and eat it here.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.180
Girls are the same.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.420
They are the same?

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.660
There are some girls who bring pretty lunch boxes, 

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:36.954
and there some who bring simple foods, 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.100
but as we age, I think more and more friends of mine know how to pack their own lunch box, 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360
whereas when we were younger, we would always buy food.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.720
That's right. I assume many of them brought kimbap.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.600
No, unlike you expected, they didn't bring kimbap, 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.480
but sandwiches, or things like cheese, fruits like tomatoes, or something like that.

00:02:55.714 --> 00:02:56.960
Sounds like the lunch box would be pretty.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.420
Yes, that's right. Because girls also take a lot of pictures.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.093
Very nice.

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:06.633
I am so excited. Oh my gosh.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.300
 I need to buy a bike. 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.220
My previous one got too old, so I threw it away.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.400
When I was little, I was jealous of friends who could ride with both hands off the handle bars. 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.260
Like this? Oh no.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.960
I wanted to do it like them, and I could let go with one hand, but I could never do two hands. 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.320
You have to balance well. 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.640
Balance...oh, well, this is difficult. This bike seems difficult to balance.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.380
My friends who could ride a bike with two hands off would brag a lot to me.

00:03:40.934 --> 00:03:43.894
Back then, when I was little, (kids) used to brag about even the smallest things.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.700
Right now, Seokjin and Kyung-hwa went really far away while concentrating on talking. 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.320
I think they must be absorbed in talking without even noticing that I've escaped in the middle of the ride. 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.320
The scenery is here so good.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.600
The weather is not good today, but the scenery that I can see here is good, so I've stopped for a moment.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:05.800
Aren't you hungry?

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.700
Yes, how did you know? How did she know?

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.840
Everyone, I don't know what time it is when you are watching this now, but we are hungry.

00:04:13.154 --> 00:04:15.154
I guess it's about one o'clock now?

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:15.774
Now?

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.380
Yeah.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.920
It's two o'clock.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.920
It's two o'clock? Already?

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.960
It was 1:30 when we rented the bikes.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.920
That explains why we were hungry. We normally eat at one o'clock.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:37.280
That's right. The lunch time in the office at our company is usually from one o'clock but now it's past two, so we will go back to eat because we are hungry.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.684
That place is Bamseom Island.

00:04:42.684 --> 00:04:44.020
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:46.116
The one from the movie...

00:04:46.177 --> 00:04:52.157
It's the island in the movie "Castaway On the Moon", but in fact, there is no path to go there.

00:04:52.714 --> 00:04:53.514
You have to go there by boat.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.360
You can only go there by boat.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.642
Or you can jump from over there.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.440
In that movie, Mr. Kim jumped from there and ended up going to Bamseom Island.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.980
(Accoring to the map) that is Seogang Bridge and this is Mapo Bridge.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.740
Oh, I see.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.740
But Mapo Gu is actually over there.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.940
Exactly.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.480
Interesting.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.900
Mapo Bridge, and then?

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.400
Over there?

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.980
Over there? This side.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.980
Over there, next to Seogang Bridge is Yang-hwa Bridge.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.460
Yang-hwa.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.460
And then Seongsan.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.960
That's right.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.760
And next.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.380
After Seongsan is Gayang Bridge.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.380
Gayang. How about this side?

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.380
On this side, the one you see here now is Mapo Bridge.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.680
Mapo Bridge.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.860
The next one is Wonhyo Bridge.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.080
The next one is Hangang Bridge.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.080
The next one is Dongjak Bridge.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.820
Dongjak Bridge, and the next is Banpo Bridge.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.360
Yes, that's right.  

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.280
If you know that much, I guess you can say that you know almost all about the majority of bridges in Seoul.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.640
I would know better if I drove (that's right). 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.920
As for me, the bridge that I always pass when I go to work in the morning is Dongjak Bridge, 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.540
so I said before anything else that Dongjak Bridge is over here.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.240
Shall we go return the bikes?

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.160
Yes, let's go.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
We have returned.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
We are here.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
We have arrived.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.680
On our way to get his ID card back...

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.640
That's it?

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.380
Yes.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.080
Thank you.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.960
Yes, finished!

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.960
Goodbye bikes.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.280
Bike riding was fun today. 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.500
And everyone, we talked about a bunch of things today, and I hope that you heard some interesting stories.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.220
I didn't get to hear what they were talking about because I was riding separately, so I think I will have to watch the video to find out.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.820
It was so much fun, right, everybody?

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.820
As long as you didn't talk about me, it's fine for me.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.020
Did we...?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.360
We'll see you again in the next place.
