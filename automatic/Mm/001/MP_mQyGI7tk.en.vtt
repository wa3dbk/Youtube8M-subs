00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
in took about three weeks to come from I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.930 
in took about three weeks to come from I
believe<00:00:40.620> Malaysia<00:00:41.010> or<00:00:41.370> something<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
believe Malaysia or something like that

Philippines<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.190> mail<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.030> took<00:00:45.149> about

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
Philippines to the mail so it took about

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.430 
Philippines to the mail so it took about
three<00:00:45.690> weeks<00:00:45.770> it's<00:00:46.770> 12<00:00:47.550> bucks<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.050> nice

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
three weeks it's 12 bucks and as a nice

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.119 
three weeks it's 12 bucks and as a nice
little<00:00:49.739> features<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:51.090> consider<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.199> clock<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
little features I consider this clock to

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.799 
little features I consider this clock to
be<00:00:53.280> more<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.770> I<00:00:55.770> would<00:00:56.129> say<00:00:56.309> bedtime<00:00:56.940> bedside

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
be more of a I would say bedtime bedside

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.189 
be more of a I would say bedtime bedside
clock<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> reasons<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.570> is

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
clock and one of the reasons for that is

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.810 
clock and one of the reasons for that is
that<00:01:01.590> now<00:01:01.920> you're<00:01:02.219> seeing<00:01:03.439> well<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:05.040> time<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that now you're seeing well the time and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.380 
that now you're seeing well the time and
everything<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.710> unfortunately<00:01:07.729> I<00:01:08.729> must<00:01:09.210> say

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
everything but unfortunately I must say

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.289 
everything but unfortunately I must say
that<00:01:09.560> in<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.770> day<00:01:10.920> time<00:01:11.159> sitting<00:01:11.909> at<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> desk

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
that in the day time sitting at a desk

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.780 
that in the day time sitting at a desk
if<00:01:12.720> there's<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.799> lot<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.040> light<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.610> won't

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
if there's not a lot of light you won't

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.679 
if there's not a lot of light you won't
see<00:01:15.180> much<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.470> display<00:01:17.509> yeah

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
see much of the display yeah

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.570 
see much of the display yeah
there<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> light<00:01:19.259> though<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.100> find<00:01:20.340> close

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
there is a light though so we find close

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.660 
there is a light though so we find close
this<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.710> can<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.220> lights

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
this and I just can see that it lights

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
this and I just can see that it lights
up<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.390> pretty<00:01:24.600> cute<00:01:24.960> lights<00:01:25.710> up<00:01:25.890> for

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
up and that's pretty cute lights up for

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.350 
up and that's pretty cute lights up for
a<00:01:26.130> few<00:01:26.400> moments<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.689> unfortunately<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.619> a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
a few moments but unfortunately in a

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.730 
a few moments but unfortunately in a
dark<00:01:30.360> environment<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.560> it's

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
dark environment you can see that it's

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.840 
dark environment you can see that it's
kind<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.520> harder<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.960> clock<00:01:34.380> itself

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
kind of harder to see the clock itself

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.219 
kind of harder to see the clock itself
when<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.939> put<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> lot<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.570> light<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.020> though

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
when you put a lot of light on it though

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.700 
when you put a lot of light on it though
it's<00:01:37.500> not<00:01:38.070> too<00:01:38.310> bad<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.990> would<00:01:43.290> consider

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
it's not too bad so I I would consider

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.580 
it's not too bad so I I would consider
more<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.189> clock<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> bed<00:01:45.630> sign<00:01:46.049> like

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
more this clock for a bed sign like

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950 
more this clock for a bed sign like
clocks<00:01:47.310> when<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.119> wake<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.299> night

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
clocks when you wake up night

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.260 
clocks when you wake up night
want<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> see<00:01:49.799> what<00:01:49.920> time<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.399> well<00:01:50.610> you

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
want to see what time it is well you

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.999 
want to see what time it is well you
know<00:01:51.329> we'll<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.750> close<00:01:52.170> everything<00:01:52.350> here

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
know we'll just close everything here

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.389 
know we'll just close everything here
pretend<00:01:53.610> we're<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.909> night<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.130> there's

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
pretend we're it night and so there's

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.370 
pretend we're it night and so there's
nothing<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.000> then<00:01:57.180> you're<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:58.079> want<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.290> know

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
nothing and then you're you want to know

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.139 
nothing and then you're you want to know
what<00:01:58.560> time<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.159> click<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
what time it is you just click on it and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.780 
what time it is you just click on it and
there<00:02:01.079> you've<00:02:01.229> got<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.710> very<00:02:02.159> beautiful

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
there you've got that very beautiful

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.649 
there you've got that very beautiful
clock<00:02:03.240> showing<00:02:03.689> up<00:02:04.100> momentarily<00:02:05.659> another

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
clock showing up momentarily another

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.080 
clock showing up momentarily another
great<00:02:06.930> feature<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.920> clock<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.610> fact

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
great feature of this clock is the fact

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.660 
great feature of this clock is the fact
that<00:02:09.209> when<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:09.690> lighting<00:02:10.229> up<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:11.220> has<00:02:11.459> this

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
that when it's lighting up it has this

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.500 
that when it's lighting up it has this
little

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
little

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.809 
little
are<00:02:12.569> mere<00:02:12.840> as<00:02:13.049> you<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.349> see<00:02:13.650> right<00:02:13.950> there<00:02:14.010> this

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
are mere as you can see right there this

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.720 
are mere as you can see right there this
is<00:02:14.879> actually<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.569> projection<00:02:16.280> for<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.430> clock

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
is actually a projection for the clock

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.509 
is actually a projection for the clock
it<00:02:18.510> will<00:02:18.750> project<00:02:19.019> on<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.650> ceiling<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.970> clock

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
it will project on the ceiling the clock

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.720 
it will project on the ceiling the clock
and<00:02:23.519> I<00:02:23.760> will<00:02:23.970> try<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:25.040> show<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.099> what<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.489> looks

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
and I will try to show you what it looks

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.880 
and I will try to show you what it looks
like<00:02:26.909> on<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.209> ceiling<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:29.190> hope<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.329> works<00:02:30.890> and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
like on the ceiling I hope it works and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.780 
like on the ceiling I hope it works and
there<00:02:32.370> we<00:02:32.459> go

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
there we go

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.830 
there we go
this<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.150> what<00:02:33.299> it<00:02:33.360> looks<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.569> on<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
this is what it looks like on the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.440 
this is what it looks like on the
ceiling<00:02:34.230> as<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.739> can<00:02:35.040> see<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.489> very<00:02:35.670> very

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
ceiling as you can see it's very very

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.930 
ceiling as you can see it's very very
bright<00:02:36.780> that's<00:02:37.620> something<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.099> enjoy<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> lot<00:02:38.640> so

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
bright that's something I enjoy a lot so

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.240 
bright that's something I enjoy a lot so
when<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.299> press<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:39.959> little<00:02:40.230> button<00:02:40.379> not

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
when you press that little button not

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.030 
when you press that little button not
only<00:02:41.579> that<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:42.629> can<00:02:42.659> see<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.379> clock<00:02:43.650> on<00:02:43.980> your

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
only that you can see the clock on your

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.059 
only that you can see the clock on your
desk<00:02:44.579> but<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.569> light<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.530> ceiling<00:02:46.950> is

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
desk but the light on the ceiling is

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.250 
desk but the light on the ceiling is
pretty<00:02:47.340> good<00:02:47.519> also<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.629> it's<00:02:48.780> pretty<00:02:49.019> nice

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
pretty good also so it's pretty nice

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.160 
pretty good also so it's pretty nice
feature<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:52.849> basically<00:02:53.849> makes<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.299> $12

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
feature and basically makes this $12

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.089 
feature and basically makes this $12
clock<00:02:55.500> really<00:02:56.430> cool<00:02:56.879> little<00:02:57.060> device<00:02:57.799> but<00:02:58.799> like

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
clock really cool little device but like

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.819 
clock really cool little device but like
I<00:02:59.220> said<00:03:00.620> for<00:03:01.620> nighttime<00:03:02.250> or<00:03:02.760> bed<00:03:03.000> time<00:03:03.329> viewing

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
I said for nighttime or bed time viewing

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:10.839 
I said for nighttime or bed time viewing
mostly<00:03:04.829> I<00:03:04.859> would<00:03:05.069> say<00:03:05.400> because<00:03:09.049> daytime<00:03:10.049> is

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
mostly I would say because daytime is

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.509 
mostly I would say because daytime is
actually<00:03:12.409> even<00:03:13.409> a<00:03:13.530> little<00:03:13.680> horrible<00:03:14.280> oh<00:03:14.370> it's

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
actually even a little horrible oh it's

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.589 
actually even a little horrible oh it's
like<00:03:14.730> doesn't<00:03:15.389> look<00:03:15.569> nice<00:03:16.489> not<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:17.730> nice<00:03:18.030> as<00:03:18.060> it

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
like doesn't look nice not as nice as it

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.309 
like doesn't look nice not as nice as it
nighttime<00:03:20.090> other<00:03:21.090> little<00:03:21.449> features<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.049> will

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
nighttime other little features it will

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.360 
nighttime other little features it will
have<00:03:22.709> is<00:03:23.160> okay<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.840> clock

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
have is okay the clock

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.770 
have is okay the clock
the<00:03:26.370> little<00:03:27.319> arm<00:03:28.319> here<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.769> shows<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.780> time

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
the little arm here that shows the time

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.539 
the little arm here that shows the time
on<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.319> wall<00:03:31.620> or<00:03:31.919> your<00:03:32.099> ceiling<00:03:32.840> but<00:03:34.400> there's<00:03:35.400> a

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
on a wall or your ceiling but there's a

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.640 
on a wall or your ceiling but there's a
little<00:03:36.269> indicator<00:03:36.780> for<00:03:37.049> humidity<00:03:37.500> and

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
little indicator for humidity and

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.909 
little indicator for humidity and
temperature<00:03:38.579> so<00:03:38.849> it<00:03:38.940> says<00:03:39.209> here<00:03:39.510> for<00:03:39.569> example

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
temperature so it says here for example

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.150 
temperature so it says here for example
22.9<00:03:40.919> Celsius<00:03:41.430> indoors<00:03:42.169> here<00:03:43.169> says<00:03:43.620> hell<00:03:43.919> L

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
22.9 Celsius indoors here says hell L

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.869 
22.9 Celsius indoors here says hell L
because<00:03:44.669> the<00:03:45.560> humidity<00:03:46.560> humidity<00:03:46.980> sensor

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
because the humidity humidity sensor

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.020 
because the humidity humidity sensor
cannot<00:03:48.840> detect<00:03:49.199> below<00:03:49.560> 20<00:03:49.949> percent<00:03:49.980> or<00:03:50.579> above

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
cannot detect below 20 percent or above

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.020 
cannot detect below 20 percent or above
80<00:03:51.269> percent<00:03:52.280> it's<00:03:53.280> really<00:03:53.730> really<00:03:54.000> really<00:03:56.030> dry

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
80 percent it's really really really dry

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.629 
80 percent it's really really really dry
here<00:03:57.510> at<00:03:57.959> this<00:03:58.199> time<00:03:58.409> so<00:03:58.650> it's<00:03:59.129> probably<00:03:59.519> like

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
here at this time so it's probably like

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.619 
here at this time so it's probably like
a<00:03:59.790> little<00:04:00.150> below<00:04:00.540> 20%<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:02.579> makes<00:04:02.940> the

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
a little below 20% and that makes the

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.119 
a little below 20% and that makes the
display<00:04:04.109> just<00:04:04.949> put<00:04:05.159> ll<00:04:05.760> but<00:04:06.419> if<00:04:06.959> I<00:04:07.349> put<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:07.949> I

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
display just put ll but if I put it I

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.159 
display just put ll but if I put it I
put<00:04:08.159> it<00:04:08.459> outside<00:04:08.609> today<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.150> little<00:04:09.329> bit<00:04:09.479> and<00:04:09.780> he

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
put it outside today a little bit and he

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.860 
put it outside today a little bit and he
actually<00:04:10.349> displays<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.329> percentage<00:04:12.329> here<00:04:12.750> in

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
actually displays a percentage here in

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.740 
actually displays a percentage here in
the<00:04:12.989> humidity<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.680> does<00:04:13.859> work<00:04:13.889> and<00:04:14.750> there's

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
the humidity so it does work and there's

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.610 
the humidity so it does work and there's
what<00:04:16.349> looks<00:04:16.799> like<00:04:16.889> a<00:04:17.310> small<00:04:17.370> little<00:04:21.620> device

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
what looks like a small little device

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.340 
what looks like a small little device
here<00:04:23.099> that's<00:04:23.340> showing<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.120> kind<00:04:24.450> of<00:04:24.570> tend

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
here that's showing you kind of tend

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.730 
here that's showing you kind of tend
the<00:04:26.390> coming<00:04:27.390> whether<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:28.020> pressure<00:04:28.380> or

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
the coming whether the pressure or

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.500 
the coming whether the pressure or
whatever<00:04:29.300> this<00:04:30.300> shows<00:04:30.660> is<00:04:31.020> like<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:33.180> pressure

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
whatever this shows is like the pressure

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.720 
whatever this shows is like the pressure
and<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.260> differentiation<00:04:34.740> of<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.460> pressure

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
and the differentiation of the pressure

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.540 
and the differentiation of the pressure
it<00:04:36.030> may<00:04:36.210> be<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:37.470> there's<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:37.800> little<00:04:38.010> Sun<00:04:38.310> here

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
it may be and there's a little Sun here

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.760 
it may be and there's a little Sun here
that<00:04:38.700> says<00:04:38.880> well<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.570> should<00:04:39.870> be<00:04:40.050> sunny<00:04:40.410> so

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
that says well it should be sunny so

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.590 
that says well it should be sunny so
it's<00:04:40.920> kind<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.310> a<00:04:41.400> little<00:04:41.610> wetter<00:04:41.910> station<00:04:42.480> if

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
it's kind of a little wetter station if

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.050 
it's kind of a little wetter station if
you<00:04:42.720> want<00:04:42.930> at<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.170> same<00:04:43.380> time<00:04:43.620> of<00:04:44.100> course<00:04:44.490> it's

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
you want at the same time of course it's

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.600 
you want at the same time of course it's
very<00:04:45.120> very<00:04:45.660> approximate<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:47.100> think<00:04:47.490> you

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
very very approximate and I think you

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.400 
very very approximate and I think you
should<00:04:47.640> actually<00:04:48.300> use<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:48.780> for<00:04:49.200> real

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
should actually use that for real

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.830 
should actually use that for real
forecast<00:04:49.950> but<00:04:50.700> it's<00:04:50.880> a<00:04:50.970> cool<00:04:51.210> little<00:04:51.330> add-on

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
forecast but it's a cool little add-on

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.000 
forecast but it's a cool little add-on
here<00:04:52.170> and<00:04:52.350> it<00:04:52.470> does<00:04:52.800> had<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.370> little<00:04:55.010> animation

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
here and it does had a little animation

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.190 
here and it does had a little animation
on<00:04:56.430> your<00:04:56.790> display<00:04:58.460> so<00:04:59.600> it's<00:05:00.600> a<00:05:00.840> weather

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
on your display so it's a weather

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.730
