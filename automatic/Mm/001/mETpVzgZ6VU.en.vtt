00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
charm out from before because it's a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.410 
charm out from before because it's a
remake<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.059> old<00:00:42.180> charm<00:00:42.540> um<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:45.090> face<00:00:45.390> is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
adventure so it's not in place I think

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.590 
adventure so it's not in place I think
that's<00:01:42.420> because<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.340> dropped<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.549> before<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> was

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that's because I dropped it before I was

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.260 
that's because I dropped it before I was
going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.229> make<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> remake<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.909> I
