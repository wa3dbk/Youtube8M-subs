00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.170 

date<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:39.619> think<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> moment<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> knew<00:01:41.400> was<00:01:41.939> when

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
date I think the moment I knew was when

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.370 
date I think the moment I knew was when
I<00:01:42.210> was<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> date<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.259> the

bachelors<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.840> I<00:01:45.840> believe<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.649> were<00:01:46.740> sitting

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
bachelors and I believe we were sitting

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.190 
bachelors and I believe we were sitting
at<00:01:47.100> dinner<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.240> looked<00:01:48.450> at<00:01:48.540> my<00:01:48.659> date<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
at dinner and I looked at my date and I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.460 
at dinner and I looked at my date and I
looked<00:01:49.439> over<00:01:49.530> at<00:01:49.740> Larry<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.509> just<00:01:51.509> felt<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.079> I

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
looked over at Larry I just felt like I

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.850 
looked over at Larry I just felt like I
wanted<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.520> be<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> date<00:01:54.090> with<00:01:54.240> Larry

wanted to be on the date with Larry
instead<00:01:56.780> obviously<00:01:57.780> no<00:01:57.899> offense<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
instead obviously no offense to the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.859 
instead obviously no offense to the
bachelor<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.909> realized<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
bachelor but I just I realized for the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:01.660 
bachelor but I just I realized for the
first<00:02:00.930> time<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.530> I

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
first time that I
