00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.380
 Welcome to a new through 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.199
 josef video on connoisseur surprise tores 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.170
 and today it's about play doh and kneading 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.740
 I want to show you how we are doing with it 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.199
 such a small box-customizing can 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.859
 with some colorful Easter eggs in it 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.519
 and for that you need four different ones 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.239
 to dye 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.370
 I have women there but that would 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.350
 not enough for the project at the moment 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.370
 that's why I call myself orange 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.489
 Decided for the basket and then 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.039
 three eggs in the colors yes so 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.930
 impressive pink green and yellow 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.199
 You may also need one 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.180
 rheine around to a current knife like 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:01.020
 the whole works that I show 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:04.710
 Now you as the first magnets and make 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.049
 I'm not here for a quarter 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.049
 quarter of a third of it is about eight 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.280
 I'm going to pick that up a bit 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.100
 and push it once so I can 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.360
 so to speak, the underbody of mine 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.360
 Easter baskets have 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.690
 you make a little bit of a reason and 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.650
 putting it only once to the side 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:51.640
 so now he takes this and divides it into 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.150
 three pieces here too 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.150
 approximately 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.869
 and here you are doing nice long now 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.869
 out if you notice that it a bit 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:11.950
 too long or too thick then take 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:14.320
 a little bit awakened and a little bit children 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.350
 You do that three times with all three 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.780
 that they have a lot 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.640
 Remember that when you do 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.370
 bad that has me braided 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.050
 then the whole thing will come 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.600
 That's why they get a little smaller 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.070
 make a bit longer and how 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:37.420
 said three times the same length 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.440
 so it would have made nice places 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.630
 ye the times with their dealer 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.920
 You can push up areas up here 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.820
 that a little bit together 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.549
 diverge 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.970
 then you can touch the three 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.970
 knead 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:10.380
 that should not happen that 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:13.970
 but there is a kneading there is kneading 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.970
 you can attach all well that indeed 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:54.090
 so you need that again and now 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.090
 put your braided drum around 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:10.750
 and do what is too much and that 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:13.780
 other ends now you're pushing 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.140
 her upper knead the under 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.140
 contract 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.170
 who finished our baskets and 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.210
 Now we need the colorful color 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:35.910
 So the colorful other colorful kneading that is 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.910
 yes on bunch but our easter eggs and 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:43.060
 make us little eggs and set with it 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:46.660
 it was like that we take you 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.790
 bit kneads the meaning and then 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.790
 do you do you that my little at 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.140
 then you push that a little bit 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:08.050
 flat very little and then it makes 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:08.050
 a good as it goes 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:18.100
 and then you can put yours in that 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.100
 put in or place easter basket 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.610
 many big make Beck explained 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:52.380
 finished play easter basket so I wish 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.690
 you have a lot of fun copying and 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.360
 has indeed let me be better liked 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.100
 always down in the commentators with it 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.430
 or what you may still have in the future 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.600
 never want to see that on the canal 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.580
 Just comment and if it is you 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.040
