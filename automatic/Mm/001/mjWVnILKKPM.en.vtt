 the net 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.590
 eat a good meal of good wine 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.930
 and having good company the pleasure of some the work of others this is what 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.280
 that I'm not going to international gastronomic journalists did for ten 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.060
 days throughout chile the idea knows our country through their families 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 and position these products abroad 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.869
 understand spain japan korea 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.710
 China 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.689
 Canada 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.440
 know the block that does not recognize what our professionals soil 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.330
 person condemned with the difference between north and south that is tremendous 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.990
 the end the projects that we have along four thousand kilometers goes up 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.879
 the most affected but did not eat the pumitas empanadas and cakes sao paulo 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.049
 but they knew the story behind the curanto on the island of puluqui 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.619
 They delighted with the winding in a temuco market and tasted the quinoa 

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:58.019
 in the Andean village of Machuca a trip that concentrated the best of our 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.960
 earth one of chÃ¡vez is a hero the god is a discovery in a sense 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.800
 culinary 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.540
 so I really feel like it's covering chili through food and 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.880
 people who cooked 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.130
 I felt that the stories of the chefs and the chefs really 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.310
 reach 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.960
 journalists and critics from the markets although Chile has more 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.289
 commercial exchange 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.319
 they surrendered to the smells flavors textures and mixtures because it lies to the 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:23.030
 teacher 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.360
 briefly attention 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.880
 what certain products 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.420
 marine 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.640
 Saturday 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.900
 work as you work 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.140
 the traders how the seafood is worked how they work 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.240
 after the mysterious 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.020
 as they are 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.980
 or how are they 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.920
 I want to be that I do not remember what they are called from where those 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.900
 animals loaded 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.470
 this Japanese correspondent who was documented with the ambassador of chile in 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.299
 his country recommended him to pay attention 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.790
 four aspects 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.480
 women 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.050
 wine and work 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.400
 definitely 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.659
 I managed to understand it after spending ten days here 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.479
 the national chefs were also part of the first inspiration 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:16.149
 one of them explained the importance of creating these concepts 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.200
 an identity as a country a little what maybe but a little bit managed a bit with 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.879
 macho mind 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.099
 and you can not show the same trend is aimed at an entity 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.450
 own our 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.290
 For now, we have here to deal with this Catalan 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.000
 we asked him stories he would count on his return this they answered cd the style 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 It is one of the best kept secrets 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.059
 not only to create perhaps a concept of Chilean cuisine in 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.390
 mexico because representative we do not know 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.329
 It would be like a little informing people what it is about 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.329
 and know what local products are doing 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:59.389
 now they wait to be exported at the moment a job is comfortable 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.079
