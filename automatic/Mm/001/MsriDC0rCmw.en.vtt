00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
have concerns about women and frontline

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.270 
have concerns about women and frontline
combat<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.359> think<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:43.780> could<00:01:43.929> be<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.280> very

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
combat I think that could be a very

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.429 
combat I think that could be a very
compromising<00:01:45.729> situation<00:01:46.600> where<00:01:46.840> where

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
compromising situation where where

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.249 
compromising situation where where
people<00:01:48.039> naturally<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.600> know<00:01:49.689> may<00:01:49.840> do<00:01:49.899> things

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
people naturally you know may do things

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.779 
people naturally you know may do things
that<00:01:50.590> may<00:01:50.740> not<00:01:50.950> be<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.280> interest<00:01:51.579> of<00:01:51.670> the

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
that may not be in the interest of the

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.999 
that may not be in the interest of the
mission<00:01:52.119> because<00:01:53.049> of<00:01:53.229> other<00:01:53.530> types<00:01:53.859> of

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
mission because of other types of

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.800 
mission because of other types of
emotions<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.609> are<00:01:54.700> involved<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.210> I<00:01:55.450> think

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
emotions that are involved and I think

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.149 
emotions that are involved and I think
that's<00:01:55.960> probably<00:01:56.109> you<00:01:56.859> know<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.039> already

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
that's probably you know it already

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.679 
that's probably you know it already
happens<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.789> course<00:01:57.820> with<00:01:58.210> with<00:01:58.659> the

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
happens of course with with the

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.719 
happens of course with with the
camaraderie<00:01:58.929> of<00:01:59.079> men<00:01:59.799> in<00:01:59.950> combat<00:02:00.159> but<00:02:00.549> it's

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
camaraderie of men in combat but it's

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.969 
camaraderie of men in combat but it's
but<00:02:01.240> it's<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.749> think<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.170> would<00:02:02.259> be<00:02:02.289> even<00:02:02.469> more

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
but it's I think it would be even more

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.649 
but it's I think it would be even more
unique<00:02:03.340> if<00:02:03.549> when<00:02:03.909> we're<00:02:04.060> in<00:02:04.119> combat<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.630> I

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
unique if when we're in combat and I

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:05.669 
unique if when we're in combat and I
think<00:02:04.869> that's<00:02:05.020> probably<00:02:05.140> not<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:05.499> the<00:02:05.530> best

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
think that's probably not in the best

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.290 
think that's probably not in the best
interests<00:02:06.130> of<00:02:06.219> men<00:02:06.880> women<00:02:07.210> or<00:02:07.329> the<00:02:07.509> mission

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
interests of men women or the mission

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.700 
interests of men women or the mission
okay<00:02:10.300> right<00:02:10.569> if<00:02:10.810> women<00:02:11.200> go<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.500> front

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
okay right if women go to the front

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.350 
okay right if women go to the front
lines<00:02:11.890> all<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.550> sudden<00:02:12.790> there's<00:02:13.060> just<00:02:13.270> gonna

that's gonna be no good what he's afraid

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.180

about there you know I wonder what other

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.680
