00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.220 
of the leak we saw a couple of days ago
I've<00:00:05.549> now<00:00:05.910> got<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.120> name<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.359> go<00:00:06.540> on<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.049> one

I've now got a name to go on and one
that's<00:00:07.350> fairly<00:00:07.560> legitimate<00:00:08.130> so<00:00:08.250> long<00:00:08.429> as<00:00:08.580> this

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
that's fairly legitimate so long as this

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.850 
that's fairly legitimate so long as this
leak<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.240> course<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.630> real<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.380> not<00:00:10.500> made<00:00:10.710> up

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860

but<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.519> know<00:00:11.610> very<00:00:11.790> unlikely<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.389> has

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
but you know very unlikely that it has

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.060 
but you know very unlikely that it has
been<00:00:12.719> but<00:00:13.170> basically<00:00:13.349> if<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.740> haven't<00:00:13.920> heard

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.520 
as well as why this leaked a couple of
days<00:01:12.240> ago<00:01:12.360> actually<00:01:12.600> happen<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.350> very

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
days ago actually happen it's very

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.960 
days ago actually happen it's very
interesting<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.130> stick<00:01:14.430> around<00:01:14.460> right<00:01:14.850> till

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
interesting so stick around right till

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.090 
interesting so stick around right till
the<00:01:15.090> end<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.810> first<00:01:16.080> things<00:01:16.290> first<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.009> we

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the end so first things first what do we

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.620 
the end so first things first what do we
get<00:01:17.250> from<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.580> leaked<00:01:17.850> information<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.570> we

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
get from this leaked information that we

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.060 
get from this leaked information that we
saw<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.080> couple<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.380> days<00:01:19.530> ago<00:01:19.560> well<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
saw just a couple of days ago well the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.890 
saw just a couple of days ago well the
title<00:01:20.490> called<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.880> goes<00:01:21.119> pretty<00:01:21.360> obvious<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
title called it goes pretty obvious the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
title called it goes pretty obvious the
reveal<00:01:22.439> date<00:01:22.680> fifth<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.040> november<00:01:23.549> pretty

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
reveal date fifth of november pretty

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.880 
reveal date fifth of november pretty
obvious<00:01:24.060> again<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.600> infinity<00:01:25.320> ward<00:01:25.500> are<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
obvious again and infinity ward are the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.320 
obvious again and infinity ward are the
developers<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:26.610> there's<00:01:26.820> some<00:01:26.939> other<00:01:27.030> things

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
developers but there's some other things

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.999 
developers but there's some other things
that<00:01:27.450> give<00:01:27.720> us<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:28.140> bit<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.470> hint<00:01:28.710> into

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that give us a little bit of a hint into

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.160 
that give us a little bit of a hint into
what<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> game<00:01:29.369> could<00:01:29.610> include<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:31.049> takes

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
what the game could include and it takes

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.210 
what the game could include and it takes
a<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.320> bit<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.500> working<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
a little bit of working out but the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.249 
a little bit of working out but the
image<00:01:32.400> itself<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> name<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> game<00:01:33.810> so

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
image itself and the name of the game so

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.660 
image itself and the name of the game so
the<00:01:34.380> name<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> game<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.009> call<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.369> duty

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the name of the game is call of duty

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.810 
the name of the game is call of duty
ghosts<00:01:36.240> hint<00:01:36.570> there<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.560> ghosts<00:01:38.159> not<00:01:38.460> ghosts

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
ghosts hint there it's ghosts not ghosts

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.390 
ghosts hint there it's ghosts not ghosts
so<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.900> probably<00:01:40.380> not<00:01:40.530> centered<00:01:41.100> around<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
so it's probably not centered around the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.420 
so it's probably not centered around the
character<00:01:41.850> ghosts<00:01:42.470> entirely<00:01:43.470> or<00:01:43.590> solely<00:01:43.979> but

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
character ghosts entirely or solely but

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.830 
character ghosts entirely or solely but
if<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.610> look<00:01:44.729> towards<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.149> image<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.570> looks

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
if you look towards the image it looks

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.050 
if you look towards the image it looks
like<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.320> either<00:01:46.530> ghost<00:01:46.890> pulling<00:01:47.280> his<00:01:47.369> mask

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
like it's either ghost pulling his mask

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.420 
like it's either ghost pulling his mask
up<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.479> down<00:01:48.689> or<00:01:48.869> somebody<00:01:49.770> because<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.280> course

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
up or down or somebody because of course

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.160 
up or down or somebody because of course
we've<00:01:50.549> never<00:01:50.700> seen<00:01:50.909> ghosts<00:01:51.270> face<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.750> somebody

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
we've never seen ghosts face so somebody

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.050 
we've never seen ghosts face so somebody
pulling<00:01:52.380> ghost<00:01:52.649> mask<00:01:52.920> or<00:01:53.189> poured<00:01:53.490> down<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
pulling ghost mask or poured down and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.370 
pulling ghost mask or poured down and
taking<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> hint<00:01:54.600> from<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.810> title<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.290> is

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
taking the hint from the title that is

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.899 
taking the hint from the title that is
not<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.740> solely<00:01:56.130> centered<00:01:56.670> around

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
not going to be solely centered around

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.819 
not going to be solely centered around
go<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.570> CAC<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.960> there<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.320> guess<00:01:58.590> two

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
go to the CAC to there I guess two

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.350 
go to the CAC to there I guess two
different<00:01:59.189> routes<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.969> storyline

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
different routes that the storyline

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.209 
different routes that the storyline
could<00:02:00.659> go<00:02:00.869> down<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> first<00:02:01.860> one<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.100> that

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
could go down so the first one is that

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.800 
could go down so the first one is that
it<00:02:02.430> could<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> prequel<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.390> modern<00:02:03.659> warfare

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
it could be a prequel to modern warfare

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
it could be a prequel to modern warfare
2<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> game<00:02:04.590> set<00:02:04.890> before<00:02:05.250> modern<00:02:05.520> warfare<00:02:05.670> 2

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
2 so a game set before modern warfare 2

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.240 
2 so a game set before modern warfare 2
we're<00:02:06.810> ghosts<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.439> course<00:02:07.619> still<00:02:07.950> alive

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
we're ghosts is of course still alive

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.740 
we're ghosts is of course still alive
and<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.670> could<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.849> telling<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> story<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.569> how

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
and it could be telling the story of how

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.320 
and it could be telling the story of how
ghosts<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.319> his<00:02:10.410> squad<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.979> should<00:02:11.700> get<00:02:11.849> into

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
ghosts and his squad I should get into

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.250 
ghosts and his squad I should get into
like<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.720> story

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
like the story

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.929 
like the story
modern<00:02:13.920> warfare<00:02:14.010> 2<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.549> what<00:02:14.670> happens

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
modern warfare 2 like what happens

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.789 
modern warfare 2 like what happens
before<00:02:15.150> modern<00:02:15.659> warfare<00:02:15.810> two<00:02:16.140> for<00:02:16.319> them<00:02:16.709> to

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
before modern warfare two for them to

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.319 
before modern warfare two for them to
get<00:02:16.920> into<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.189> situations<00:02:17.819> that<00:02:17.939> they're<00:02:18.209> in

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
get into the situations that they're in

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.330 
get into the situations that they're in
in<00:02:18.510> modern<00:02:18.840> warfare<00:02:19.019> 2<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.439> how<00:02:19.560> him<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.069> his

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
in modern warfare 2 and how him and his

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.520 
in modern warfare 2 and how him and his
squad<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:20.939> maybe<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.420> squad's<00:02:21.720> called<00:02:21.989> ghosts

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
squad so maybe the squad's called ghosts

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.710 
squad so maybe the squad's called ghosts
again<00:02:23.310> linking<00:02:23.640> him<00:02:23.730> with<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.879> title<00:02:24.150> something

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
again linking him with a title something

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.059 
again linking him with a title something
like<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.049> some<00:02:25.200> kind<00:02:25.379> of<00:02:25.409> backstory<00:02:25.950> to

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
like that some kind of backstory to

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.880 
like that some kind of backstory to
modern<00:02:26.459> warfare<00:02:26.610> 2<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.209> his<00:02:28.049> squad<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.799> other

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
modern warfare 2 and his squad the other

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.530 
modern warfare 2 and his squad the other
possibility<00:02:29.099> is<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:29.940> actually<00:02:30.150> set

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
possibility is that it's actually set

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.869 
possibility is that it's actually set
after<00:02:30.780> modern<00:02:31.200> warfare<00:02:31.349> 3<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.040> kind<00:02:32.849> of

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
after modern warfare 3 and kind of

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.759 
after modern warfare 3 and kind of
branching<00:02:33.269> off<00:02:33.360> into<00:02:33.569> its<00:02:33.810> own<00:02:33.930> series<00:02:34.590> of

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
branching off into its own series of

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.619 
branching off into its own series of
course<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.579> presuming<00:02:35.909> that<00:02:35.970> ghost<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.420> dead

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
course and presuming that ghost is dead

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
for some kind of upper power that they

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.509 
for some kind of upper power that they
gain<00:03:00.959> from<00:03:01.170> his<00:03:01.230> death<00:03:01.590> or<00:03:01.859> from<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.190> war<00:03:02.370> that

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
gain from his death or from the war that

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.580 
gain from his death or from the war that
they<00:03:02.639> were<00:03:02.909> in<00:03:03.060> something<00:03:03.810> like<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.500> I

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
they were in something like that and I

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.839 
they were in something like that and I
guess<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.769> third<00:03:05.099> possible<00:03:05.489> way<00:03:05.609> that<00:03:05.639> I've

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
guess a third possible way that I've

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.220 
guess a third possible way that I've
just<00:03:05.879> really<00:03:06.299> thought<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.569> is<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.989> ghost

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
just really thought of is that ghost

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.780 
just really thought of is that ghost
isn't<00:03:07.500> dead<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:07.950> he's<00:03:08.040> coming<00:03:08.310> back<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.700> this

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
isn't dead and he's coming back in this

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.490 
isn't dead and he's coming back in this
game<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.329> is<00:03:09.629> him<00:03:09.900> actually<00:03:10.170> wearing

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
game and that is him actually wearing

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.470 
game and that is him actually wearing
his<00:03:10.680> mask<00:03:10.709> on<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.220> front<00:03:11.459> cover<00:03:11.519> that's<00:03:12.420> a

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
his mask on the front cover that's a

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.210 
his mask on the front cover that's a
possibility<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.989> course<00:03:13.109> boy<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.650> may<00:03:13.980> be<00:03:14.040> that

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
possibility of course boy it may be that

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.460 
possibility of course boy it may be that
him<00:03:14.639> and<00:03:14.730> his<00:03:14.790> squad<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.389> secret<00:03:15.870> some<00:03:16.170> revenge

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
him and his squad a secret some revenge

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.110 
him and his squad a secret some revenge
for<00:03:16.799> events<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.430> happened<00:03:17.489> in<00:03:17.819> modern

for events that have happened in modern
warfare<00:03:18.269> 2<00:03:18.569> you<00:03:18.959> never<00:03:19.199> really<00:03:19.440> know<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.709> I

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
warfare 2 you never really know and I

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:20.930 
warfare 2 you never really know and I
guess<00:03:19.889> we're<00:03:20.069> not<00:03:20.160> going<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.430> find<00:03:20.579> out<00:03:20.790> until

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
guess we're not going to find out until

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.220 
guess we're not going to find out until
we<00:03:21.150> see<00:03:21.389> some<00:03:21.419> kind<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.810> game<00:03:22.019> player

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
we see some kind of game player

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.689 
we see some kind of game player
something<00:03:22.620> however<00:03:22.949> in<00:03:23.129> The<00:03:23.190> Drifter<00:03:23.549> leaked

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
something however in The Drifter leaked

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:24.949 
something however in The Drifter leaked
a<00:03:23.790> few<00:03:23.970> months<00:03:24.150> ago<00:03:24.389> he<00:03:24.599> said<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
a few months ago he said that the

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.300 
a few months ago he said that the
campaign<00:03:25.440> was<00:03:25.590> going<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.769> be<00:03:25.829> set<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.160> the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
campaign was going to be set in the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.979 
campaign was going to be set in the
future<00:03:26.579> using<00:03:27.030> current<00:03:27.449> generation

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
future using current generation

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
going to be some kind of plot twist

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.119 
going to be some kind of plot twist
meaning<00:03:31.199> you<00:03:31.290> couldn't<00:03:31.590> use<00:03:31.709> future

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
meaning you couldn't use future

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.770 
meaning you couldn't use future
generation<00:03:32.639> tech<00:03:32.879> guide<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.239> use<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.480> current

generation tech guide to use the current
one<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.109> this<00:03:34.260> will<00:03:34.440> kind<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.709> link<00:03:34.859> in<00:03:35.010> with<00:03:35.040> a

one and this will kind of link in with a
thinking<00:03:35.609> that<00:03:35.819> it's<00:03:35.970> gonna<00:03:36.090> be<00:03:36.239> set<00:03:36.449> after

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
thinking that it's gonna be set after

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.539 
thinking that it's gonna be set after
modern<00:03:37.049> warfare<00:03:37.230> 3<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.069> maybe<00:03:38.280> add<00:03:38.519> some

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
modern warfare 3 and it maybe add some

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.580 
modern warfare 3 and it maybe add some
nostalgia<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.449> a<00:03:39.480> new<00:03:39.720> team<00:03:39.959> trying<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.349> seek

nostalgia to a new team trying to seek
revenge<00:03:40.919> on<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.310> ghost<00:03:41.609> death<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.299> ghost

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
kill them with the same kind of weaponry

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.210 
kill them with the same kind of weaponry
that<00:03:45.870> they<00:03:46.139> would<00:03:46.290> have<00:03:46.410> killed<00:03:46.620> ghost<00:03:46.919> with

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
that they would have killed ghost with

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.740 
that they would have killed ghost with
but<00:03:47.669> anyway<00:03:48.000> they're<00:03:48.180> just<00:03:48.389> some<00:03:48.540> thoughts

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
but anyway they're just some thoughts

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.330 
but anyway they're just some thoughts
but<00:03:49.019> I've<00:03:49.139> got<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.260> pretty<00:03:49.470> good<00:03:49.650> idea<00:03:49.709> on<00:03:50.129> when

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
but I've got a pretty good idea on when

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.890 
but I've got a pretty good idea on when
this<00:03:50.489> game<00:03:50.699> could<00:03:50.910> be<00:03:51.060> revealed<00:03:51.419> now<00:03:51.840> the

and then at the end of the week they

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.740

were going to release the first trailer

were going to release the first trailer
on<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.079> first<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.620> may<00:04:01.859> which<00:04:02.250> links<00:04:02.549> into<00:04:02.760> the

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
on the first of may which links into the

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.339 
on the first of may which links into the
drifter<00:04:03.269> theory<00:04:03.659> where<00:04:03.930> he<00:04:04.019> said<00:04:04.199> that<00:04:04.319> the

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
drifter theory where he said that the

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.960 
drifter theory where he said that the
first<00:04:04.530> trailer<00:04:04.859> would<00:04:05.099> be<00:04:05.220> on<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.549> first<00:04:05.819> of

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
first trailer would be on the first of

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.580 
first trailer would be on the first of
may<00:04:06.269> however<00:04:06.510> they've<00:04:06.840> changed<00:04:07.169> this<00:04:07.409> of

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
may however they've changed this of

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.170 
may however they've changed this of
course<00:04:07.620> because<00:04:08.010> teaser<00:04:08.430> campaign<00:04:08.730> hasn't

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
course because teaser campaign hasn't

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.089 
course because teaser campaign hasn't
started<00:04:09.569> yet<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:10.349> they're<00:04:10.530> going<00:04:10.620> for<00:04:10.829> a<00:04:10.859> later

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
started yet so they're going for a later

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.770 
started yet so they're going for a later
date<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.400> this<00:04:11.639> is<00:04:11.760> possibly<00:04:12.120> because<00:04:12.449> of<00:04:12.629> the

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
date and this is possibly because of the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.599 
date and this is possibly because of the
xbox<00:04:13.019> 720<00:04:13.500> announcement<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.280> was<00:04:14.370> on<00:04:14.489> the

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
xbox 720 announcement that was on the

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.670 
xbox 720 announcement that was on the
same<00:04:14.849> date<00:04:15.090> of<00:04:15.239> when<00:04:15.720> this<00:04:15.840> leak<00:04:16.049> happened<00:04:16.289> and

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
same date of when this leak happened and

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.259 
same date of when this leak happened and
there<00:04:16.979> might<00:04:17.099> be<00:04:17.130> some<00:04:17.400> thinking<00:04:17.789> behind<00:04:18.030> it

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
there might be some thinking behind it

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.449 
there might be some thinking behind it
that<00:04:18.329> the<00:04:18.659> xbox<00:04:19.079> 720<00:04:19.440> event<00:04:19.859> will<00:04:20.010> be<00:04:20.159> a<00:04:20.190> good

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
that the xbox 720 event will be a good

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.060 
that the xbox 720 event will be a good
chance<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:21.150> launch<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.750> reveal<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.830> next

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
chance to launch and reveal the next

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.500 
chance to launch and reveal the next

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
call of duty game so that is why I'm

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.459
