the water softener pillows that didn't

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.310 
the water softener pillows that didn't
work<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.550> tried<00:02:38.450> driftwood<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.480> didn't<00:02:40.110> work

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
work I tried driftwood that didn't work

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
water soft where I don't have to

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.860 
water soft where I don't have to
actually<00:02:49.980> go<00:02:50.310> out<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.460> buy<00:02:50.670> an<00:02:50.730> RO<00:02:51.060> di<00:02:51.360> unit

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
actually go out and buy an RO di unit

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.960 
actually go out and buy an RO di unit
and<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.680> know<00:02:52.800> what<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.280> had<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.730> go<00:02:53.760> out<00:02:53.940> and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
and you know what I had to go out and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.700 
and you know what I had to go out and
buy<00:02:54.210> an<00:02:54.360> RO<00:02:54.540> di<00:02:54.840> unit<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:59.150> with<00:03:00.150> once<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.350> went

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
buy an RO di unit so with once I went

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.320 
buy an RO di unit so with once I went
ahead<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.040> made<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.370> initial<00:03:02.790> purchase<00:03:02.970> it

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
ahead and made the initial purchase it

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.250 
ahead and made the initial purchase it
made<00:03:03.540> keeping<00:03:04.580> soft<00:03:05.580> water<00:03:05.970> aquaria<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.630> lot

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
made keeping soft water aquaria a lot

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.280 
made keeping soft water aquaria a lot
easier<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.300> you<00:03:09.300> know<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.570> really<00:03:09.930> didn't<00:03:10.170> have

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
easier and you know I really didn't have

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.020 
easier and you know I really didn't have
any<00:03:10.530> problems<00:03:11.100> with<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.670> know<00:03:11.790> you're

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
any problems with it you know you're

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.710 
any problems with it you know you're
you're<00:03:12.360> just<00:03:12.390> gonna<00:03:12.750> get<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> base<00:03:13.650> water<00:03:14.100> and

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
you're just gonna get a base water and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.750 
you're just gonna get a base water and
of<00:03:15.720> course<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.890> know<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:17.370> can<00:03:17.400> look<00:03:17.610> at

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
of course it you know you can look at

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.660 
of course it you know you can look at
the<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.600> alkaline<00:03:19.080> buffer<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.709> my<00:03:20.340> small

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
the the alkaline buffer is my small

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.310 
the the alkaline buffer is my small
bottle<00:03:21.000> because<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.510> just<00:03:21.780> don't<00:03:21.930> need<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.140> lot

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
bottle because I just don't need a lot

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.750 
bottle because I just don't need a lot
of<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:22.739> don't<00:03:22.800> use<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.130> lot<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.580> so

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
of it and I don't use a lot of it so

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.310 
of it and I don't use a lot of it so
this<00:03:23.940> right<00:03:24.120> here<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:25.080> know<00:03:25.170> will

put I put you know one scoop to every

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.560 
put I put you know one scoop to every
two<00:03:33.510> scoops<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.230> use<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.450> know

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
two scoops that I use of the you know

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.540 
two scoops that I use of the you know

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
regulator are meant for non planet tanks

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.259 
regulator are meant for non planet tanks
because<00:03:55.920> their<00:03:56.100> phosphate<00:03:56.580> base<00:03:56.790> they<00:03:57.000> really

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
because their phosphate base they really

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.210 
because their phosphate base they really
have<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.600> same<00:03:57.840> thing<00:03:58.140> in<00:03:58.320> them<00:03:58.470> except<00:03:58.890> for

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
have the same thing in them except for

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.509 
have the same thing in them except for

them except for you know neither one was
gonna<00:04:23.730> is<00:04:24.730> is<00:04:25.060> is<00:04:25.300> you<00:04:25.930> know<00:04:26.050> better<00:04:26.350> or<00:04:26.470> worse

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
gonna is is is you know better or worse

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.409 
gonna is is is you know better or worse
for<00:04:27.010> your<00:04:27.100> discus<00:04:27.520> it's<00:04:27.730> just<00:04:27.940> about<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.389> know

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
for your discus it's just about you know

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.390 
for your discus it's just about you know
what's<00:04:28.720> better<00:04:28.900> or<00:04:29.110> worse<00:04:29.260> for<00:04:29.290> a<00:04:29.740> planet<00:04:30.190> tank

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
what's better or worse for a planet tank

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.250 
what's better or worse for a planet tank
basically<00:04:30.639> so<00:04:32.040> when<00:04:33.040> you're<00:04:33.669> using<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.480> buffer

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
basically so when you're using a buffer

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.310 
basically so when you're using a buffer
you<00:04:35.950> know<00:04:36.070> you<00:04:36.130> just<00:04:36.730> if<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:37.480> have<00:04:37.750> an<00:04:37.870> RO<00:04:38.050> di

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
you know you just if you have an RO di

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.129 
you know you just if you have an RO di
unit<00:04:38.770> then<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.070> can<00:04:39.250> just<00:04:39.430> add<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:40.690> buffer

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
unit then you can just add the buffer

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.270 
unit then you can just add the buffer
and<00:04:41.520> let<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.730> sit<00:04:43.120> for<00:04:43.389> 24<00:04:43.990> hours<00:04:44.680> and<00:04:44.950> then<00:04:45.070> you

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
and let it sit for 24 hours and then you

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.700 
and let it sit for 24 hours and then you
know<00:04:45.400> you<00:04:45.460> can<00:04:45.790> you<00:04:46.090> can<00:04:46.120> measure<00:04:46.840> your<00:04:47.139> pH<00:04:47.500> and

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
know you can you can measure your pH and

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.159 
know you can you can measure your pH and
you<00:04:47.770> can<00:04:47.950> see<00:04:48.160> you<00:04:48.940> know<00:04:49.090> where<00:04:49.300> it's<00:04:49.480> at<00:04:49.660> and

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
you can see you know where it's at and

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.960 
you can see you know where it's at and
then<00:04:50.980> also<00:04:52.110> you<00:04:53.110> know<00:04:53.229> this<00:04:53.590> freshwater<00:04:54.340> trace

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
then also you know this freshwater trace

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.390 
then also you know this freshwater trace
right<00:04:55.210> here<00:04:55.450> fresh<00:04:56.139> trace<00:04:56.500> or<00:04:56.740> discus<00:04:57.130> trace

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
right here fresh trace or discus trace

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.610 
right here fresh trace or discus trace
they<00:04:57.760> both<00:04:58.000> have<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.360> exact<00:04:58.660> same<00:04:58.690> same<00:04:59.380> thing

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
they both have the exact same same thing

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.580 
they both have the exact same same thing
in<00:04:59.740> them<00:04:59.860> again<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.850> the<00:05:01.720> discus<00:05:02.110> trace<00:05:02.380> is

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
in them again the the discus trace is

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.820 
in them again the the discus trace is
meant<00:05:02.830> for<00:05:02.919> a<00:05:03.160> non<00:05:03.729> planted<00:05:04.210> tank<00:05:04.530> fresh<00:05:05.530> trace

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
meant for a non planted tank fresh trace

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.680 
meant for a non planted tank fresh trace
is<00:05:06.040> meant<00:05:06.250> for<00:05:06.340> planted<00:05:06.880> one<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.210> phosphate

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
is meant for planted one is phosphate

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.330 
is meant for planted one is phosphate
based<00:05:07.930> one<00:05:08.200> does<00:05:08.350> not<00:05:08.500> but<00:05:08.710> they<00:05:08.830> both<00:05:09.040> have

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
based one does not but they both have

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.100 
based one does not but they both have
the<00:05:09.700> same<00:05:09.729> exact<00:05:10.300> thing<00:05:10.510> in<00:05:10.630> him<00:05:10.720> you<00:05:10.840> can<00:05:10.990> go

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
the same exact thing in him you can go

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.440 
the same exact thing in him you can go
on<00:05:11.260> see<00:05:11.950> Kim's<00:05:12.190> website<00:05:12.700> and<00:05:12.880> you<00:05:12.940> can<00:05:13.090> look<00:05:13.240> at

on see Kim's website and you can look at

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.640 
on see Kim's website and you can look at
it<00:05:13.570> and<00:05:13.630> they'll<00:05:13.780> say<00:05:13.810> if<00:05:13.990> you<00:05:14.169> have<00:05:14.320> a<00:05:14.350> planet

it and they'll say if you have a planet

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.100 
it and they'll say if you have a planet
tanked<00:05:15.040> and<00:05:15.190> use<00:05:15.370> fresh<00:05:16.150> trace<00:05:16.479> if<00:05:16.720> you<00:05:16.870> have<00:05:17.080> a

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
tanked and use fresh trace if you have a

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.510 
tanked and use fresh trace if you have a
non<00:05:17.470> planted<00:05:17.919> tank<00:05:18.130> then<00:05:18.340> use<00:05:19.590> use<00:05:20.590> a<00:05:20.620> used

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
non planted tank then use use a used

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
don't take the buffers the acid buffers

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.960 
don't take the buffers the acid buffers
and<00:05:32.380> try<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:32.740> add<00:05:32.950> them<00:05:33.220> directly<00:05:33.400> to<00:05:33.729> your

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
and try to add them directly to your

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.450 
and try to add them directly to your
tank<00:05:34.240> if<00:05:34.479> you<00:05:34.539> do<00:05:34.960> that<00:05:35.289> you<00:05:35.770> can<00:05:35.919> actually

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
tank if you do that you can actually

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.110 
tank if you do that you can actually
burn<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:37.030> discus<00:05:37.510> gills<00:05:38.340> so<00:05:39.340> if<00:05:39.669> you<00:05:39.820> see<00:05:40.000> them

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
burn the discus gills so if you see them

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.909 
burn the discus gills so if you see them
breathing<00:05:40.390> out<00:05:40.600> of<00:05:40.750> one<00:05:40.930> Gill<00:05:41.200> or<00:05:41.500> if<00:05:41.590> you<00:05:41.710> see

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
breathing out of one Gill or if you see

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.620 
breathing out of one Gill or if you see
them<00:05:42.039> kind<00:05:42.220> of<00:05:42.400> getting<00:05:42.640> irritated<00:05:43.330> skin

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
them kind of getting irritated skin

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.630 
them kind of getting irritated skin
irritated<00:05:44.350> and<00:05:44.410> they're<00:05:44.530> rubbing<00:05:44.919> and<00:05:45.130> you

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
irritated and they're rubbing and you

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.610 
irritated and they're rubbing and you
know<00:05:45.760> they<00:05:45.910> don't<00:05:46.090> really<00:05:46.419> look<00:05:46.600> happy<00:05:47.050> you

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
know they don't really look happy you

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.590 
know they don't really look happy you
know<00:05:47.740> then<00:05:48.039> that's<00:05:48.550> because<00:05:49.060> you<00:05:49.419> can

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
know then that's because you can

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.070 
know then that's because you can
actually<00:05:49.810> harm<00:05:50.620> their<00:05:50.860> gills<00:05:51.100> so<00:05:51.780> that's<00:05:52.780> a

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
actually harm their gills so that's a

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.500 
actually harm their gills so that's a
word<00:05:53.919> of<00:05:54.160> a<00:05:54.400> word<00:05:54.669> of<00:05:54.850> caution<00:05:55.060> when<00:05:55.479> using

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
word of a word of caution when using

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.550 
word of a word of caution when using
that<00:05:55.990> use<00:05:56.620> it<00:05:57.030> inside<00:05:58.030> of<00:05:58.060> you<00:05:58.930> know<00:05:59.050> your<00:05:59.320> your

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
that use it inside of you know your your

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.500 
that use it inside of you know your your
barrel<00:06:00.039> or<00:06:00.220> your<00:06:00.370> buckets<00:06:00.820> or<00:06:01.000> whatever<00:06:01.330> and

barrel or your buckets or whatever and

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.510 
barrel or your buckets or whatever and
then<00:06:01.630> measure<00:06:01.840> it<00:06:02.080> and<00:06:02.229> then<00:06:02.440> the<00:06:03.010> great<00:06:03.250> thing

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
then measure it and then the great thing

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.210 
then measure it and then the great thing
about<00:06:03.610> it<00:06:04.030> is<00:06:04.270> that<00:06:04.770> once<00:06:05.770> you've<00:06:05.979> actually

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
about it is that once you've actually

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.940 
about it is that once you've actually
done<00:06:06.600> your<00:06:07.600> measuring<00:06:08.020> one<00:06:08.229> time<00:06:08.440> you<00:06:08.740> you

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
done your measuring one time you you

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.650 
done your measuring one time you you
don't<00:06:09.130> ever<00:06:09.280> have<00:06:09.520> to<00:06:09.700> really<00:06:09.970> question<00:06:10.150> what

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
don't ever have to really question what

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.779 
don't ever have to really question what
you<00:06:10.870> know<00:06:10.990> what<00:06:11.710> amounts<00:06:12.130> to<00:06:12.190> use<00:06:12.460> because

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
you know what amounts to use because

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.100 
you know what amounts to use because
you're<00:06:12.970> pretty<00:06:13.120> much<00:06:13.389> always<00:06:13.630> going<00:06:13.900> to<00:06:13.960> know

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
you're pretty much always going to know

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.430 
you're pretty much always going to know
it<00:06:14.289> if<00:06:14.710> you're<00:06:14.979> using<00:06:15.190> tap<00:06:15.610> water<00:06:16.000> and<00:06:16.330> and<00:06:17.020> you

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
it if you're using tap water and and you
