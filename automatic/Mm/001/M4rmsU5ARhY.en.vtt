00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
to cut both of your wires at the same

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.300 
to cut both of your wires at the same
time<00:01:16.630> though<00:01:16.869> so<00:01:17.500> that<00:01:17.649> your<00:01:17.800> you'll<00:01:18.100> have

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.240 
okay so the first thing I'm going to do
is<00:01:24.850> place<00:01:25.149> this<00:01:25.390> pearl<00:01:26.170> on<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.800> end<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.130> the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
is place this pearl on the end of the

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.830 
is place this pearl on the end of the
wire<00:01:27.459> and<00:01:27.490> I'm<00:01:27.880> going<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.179> leave<00:01:28.300> about<00:01:28.330> an

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
wire and I'm going to leave about an

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.740 
wire and I'm going to leave about an
inch<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.289> wire<00:01:29.500> extending<00:01:30.429> here<00:01:30.729> and<00:01:30.940> then<00:01:31.599> I'm

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
inch of wire extending here and then I'm

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.199 
inch of wire extending here and then I'm
just<00:01:31.780> going<00:01:32.170> to<00:01:32.349> start<00:01:32.759> I'm<00:01:33.759> going<00:01:33.910> to<00:01:34.030> hold

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
just going to start I'm going to hold

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:37.889 
just going to start I'm going to hold
that<00:01:34.569> bead<00:01:35.020> in<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:36.240> I'm<00:01:37.240> going<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.539> start

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
that bead in and I'm going to start

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.180 
that bead in and I'm going to start
winding<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.610> wire<00:01:39.990> around<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.470> bead<00:01:41.619> like

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
winding the wire around the bead like

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.120 
winding the wire around the bead like
that<00:01:42.429> and<00:01:42.759> then<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.599> can<00:01:43.660> use<00:01:43.810> my<00:01:43.990> pliers<00:01:44.500> to

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
that and then I can use my pliers to

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.850 
that and then I can use my pliers to
close<00:01:45.940> up<00:01:46.330> that<00:01:46.390> end<00:01:47.110> of<00:01:47.709> the<00:01:47.950> wire<00:01:48.569> okay<00:01:49.860> so

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
close up that end of the wire okay so

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.949 
close up that end of the wire okay so
now<00:01:51.069> I<00:01:51.099> can<00:01:51.429> kind<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:51.789> get<00:01:52.149> a<00:01:52.179> hold<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.569> the<00:01:52.750> wire

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
now I can kind of get a hold of the wire

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.930 
now I can kind of get a hold of the wire
here<00:01:53.410> and<00:01:53.789> I<00:01:54.789> can<00:01:55.000> start<00:01:55.300> winding<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.940> wire

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
here and I can start winding the wire

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.260 
here and I can start winding the wire
around<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:59.020> bead<00:02:00.690> like<00:02:01.690> that<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:03.220> when<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.149> get

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
around the bead like that and when I get

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.180 
around the bead like that and when I get
to<00:02:04.450> where<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.929> beginning<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.619> wire<00:02:05.830> was

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
to where the beginning of the wire was

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.510 
to where the beginning of the wire was
I'll<00:02:07.000> just<00:02:07.450> make<00:02:07.690> sure<00:02:07.899> I<00:02:07.959> wind<00:02:08.349> it<00:02:08.560> in<00:02:08.739> front

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
I'll just make sure I wind it in front

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.860 
I'll just make sure I wind it in front
of<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:10.470> okay<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:13.330> I'm<00:02:13.390> going<00:02:13.599> to<00:02:13.690> keep

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
of that okay so I'm going to keep

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.640 
of that okay so I'm going to keep
winding<00:02:14.260> until<00:02:14.739> I've<00:02:15.400> used<00:02:15.670> up<00:02:16.110> all<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.170> the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
winding until I've used up all of the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.360 
winding until I've used up all of the
wire<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.170> have<00:02:20.440> three<00:02:20.709> quarters<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.160> an

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
wire but I have three quarters of an

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.030 
wire but I have three quarters of an
inch<00:02:21.489> left

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
inch left

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.170 
inch left
okay<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:26.110> keep<00:02:26.709> winding<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:27.939> can

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
okay so just keep winding and you can

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.599 
okay so just keep winding and you can
use<00:02:28.390> your<00:02:28.599> pliers<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:29.349> tighten<00:02:29.769> up<00:02:30.069> your<00:02:30.280> roll

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
use your pliers to tighten up your roll

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.979 
use your pliers to tighten up your roll
if<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:30.969> have<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:32.549> okay

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
so just keep on rolling and winding and
