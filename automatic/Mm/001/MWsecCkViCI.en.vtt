00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hi and video what my grandfather asked 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.210
 to entertain 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.410
 is a kind of wallpaper goodbye and I have 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.400
 thought about it so also going 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.050
 to fill in 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.880
 and then I thought maybe nice 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.009
 to show you my blog posts 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.089
 make cookie review 'make one too 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.310
 often asked how do you do that well 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.220
 actually where do you take photos 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.600
 how dual it how you do that so i thought 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.519
 you know what i'm going today 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.240
 totally shows the whole process as 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.109
 to film 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.670
 well i hope you enjoyed it too 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.680
 See who's not always without makeup 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.439
 so today also weeks completely 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.149
 sun canopy and I think there is just one 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.890
 package it arrived and I think 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.200
 that it is very nice today 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.680
 learn to review and so yes I go 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:47.129
 that room they rub loose 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:53.730
 so I am ruben but no this is it 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.170
 package you find I also look in 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.300
 well first there is press information 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.160
 here is also all info washing 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.840
 products are the colors the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.699
 prices and then the products themselves 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.229
 release watson first impression i think 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.030
 that is interesting to you 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.070
 I think it's fun to be around 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.570
 to write something about it 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.390
 sometimes get punch sent to buy 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.100
 also product review 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.450
 i found example this lip product saw this 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.320
 really good looking very bad 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.240
 curious about 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.619
 then I go to my office and I lay 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.390
 make the product down on my desk there 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.950
 I usually like the pictures but I also like 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.200
 nice to play the background 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.850
 I just looked at this was fun 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.259
 decided to take the photos from someone else 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.210
 desk 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.140
 then I pack my camera in the accessories 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.509
 there 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.640
 the 50-mm lens between people a 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.640
 external flash and the sd card 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.860
 then I put the 50 mm lens on my camera 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.750
 so tangier chains that goes off 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.510
 the flash that also goes that way 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.610
 I go up so that you do not flash immediately 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.470
 this the most beautiful effect and then I make the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.760
 photos and now I usually do not go through 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.920
 visitor but looking through it 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.420
 screen on my camera 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.860
 i play a lot with though i do 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.480
 canceling cancer are just as sweet with it 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.310
 but I also really like it 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.080
 I really love doing and photographing 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.370
 very nice especially if there are products 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.050
 to be 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.880
 This is a skater came up to me 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.160
 come closer to product because with a 5 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.680
 mm cannot be zoomed in or out 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.650
 this is perfect for close-up photos 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.270
 for detail photos 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.160
 a mythical by flat adhesive tape 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.470
 under your product if it goes either way 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.300
 rolls prevents a whole lot than sheets I 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.240
 through the photos and possibly delete 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.920
 one or two photos 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.420
 when I photographed all products separately 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.220
 then I need another picture of 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.140
 all together the complete picture 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.730
 I also do this before the side appeared and 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.410
 just as long in different ways 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.300
 until I am satisfied with the photo that is possible 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.600
 for start of article and on 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.600
 the end 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.110
 then it goes back up from your lens 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.730
 pictures near making the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.560
 eye shadows and now I make in the bathroom 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.340
 so you get all the glitters et cetera well 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.900
 can see 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.670
 and who your name is pitch dark are none 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.980
 windows so you can therefore take perfect pictures 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.989
 dealing with flash 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.120
 and then I will swatch like you do I do 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.150
 my arm 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.849
 all the colors and then I'll make it 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.590
 photos daylight but I also go to again 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.690
 the bathroom and there were pictures with flash 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.720
 pick everything up with 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.370
 wipes them from guinea and 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.239
 now it's time for the other products 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.730
 also on my arm 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.730
 lip products and the eyeliner 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.019
 also who I photograph again in the bathroom 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.140
 and I love them for so far and so 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.370
 good that it is possible with wipes 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.069
 we try the product i make one 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.480
 makeup look make my eye shadow look 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.480
 with the palette 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.580
 the eyeliner that goes on too 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.440
 I think a man's complete look is complete 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.420
 very important to test everything well 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.920
 then I would need a tripod more for photos 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.180
 from my face to make the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:07.530
 makeup look and overshoes 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.880
 lip products and here mountain biky again it 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.900
 screen can tilt a bit very nice 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.460
 is 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.460
 yes then I will apply lipsticks there 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.739
 who applies as neatly as possible and then 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.320
 I make a close-up photo with my 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.980
 standard kit lens always comes before the 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.980
 pictures of my face 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.960
 We can remove and go with a moment 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.790
 the foundation brushes over my lips 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.830
 so that everything is nicely concealed and then 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.230
 can I apply the following lip color 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.300
 I love this color 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:51.630
 really very beautiful god of my photos 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:53.610
 up close and whose face then 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.580
 the photos go on my computer or you 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.980
 again and then I let them in 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:04.710
 iphoto and with that they search quickly 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:07.380
 and edit a little bit 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.330
 clip the photos off i write one 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.310
 bit with it and this just handy for one 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.840
 to select it with the photos 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.190
 can not and the photos that I am going 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.190
 use scoop to a desktop 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.990
 then I will actually edit them, I will go text 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.250
 also very nice in the first pictures 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.060
 to do I can work on it for a long time 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.400
 to be 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.990
 fonts too large is the colors that 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.370
 I use 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.610
 but this I actually pretty fast 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.610
 from 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.720
 I will reduce all the photos there 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:41.080
 edit especially the light I adjust 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.740
 and to between testicle your product and if 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.740
 I put it in a blog post 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.090
 I upload everything and then I do the text 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.920
 there 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.720
 you now see codes and I can confirm 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.580
 or view a profile now you see it in 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.690
 photos this press release given to me by 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.670
 the four of course not all in one 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.930
 times it should be lip products longer 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.220
 We also tested whether the 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.290
 eyeshadows stay in place et 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.630
 cetera this something else to notice that 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.160
 later on I am all in all 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.030
 spend about five hours on a review 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.010
 if this 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.590
 when I'm done I am him in me 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:21.460
 work from it very handy 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:24.240
 lip product is also on the road I can 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.240
 a more comprehensive review 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.020
 and if it is online then it is 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.640
 time to read and respond to your responses 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.210
 and that they are actually the 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.590
 final step of a product review 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.600
 well this was the behine the bye gave 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.550
 eric nu.nl how it goes about when 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.919
 my blog posts make was 4 times make it 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.169
 I don't always go exactly this way 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.430
 this is about the bell and it's pretty awkward 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.960
 but too many with you can be the one 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.570
 a little good image if you 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.950
 Any questions about them represents mainly 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.570
 yes i did like to be with quite once 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.250

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.960

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.310
