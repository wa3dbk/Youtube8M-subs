only works if you have developed your
horse<00:00:50.940> correctly<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.170> developed<00:00:52.560> to

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
horse correctly and it's developed to

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.590 
horse correctly and it's developed to
the<00:00:52.740> point<00:00:52.800> where<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.250> top<00:00:53.910> line<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.300> clearly

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the point where this top line is clearly

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.260 
the point where this top line is clearly
defined<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.400> ride<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> horse<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.150> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
defined and we can ride the horse in the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.960 
defined and we can ride the horse in the
weight<00:00:57.450> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> race<00:00:57.870> riders<00:00:58.680> ride<00:00:59.070> holding<00:00:59.910> a

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
weight of the race riders ride holding a

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.300 
weight of the race riders ride holding a
heavy<00:01:00.210> hand<00:01:00.630> against<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> rider<00:01:01.410> as<00:01:02.070> soon<00:01:02.220> as

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
heavy hand against the rider as soon as

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.890 
heavy hand against the rider as soon as
you<00:01:02.400> try<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.910> top<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.390> horse<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.720> try

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
you try to do the top the horse will try

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.179 
you try to do the top the horse will try
to<00:01:03.930> bolt<00:01:04.260> right<00:01:04.379> out<00:01:04.559> from<00:01:04.710> underneath<00:01:04.949> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
to bolt right out from underneath you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.190 
to bolt right out from underneath you
and<00:01:05.670> that's<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.030> problem<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.659> your<00:01:07.049> horse

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and that's the problem so your horse

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.319 
and that's the problem so your horse
must<00:01:07.469> be<00:01:07.590> developing<00:01:08.130> trains<00:01:08.490> correctly<00:01:09.119> for

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
must be developing trains correctly for

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.179 
must be developing trains correctly for
this<00:01:09.450> all<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.689> work<00:01:09.869> correctly<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.890> once<00:01:11.070> you

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
this all to work correctly so once you

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.319 
this all to work correctly so once you
have<00:01:11.399> all<00:01:11.609> those<00:01:11.700> things<00:01:11.939> working<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
have all those things working the

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:13.789 
have all those things working the
wreckage<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.929> can<00:01:13.079> try<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.259> start<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
wreckage then we can try to start at the
