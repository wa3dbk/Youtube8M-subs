00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.980
 moves aggressively and unleashes a 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.770
 rain of attacks on enemies 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.380
 hard and inflexible the barbarian stands out 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.510
 among the warriors he uses his anger and his 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.070
 physical force to crush the enemy to 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.110

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.610
 battle as it inflicts and receives 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.610

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.030

 series of traps and skills 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.790
 evasive to elude the claws of

 enemy 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.690
 agile and lethal the demon hunter will 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.490

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.520

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.420
 his attacks and tactical skills are 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.330
 they feed on the dual forces of hatred 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.280
 whose regeneration is fast and the 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.280
 slow regeneration discipline 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.009

 almost imperceptible to the eye 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:38.120
 incapacitate the enemy 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.710

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.560

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.850
 Martial uses his blinding speed to 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.020
 club the enemies while they 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.020
 dodge their attacks 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.500
 the force of spirit nourishes the ability 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.580
 from the monk to ghana spirit with his 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.580

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.709
 we also have the witch doctor 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.290
 the main attribute of the witch doctor 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.840

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.690
 power of the spirits 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.240
 thanks to a wide selection of 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.569
 offensive spells the witch doctor does not 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.819
 amilana before the combat 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.010
 cunning and devious the witch doctor 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.780

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.780
 summon creatures from beyond the grave 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.520
 the witch doctor uses the power of the mana 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.780
 to cast devastating spells 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.780
 the witch doctor 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:07.000
 and we have the magician 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.460
 main attribute intelligence 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.320
 master of elemental energies and 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.860
 temporary that sustain one's own 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.830
 creation 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.480
 the magician can inflict resist and avoid 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.049
 damage with a formidable series of 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.540
 area spells and directed powerful and 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.490
 elusive the magician materializes the magic in 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.050
 shields and spells that 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.040
 they unleash the destruction on their 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.650
 enemies 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.600
 the magician makes use of the arcane power a 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.050
 quick regeneration resource for 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.050
 cast spells 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.969
 we also have the magician 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.250
 I personally am going to play with the magician 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.990
 is one of the classes that I like the most and 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.290
 this is going to be my character 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.290
 principal 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.169
 then we also have this button 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.280
 here that is to make miner 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.680
 hardcore or hardcore mode 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.660
 the unconditional heroes are just 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.530
 available after reaching the level 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.530
 10 in normal mode 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:22.160
 what happens is that when creating a 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:24.160
 unconditional character when dying then no 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.310
 you can play again with the character 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:31.610
 it stays blocked and dies in fact 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:36.009
 when you die you die you can not really 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:39.759
 return to a previous point of departure or 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.759
 recover it in any way 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.920
 then all that remains is to put the name of the 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.900
 character 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.980
 I will use my own for the first 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.870
 name and so I get more into the game 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.870
 and we give to create hero 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.960
 Well, that would be everything, I hope you have 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.650
 been useful and if you want to see my 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.870
 steps in devil 3 follow my channel without more 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:12.180
 I wait for you in the next video program
