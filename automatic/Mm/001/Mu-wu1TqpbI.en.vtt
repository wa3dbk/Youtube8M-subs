00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
absolutely fantastic so it's going to

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.990 
absolutely fantastic so it's going to
think<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:13.019> 446<00:03:13.859> PPI<00:03:14.430> which<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.909> just

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
think of 446 PPI which is just

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.270 
think of 446 PPI which is just
absolutely<00:03:15.389> astronomical<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.680> sort<00:03:16.859> of<00:03:16.889> aces

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
absolutely astronomical it sort of aces

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.360 
absolutely astronomical it sort of aces
everything<00:03:17.639> that's<00:03:17.819> on<00:03:17.909> the<00:03:18.000> record<00:03:19.340> well<00:03:20.340> I

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
everything that's on the record well I

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.430 
everything that's on the record well I
was<00:03:20.609> loud<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.389> everything<00:03:22.049> on<00:03:22.169> the<00:03:22.290> retina

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
display side of things something this is

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.369 
display side of things something this is
probably<00:03:24.419> one<00:03:24.599> of<00:03:24.629> the<00:03:24.720> best<00:03:24.840> phone<00:03:25.049> screens
