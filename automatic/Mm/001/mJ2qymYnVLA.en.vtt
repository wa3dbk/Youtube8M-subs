00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.629
 a little over a week ago during 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.720
 tokyo game show sony surprised us with 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.759
 a somewhat disconcerting announcement a 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.000
 new console without screen call 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.560
 playstation vita type obviously not 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.820
 is not even remotely comparable to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.010
 Playstation 4 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.320
 so if it takes it lives in the name 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.150
 but it has no screen of what we are 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.920
 talking 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.440
 playstation vita tv is a habitat 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.269
 rethought by the sony engineers 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.000
 who have seen that on the consoles 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.010
 laptops no longer have a future at the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.649
 proliferation of games for smartphone 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.899
 and of course with the stock of consoles and 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.870
 components in the warehouses something had 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.390
 what to do for them or create life tv 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.090
 a console that runs the games of the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.329
 current ps vita in addition to including a 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.699
 emulator of the playstation x sony lÃ­ber 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.610
 Habitat divides the screen and adds 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.220
 hdmi output to reduce the final price 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.039
 and give the feeling that we have a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.170
 great entertainment station now 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.750
 bing what can get the most attention 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.190
 of rita tv is the remote game with 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.830
 playstation 4 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.050
 that is when I got playstation 4 to 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.360
 market and you want to play in the lounge 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.070
 house that is where you usually have the console 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.710
 but someone will come and stop you 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.780
 you can take your life tiff and take it to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.060
 your room connect it to the television that 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.940
 have and and continue with the game 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.190
 loaded on playstation 4 thanks to the 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.550
 wifi connection and streaming games 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.530
 all this is playstation vita tv and 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.750
 although at first we thought that 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.050
 we would come out of japan things 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.180
 they start to change yes guys are and has 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.820
 announced that for the time being it will also arrive 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.920
 china and korea so he the logical thing is 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.190
 that ends up landing also in 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.190
 Europe 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.819
 ah
