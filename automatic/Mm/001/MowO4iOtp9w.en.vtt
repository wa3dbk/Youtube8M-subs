00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:09.519
 My name is Tsuzuki Summoner Kato Inc. 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:14.170
 8 Today is the Hydrogen fuel cell exhibition 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.280
 Click here for Fuel Cell Act empty lift hydrogen station 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:21.170
 end point 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:25.940
 I'm sending it out, it's here About the process of opening a store 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:31.710
 8 It is a car in 8 follow society now 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:34.680
 It is responsible for the next generation we are going to try old 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.990
 Forklift person is this one 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:44.730
 As our company, we hit the ground and supply hydrogen to fuel cell or chase and op lift. 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:48.610
 It is in the form of releasing a station 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:55.300
 That's already in the US 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:58.870
 It has been widely spread, but in Japan we are going to test it 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:05.350
 Forklifts are in the form of being sold 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.050
 Here is the hydrogen station pressure is 35 people pa 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.690
 so 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.080
 The car is now the car The hydrogen chorus is in the form of 70 megapascals 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.620
 But 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:22.040
 8 Low pressure hydrogen station 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:26.040
 Here's the hydrogen station situation or to miniaturize the forklift itself 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.640
 If you make your daughter's initial strength smaller and your chest smaller 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:35.220
 In the United States in the form of that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:42.030
 It is hilarious like stuffing in a forklift It is a forklift child that loads it on the lift a lot 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.740
 Then in the factory then it 's getting smaller and the distance runs a bridge like that much car 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.860
 Than not 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.250
 Well on the premises 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:57.020
 That can run enough 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:02:00.469
 Enough is available 35 people Gappa in an amount to run a day was calculated in the form of a fee of hydrogen month 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:07.070
 It is a kind of form that here 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:08.899
 It of the will in the form of the supply here of the nozzle and the station was considered 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.630
 Well done 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.830
 I think it is a system that can be easily supplied by one touch 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:23.850
 It is from now on about this justice as our company 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:26.030
 Because we think in the wind that we want to put power and want to spread in the whole country 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.640
 To everyone by all means 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:34.420
 It is more than I think that you want to have you look and feel that you are the exhibit 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.420
 Thank you
