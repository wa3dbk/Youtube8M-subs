00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
aerodynamic reasons and also a place to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.760 
aerodynamic reasons and also a place to
tuck<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.700> wiper<00:01:38.880> system<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.659> top<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.619> how

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
tuck the wiper system up in top so how

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.469 
tuck the wiper system up in top so how
to<00:01:40.829> engage<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.880> you've<00:01:42.119> got<00:01:42.270> two

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
to engage that is you've got two

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.600 
to engage that is you've got two
settings<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:43.140> your<00:01:43.259> wiper<00:01:43.500> you've<00:01:44.250> got<00:01:44.430> your

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
settings for your wiper you've got your

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.249 
settings for your wiper you've got your
intermittent<00:01:45.119> mode<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.659> you've<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:46.170> your

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
intermittent mode and you've got your

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.740 
intermittent mode and you've got your
constant<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.909> put<00:01:48.119> an<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.450> mode

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
constant on so if I put an on mode

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.899 
constant on so if I put an on mode
you'll<00:01:49.409> see<00:01:49.619> how<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.770> wiper<00:01:50.009> now<00:01:50.280> comes<00:01:50.579> down

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
you'll see how the wiper now comes down

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.899 
you'll see how the wiper now comes down
from<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> top<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.920> vehicle<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.790> I'll

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
from the top of the vehicle and I'll

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.280 
from the top of the vehicle and I'll
shut<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.180> off<00:01:54.560> or<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.270> go<00:01:57.450> so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
shut it off or you can there you go so

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.289 
shut it off or you can there you go so
that<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.890> also<00:01:59.040> change<00:01:59.430> how<00:01:59.610> often<00:02:00.000> you

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
that you can also change how often you

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.440 
that you can also change how often you
want<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.600> wipers<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.079> go<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.450> you

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
want the wipers to go so this is you

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.149 
want the wipers to go so this is you
know<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> third<00:02:03.869> setting<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.350> intermittent<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
know a third setting of intermittent the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.590 
know a third setting of intermittent the
fourth<00:02:05.430> setting<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.880> intermittent<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.450> goes

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
fourth setting of intermittent it goes

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600 
fourth setting of intermittent it goes
more<00:02:06.899> often<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.560> then<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.190> put<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.489> in

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
more often and then to put it in

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.279 
more often and then to put it in
constant<00:02:09.270> mode<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.899> go<00:02:09.989> all<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.170> way

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
constant mode you have to go all the way

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.710 
constant mode you have to go all the way
up<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.890> notch<00:02:11.099> or<00:02:12.050> your

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
up here to this notch or your

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.170 
up here to this notch or your
all<00:02:13.900> right<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.710> wash<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.130> windshields<00:02:15.730> just
