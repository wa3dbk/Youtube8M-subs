00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.120
 video guys today as you see in 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.639
 the title we are in a new draw for 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.769
 a premium account of minecraft and guys 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.999
 good to start I'd like to give you the 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.470
 thank you all because the truth 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.480
 you're doing pretty well in the 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.949
 good episode in the episode in the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.930
 previous draw that we made of a 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.279
 premium account of minecraft so then 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.990
 encourages me to do this also tell you 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.810
 that has advanced a little 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.369
 winners of let's say the good week of 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.470
 draw I made earlier is to say what 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.059
 five days ahead of the draw I think 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.440
 nothing better happens for those who have 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.360
 already participated because we say that 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.129
 you have participate less you have less 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.320
 competition and it's pretty simpler 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.090
 guys and also thank you very much everyone 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.350
 good for having participated 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.969
 you have done pretty well so I'm 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.370
 quite happy everything has come out very 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.809
 alright so in the description of this 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.640
 video you have the winner of the draw 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.710
 previous it's good that you can not 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.989
 to participate obviously is to say the 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.940
 guys that if we get to many many 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.100
 likes and burst is the button me 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.260
 like in this video in the next 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.879
 Well, I'm probably thinking about doing 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.910
 this once a month or so it's worth because 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.900
 I think it does not cost too much and I do not 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.640
 I think it 's something possible 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.100
 and also say the guys that 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.810
 finally this draw I'm not going to do 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.400
 I'm just going to do it with robbie and 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.110
 with rendering card in fight you will know him 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.030
 of the channel by pixel moon and robe and then 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.590
 well for you also know the channel 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.810
 for the sky wars videos so 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.980
 perfect good guys I'll pass you 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.540
 explain the requirements that we have 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.640
 made quite easy and for all 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.170
 basically you can participate then 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.700
 you will need to have only one guys 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.110
 twitter account and an account 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.060
 youtube and youtube account me 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.410
 I imagine that if you are seeing this is that 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.300
 if you have it and the twitter account 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.130
 guys is super easy to do 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.440
 that do not require or confirmation and you 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.119
 you can do in basically a minute 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.830
 so nothing guys you'll have to 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.390
 do to enter you will have to be 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.500

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.640
 subscribed also to the robbie channel and 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.530
 you will have to retweet a tweet 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.210
 what you will find in the description 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.830
 and good to follow the three on twitter 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.810
 It is worth as you see are enough requirements 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.460
 simple and good what happens if you 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.140
 you will come out some of the steps that is what 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.210
 that someone tells me how you're going to 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.160
 check how good do not do it 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.140
 we are going to buy at the moment but if 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.090
 some casual the person who wins is not 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.400
 If the three of us are our, remove the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.390
 three obviously we will give you the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.190
 I award the code for this case 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.530
 the draw as I say will last a week 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.410

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.930
 wrong is in 23th as it will 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.180
 when we see the results it's worth so 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.190

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.500
 Sorte previous for how well you 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.900
 did you do or was there hardly any doubt I think 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.510
 that I left everything pretty clear here 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.250
 so nothing many soldiers guys like 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.560
 I say premium accounts basically you 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.690
 will be good to put the skin to 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.640
 enter premium servers that is 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.250
 basically for what greater utility 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.020
 has and a little more for adam than 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.680
 it escapes me out there but well so 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.940
