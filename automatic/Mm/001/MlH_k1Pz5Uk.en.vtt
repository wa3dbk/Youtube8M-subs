BCC's and this is hot stills today we

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.300 
BCC's and this is hot stills today we
are<00:00:13.590> introducing<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.429> pvp<00:00:14.940> strategy<00:00:15.890> a2k<00:00:16.890> proxy

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
are introducing a pvp strategy a2k proxy

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.560 
are introducing a pvp strategy a2k proxy
that's<00:00:18.060> right<00:00:19.730> sees<00:00:20.730> how<00:00:20.880> would<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.150> execute

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
that's right sees how would you execute

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.720 
that's right sees how would you execute
this<00:00:21.689> strategy<00:00:22.100> first<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.250> all<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.369> want<00:00:23.640> to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
this strategy first of all you want to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.480 
this strategy first of all you want to
have<00:00:23.910> your<00:00:24.390> first<00:00:24.720> probe<00:00:25.109> sending<00:00:26.070> two<00:00:26.279> other

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
have your first probe sending two other

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.960 
have your first probe sending two other
opponent<00:00:27.390> area<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:29.160> strategy<00:00:29.849> works

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
opponent area so this strategy works

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.420 
opponent area so this strategy works
really<00:00:30.240> good<00:00:30.510> against<00:00:31.009> two<00:00:32.009> player<00:00:32.219> map

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
really good against two player map

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.220 
really good against two player map
because<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.850> know<00:00:32.969> where<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.420> opponent's

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
because you know where the opponent's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.490 
because you know where the opponent's
add<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.070> actually<00:00:35.219> build<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.300> pylon<00:00:36.809> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
add so you can actually build a pylon to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.860 
add so you can actually build a pylon to
this<00:00:37.829> clip<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.219> here<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.879> over<00:00:39.360> there<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
this clip right here or over there and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.410 
this clip right here or over there and
you<00:00:40.410> could<00:00:40.559> actually<00:00:40.620> put<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> gateway<00:00:41.820> up<00:00:42.120> on

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
you could actually put a gateway up on

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.450 
you could actually put a gateway up on
the<00:00:42.510> cliff<00:00:42.780> okay<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.800> want<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> put<00:00:44.370> your

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the cliff okay so you want to put your

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.420 
the cliff okay so you want to put your
first<00:00:44.670> pylon<00:00:45.649> like<00:00:46.649> my<00:00:46.860> next<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.219> your

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
first pylon like my next to your

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.580 
first pylon like my next to your
opponent's<00:00:48.030> cliff<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
opponent's cliff that's right then you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.760 
opponent's cliff that's right then you
later<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.550> for<00:00:50.760> your<00:00:50.879> gateway<00:00:51.059> inside

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
later on you for your gateway inside

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.189 
later on you for your gateway inside
okay<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.949> try<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> sneak<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.000> then<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
okay you try to sneak in and then the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.529 
okay you try to sneak in and then the
Builder<00:00:55.530> gateway<00:00:55.890> sometimes<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:57.030> build<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.510> new

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
Builder gateway sometimes to build a new

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.860 
Builder gateway sometimes to build a new
gateway<00:00:57.930> around<00:00:58.620> here<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.449> and<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.719> gotta

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
gateway around here and so and you gotta

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.640 
gateway around here and so and you gotta
stop<00:01:01.289> making<00:01:01.829> probe<00:01:02.100> about<00:01:02.640> 10<00:01:03.260> okay<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.559> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
stop making probe about 10 okay so you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.710 
stop making probe about 10 okay so you
go<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.010> 10<00:01:05.369> tops<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.939> stop<00:01:06.210> making

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
go up to 10 tops and you stop making

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.980 
go up to 10 tops and you stop making
folks<00:01:07.080> that's<00:01:07.439> right<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.040> save<00:01:08.400> till<00:01:08.689> 304<00:01:09.689> to

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
folks that's right and save till 304 to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.780 
folks that's right and save till 304 to
gateway<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.619> make<00:01:11.189> sure<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.520> guys<00:01:11.610> are

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
gateway and make sure you guys are

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.149 
gateway and make sure you guys are
building<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.689> gateway<00:01:12.960> at<00:01:13.140> same<00:01:13.320> time<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
building to gateway at same time and you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.399 
building to gateway at same time and you
kind<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.490> gotta<00:01:14.670> act<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.810> fresh<00:01:16.140> probes

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
kind of gotta act with this fresh probes

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.249 
kind of gotta act with this fresh probes
so<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.340> kind<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> analyze<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.080> kind

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
so you kind of want to analyze it kind

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.570 
so you kind of want to analyze it kind
of<00:01:19.320> looks<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.650> scouting<00:01:20.009> program<00:01:20.490> in

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
of looks like a scouting program in

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.710 
of looks like a scouting program in
touch<00:01:20.700> rice<00:01:20.909> you're<00:01:21.150> not<00:01:21.240> directly<00:01:21.509> going

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
touch rice you're not directly going

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.480 
touch rice you're not directly going
into<00:01:21.990> right<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.220> could<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.460> a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
into right there then you could be a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.399 
into right there then you could be a
little<00:01:23.670> suspicious<00:01:23.930> kinda<00:01:24.930> should<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:25.200> seen

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
little suspicious kinda should have seen

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.440 
little suspicious kinda should have seen
my<00:01:25.560> foot

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
my foot

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.710 
my foot
I<00:01:26.509> bet<00:01:27.079> you<00:01:27.229> come<00:01:27.439> out<00:01:30.520> Nash<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:31.549> had

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
I bet you come out Nash you had

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.870 
I bet you come out Nash you had
that's<00:01:34.720> right<00:01:34.930> okay<00:01:35.740> at<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:35.920> same<00:01:36.100> time<00:01:36.370> so

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
that's right okay at the same time so

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.940 
that's right okay at the same time so
you<00:01:36.940> want<00:01:37.120> to<00:01:37.180> have<00:01:37.300> to<00:01:37.480> do<00:01:37.630> coming<00:01:38.110> out<00:01:38.260> at<00:01:38.500> the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
you want to have to do coming out at the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.550 
you want to have to do coming out at the
same<00:01:39.130> time<00:01:39.400> so<00:01:39.790> that's<00:01:39.970> more<00:01:40.150> effective<00:01:40.570> so

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
same time so that's more effective so

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.680 
same time so that's more effective so
right<00:01:42.520> now<00:01:42.550> you're<00:01:42.760> starting<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.150> make<00:01:43.300> probes

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
right now you're starting to make probes

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.260 
right now you're starting to make probes
again<00:01:43.960> right<00:01:44.140> that's<00:01:44.500> right<00:01:44.740> so<00:01:45.729> you<00:01:45.790> want<00:01:46.180> to

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
again right that's right so you want to

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.830 
again right that's right so you want to
make<00:01:46.300> pro<00:01:46.630> until<00:01:47.050> like<00:01:47.380> 14<00:01:47.950> or<00:01:48.310> 13<00:01:48.660> sounds<00:01:49.660> good

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
make pro until like 14 or 13 sounds good

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.170 
make pro until like 14 or 13 sounds good
and<00:01:50.740> you<00:01:50.920> could<00:01:51.100> still<00:01:51.310> use<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.670> chronic<00:01:52.000> was

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
and you could still use the chronic was

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.660 
and you could still use the chronic was
for<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:53.170> two<00:01:53.500> pros<00:01:53.740> because<00:01:54.040> you<00:01:54.400> still

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
for the the two pros because you still

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.840 
for the the two pros because you still
have<00:01:54.700> 15<00:01:55.210> energy<00:01:56.110> left<00:01:56.290> for<00:01:56.530> two<00:01:56.890> gateways<00:01:57.160> so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
have 15 energy left for two gateways so

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.940 
have 15 energy left for two gateways so
basically<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.540> want<00:01:58.660> to<00:01:58.810> have<00:01:58.960> at<00:01:59.320> least<00:01:59.380> two

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
basically you want to have at least two

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.810 
basically you want to have at least two
Colonels<00:02:00.820> safety<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:03.190> you<00:02:03.340> wanna<00:02:03.460> have<00:02:03.670> your

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
Colonels safety and you wanna have your

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.440 
Colonels safety and you wanna have your
pilot<00:02:04.510> about<00:02:04.899> halfway<00:02:05.259> done<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.670> Gateway<00:02:07.030> so

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
pilot about halfway done the Gateway so

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.050

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
and you could actually make a choke

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.070 
and you could actually make a choke
point<00:02:15.370> right<00:02:15.730> there<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.180> can<00:02:16.360> suck<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.870> do

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
point right there so you can suck a do

it right there and actually i'll take
those<00:02:19.420> probes<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.900> not<00:02:20.170> guess<00:02:20.440> around<00:02:20.739> it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
those probes and not guess around it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.880 
those probes and not guess around it
that's<00:02:22.120> pretty<00:02:22.270> good<00:02:22.480> idea<00:02:22.720> that's<00:02:23.470> that's
