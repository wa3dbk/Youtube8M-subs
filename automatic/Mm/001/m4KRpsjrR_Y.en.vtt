00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.839 
today I'm going to show you guys some
traps<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.840> locking<00:00:10.320> mechanisms<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.370> hope<00:00:11.820> you

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
traps and locking mechanisms so hope you

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.799 
traps and locking mechanisms so hope you
guys<00:00:12.059> enjoy<00:00:12.740> so<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.830> open<00:00:14.219> up<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.519> sword

guys enjoy so you open up the sword

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.580 
guys enjoy so you open up the sword
there<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.990> go<00:00:16.460> it's<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.609> pretty<00:00:18.570> simple<00:00:19.199> how

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
there you go it's a pretty simple how

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.890 
there you go it's a pretty simple how
that<00:00:19.859> works<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.460> just<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:21.000> button<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.689> opens

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
that works it's just a button that opens

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.670 
that works it's just a button that opens
this<00:00:22.380> door<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:22.949> also<00:00:23.160> opens<00:00:23.910> um<00:00:24.680> these

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
this door and it also opens um these

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.970 
this door and it also opens um these
Pistons<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:27.660> they're<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.949> know

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
Pistons and they're just you know

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.330 
Pistons and they're just you know
constantly<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.300> button<00:00:30.599> turns<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> off<00:00:31.340> so

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
constantly on the button turns it off so

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.940 
constantly on the button turns it off so
they<00:00:32.489> open<00:00:32.880> up<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.829> then

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
they open up and then

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.060 
they open up and then
so<00:00:36.580> say<00:00:36.910> if<00:00:37.030> this<00:00:37.210> is<00:00:37.450> your<00:00:37.660> base<00:00:38.170> and<00:00:38.590> someone

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
so say if this is your base and someone

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.300 
so say if this is your base and someone
sees<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:40.600> know<00:00:40.720> door<00:00:41.110> they're<00:00:41.440> trying<00:00:41.740> to<00:00:41.860> you

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
sees you know door they're trying to you

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.420 
sees you know door they're trying to you
know<00:00:42.340> trying<00:00:43.060> to<00:00:43.150> get<00:00:43.390> up<00:00:43.510> there<00:00:43.750> but<00:00:44.260> you<00:00:45.250> have

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
know trying to get up there but you have

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.890 
know trying to get up there but you have
to<00:00:45.610> know<00:00:45.640> each<00:00:46.120> step<00:00:46.930> to<00:00:47.680> get<00:00:48.550> there<00:00:48.940> so<00:00:49.720> the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
to know each step to get there so the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.720 
to know each step to get there so the
first<00:00:50.170> thing<00:00:50.410> is<00:00:50.620> you<00:00:52.110> open<00:00:53.110> this<00:00:53.260> lever<00:00:53.770> so

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
first thing is you open this lever so

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.860 
first thing is you open this lever so
I'll<00:00:55.660> show<00:00:55.870> you<00:00:55.950> I'll<00:00:56.950> show<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.250> that<00:00:57.489> so<00:00:58.360> you

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
I'll show you I'll show you that so you

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.220 
I'll show you I'll show you that so you
can<00:00:59.050> see<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.950> levers<00:01:00.280> on<00:01:00.489> now<00:01:00.760> so<00:01:01.600> that's<00:01:02.110> just

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
can see the levers on now so that's just

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.320 
can see the levers on now so that's just
a<00:01:02.500> good<00:01:02.680> way<00:01:02.710> of<00:01:02.890> hiding<00:01:03.309> your<00:01:03.670> lever<00:01:03.910> is<00:01:04.300> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
a good way of hiding your lever is to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.850 
a good way of hiding your lever is to
put<00:01:07.330> it<00:01:07.450> in<00:01:07.540> la<00:01:07.690> bar<00:01:08.050> behind<00:01:08.410> fire<00:01:08.920> in<00:01:09.759> water

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
put it in la bar behind fire in water

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.690 
put it in la bar behind fire in water
and<00:01:11.860> then<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.430> next<00:01:12.460> thing<00:01:13.150> is<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:15.340> throw

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
and then the next thing is you throw

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.810 
and then the next thing is you throw
blocks<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.950> it'll<00:01:18.190> hit<00:01:18.400> a<00:01:18.670> pressure<00:01:19.570> pad<00:01:19.990> and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
blocks and it'll hit a pressure pad and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.890 
blocks and it'll hit a pressure pad and
then<00:01:21.820> BAM<00:01:22.240> it<00:01:22.869> opens<00:01:23.350> up<00:01:23.500> this<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.600> you<00:01:25.720> hit

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
then BAM it opens up this so you hit

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.950 
then BAM it opens up this so you hit
that<00:01:26.140> and<00:01:26.800> it<00:01:27.100> opens<00:01:27.520> up<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.820> door<00:01:28.090> or<00:01:28.479> I'm<00:01:28.780> in

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
that and it opens up a door or I'm in

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.210 
that and it opens up a door or I'm in
that<00:01:29.110> staircase<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:32.320> go<00:01:32.500> up<00:01:32.740> like<00:01:32.950> this

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
that staircase so you go up like this

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.200 
that staircase so you go up like this
and<00:01:33.550> this<00:01:34.330> is<00:01:34.509> actually<00:01:34.800> pretty<00:01:35.800> tricky<00:01:36.520> to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
and this is actually pretty tricky to

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.370 
and this is actually pretty tricky to
make<00:01:37.690> this<00:01:37.990> jump

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.100 

from<00:01:42.009> what<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.369> know<00:01:42.549> is<00:01:43.119> it's<00:01:43.450> kind<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.899> better

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
from what I know is it's kind of better

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.069 
from what I know is it's kind of better
to<00:01:44.469> start<00:01:44.890> back<00:01:45.189> and<00:01:45.549> then<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:46.479> sprint<00:01:46.869> jump

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
to start back and then you sprint jump

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.100 
to start back and then you sprint jump
and<00:01:47.380> then<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:49.299> was<00:01:49.450> like<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.720> first<00:01:49.869> time

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
and then that was like the first time

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.270 
and then that was like the first time
actually<00:01:50.380> made<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:51.509> let's<00:01:52.509> try<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.840> again<00:01:53.280> it's

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
actually made it let's try it again it's

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.020 
actually made it let's try it again it's
actually<00:01:54.789> pretty<00:01:55.240> hard<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:57.159> you<00:01:57.369> sprint<00:01:57.789> out

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
actually pretty hard but you sprint out

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.809 
actually pretty hard but you sprint out
more<00:01:58.780> or<00:01:58.899> less<00:01:59.049> on<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.799> back<00:02:00.159> of<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.520> block

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
more or less on the back of the block

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.370 
more or less on the back of the block
and<00:02:02.069> then<00:02:03.069> you'll<00:02:03.310> make<00:02:03.520> it<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:03.939> then<00:02:04.450> the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
and then you'll make it and then the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.460 
and then you'll make it and then the
other<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:07.030> get<00:02:07.179> into<00:02:07.509> this<00:02:07.659> door<00:02:07.960> you<00:02:08.019> have<00:02:08.200> to

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
other to get into this door you have to

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.460 
other to get into this door you have to
do<00:02:08.619> another<00:02:08.860> step<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:10.479> just<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.869> lever<00:02:11.110> but

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
do another step it's just a lever but

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.460 
do another step it's just a lever but
it's<00:02:11.590> hidden<00:02:11.860> cutting<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:12.940> grass<00:02:13.209> block<00:02:13.690> so

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
it's hidden cutting this grass block so

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.420 
it's hidden cutting this grass block so
you<00:02:14.560> just<00:02:14.799> hit<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:16.120> will<00:02:16.239> open<00:02:16.390> up<00:02:16.690> and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
you just hit that it will open up and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.979 
you just hit that it will open up and
then<00:02:18.430> there's<00:02:18.910> another<00:02:19.299> door<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:21.989> obviously

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
then there's another door so obviously

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.630 
then there's another door so obviously
there's<00:02:23.319> another<00:02:23.680> step<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:25.510> look<00:02:25.720> up<00:02:25.959> here

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
there's another step you look up here

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.839 
there's another step you look up here
whatever<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.230> says<00:02:29.440> pull<00:02:29.920> lever<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.819> open

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
whatever and it says pull lever to open

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.790 
whatever and it says pull lever to open
door<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.769> hit

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
door so you hit

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.800 
door so you hit
and<00:02:35.300> then<00:02:36.300> BAM<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:37.670> piston<00:02:38.670> opens<00:02:39.150> up<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.570> fall

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
and then BAM a piston opens up you fall

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.670 
and then BAM a piston opens up you fall
in<00:02:39.930> lava<00:02:40.730> pretty<00:02:41.730> simple<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.470> these<00:02:43.470> are

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
in lava pretty simple but these are

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.310 
in lava pretty simple but these are
super<00:02:44.190> effective<00:02:44.540> especially<00:02:45.540> when<00:02:46.170> you're

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
super effective especially when you're

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.040 
super effective especially when you're
not<00:02:46.470> expecting<00:02:46.710> it<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:48.450> think<00:02:49.140> these<00:02:50.030> traps

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050
