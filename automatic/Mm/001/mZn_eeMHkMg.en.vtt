 2013 wise let me one of the best 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.820
 playstation 3 games because the story 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.680
 Dare year the characters were more 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.590
 are fit though many gold and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.670
 I do not like it at all 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.949
 soundtrack has tuned technology 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.930
 Voted gameplay find many simplistic 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.699
 That may be true but it was great 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.130
 offered throughout the game and that's why 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.410
 rightly one of the best playstation 3 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 then games is this year 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.520

 and yesterday on the third 12 2014 is lass 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.620

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.110

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.510

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.879
 at dealers this gets 4 44 eur 95 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.210

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.970
 So let it be for me as I said 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.400
 Last year one of the best games 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.720
 Do not play a friend of digital stuff 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.970
 as you know that's why I have me too 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.780
 not downloaded the dsi with elli and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.159

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.170

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.900

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.729

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.729

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.590

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.150
 great and elli by hopeless circumstances 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.009
 we have to face each other 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.020
 can rely on each other 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.720
 nameless travel through the ruins of the usa 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.450
 to survive was the extras are 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.430
 left behind single player prologue 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.329
 board territories and offers territories 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.280

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.810
 merciless mode and extra 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.469
 level of difficulty for a player 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.450
 then history then pass then stands 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.929

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.030
 many like it 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.430
 But if you are the right one here 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.319
 has people together and plays in a team 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.300

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.890

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.000

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:34.840

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:43.660
