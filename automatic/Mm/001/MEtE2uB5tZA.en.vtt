00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
not going to cause it to pill up I can

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.650 
not going to cause it to pill up I can
go<00:02:59.650> back<00:02:59.830> over<00:03:00.070> an<00:03:00.280> area<00:03:00.490> over<00:03:00.910> over<00:03:01.330> again<00:03:01.420> and

go back over an area over over again and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.730 
go back over an area over over again and
it's<00:03:01.780> going<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:01.990> be<00:03:02.050> smooth<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:03.010> cleaned<00:03:04.740> so

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.059

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
though her face had already dry I can

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:28.130 
though her face had already dry I can
just<00:03:18.730> keep<00:03:19.180> going<00:03:19.209> back<00:03:19.689> in<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.079> blending<00:03:20.530> it

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.680
