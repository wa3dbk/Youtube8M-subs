long<00:01:36.360> enough<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:38.299> have<00:01:39.299> some<00:01:39.420> pretty

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
long enough that that I have some pretty

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.120 
long enough that that I have some pretty
good<00:01:39.659> radar<00:01:40.110> when<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.590> think<00:01:40.829> things<00:01:40.950> are

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
good radar when I think things are

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.670 
good radar when I think things are
clicking<00:01:41.520> there's<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> rhythm<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.290> happens

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
clicking there's a rhythm that happens

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.350 
clicking there's a rhythm that happens
there's<00:01:43.829> dynamics<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.399> are<00:01:44.490> falling<00:01:45.240> in

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
there's dynamics that are falling in

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.870 
there's dynamics that are falling in
line<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.470> got<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.799> say<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:47.850> of

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
line but I got to say on this is one of

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.749 
line but I got to say on this is one of
the<00:01:48.030> few<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.420> were<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.369> don't<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.430> immersed

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the few we were so I don't know immersed

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.910

and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.710 
and
trying<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.729> hammer<00:01:52.880> this<00:01:53.090> thing<00:01:53.150> out<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.570> get

trying to hammer this thing out and get
it<00:01:53.810> right<00:01:54.020> because<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.590> complex<00:01:55.040> material

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
it right because it is complex material

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.800 
it right because it is complex material
