with the you know typical Star Wars

thing Reno
shows<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.470> scrolling<00:01:54.830> text<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.490> it's

about what's going on and whatnot and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.620 
about what's going on and whatnot and
I'm<00:02:00.860> assuming<00:02:01.130> print<00:02:01.520> watching<00:02:02.300> this<00:02:02.420> is

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
I'm assuming print watching this is

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.040 
I'm assuming print watching this is
familiar<00:02:02.840> with<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.200> Star<00:02:03.500> Wars<00:02:03.740> theme<00:02:04.600> now<00:02:05.600> I

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
familiar with a Star Wars theme now I

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.400 
familiar with a Star Wars theme now I
like<00:02:06.980> Star<00:02:07.460> Wars<00:02:07.760> a<00:02:07.880> lot<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.479> like<00:02:08.720> Lego<00:02:09.020> Star

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
like Star Wars a lot I like Lego Star

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.340 
like Star Wars a lot I like Lego Star
Wars<00:02:09.679> but<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.369> have<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.090> admit<00:02:11.240> this<00:02:11.690> game<00:02:12.050> I'm

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
Wars but I have to admit this game I'm

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.490 
Wars but I have to admit this game I'm
not<00:02:12.740> quite<00:02:13.250> as<00:02:13.460> big<00:02:13.970> on<00:02:14.180> as<00:02:14.540> some<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.350> other

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
not quite as big on as some of the other

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.880 
not quite as big on as some of the other
variations<00:02:16.280> like<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:17.630> know<00:02:17.780> Lego<00:02:18.170> Star<00:02:18.590> Wars

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
variations like you know Lego Star Wars

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.199 
variations like you know Lego Star Wars
for<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:20.510> Wii<00:02:20.750> or<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.230> ps3<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.180> really<00:02:23.180> I

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
for the Wii or the ps3 and really I

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.960 
for the Wii or the ps3 and really I
think<00:02:23.420> my<00:02:23.690> big<00:02:24.020> reason<00:02:24.470> for<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:25.100> just<00:02:25.820> be

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
think my big reason for that is just be

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.630 
think my big reason for that is just be
as<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.240> game<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.780> really<00:02:27.380> motion<00:02:28.040> control

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
as this game is really motion control

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.710 
as this game is really motion control
heavy<00:02:28.910> for<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.480> whole<00:02:29.660> force<00:02:30.080> aspect<00:02:30.709> and

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
heavy for the whole force aspect and

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.750 
heavy for the whole force aspect and
what<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.750> mean<00:02:32.990> by<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.860> let<00:02:34.310> me<00:02:34.430> see<00:02:34.610> if<00:02:34.700> I

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
what I mean by that is let me see if I

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.130 
what I mean by that is let me see if I
can<00:02:35.380> find<00:02:36.380> any<00:02:36.680> guys<00:02:36.920> here

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.410 

what<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.800> mean<00:02:41.010> with<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:41.970> mean<00:02:42.180> hey

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
what I mean with that is and I mean hey

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.120 
what I mean with that is and I mean hey
I<00:02:42.660> get<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.170> makes<00:02:43.380> sense<00:02:43.650> because<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.010> know

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
I get it makes sense because you know

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.180 
I get it makes sense because you know
it's<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.940> DS<00:02:45.150> version<00:02:45.270> it's<00:02:45.959> all<00:02:46.110> about<00:02:46.350> you

it's the DS version it's all about you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.949 
it's the DS version it's all about you

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
know touchscreen and whatnot

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.680 
know touchscreen and whatnot
they<00:02:49.709> know<00:02:49.770> most<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.100> other<00:02:50.190> games<00:02:50.640> like<00:02:51.090> you

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
they know most the other games like you

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.210 
they know most the other games like you

button and just use the Force on them to
move<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.310> or<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.570> move<00:02:57.780> them<00:02:58.020> in<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.470> game<00:02:58.680> you

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860

little<00:03:00.570> thing<00:03:00.810> down<00:03:00.959> here<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.410> got<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.650> move

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
little thing down here you got to move

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.880 
little thing down here you got to move
the<00:03:01.890> stylus<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:03.870> know<00:03:03.990> and<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.380> moves<00:03:04.709> them

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
the stylus you know and that moves them

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.750 
the stylus you know and that moves them
around<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:06.780> don't<00:03:07.709> know<00:03:07.800> just<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.250> me<00:03:08.400> it's

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
around and I don't know just to me it's

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.690 
around and I don't know just to me it's
tedious<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.720> be<00:03:09.840> honest<00:03:10.170> with<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.550> you<00:03:11.550> know

tedious to be honest with you you know

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.180 
tedious to be honest with you you know
maybe<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:13.020> me<00:03:13.320> or<00:03:13.500> maybe<00:03:13.680> I'm<00:03:13.920> just

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
maybe it's just me or maybe I'm just

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.090 
maybe it's just me or maybe I'm just
doing<00:03:14.520> it<00:03:14.670> wrong<00:03:15.140> but<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.350> fact<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.680> got<00:03:16.890> to

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
doing it wrong but the fact you got to

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.340 
doing it wrong but the fact you got to
be<00:03:17.700> hanging<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.030> stylus<00:03:18.600> but<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.140> know<00:03:19.260> you

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
be hanging the stylus but you know you

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.440 
be hanging the stylus but you know you
got<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.620> be<00:03:19.769> playing<00:03:20.519> your<00:03:20.640> stylus<00:03:21.209> and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
got to be playing your stylus and

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.880 
got to be playing your stylus and
tapping<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.900> touchscreen

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
tapping the touchscreen

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.670 
tapping the touchscreen
while<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.550> middle<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.880> playing<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.680> just

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
while in the middle of playing I just

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.380 
while in the middle of playing I just
don't<00:03:25.860> really<00:03:26.010> care<00:03:26.130> for<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.640> myself

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
don't really care for it myself

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.690 
don't really care for it myself
see<00:03:28.080> throwing<00:03:28.500> guys<00:03:28.680> around<00:03:29.100> they're<00:03:29.340> using

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700

see throwing guys around they're using
the<00:03:29.790> force<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:33.120> that's<00:03:33.360> probably<00:03:33.660> just

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
the force and that's probably just

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.670 
the force and that's probably just
personal<00:03:34.350> preference<00:03:34.590> but<00:03:35.010> that's<00:03:35.220> just<00:03:35.400> me

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
personal preference but that's just me

personal preference but that's just me

is<00:05:31.850> like<00:05:32.090> I<00:05:32.120> said<00:05:32.300> maybe<00:05:33.020> it's<00:05:33.289> just<00:05:33.500> me

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740

personally<00:05:34.090> but<00:05:35.090> I<00:05:35.270> find<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:35.780> motion

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
personally but I find the motion

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.260 
personally but I find the motion
controls<00:05:36.470> to<00:05:36.680> be<00:05:36.830> a<00:05:36.860> bit<00:05:37.130> more<00:05:37.700> of<00:05:37.850> a<00:05:37.910> hindrance

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
controls to be a bit more of a hindrance
