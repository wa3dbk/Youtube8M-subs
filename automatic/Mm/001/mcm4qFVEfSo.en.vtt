well<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.780> seems<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.049> little<00:01:07.080> bit<00:01:07.290> gimmicky<00:01:07.560> I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
well that seems a little bit gimmicky I

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.530 
well that seems a little bit gimmicky I
fought<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.430> too<00:01:08.640> until<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.939> realized<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.420> if

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
fought that too until I realized that if

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300 
fought that too until I realized that if
you<00:01:09.630> launch<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> building<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.010> actually

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
you launch it a building it actually

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280 
you launch it a building it actually
gets<00:01:11.430> stuck<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> wall<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:13.080> allows

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
gets stuck to the wall and this allows

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.990 
gets stuck to the wall and this allows
you<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> get<00:01:13.680> kind<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.920> crazy<00:01:14.159> lines<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.790> sight

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you to get kind of crazy lines of sight

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.789 
you to get kind of crazy lines of sight
I'm<00:01:15.240> guessing<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.110> see<00:01:16.320> Sun<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.680> your

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
I'm guessing if you see Sun in your

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.530 
I'm guessing if you see Sun in your
camera<00:01:17.070> maybe<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.549> spots<00:01:18.000> them<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.420> your

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
camera maybe it spots them for your

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.539 
camera maybe it spots them for your
teammate<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.860> right-click<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.400> well

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
teammate but you can right-click as well

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.520 
teammate but you can right-click as well
to<00:01:20.700> zoom<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.090> with<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> camera<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.409> is

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
to zoom in with the camera and this is

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.130 
to zoom in with the camera and this is
pretty<00:01:22.740> fun<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.310> I'm<00:01:24.299> kind<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.720> curious<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
pretty fun and I'm kind of curious to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.780 
pretty fun and I'm kind of curious to
see<00:01:25.290> what<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.680> could<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.460> really

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
see what this could do you can really

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.390 
see what this could do you can really
launch<00:01:27.030> these<00:01:27.330> long<00:01:27.570> distances<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.470> their<00:01:29.189> own

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
launch these long distances on their own

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.670 
launch these long distances on their own
perhaps<00:01:30.000> not<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.659> most<00:01:30.689> incredibly<00:01:31.530> useful

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
perhaps not the most incredibly useful

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.710 
perhaps not the most incredibly useful
thing<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.490> kind<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.939> sat<00:01:33.150> there<00:01:33.329> gonna<00:01:33.659> know

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
thing I kind of sat there gonna know

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.870 
thing I kind of sat there gonna know
that<00:01:33.900> well<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:34.259> seem<00:01:34.500> okay<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.700> what

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
that well they seem okay is this what

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.819 
that well they seem okay is this what
they<00:01:36.060> are<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.689> throw<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> camera<00:01:37.320> but

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
they are you know you throw a camera but

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.399 
they are you know you throw a camera but
then<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> realized<00:01:38.720> when<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.750> decided<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> hit

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
then I realized when I decided to hit

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.550 
then I realized when I decided to hit
the<00:01:40.500> ground<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.930> had<00:01:43.110> various

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the ground of one that they had various

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.719 
the ground of one that they had various
different<00:01:43.710> effects<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> don't<00:01:44.520> know<00:01:44.670> if

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
different effects now I don't know if

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.280 
different effects now I don't know if
this<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.970> an<00:01:45.060> intended<00:01:45.509> thing<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.110> could

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
this is an intended thing this could

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.690 
this is an intended thing this could
change<00:01:46.350> before<00:01:46.799> full<00:01:47.159> release<00:01:47.399> because<00:01:47.610> of

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
change before full release because of

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.670 
change before full release because of
course<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.060> unreleased<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.200> actually

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
course this is unreleased but actually

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.109 
course this is unreleased but actually
so<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:49.920> first<00:01:49.979> example<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:50.759> close<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
so in that first example it can close to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.330 
so in that first example it can close to
me<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.899> second<00:01:52.229> example<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.799> knifed<00:01:53.070> it

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
me in this second example I knifed it

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
me in this second example I knifed it
with<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.850> katana<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.780> blew<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
with the katana and it just blew the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.719 
with the katana and it just blew the
crap<00:01:55.350> out<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.560> me<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.280> might<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.520> an

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
crap out of me so that might be an

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.950 
crap out of me so that might be an
interesting<00:01:56.850> thing<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.719> could<00:01:57.840> like

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
interesting thing if you could like

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.870 
interesting thing if you could like
detonate<00:01:58.469> them<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.770> buildings<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.759> yeah

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
detonate them in buildings but yeah

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.639 
detonate them in buildings but yeah
that's<00:02:00.149> Amy's<00:02:00.600> third<00:02:00.840> eye<00:02:00.990> cameras

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
that's Amy's third eye cameras

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.459 
that's Amy's third eye cameras
anyway<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.909> next<00:02:03.210> item<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:04.409> you

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
anyway the next item we have for you

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.380 
anyway the next item we have for you
guys<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> next<00:02:05.399> thing<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.790> guess<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
guys in the next thing I guess is the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.290 
guys in the next thing I guess is the
fact<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.829> self<00:02:08.099> revive<00:02:08.520> system<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.209> in

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
fact that the self revive system is in

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.240 
fact that the self revive system is in
the<00:02:09.390> game<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.750> don't<00:02:09.929> know<00:02:10.050> Phoenix<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.800> a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the game if you don't know Phoenix is a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.000 
the game if you don't know Phoenix is a
medic<00:02:11.760> kinetic<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.450> revive

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
medic kinetic you can revive

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.710 
medic kinetic you can revive
himself<00:02:13.340> as<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.939> can<00:02:14.060> see<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.450> was<00:02:14.629> able

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
himself as you can see here I was able

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.449 
himself as you can see here I was able
to<00:02:14.870> get<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.080> working<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:15.680> game<00:02:15.890> with<00:02:16.069> phantom

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
to get this working in game with phantom

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.539 
to get this working in game with phantom
by<00:02:16.790> using<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.299> magic<00:02:17.629> of<00:02:17.720> commands<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:19.430> this

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
by using the magic of commands and this

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.610 
by using the magic of commands and this
is<00:02:19.670> kind<00:02:19.879> of<00:02:19.909> interesting<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:21.560> is

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
is kind of interesting that this is

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.050 
is kind of interesting that this is
already<00:02:21.980> here<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.250> lot<00:02:22.459> of<00:02:22.519> people<00:02:22.730> speculate

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
already here a lot of people speculate

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.940 
already here a lot of people speculate
and<00:02:23.360> maybe<00:02:23.569> Phoenix<00:02:24.170> will<00:02:24.349> be<00:02:24.439> next<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.920> think

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
and maybe Phoenix will be next I think

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.160 
and maybe Phoenix will be next I think
personally<00:02:25.760> I'll<00:02:25.849> probably<00:02:26.090> be<00:02:26.390> turtle<00:02:26.930> then

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
personally I'll probably be turtle then

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.250 
personally I'll probably be turtle then
Phoenix<00:02:27.650> but<00:02:28.340> yeah<00:02:28.909> this<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.209> now<00:02:29.450> active<00:02:29.989> in

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
Phoenix but yeah this is now active in

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.319 
Phoenix but yeah this is now active in
the<00:02:30.379> game<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:30.890> yeah<00:02:31.159> self<00:02:31.579> reviving<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.299> a

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
the game so yeah self reviving is a

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.839 
the game so yeah self reviving is a
thing<00:02:32.659> definitely<00:02:32.959> back<00:02:33.610> one<00:02:34.610> would<00:02:34.730> assume

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
thing definitely back one would assume

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.660 
thing definitely back one would assume
and<00:02:35.299> you<00:02:35.870> know<00:02:35.989> it's<00:02:36.170> there<00:02:36.459> anyway<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.579> next

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
and you know it's there anyway the next

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.309 
and you know it's there anyway the next
good<00:02:37.970> thing<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.299> have<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.540> show<00:02:38.659> you<00:02:38.720> guys<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.260> a

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
good thing I have to show you guys is a

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.979 
good thing I have to show you guys is a
unreleased<00:02:40.129> sniper<00:02:40.670> rifle<00:02:41.209> now<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.720> want<00:02:41.900> to

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
unreleased sniper rifle now I want to

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.170 
unreleased sniper rifle now I want to
speculate<00:02:42.439> this<00:02:42.739> might<00:02:43.040> be<00:02:43.220> for<00:02:43.430> red<00:02:43.670> eye<00:02:43.700> who

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
speculate this might be for red eye who

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.979 
speculate this might be for red eye who
is<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.420> recon<00:02:45.019> class<00:02:45.319> with<00:02:45.680> infrared<00:02:46.099> vision

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
is a recon class with infrared vision

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.240 
is a recon class with infrared vision
the<00:02:47.989> reason<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.290> speculate<00:02:48.799> this<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.069> because

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
the reason I speculate this is because

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.099 
the reason I speculate this is because
he's<00:02:49.370> not<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:50.239> my<00:02:50.359> knowledge<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.870> kind<00:02:51.019> of

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
he's not to my knowledge the kind of

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.080 
he's not to my knowledge the kind of
traditional<00:02:51.260> recon<00:02:51.980> class<00:02:52.099> wanted<00:02:53.030> this

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
traditional recon class wanted this

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.460 
traditional recon class wanted this
interest<00:02:53.450> are<00:02:53.569> worth<00:02:53.720> noting<00:02:53.930> about<00:02:54.170> this

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
interest are worth noting about this

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.259 
interest are worth noting about this
sniper<00:02:54.650> rifle<00:02:55.190> is<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.310> fact<00:02:55.579> it<00:02:55.700> doesn't<00:02:55.790> have

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
sniper rifle is the fact it doesn't have

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.300 
sniper rifle is the fact it doesn't have
a<00:02:56.299> scope<00:02:56.780> whilst<00:02:57.409> when<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:57.709> spawn<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.099> other

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
a scope whilst when you spawn the other

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.399 
a scope whilst when you spawn the other
sniper<00:02:58.639> rifles<00:02:59.269> in<00:02:59.420> this<00:02:59.659> kind<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.049> I<00:03:00.260> guess

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
sniper rifles in this kind of I guess

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.220 
sniper rifles in this kind of I guess
arena<00:03:01.040> in<00:03:01.400> offline<00:03:01.700> mode<00:03:01.819> and<00:03:02.329> they<00:03:02.989> don't

arena in offline mode and they don't

arena in offline mode and they don't
have<00:03:03.379> scopes<00:03:03.709> either<00:03:03.920> when<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:04.280> aim<00:03:04.549> down

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
have scopes either when you aim down

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.580 
have scopes either when you aim down
sights<00:03:05.090> with<00:03:05.329> them<00:03:05.540> they<00:03:05.750> glitch<00:03:06.019> out<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.319> lot

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
sights with them they glitch out a lot

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.020 
sights with them they glitch out a lot
whereas<00:03:06.920> with<00:03:07.069> this<00:03:07.190> one<00:03:07.459> when<00:03:07.609> I<00:03:07.700> iron

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
whereas with this one when I iron

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.449 
whereas with this one when I iron
sighted<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:09.139> aim<00:03:09.530> down<00:03:09.709> sights<00:03:10.010> perfectly

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
sighted it aim down sights perfectly

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.890 
sighted it aim down sights perfectly
fine<00:03:10.670> which<00:03:10.879> leads<00:03:11.120> me<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.269> speculate<00:03:11.870> that

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
fine which leads me to speculate that

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.449 
fine which leads me to speculate that
this<00:03:12.079> might<00:03:12.230> be<00:03:12.260> some<00:03:12.530> kind<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.829> marksman

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
this might be some kind of marksman

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.369 
this might be some kind of marksman
rifle<00:03:13.819> of<00:03:13.940> sorts<00:03:14.299> whereby<00:03:14.989> it's<00:03:15.260> a

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
rifle of sorts whereby it's a

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.289 
rifle of sorts whereby it's a
semi-automatic<00:03:15.950> sniper<00:03:16.250> rifle<00:03:16.879> but<00:03:17.060> that

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
semi-automatic sniper rifle but that

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.059 
semi-automatic sniper rifle but that
uses<00:03:17.660> iron<00:03:17.900> sights<00:03:18.169> so<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.680> could<00:03:18.799> be<00:03:18.889> pretty

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
uses iron sights so that could be pretty

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.349 
uses iron sights so that could be pretty
interesting<00:03:19.099> and<00:03:19.639> it<00:03:19.730> really<00:03:19.910> did<00:03:20.060> pack<00:03:20.329> a

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
interesting and it really did pack a

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.420 
interesting and it really did pack a
punch<00:03:20.690> so<00:03:21.379> the<00:03:21.470> next<00:03:21.650> item<00:03:21.829> I<00:03:22.040> have<00:03:22.250> for<00:03:22.370> you

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
clip size in the game so keep an eye out

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:57.640 
clip size in the game so keep an eye out
for<00:03:57.079> this<00:03:57.230> one

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
for this one

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.379 
for this one
not<00:03:58.069> sure<00:03:58.250> which<00:03:58.370> mercs<00:03:58.730> it<00:03:58.909> could<00:03:59.060> be<00:03:59.120> coming

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
not sure which mercs it could be coming

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.330 
not sure which mercs it could be coming
for<00:03:59.599> i'd<00:03:59.870> like<00:04:00.049> to<00:04:00.079> speculate<00:04:00.500> maybe<00:04:00.859> thunder

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
for i'd like to speculate maybe thunder

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.869 
for i'd like to speculate maybe thunder
but<00:04:01.489> i<00:04:01.519> guess<00:04:01.819> time<00:04:02.449> will<00:04:02.720> tell

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
but i guess time will tell

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.399 
but i guess time will tell
so<00:04:04.879> the<00:04:05.000> penultimate<00:04:05.329> item<00:04:05.900> i<00:04:05.989> have<00:04:06.169> to<00:04:06.260> show

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
so the penultimate item i have to show

you guys is this blade bounzer which

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.939 
you guys is this blade bounzer which
you're<00:04:08.989> gonna<00:04:09.049> look<00:04:09.290> at<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:09.590> oh<00:04:09.680> well<00:04:09.829> this

you're gonna look at and oh well this

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.830 
you're gonna look at and oh well this
looks<00:04:10.129> very<00:04:10.280> very<00:04:10.549> familiar<00:04:11.120> why<00:04:11.299> show<00:04:11.629> me

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
looks very very familiar why show me

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.360 
looks very very familiar why show me
neither<00:04:12.109> snake<00:04:12.470> launch<00:04:12.739> and<00:04:12.949> well<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.129> reason

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
neither snake launch and well the reason

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.250 
neither snake launch and well the reason
I'm<00:04:13.459> showing<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:13.909> is<00:04:14.030> because<00:04:14.060> that<00:04:14.359> this<00:04:14.750> is<00:04:15.199> a

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
I'm showing it is because that this is a

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.560 
I'm showing it is because that this is a
weapon<00:04:15.590> not<00:04:16.010> an<00:04:16.130> ability<00:04:16.400> as<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.269> can<00:04:17.389> see<00:04:17.510> it

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
weapon not an ability as you can see it

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.120 
weapon not an ability as you can see it
has<00:04:17.659> a<00:04:17.690> different<00:04:17.810> reload<00:04:18.409> animation<00:04:18.979> to

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
has a different reload animation to

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.949 
has a different reload animation to
needest<00:04:19.519> thing<00:04:19.729> and<00:04:19.909> you'll<00:04:20.239> also<00:04:20.419> notice<00:04:20.570> it

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
needest thing and you'll also notice it

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:21.910 
needest thing and you'll also notice it
as<00:04:21.049> an<00:04:21.139> arrow<00:04:21.409> count

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
as an arrow count

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.260 
as an arrow count
the<00:04:22.040> bottom-right<00:04:22.520> so<00:04:22.670> this<00:04:22.820> seems<00:04:23.090> to

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
the bottom-right so this seems to

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.900 
the bottom-right so this seems to
suggest<00:04:23.450> that<00:04:23.840> as<00:04:23.960> some<00:04:24.200> point<00:04:24.380> leaders

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
suggest that as some point leaders

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.370 
suggest that as some point leaders
grenade<00:04:25.910> launcher<00:04:26.330> wasn't<00:04:26.720> an<00:04:26.780> ability<00:04:27.020> at

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
grenade launcher wasn't an ability at

grenade launcher wasn't an ability at
all<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:27.740> instead<00:04:28.070> it<00:04:28.220> was<00:04:28.250> a<00:04:28.640> weapon<00:04:29.240> of<00:04:29.750> that

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
all and instead it was a weapon of that

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.540 
all and instead it was a weapon of that
kind<00:04:30.260> of<00:04:30.320> limited<00:04:30.680> ammo<00:04:30.800> supply<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.460> was

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
kind of limited ammo supply and was

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.280 
kind of limited ammo supply and was
properly<00:04:31.880> changed<00:04:32.300> at<00:04:32.390> balancing<00:04:32.810> classes

some<00:04:33.530> point<00:04:33.800> early<00:04:34.130> on<00:04:34.160> in<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.550> game<00:04:34.700> cycle<00:04:35.590> as

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
some point early on in the game cycle as

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.170 
some point early on in the game cycle as
you<00:04:36.710> can<00:04:36.830> see<00:04:36.980> here<00:04:37.190> I<00:04:37.310> believe<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.060> model

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
you can see here I believe the model

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.820 
you can see here I believe the model
looks<00:04:38.450> slightly<00:04:38.750> different<00:04:39.260> to<00:04:39.320> how<00:04:39.500> it<00:04:39.530> does

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
looks slightly different to how it does

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.080 
looks slightly different to how it does
now<00:04:40.040> obviously<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:40.490> has<00:04:40.580> that<00:04:40.730> different

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
now obviously it has that different

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.880 
now obviously it has that different
reload<00:04:41.330> animation<00:04:41.840> you<00:04:42.230> could<00:04:42.410> get<00:04:42.560> ammo<00:04:42.770> from

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
reload animation you could get ammo from

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.380 
reload animation you could get ammo from
the<00:04:43.070> ammo<00:04:43.280> box<00:04:43.520> but<00:04:43.700> I<00:04:43.730> wanted<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.060> show<00:04:44.240> this

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
the ammo box but I wanted to show this

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.520 
the ammo box but I wanted to show this
just<00:04:44.600> because<00:04:44.750> it's<00:04:44.870> something<00:04:45.200> a<00:04:45.260> little<00:04:45.440> bit

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
just because it's something a little bit

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.230 
just because it's something a little bit
interesting<00:04:46.040> and<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:46.370> guess<00:04:46.550> a<00:04:46.580> lot<00:04:46.820> of<00:04:46.850> F<00:04:47.000> dirty

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
interesting and I guess a lot of F dirty

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.870 
interesting and I guess a lot of F dirty
bomb<00:04:47.510> history<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.890> the<00:04:48.980> final<00:04:49.340> item<00:04:49.550> I<00:04:49.850> have

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
bomb history and the final item I have

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.370 
bomb history and the final item I have
to<00:04:50.090> show<00:04:50.360> you<00:04:50.390> guys<00:04:50.540> is<00:04:50.900> one<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.260> I<00:04:51.320> could

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
to show you guys is one that I could

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.590 
to show you guys is one that I could
spawn<00:04:51.770> him<00:04:51.950> by<00:04:52.070> typing<00:04:52.580> in<00:04:52.700> hacking<00:04:53.270> device

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
spawn him by typing in hacking device

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.400 
spawn him by typing in hacking device
now<00:04:54.460> it's<00:04:55.460> not<00:04:55.640> textured<00:04:56.240> is<00:04:56.420> buggy<00:04:57.020> as<00:04:57.230> house

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
now it's not textured is buggy as house

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.810 
now it's not textured is buggy as house
you<00:04:57.560> can<00:04:57.680> see<00:04:57.800> on<00:04:57.890> my<00:04:57.980> screen<00:04:58.010> I<00:04:58.520> don't<00:04:58.760> know

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
you can see on my screen I don't know

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.390 
you can see on my screen I don't know
what<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.120> does<00:04:59.420> are<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:00.530> try<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:00.920> look<00:05:01.220> into

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
what it does are you try to look into

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.920 
what it does are you try to look into
this<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:01.790> I<00:05:01.910> kind<00:05:02.390> of<00:05:02.420> thought<00:05:02.540> well<00:05:02.720> maybe

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
this and I kind of thought well maybe

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.690 
this and I kind of thought well maybe
it's<00:05:03.140> just<00:05:03.230> the<00:05:03.440> device<00:05:03.740> that<00:05:03.950> engineers<00:05:04.430> used

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
it's just the device that engineers used

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.850 
it's just the device that engineers used
to<00:05:04.820> defuse<00:05:05.180> items<00:05:05.660> but<00:05:06.020> I<00:05:06.200> could<00:05:06.590> spawn<00:05:06.800> that

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
to defuse items but I could spawn that

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.180 
to defuse items but I could spawn that
in<00:05:07.130> by<00:05:07.280> typing<00:05:07.520> in<00:05:07.820> PDAs<00:05:08.660> 0<00:05:09.020> underscore<00:05:09.560> 0<00:05:09.800> 1

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
in by typing in PDAs 0 underscore 0 1

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.400 
in by typing in PDAs 0 underscore 0 1
which<00:05:10.880> leads<00:05:11.120> me<00:05:11.270> to<00:05:11.300> think<00:05:11.600> this<00:05:11.690> might<00:05:11.990> be

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
which leads me to think this might be

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.500 
which leads me to think this might be
its<00:05:12.860> own<00:05:13.010> item<00:05:13.490> in<00:05:13.580> which<00:05:13.700> case<00:05:13.940> I<00:05:14.150> don't<00:05:14.420> know

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
its own item in which case I don't know

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.420 
its own item in which case I don't know
what<00:05:14.660> it<00:05:14.780> does<00:05:14.990> I'd<00:05:15.200> speculate<00:05:15.830> maybe<00:05:16.070> you<00:05:16.280> can

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
what it does I'd speculate maybe you can

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.700 
what it does I'd speculate maybe you can
hack<00:05:16.610> mines<00:05:17.000> and<00:05:17.300> turrets<00:05:17.570> with<00:05:17.720> it<00:05:17.840> as<00:05:18.110> I<00:05:18.500> said

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
hack mines and turrets with it as I said

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.170 
hack mines and turrets with it as I said
I<00:05:18.770> did<00:05:18.920> a<00:05:18.950> little<00:05:19.190> bit<00:05:19.280> of<00:05:19.370> googling<00:05:19.640> really

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
I did a little bit of googling really

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.730 
I did a little bit of googling really
couldn't<00:05:20.420> find<00:05:20.600> anything<00:05:20.960> about<00:05:21.080> this<00:05:21.410> if<00:05:21.590> you
