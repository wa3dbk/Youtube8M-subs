millimeters<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:52.770> material<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> case

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
millimeters the material that the case

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.420 
millimeters the material that the case
is<00:00:54.030> made<00:00:54.210> out<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.170> black<00:00:55.559> PVD<00:00:56.280> finish

is made out of is on a black PVD finish
stainless<00:00:57.329> steel<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.899> kind<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.170> hard<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
stainless steel so it's kind of hard to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.170 
stainless steel so it's kind of hard to
get<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> picture<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.120> so

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
get a picture of it because it's so

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.380 
get a picture of it because it's so

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.369 
everyday wear I usually wear g-shock but
um<00:02:38.889> this<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.609> one<00:02:39.849> out<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.030> my<00:02:40.209> two<00:02:40.379> higher-end

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
um this is one out of my two higher-end

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.809 
um this is one out of my two higher-end
watches<00:02:41.859> that<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.099> own<00:02:42.370> at<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.700> moment<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:45.310> I

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
watches that I own at the moment and I

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.259 
watches that I own at the moment and I
