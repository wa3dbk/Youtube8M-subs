00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.540
 Hello, I'm a movie nose and welcome 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.730
 to my channel 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.769
 in this master class you will see how 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.200
 make a smooth geometric pattern with 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.440
 color transition and perform earrings in 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.270
 account form stay with me in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.830
 work I will use yellow and 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.949
 red polymer clay 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.910
 rolling pin and pasta machine stationery knife 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.010
 or blade metal tins 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.210
 metal modeling tool 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.739
 accessories and tools for assembly and 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:40.739
 also a super glue file 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.960
 gloss polish and paint brush well 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.520
 I crush polymer clay before work 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.610
 I chose a color that I will use 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.860
 as a base and roll out big 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.190
 about 1 millimeter thick 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.730
 lay a hole in the direction of taking two colors 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.350
 cut triangles out of them and fold 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.930
 in such a way that turned out 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.960
 two-color rectangle separating 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.010
 colors diagonally cut 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.930
 a rectangle into 4 pieces and each of 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.630
 parts mix thoroughly to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.210
 we got uniform colors for this row 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.490
 add pure red and pure yellow and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.009
 I get a palette with the transition 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.650
 colors each of these pieces 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.080
 we roll a layer about 1 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.259
 millimeter all layers should have 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.869
 the same thickness take one of the pieces 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.710
 and on the line do serifs from two sides 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.020
 two millimeters 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.250
 carefully cut the same strips 2 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.250
 millimeter wide 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.000
 in the same way on the line I do 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:56.950
 serifs on the next color and cut 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.900
 this light on the same stripes in 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.130
 As a result, I get a lot 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.920
 identical strips 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.960
 different colors and these strips i will 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.910
 stack in a row from prepared 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.180
 red stratum i cut off 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.570
 a small piece and fold the strips on 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.240
 I do it very carefully alternate 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.150
 colors to make a smooth transition 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.220
 colors of color stripes more precisely shades 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.470
 must be different from each other in order to 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.750
 then we could see the geometric 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.640
 drawing small cells at work 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.920
 you can help yourself modeling 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.080
 smooth tool strips to each 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.900
 to a friend and when I laid out all the strips 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.350
 you can trim them a little with a rolling pin 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.710
 rolling in the direction of these strips to 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.950
 not to deform the pattern I have turned 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.680
 flat smooth striped surface all 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.440
 the strips lie one to the other gaps 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.350
 between them there is no after this 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.110
 the surface i also cut into exactly 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.350
 the same strips of two millimeters and 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.020
 do it along my color junction 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.680
 It turns out a lot of stripes with small 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.080
 the cells take a piece of red base 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.900
 colors and very neatly starting 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.060
 lay out cell stripes here 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.130
 strips need to be laid in this way 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.170
 to make a small shift 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.870
 if you did everything right and 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.450
 neatly the cells will be smooth and 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.000
 the same and you can lay out 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.430
 smooth beautiful pattern I post 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.459
 strips in such a way that turned out 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.980
 zigzag and of course the size of the surface 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.110
 this canvas should be such that 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.000
 it was possible to cut it further 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.520
 metal mold that is, he should 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.680
 be a little more of your forms 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.590
 As a result, I got this 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.549
 canvas is one of the varieties 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.590
 bargello technique 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.930
 very neatly with a rolling pin I level 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.329
 the surface is by no means much 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.790
 pressure otherwise drawing may float 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.409
 in different directions to us this is absolutely not 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.069
 need one canvas 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:03.560
 This is one future earring 2 earrings need 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.739
 do so separately so that 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.049
 need to do another second 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.079
 the same canvas so that the surface does not 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.389
 stuck to the rolling pin and not to hurt 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.910
 I enclose it when rolling 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:18.680
 tracing paper she will do 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.769
 the surface of the canvas is smoother and 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.570
 velvety I impose this canvas on 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.270
 another layer of foundation 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.699
 to make an earring a little bit thicker and 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.580
 just as smoothing leveled 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:34.400
 the surface all layers must be tight 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.830
 glued together I take the metal 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.990
 shield shape aiming to cut 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.310
 exactly the picture that I want 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.720
 and press on top 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.720
 getting a shape out of shape 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.490
 I make additional earrings 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.120
 small balls of red color from 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.120
 polymer clay 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.920
 cut off a piece of red base 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.660
 about 1 millimeter thick and cut out 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.480
 of which a long strip 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.480
 the width of the strip is equal to the height of the earring and 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.870
 pasted this shield from all sides 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.820
 red stripe 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.220
 gently level the strip 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.470
 follow the modeling tool to 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.720
 there were no big gaps to 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.720
 the strip fits snugly to the base 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.970
 also before baking case holes in 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.250
 red bead and shield and put everything in 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.230
 oven temperature and long 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.790
 roasting look at the packaging of 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:53.440
 polymer clay from which you sculpt 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.170
 after baking you need a little bit 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.030
 trim trim earrings it 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:02.110
 can be made by grinding 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:05.530
 nozzles with a drill or a regular nail file for 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.630
 nail or sanding sheet after 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.550
 grinding must be washed with 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.919
 polymer clay and either good 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.500
 wipe with wet wipes so as not to 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.960
 no dust left and when the parts 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.080
 dry out can be varnished for 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.370
 coatings I chose a glossy varnish 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.660
 I paint over the side first 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.780
 then facial 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.610
 waiting for it to dry after which 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.310
 overturn the earring and cover 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.850
 back side and just waiting when she 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.850
 dry out 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:41.509
 when the varnish is dry you can collect 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.990
 jewelry I string the bead on the pin 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:47.840
 pin dunk glue and quickly insert it 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.990
 in the hole in the earrings do the same thing 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.930
 and with the second earring fastening the fasteners at 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.930
 help pliers and earrings ready 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.750
 I have got earrings in the form of bills 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.340
 with a beautiful geometric pattern 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.710
 cells with a smooth color transition 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.870
 slight shift in drawing 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.030
 made an interesting zigzag 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.760
 drawing is the most important when compiling 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:19.250
 this picture of course accuracy 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.590
 the neater and more accurate you do 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.960
 cells are obtained more beautiful 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.870
 the result is of course in work you can 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.820
 use absolutely any colors but 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.000
 it is desirable to pick up those who 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.740
 beautiful combined with each other 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.450
 You can also choose any mix 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.330
 no other form is necessary 

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:40.100
 it is the shield I wish you creative success 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.169
 and inspiration 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.750
 if you like this technique not 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:46.160
 skip the other master classes 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.850
 made in the volumetric technique 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.460
 bargello 

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.200
 This is a spring pendant master class as well 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.050
 master class making beautiful 

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.389
 earrings write your comments
