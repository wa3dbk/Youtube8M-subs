00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
do so the very first place to start is

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.150 
do so the very first place to start is
of<00:00:19.700> course<00:00:19.970> safety<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:21.080> while<00:00:21.410> I<00:00:21.439> can't<00:00:21.860> give

ladder against the stack itself what

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.459 
ladder against the stack itself what
this<00:01:25.310> means<00:01:25.639> is<00:01:25.909> that<00:01:25.939> I<00:01:26.270> can<00:01:26.509> pass<00:01:26.719> rubble<00:01:27.229> or

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
complete safety okay let's just have a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.940 
complete safety okay let's just have a
little<00:01:35.600> look<00:01:35.749> down<00:01:36.139> the<00:01:36.319> chimney<00:01:36.709> stack

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
little look down the chimney stack

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.520 
little look down the chimney stack
itself<00:01:37.369> by<00:01:37.880> poking<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.630> camera<00:01:39.079> down<00:01:39.319> the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
itself by poking the camera down the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.669 
itself by poking the camera down the
flue<00:01:39.789> now<00:01:40.789> this<00:01:41.030> flue<00:01:41.299> is<00:01:41.539> actually<00:01:42.109> disused

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
flue now this flue is actually disused

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.550 
flue now this flue is actually disused
and<00:01:43.009> has<00:01:43.399> been<00:01:43.609> bricked<00:01:43.880> up<00:01:44.179> inside<00:01:44.659> plastered

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
and has been bricked up inside plastered

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.399 
and has been bricked up inside plastered
and<00:01:45.740> decorated<00:01:46.639> as<00:01:46.819> well<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:47.689> what<00:01:47.899> I<00:01:47.929> don't

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
and decorated as well so what I don't

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.499 
and decorated as well so what I don't
want<00:01:48.679> to<00:01:48.859> happen<00:01:49.039> here<00:01:49.399> is<00:01:49.579> to<00:01:49.939> drop<00:01:50.149> bricks

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
want to happen here is to drop bricks

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.260 
want to happen here is to drop bricks
rubble<00:01:51.139> or<00:01:51.289> lots<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.950> dust<00:01:52.249> down<00:01:52.639> this<00:01:52.939> flue

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
rubble or lots of dust down this flue

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.449 
rubble or lots of dust down this flue
and<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.929> reason<00:01:54.380> for<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:54.709> is<00:01:54.979> there's<00:01:55.369> no

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
and the reason for that is there's no

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.209 
and the reason for that is there's no
way<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:55.969> clean<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.630> out<00:01:56.810> afterwards<00:01:57.469> and<00:01:57.709> if<00:01:58.069> I

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
way to clean it out afterwards and if I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.519 
way to clean it out afterwards and if I
were<00:01:58.429> to<00:01:58.670> drop<00:01:58.880> debris<00:01:59.359> down<00:01:59.630> here<00:01:59.959> I'll<00:02:00.109> risk

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:00.529 
were to drop debris down here I'll risk

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:03.339 
were to drop debris down here I'll risk
a<00:02:00.740> small<00:02:01.100> pile<00:02:01.399> of<00:02:01.609> old<00:02:01.789> mortar<00:02:02.349> potentially

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
turf launching for example so what I'm

turf launching for example so what I'm
going<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.000> do<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.480> smash<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.140> pot<00:02:53.350> up<00:02:53.620> with<00:02:54.100> a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
going to do is smash the pot up with a

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.700 
going to do is smash the pot up with a
basic<00:02:54.430> claw<00:02:54.910> hammer<00:02:55.210> I've<00:02:55.570> found<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.500> easiest

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
basic claw hammer I've found the easiest

way<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.280> do<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:58.000> tap<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.750> top<00:02:58.990> of<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.320> pot

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
way to do this is tap the top of the pot

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.770 
way to do this is tap the top of the pot
gently<00:02:59.830> but<00:03:00.400> firmly<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:01.150> an<00:03:01.330> outside

gently but firmly in an outside
direction<00:03:02.560> if<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.460> have<00:03:03.670> an<00:03:03.820> old<00:03:03.970> stack<00:03:04.300> like

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
direction if you have an old stack like

direction if you have an old stack like
this<00:03:04.840> however<00:03:05.080> with<00:03:05.680> more<00:03:05.920> turf<00:03:06.190> launching

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
this however with more turf launching

between<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.240> pots<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:08.110> can<00:03:08.140> either<00:03:08.440> break<00:03:08.830> up

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
between the pots you can either break up

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.550 
between the pots you can either break up
the<00:03:09.280> pots<00:03:09.520> or<00:03:09.790> remove<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.720> old<00:03:10.900> flan<00:03:11.230> Ching

it one of the safest ways I found of

doing this is to carefully Drive a
