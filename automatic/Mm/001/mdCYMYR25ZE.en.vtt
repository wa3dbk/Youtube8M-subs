00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 to us in doing things well 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.880
 formative at our rhythm symbols the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.370
 crazy and trying to classify the team 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.360
 has known in relation to the 11 that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.980
 you have thought 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.980
 ricardo will be titular centurion 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.439
 Thank God 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.529
 level 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:52.629
 although its absence is important 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:56.230
 surely all the 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:01.860
 they are not one hundred percent always 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.860
 sure I prefer that today surely 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:11.960
 to see how it feels until tomorrow 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.960
 we will know a breath we would see 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.090
 play they think is the ideal match for 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.550
 can do it 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.550
 by the way of playing 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.880
 but play in your field 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.540
 but play simple like our feet 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.540
 different 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.170
 so let's be smart people 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.790
 simple work 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.820
 Independent 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.530
 who plays in another direction 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.690
 the variation is now more 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.100
 I say as much as it seems, although 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.640
 party and the independent authority in 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.240
 the recent past 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.069
 that year could not be like that 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.450
 it would be important were visuals a point 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.670
 and only always the way not the ways 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.720
 if you really do not cover a slope 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.780
 the game is better 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.990
 cadastre world welcome 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.770
 today in the preview we will be fine 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.090
 stopped well ordered we will be 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.280
 prepared to be able 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.599
 we order and on that basis recover the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.140
 ball to be able to go out and be able 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.140
 remove it 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.670
 gave a short week is a week 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:47.879
 previous of the classic for other the player 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.879
 that has to go down a little bit more 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.599
 the issue of care recovery 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.599
 it is very important to rest well 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.650
 this week of the fourth in a few weeks 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.270
 where we say a lot to recover and 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.330
 We need the manners of God 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.310
 I have not spent for 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:17.340
 very important decision shows there is 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:20.849
 impose as such to not be a player 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.220
 at his level and his funeral it is important 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.690
 court but basically the sack in 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.670
 this ranking practically 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:42.580
 and that gives us peace of mind 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:42.580
 so we do not know why 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.459
 just to the east was web of how well 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.200
 I was julia and wanted to ask 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.989
 although you're not going to confirm the team 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.940
 if the doubts pass by union centurion to 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.940
 egg acevedo those raw series 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.760
 no but I do not know yet 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.480
 well that goes for independent I have a 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.430
 idea 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.590
 the course of the day expressing a little 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.819
 more but I 'll tell you again that it 's in 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.819
 all those levels then 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.120
 operation and we have to be 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.510
 smart to say what we 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.299
 It is better to do 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.430
 and if I 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.409
 change after the game and have the 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.790
 important change like the one we're 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.500
 having so that the coma 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.820
 but staff is the most 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.820
 important to choose 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.150
 what is that 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.710
 It is an important significance now no 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.160
 it means 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.220
 on the fifth date 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.930
 in one way to another does not mean anything 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.600
 I've had to lead matches in the 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.880
 which 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.120
 the goal of the year was closing a 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.400
 descent or a promotion or promotion 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:57.190
 for me they are much more important today 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.190
 logically if for now 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.550
 we are served for the largest 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.220
 a few weeks ago he said he is 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.680
 centurion to make headlines such 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.780
 maybe accommodate will continue to buy be a 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.940
 little more to the idea of the system and to 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.310
 style of the game that I had 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.220
 you think you are already understanding that the 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.910
 another day the first time 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.910
 what are you missing 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.280
 he worked very well he had an injury 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:34.560
 then they can conjugate 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:37.560
 the kitchen works but contains the 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.560
 team
