00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.510
 good 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.180
 ah 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.630
 I will explain in this video about 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.599
 simple but very useful exercises 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.140
 Stretching and mobilization for the area 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.140
 cervical 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.760
 so they are very important and 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.450
 I say that now, nothing more to start 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.630
 keep the shoulder girdle 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.060
 well fixed down because if I 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.150
 I want to stretch my neck to one side and 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.629
 the shoulder accompanies me I will not do more than 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.250
 move the rope from one side to the other 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.460
 I have to be able to fix the shoulder 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.329
 fix it to be able to stretch from the other side 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.150
 that is me on the shoulder down and now 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.000
 style 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.000
 contracting the dorsal muscles 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.960
 we fix the shoulder down then 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.170
 let's start 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.170
 doing some lateral movements 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.060
 on both sides 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.540
 we can make them 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.540
 the same but the downward 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.140
 with the head in slight flexion go 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.140
 and we can perform the same exercises 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.970
 also leaving the shoulder and carrying the 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.650
 head back and one side 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.090
 there we can 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.400
 explore different degrees of rotation what 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.030
 same to the other side we set the 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.570
 shoulder and 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.570
 and if we throw 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.220
 is to explore the different degrees 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.610
 to arrive from different fascicles 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:17.570
 different areas of the muscles we can 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.570
 also make some self-mobilizations 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.790
 action 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.790
 / world 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.720
 we can tilt and 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.560
 mayoral extension reflection 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.260
 so that 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.260
 very indicated 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.060
 Y 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.670
 good and this is all I wanted 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.190

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.550

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.739
 Y 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.940
