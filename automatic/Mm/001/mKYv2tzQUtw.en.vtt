00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
palpitations we typically use a monitor

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
24 hours but as Sarah will attest

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.780 
24 hours but as Sarah will attest
sometimes<00:01:05.140> we<00:01:05.409> we<00:01:05.770> don't<00:01:05.979> get<00:01:06.250> symptoms<00:01:06.700> in

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
this 24 hour period and so we move to a

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.960 
this 24 hour period and so we move to a
more<00:01:10.689> accurate<00:01:10.990> device<00:01:11.439> which<00:01:11.979> is<00:01:12.189> patient

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
more accurate device which is patient

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.570 
more accurate device which is patient
activated<00:01:13.689> and<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:14.500> event<00:01:14.830> monitor<00:01:15.250> it's<00:01:15.430> the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
activated and the event monitor it's the

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.730 
activated and the event monitor it's the
simple<00:01:16.000> little<00:01:16.210> device<00:01:16.299> and<00:01:16.750> when<00:01:17.320> Sarah's

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
simple little device and when Sarah's

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.130 
simple little device and when Sarah's
actually<00:01:18.250> having<00:01:18.610> symptoms<00:01:18.909> she<00:01:19.630> holds<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.020> up

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
actually having symptoms she holds it up

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.840 
actually having symptoms she holds it up

irritates it and causes our heart to
skip<00:03:46.400> beats<00:03:46.639> and<00:03:46.910> all<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.150> symptoms<00:03:47.389> that

it's<00:03:58.220> being<00:03:58.459> pumped<00:03:58.730> off<00:03:58.940> into<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.299> lungs

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
it's being pumped off into the lungs

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.420 
it's being pumped off into the lungs
it's<00:03:59.810> getting<00:04:00.049> oxygenated<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:00.950> then<00:04:01.310> it's

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
it's getting oxygenated and then it's

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.160 
it's getting oxygenated and then it's
collected<00:04:01.970> in<00:04:02.060> this<00:04:02.150> left<00:04:02.480> upper<00:04:02.840> chamber

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
collected in this left upper chamber

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.900 
collected in this left upper chamber
called<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.440> left<00:04:03.590> atrium<00:04:04.040> it<00:04:04.400> goes<00:04:04.609> down

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
called the left atrium it goes down

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.819 
called the left atrium it goes down
through<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.329> saloon<00:04:05.690> doors<00:04:05.959> into<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.650> left

through the saloon doors into the left

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.080 
through the saloon doors into the left
ventricle<00:04:06.889> and<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.430> gets<00:04:07.609> pumped<00:04:07.849> out<00:04:08.030> to

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
ventricle and that gets pumped out to

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.789 
ventricle and that gets pumped out to
the<00:04:08.209> brain<00:04:08.450> in<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.599> rest<00:04:08.750> of<00:04:08.840> our<00:04:08.930> body<00:04:09.079> if<00:04:09.680> you

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
the brain in the rest of our body if you

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.259 
the brain in the rest of our body if you
come<00:04:09.950> over<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.099> the<00:04:10.190> right<00:04:10.400> you'll<00:04:10.970> see<00:04:11.060> the

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
come over to the right you'll see the

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.940 
come over to the right you'll see the

same process coming to the right side to

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.979 
same process coming to the right side to
the<00:04:13.099> left<00:04:13.190> collecting<00:04:14.120> in<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.329> left<00:04:14.540> atrium

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
the left collecting in the left atrium

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.069 
the left collecting in the left atrium
and<00:04:15.109> you<00:04:15.470> can<00:04:15.620> see<00:04:15.889> as<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:17.000> leaflets<00:04:17.720> close

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
and you can see as the leaflets close

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.289 
and you can see as the leaflets close
they<00:04:18.620> balloon<00:04:19.099> upward<00:04:19.700> which<00:04:19.970> is<00:04:20.150> the

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
they balloon upward which is the

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.870 
they balloon upward which is the
prolapse<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:20.989> as<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.769> stretches<00:04:22.190> as<00:04:22.639> that

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
prolapse and as it stretches as that

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.790 
prolapse and as it stretches as that
leaflet<00:04:23.330> stretches<00:04:23.810> it<00:04:23.960> doesn't<00:04:24.590> close

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
leaflet stretches it doesn't close

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.100 
leaflet stretches it doesn't close
correctly<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:26.000> blood<00:04:26.270> then<00:04:26.450> leaks<00:04:26.780> back

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
correctly and the blood then leaks back

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.999 
correctly and the blood then leaks back
where<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.590> regurgitates<00:04:28.010> into<00:04:28.820> the

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
where it regurgitates into the

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.429 
where it regurgitates into the
left<00:04:29.189> upper<00:04:29.520> chamber<00:04:29.879> and<00:04:30.089> that<00:04:30.419> extra<00:04:30.869> volume

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:31.439 
left upper chamber and that extra volume

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.769 
left upper chamber and that extra volume
of<00:04:31.619> blood<00:04:31.860> can<00:04:32.520> tickle<00:04:32.969> or<00:04:33.150> irritate<00:04:33.629> the

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:33.779 
of blood can tickle or irritate the

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.989 
of blood can tickle or irritate the
heart<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.199> cause<00:04:34.469> skip<00:04:34.889> beats<00:04:35.129> palpitations

00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:35.999 
heart and cause skip beats palpitations

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:37.820 
heart and cause skip beats palpitations
and<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.599> lot<00:04:36.749> of<00:04:36.839> the<00:04:36.900> symptoms<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:37.499> Sarah's

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
and a lot of the symptoms that Sarah's

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.429 
and a lot of the symptoms that Sarah's
experiencing<00:04:38.839> and<00:04:39.839> that's<00:04:40.169> a<00:04:40.289> great

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 
experiencing and that's a great

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:41.959 
experiencing and that's a great
explanation<00:04:40.680> because<00:04:41.249> in<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.550> end<00:04:41.699> your

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969 
explanation because in the end your

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:43.279 
explanation because in the end your
cardiovascular<00:04:42.719> system

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
cardiovascular system

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:44.959 
cardiovascular system
it's<00:04:43.439> a<00:04:43.589> plumbing<00:04:43.979> system<00:04:44.129> with<00:04:44.819> that

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:44.969 
it's a plumbing system with that

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:46.850 
it's a plumbing system with that
prolapse<00:04:45.479> things<00:04:46.199> are<00:04:46.349> going<00:04:46.529> in<00:04:46.649> the<00:04:46.710> wrong

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
prolapse things are going in the wrong

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.619 
prolapse things are going in the wrong
direction<00:04:47.129> you<00:04:47.520> can<00:04:47.879> get<00:04:47.969> the<00:04:48.059> heart<00:04:48.210> tickled

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
direction you can get the heart tickled

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:50.239 
direction you can get the heart tickled
so<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.589> one<00:04:49.770> thing<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:49.949> want<00:04:50.099> to<00:04:50.129> highlight

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:50.249 
so the one thing I want to highlight

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:51.889 
so the one thing I want to highlight
because<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:50.669> lot<00:04:50.879> of<00:04:51.029> folks<00:04:51.270> get<00:04:51.719> these

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:51.899 
because a lot of folks get these

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:53.899 
because a lot of folks get these
palpitations<00:04:52.619> I<00:04:52.740> see<00:04:52.919> people<00:04:53.279> in<00:04:53.369> the<00:04:53.430> ER<00:04:53.699> all

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
palpitations I see people in the ER all

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.480 
palpitations I see people in the ER all
the<00:04:54.149> time<00:04:54.389> and<00:04:54.689> they<00:04:55.619> may<00:04:55.919> not<00:04:56.099> have<00:04:56.159> the
