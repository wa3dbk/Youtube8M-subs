00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
place so we're going to screw this

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.680 
place so we're going to screw this
adapter<00:00:50.040> in<00:00:50.190> right<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.030> into<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> socket

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
adapter in right here into the socket

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.740 
adapter in right here into the socket
inside<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> housing<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> adapter

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
inside the housing so we so the adapter

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.490 
inside the housing so we so the adapter
can<00:00:54.900> now<00:00:55.050> move<00:00:55.730> with<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.879> trim<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.510> this

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
can now move with this trim and this

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.009 
can now move with this trim and this
adapter<00:00:58.800> simply<00:00:59.400> attaches<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.720> back<00:01:00.870> of
