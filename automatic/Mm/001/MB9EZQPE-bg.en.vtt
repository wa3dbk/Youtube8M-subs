00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
also the custom server IP

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.100 
also the custom server IP
is<00:02:20.120> required<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.200> be<00:02:21.520> unique<00:02:22.600> also<00:02:23.600> rain

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
is required to be unique also rain

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.800

snow should cause less lag like I was
saying<00:02:30.770> just<00:02:31.010> before<00:02:31.550> so<00:02:32.300> if<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.540> pretty

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
saying just before so if that is pretty

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.820

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
massive like twice the size of the build

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.250 
massive like twice the size of the build
eight<00:02:52.730> changelog<00:02:53.450> another<00:02:53.750> one<00:02:53.930> was<00:02:54.110> pretty

keyboard<00:04:28.760> support<00:04:29.330> for<00:04:31.000> navigating<00:04:32.000> worlds

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
keyboard support for navigating worlds

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.970 
keyboard support for navigating worlds
are<00:04:33.080> some<00:04:33.500> voters

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
are some voters

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.100 
are some voters
I<00:04:34.340> guess<00:04:34.880> they're<00:04:35.030> doing<00:04:35.210> some<00:04:35.510> kind<00:04:35.780> of<00:04:35.840> stuff

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
I guess they're doing some kind of stuff

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.990 
I guess they're doing some kind of stuff
of<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.560> keyboards<00:04:37.280> because<00:04:37.460> there's

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
of the keyboards because there's

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000 
of the keyboards because there's
actually<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.300> few<00:04:38.600> fixes<00:04:39.080> with<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:39.560> keyboards

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
actually a few fixes with the keyboards

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.450 
actually a few fixes with the keyboards
the<00:04:40.400> next<00:04:40.820> one<00:04:41.000> is<00:04:41.950> support<00:04:42.950> for<00:04:43.220> local

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
the next one is support for local

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.120 
the next one is support for local
characters<00:04:44.420> with<00:04:45.050> keyboards<00:04:45.710> so<00:04:45.830> that<00:04:46.010> is

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
characters with keyboards so that is

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.730 
characters with keyboards so that is
pretty<00:04:46.370> awesome<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:47.240> players<00:04:47.690> can<00:04:48.140> no<00:04:48.470> longer

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
pretty awesome the players can no longer

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.110 
pretty awesome the players can no longer
move<00:04:49.040> items<00:04:49.310> around<00:04:50.210> when<00:04:50.990> dead<00:04:51.700> so<00:04:52.700> I<00:04:52.730> guess<00:04:53.000> I

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
move items around when dead so I guess I

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.780 
move items around when dead so I guess I
was<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.270> bug<00:04:53.450> I<00:04:53.540> never<00:04:53.750> actually<00:04:53.960> got<00:04:54.500> to

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790

one<00:06:20.360> chests<00:06:21.320> now<00:06:21.980> support<00:06:22.610> custom<00:06:23.270> names<00:06:23.600> so

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
one chests now support custom names so

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.680 
one chests now support custom names so
that<00:06:24.500> is<00:06:25.220> a<00:06:25.730> massive<00:06:26.590> list<00:06:27.590> of<00:06:28.010> bug<00:06:28.970> fixes<00:06:29.000> and

that is a massive list of bug fixes and

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.220 
that is a massive list of bug fixes and

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.390 
new tweaks and alpha build 9 so we're
getting<00:06:33.500> extremely<00:06:34.490> close<00:06:34.730> guys<00:06:36.070> it's<00:06:37.070> just

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400

really<00:06:37.880> awesome<00:06:38.300> I<00:06:38.540> build<00:06:38.870> is<00:06:38.990> coming<00:06:39.290> out

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
really awesome I build is coming out

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.350 
really awesome I build is coming out
almost<00:06:39.830> every<00:06:40.190> day<00:06:40.220> but<00:06:40.430> this<00:06:40.880> one<00:06:41.030> was<00:06:41.240> about

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
almost every day but this one was about

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.440 
almost every day but this one was about
two<00:06:41.690> days<00:06:41.960> delayed<00:06:42.650> I<00:06:42.920> believe<00:06:43.610> because<00:06:43.850> it

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
two days delayed I believe because it

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.790 
two days delayed I believe because it
just<00:06:44.570> wasn't<00:06:44.900> working<00:06:45.050> properly<00:06:45.380> and<00:06:45.560> stuff

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
just wasn't working properly and stuff

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.960 
just wasn't working properly and stuff
like<00:06:45.920> that<00:06:45.980> but<00:06:46.250> it<00:06:46.400> looks<00:06:46.640> like<00:06:46.700> they're

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
like that but it looks like they're

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:47.650 
like that but it looks like they're
getting<00:06:47.060> extra

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
getting extra

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.860
