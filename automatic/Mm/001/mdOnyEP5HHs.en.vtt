00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.180
 they are life threateningly normal cars 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.470
 which are converted into 45 km cars 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.230
 That is the opinion of safe traffic in the Netherlands 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.420
 because they look like ordinary ones 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.009
 automobiles, other road users and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.590
 get confused because of the speed 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.350
 allowing them to misjudge 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.090
 these so-called nmbs cars that state 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.609
 for motor vehicles with limited 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.550
 speed you don't need a driver's license 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.660
 the number is also growing in limburg 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.910
 sellers and drivers none none 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.949
 issue 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.170
 this jeep passing by is rows 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.809
 converted with some electronic intervention 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.000
 and it only runs 45 kilometers per hour 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.010
 but otherwise it is a normal car yes 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.020
 I do care about more won parents 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.820
 built in week 13 km think through 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.230
 the most dangerous is estimating 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.399
 of the faster that think of is a car 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.899
 row you still have a name 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.030
 you can have a paper 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.010
 there is no license plate on the car yes well 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.809
 on where indeed a broadcast from 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.149
 peacock news from last year already showed that 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.949
 you can drive without a habit 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.739
 and that is almost possible 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.390
 that's how safe traffic finds the netherlands and that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.769
 means until the Johan Breakdown 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.930
 theoretical knowledge and practical 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.119
 skills that are pro broad and injury 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.260
 their car so actually he is one 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.140
 much safer than a moped car 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.729
 and this is how a real car 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.729
 that implemented is then again too much 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.689
 cold and morbid even more for brasser 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.100
 that is a lot safer of course 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.180
 nobody knows exactly what rules are 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.439
 not on the police 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.079
 Jos Smits were a while ago 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.470
 arrested with alcohol in the car 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.990
 yes yes send a week to the doctor 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.579
 Papiamento by drunken are that good 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.189
 I agree and they did have one 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.020
 iporanga then followed a fine but none 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.579
 driving suspension because that is with this kind 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.860
 cars again not possible you have you 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.930
 maybe need a driver's license and any car 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.390
 you can build on that say orders that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.960
 know possible to born 25 kilometers 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.030
 to abs car then according to 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.670
 here is an astra that has been converted 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.159
 well 45 km car nmbs 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.110
 is therefore not boring for all the sales 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.640
 was the first to be six years ago 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.950
 she discovered a duet in a thousand 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.300
 cars Netherlands driving 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.400
 chances are that there will be rules 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.830
 changed as far as the traders 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.670
 no i do n't really think that is true 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.470
 that it must be completely deleted 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.920
 that maybe different things 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.650
 could be improved that is perhaps 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.080
 still to discuss but that it 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.040
 completely off the job that must be there 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.930
 I even could not, and 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.150
 establish insurance 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.850
 indeed , a ferrari is extra 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.120
 45 trolley it seems practical 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.120
 unfeasible 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.540
 the Afrika Center has gifts and times 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.540
 found a new location
