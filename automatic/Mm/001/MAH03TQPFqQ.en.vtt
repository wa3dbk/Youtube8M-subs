I am very very sweaty I'm comfortable
because<00:00:35.860> of<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.190> Omni<00:00:36.520> free<00:00:36.730> 0<00:00:37.000> rings<00:00:37.540> that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
because of the Omni free 0 rings that

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.570 
because of the Omni free 0 rings that
have<00:00:37.900> a<00:00:38.020> polymer<00:00:38.440> in<00:00:38.559> them<00:00:38.710> which<00:00:39.040> is<00:00:39.130> allowing

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
have a polymer in them which is allowing

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.820 
have a polymer in them which is allowing
my<00:00:39.760> heat<00:00:40.270> transfer<00:00:40.809> that's<00:00:41.230> what<00:00:41.470> does<00:00:41.680> to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
my heat transfer that's what does to

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.770 
my heat transfer that's what does to
actually<00:00:42.070> be<00:00:42.130> improved<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:42.760> better<00:00:43.059> this

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
actually be improved and better this

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.810 
actually be improved and better this
technology<00:00:44.260> isn't<00:00:44.380> a<00:00:44.620> lot<00:00:44.800> of<00:00:44.890> active<00:00:45.340> wear<00:00:45.580> as

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
technology isn't a lot of active wear as

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.170 
technology isn't a lot of active wear as
well<00:00:46.030> as<00:00:46.470> casual<00:00:47.470> wear<00:00:47.710> in<00:00:47.980> wovens<00:00:48.820> even<00:00:49.059> in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
sweat we even put this technology into

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.520 
sweat we even put this technology into
our<00:00:56.110> shoes<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.510> this<00:00:58.840> is<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.110> power<00:00:59.290> drain

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530
