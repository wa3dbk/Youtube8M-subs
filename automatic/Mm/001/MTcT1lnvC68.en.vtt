in<00:00:05.450> this<00:00:06.450> video<00:00:06.750> tutorial<00:00:06.930> we<00:00:07.470> will<00:00:07.560> create<00:00:07.770> a

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
in this video tutorial we will create a

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.920 
in this video tutorial we will create a
walkthrough<00:00:08.220> animation<00:00:08.970> in<00:00:09.450> which<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.780> end

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:09.930 
walkthrough animation in which the end

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:19.610 
walkthrough animation in which the end
result<00:00:10.260> will<00:00:10.500> look<00:00:10.650> like<00:00:10.770> this

to<00:00:24.930> create<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.230> path<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.890> could<00:00:26.130> draw<00:00:26.310> multiple

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
to create a path you could draw multiple

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.240 
to create a path you could draw multiple
lines<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.360> the<00:00:27.480> line<00:00:27.690> tool<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.230> then<00:00:28.980> join

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
lines with the line tool and then join

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.430 
lines with the line tool and then join
them<00:00:29.430> together<00:00:29.630> with<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> make<00:00:30.930> paths<00:00:31.230> from

path can be left in the scenes but most
will<00:02:15.840> probably<00:02:16.260> want<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.500> hide<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.920> paths

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
will probably want to hide the paths

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.660 
will probably want to hide the paths
that<00:02:17.520> are<00:02:17.580> made<00:02:18.920> hiding<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:19.980> path<00:02:20.160> must<00:02:20.490> be

that are made hiding the path must be
done<00:02:20.850> before<00:02:21.000> scenes<00:02:21.450> are<00:02:21.600> created<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.230> can

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.870 
done before scenes are created and can
be<00:02:22.470> done<00:02:22.680> by<00:02:22.830> simply<00:02:23.040> putting<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.460> path<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.850> a

rough path completely on one plane and
then<00:03:11.840> drag<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.349> line<00:03:12.500> segments<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.220> arcs<00:03:13.430> to
