00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 That's it guys, we've reached the fifth 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.779
 video of this sequence of their 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.179
 principles of a good kick 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.980
 previously we spoke about guard and 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.509
 Now I'm going to tell you the truth. 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.410
 this principle is the principle of 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.660
 I can practically land 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.930
 that is where most people 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 it was people, many people know 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.609
 rotation well knows of lighthouse has a good 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.090
 synchronization often even know the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.610
 guard but kick landing 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.719
 we take very very very very 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.760
 a lot because because most of the time 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.879
 we only train one or two types of 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.559
 landing 1 to 5 2 there was again 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.539
 someone who trains the three types of 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.620
 learning because the landing 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.200
 kick 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.760
 she has three types because the kick has 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.250
 several variations a lot can 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.989
 happen when you have a kick and it's 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.760
 This will make a difference to you. 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.500
 learn the principle of the adversary 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.539
 first occasion 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.579
 You can not just train a kick in the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.799
 punching bag in the dark because it occurs 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.979
 the occasion for you to miss the kick 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.330
 that is if you miss the kick the type of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.830
 landing you have to do 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.020
 and other 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.950
 probably if you kick 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.810
 circular and opponent raul or his 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.280
 energy is passing you do not 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.780
 You'll have nothing that bore you, will you? 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.759
 have to complete the spin 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.159
 so the type of training for this type of 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.729
 landing is the complete circular kick 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.229
 that we usually train that way 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.930
 complete circular ie I went kicking 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.460
 in the opponent of some I was wrong I have 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.299
 that back has to have this type of 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.820
 landing 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.979
 I can not go wrong and fall I have to 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.340
 rap round or in case 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.240
 see more side only to give a 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.579
 beat 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.490
 you make the defense with the front leg 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.230
 Even if you're wrong, do not take this into account. 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.150
 mind 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.640
 Your kick will not always catch many. 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.200
 Sometimes you'll go wrong and you have to 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.390
 train this type of landing 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.040
 the second type of landing is already 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.020
 different when you reach the 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.740
 opponent is when you hit the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.230
 opponent 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.750
 many times you do not move it from the 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.640
 place because you can hit the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.710
 you probably do not 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.990
 will move it then this kind of 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.910
 training is already invalid for this you 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.760
 need another because your leg does not 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.530
 It'll be over for you to finish the spin. 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.270
 so what happens if you train only the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.340
 first step when you make a 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.190
 kick and hit the opponent you will not 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.350
 know how to analyze and will end up buying it 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.490
 part that most is if you go 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.290
 hit the opponent 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.300
 You have to have the notion that you do not 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.520
 will surpass his energy you will 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.440
 have to go back to your guard 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.320
 whether you hit the opponent and not 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.260
 got to move it you have to 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.910
 and hit back earlier now 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.670
 This is great. We train this. 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.810
 kind of kicking a shell with a partner 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.660
 or even a hard or fixed location not 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.230
 necessarily at a fixed location for 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.209
 we lean on our backs and go back 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.459
 necessarily need to kick 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.600
 the question here is not the kick will be 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.270
 present in synchrony 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.330
 that I want to train only have there I just 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.640
 I like it and the penalty in the place the kick and return 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.209
 returns with the rotation for me it waits 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.620
 normal 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.180
 I kick back together and I come back this guy. 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.920
 training will symbolize exactly what 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.110
 when you hit the opponent and do not 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.700
 can move and the third type of 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.700
 landing will be when you reach 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.560
 the opponent and can move with much 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.940
 of times, especially when people 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.760
 hit the head 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.069
 we hit the opponent and he moves 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.499
 if he falls and goes to the side 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.879
 even in memory loss then this type 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.650
 attention, we're going to be different. 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.629
 because you will have hit an opponent 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.359
 and at the same time avoid shifting or 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.939
 whether its strength does not pass in the wind and 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.629
 her strength is not interdicted she is not 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.239
 stop 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.549
 she still has one type of vote in this 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.650
 if I recommend you train in a kick 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.829
 and landing forward with the same 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.939
 leg or in a way you gain the 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.739
 kicked back and forth in the same way as the 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.439
 first but it's interesting to have 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.669
 these three training options for the 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.400
 kick learning 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.199
 the complete circular kick that is when 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.359
 you miss the kick 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:23.820
 the kick and start back and a kick in 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.050
 that you pat and search with the leg of the 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.240
 kick in the front 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.830
 if you have three options they will 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.990
 serve for these three types of occasions 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.889
 obviously there are two other 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.180
 seasons greetings 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.430
 we will not go deep into who 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.590
 speak in counting spin kick and 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.599
 are other things speaking the principles 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.539
 for any martial timer can improve 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:44.610
 much his kick was with us and the 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.960
 We're still going to the sixth part now. 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.199
 that we will talk about the area of 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.199
 impact 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.670
 ae
