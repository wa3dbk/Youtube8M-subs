00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.580 

you<00:01:08.130> now<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.909> three-to-one<00:01:09.479> or<00:01:09.899> Z<00:01:10.259> drag

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
you now have a three-to-one or Z drag

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:39.070 
you now have a three-to-one or Z drag
system

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.260 

to<00:01:39.680> show<00:01:39.920> that<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.250> works<00:01:40.430> I've<00:01:40.820> done<00:01:41.060> two

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
to show that it works I've done two

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.180 
to show that it works I've done two
demonstrations<00:01:41.870> hooking<00:01:42.710> them<00:01:42.830> up<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.010> a

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
demonstrations hooking them up to a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.210 
demonstrations hooking them up to a
small<00:01:43.490> scale<00:01:44.200> with<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.350> three-to-one<00:01:45.770> system

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
small scale with the three-to-one system

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.010 
small scale with the three-to-one system
you<00:01:46.340> can<00:01:46.460> see<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:46.760> takes<00:01:46.970> only<00:01:47.330> about<00:01:47.450> two

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
you can see it takes only about two

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.410 
you can see it takes only about two
pounds<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.710> actually<00:01:49.070> start<00:01:49.370> moving<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:50.000> 15

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
pounds to actually start moving the 15

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.160 
pounds to actually start moving the 15
pounds<00:01:50.870> in<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.080> basket<00:01:52.780> however<00:01:53.780> when<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.050> do

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
pounds in the basket however when I do

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.470 
pounds in the basket however when I do
just<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.620> straight<00:01:54.680> pull<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.790> can<00:01:55.940> see<00:01:56.150> that<00:01:56.390> it

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
just a straight pull you can see that it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.720 
just a straight pull you can see that it
actually<00:01:56.510> takes<00:01:57.020> much<00:01:57.290> more<00:01:57.530> about<00:01:58.310> six

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
actually takes much more about six

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.490 
actually takes much more about six
pounds<00:01:59.180> to<00:01:59.540> get<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.840> basket<00:02:00.230> moving<00:02:02.320> you<00:02:03.320> can

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
pounds to get the basket moving you can

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.230 
pounds to get the basket moving you can
practice<00:02:03.920> building<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.310> three<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.610> one<00:02:04.640> Z<00:02:05.000> drag

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240
