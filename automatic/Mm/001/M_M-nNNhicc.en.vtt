00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
those blank and just have the icons you

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.710 
those blank and just have the icons you
could<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.150> rename<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.689> to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
could do that or you can rename it to

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.359 
could do that or you can rename it to
whatever<00:01:28.170> you'd<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.470> I'll<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.799> rename<00:01:29.220> it

of<00:01:29.490> course<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.909> cydia<00:01:30.299> because<00:01:30.570> that's<00:01:30.750> what

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
of course to cydia because that's what
