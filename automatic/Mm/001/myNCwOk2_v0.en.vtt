 Hello everyone today as we promised 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.160
 consider such a topic as grease 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.620
 zoom and cork cock 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.490
 what do we need for this 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.769
 need cooked soap msi 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.369
 regular leak check foam 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:23.619
 two screwdriver rag and of course grease 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.869
 first things to do before 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.239
 crane lubrication without fail 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.529
 need to open the window to be ventilated 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.489
 indoors as the eye will go out and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.530
 accordingly, it should go to 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.199
 the street they are in the room where we are 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:44.289
 Grease the tap to start off 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:46.420
 crane unscrew the push bot slightly his 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.460
 supports with two fingers since 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:59.429
 inside the spring it can pop up and 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:59.429
 get lost here it is the bolt and spring 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.360
 now supporting the cork with your finger slightly 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:13.180
 click on the key by scrolling it by 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:15.880
 clockwise and pull out reel 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:22.690
 On this hill rag thickness roughly 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:30.760
 like the diameter of the tap itself and fingers sharply 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:34.230
 take out the plug we plug it like this 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.230
 crane method 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.110
 bosch 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.010
 wipe the cork from the old grease 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.010
 it is necessary 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.540
 the inside also 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.730
 by this method 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:36.150
 now take grease smear 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.060
 as we see gran smeared evenly with 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.580
 all sides 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.020
 a lot of grease do not need to smear because 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.020
 what will bore 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:51.689
 now keep the cork in this one 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:51.689
 position take out a rag insert 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:07.290
 in the reverse order we put the key here we are 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.290
 have inserted 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:24.450
 take the pressure block with spring 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.450
 and slightly supporting spin 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.889
 now be sure to develop 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.889
 lubricate the inside of the screen for this twist 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.889
 back and forth 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:53.130
 leave the crane in the open position 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:59.210
 check for leaking soapy emotions if 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.210
 there will be a leak then there will be a bubble from the joints 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:25.730
 as you see the bubble is no means done 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.730
 all right, thank you all bye
