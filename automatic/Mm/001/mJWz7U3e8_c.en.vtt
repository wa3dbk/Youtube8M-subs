00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
look we have a new station asset we have

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.770 
look we have a new station asset we have
some<00:02:27.330> new<00:02:27.360> asteroid<00:02:28.290> assets<00:02:29.420> which<00:02:30.420> she

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
some new asteroid assets which she

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.090 
some new asteroid assets which she
didn't<00:02:31.080> load<00:02:31.200> one<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.530> new<00:02:31.650> ones<00:02:31.680> nearby

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
see the elite style radar in the game

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.330 
see the elite style radar in the game
the<00:02:48.890> station<00:02:49.890> will<00:02:50.550> start<00:02:50.850> with<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:53.160> yes

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
the station will start with that so yes

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.250 
the station will start with that so yes
so<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.180> new<00:02:54.300> station<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.840> set<00:02:55.140> oh<00:02:57.260> so

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
so this is the new station I set oh so

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.300 
so this is the new station I set oh so
you<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.500> see<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.820> these<00:02:59.820> guys<00:03:00.060> right<00:03:00.390> here<00:03:00.450> are

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
you can see it these guys right here are

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.300 
you can see it these guys right here are
the<00:03:02.310> hard<00:03:02.550> points<00:03:03.380> or<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.800> add<00:03:05.040> on

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
the hard points or you can add on

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.790 
the hard points or you can add on
additional<00:03:05.550> Station<00:03:06.360> modules<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:07.620> is

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
additional Station modules this is

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.630 
additional Station modules this is
actually<00:03:08.580> three<00:03:09.330> copies<00:03:10.050> of<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:11.070> starter

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
actually three copies of the starter

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.170 
actually three copies of the starter
station<00:03:12.030> module<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:14.220> you'll<00:03:14.459> notice<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.790> bit<00:03:15.090> of

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
station module so you'll notice a bit of

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.680 
station module so you'll notice a bit of
a<00:03:15.269> repeating<00:03:15.720> pattern<00:03:15.750> here<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:17.610> there's<00:03:17.880> one

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
a repeating pattern here so there's one

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.210 
a repeating pattern here so there's one
here<00:03:19.280> one<00:03:20.280> here<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:21.060> one<00:03:21.180> here<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:23.280> yeah<00:03:23.459> so

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
here one here and one here so yeah so

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.050 
here one here and one here so yeah so
three<00:03:26.220> modules<00:03:28.519> see<00:03:29.519> if<00:03:29.580> I<00:03:29.640> can<00:03:29.790> thread<00:03:30.030> the

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
three modules see if I can thread the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.460 
three modules see if I can thread the
needle<00:03:30.209> here<00:03:30.450> this<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.900> always<00:03:31.140> fun

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.040 

yep<00:03:36.190> get<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.090> idea<00:03:39.270> anyway<00:03:40.270> so<00:03:40.510> this<00:03:40.840> guy

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
yep get the idea anyway so this guy

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.360 
yep get the idea anyway so this guy
right<00:03:41.260> here<00:03:42.720> flying<00:03:43.720> along<00:03:44.110> all<00:03:44.530> red<00:03:45.010> is

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
right here flying along all red is

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.620 
right here flying along all red is
actually<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.120> dead<00:03:46.390> ship<00:03:47.520> because<00:03:48.520> we've<00:03:49.390> set

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
actually a dead ship because we've set

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.800 
actually a dead ship because we've set
it<00:03:49.720> up<00:03:49.810> now<00:03:49.990> to<00:03:50.410> where<00:03:50.880> after<00:03:51.880> you<00:03:51.970> die<00:03:52.150> your

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
it up now to where after you die your

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.410 
it up now to where after you die your
ship<00:03:53.200> doesn't<00:03:53.380> actually<00:03:53.740> go<00:03:54.190> away<00:03:54.460> it<00:03:54.760> gets

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
ship doesn't actually go away it gets

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.210 
ship doesn't actually go away it gets
left<00:03:55.690> behind<00:03:55.810> as<00:03:56.350> Salvage<00:03:57.360> so<00:03:58.360> if<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.950> grab<00:03:59.950> one

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
left behind as Salvage so if I grab one

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.750 
left behind as Salvage so if I grab one
of<00:04:00.250> these<00:04:00.400> guys<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:02.220> see<00:04:03.220> if<00:04:03.250> i<00:04:03.430> can<00:04:03.550> get<00:04:03.640> it

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
of these guys and see if i can get it

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:19.839 
of these guys and see if i can get it
targeted<00:04:07.620> somebody<00:04:08.620> relatively<00:04:09.370> nearby

need I've anyway I'm stuck in the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.120 
need I've anyway I'm stuck in the
asteroids<00:04:30.050> yeah<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.470> radical<00:04:31.800> target

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
asteroids yeah the radical target

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:42.850 
asteroids yeah the radical target
doesn't<00:04:32.310> quite<00:04:32.580> work<00:04:32.639> for<00:04:32.819> at<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.330> moment

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.749 

there<00:04:43.860> we<00:04:43.949> go<00:04:44.069> okay<00:04:45.139> so<00:04:46.139> now<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:47.430> can<00:04:47.610> watch

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
there we go okay so now you can watch

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.620 
there we go okay so now you can watch
his<00:04:48.060> armor<00:04:48.599> and<00:04:49.280> his<00:04:50.280> shield<00:04:50.610> drop<00:04:51.210> as<00:04:51.449> I

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
his armor and his shield drop as I

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.830 
his armor and his shield drop as I
shooting<00:04:54.169> we<00:04:55.169> turned<00:04:55.380> off<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.560> one<00:04:55.860> shot<00:04:56.840> one

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
shooting we turned off the one shot one

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.350 
shooting we turned off the one shot one
kill<00:04:58.370> so<00:04:59.370> that<00:04:59.490> we<00:04:59.550> can<00:04:59.699> actually<00:04:59.789> do<00:05:00.120> some

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
kill so that we can actually do some

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.740 
kill so that we can actually do some
testing<00:05:00.780> with<00:05:00.889> shields<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.599> armor<00:05:03.599> and

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
testing with shields and armor and

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.480 
testing with shields and armor and
whatnots<00:05:04.169> yeah<00:05:04.440> so<00:05:04.710> if<00:05:04.770> i<00:05:04.860> stop<00:05:04.919> shooting<00:05:05.430> it

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
whatnots yeah so if i stop shooting it

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.270 
whatnots yeah so if i stop shooting it
for<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:05.699> minute<00:05:05.849> is<00:05:06.030> shield<00:05:06.300> will<00:05:06.479> start<00:05:06.690> to

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
for a minute is shield will start to

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.029 
for a minute is shield will start to
regenerate<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:10.020> if<00:05:10.139> I<00:05:10.259> back<00:05:10.470> up<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.710> little<00:05:10.860> bit

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
regenerate and if I back up a little bit

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.149 
regenerate and if I back up a little bit
before<00:05:11.370> I<00:05:11.400> shooting<00:05:11.849> I<00:05:12.710> won't<00:05:13.710> die<00:05:13.919> in<00:05:14.069> the

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
before I shooting I won't die in the

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.480 
before I shooting I won't die in the
process<00:05:14.810> but<00:05:15.810> i<00:05:16.380> will<00:05:16.800> get<00:05:16.949> kicked<00:05:17.220> pretty

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490
