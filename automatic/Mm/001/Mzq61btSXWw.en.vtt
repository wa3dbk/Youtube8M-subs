what was your initial reaction when you

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.660 
what was your initial reaction when you
saw<00:00:12.930> your<00:00:13.260> open<00:00:13.530> records<00:00:13.740> law

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
saw your open records law

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.640 
saw your open records law
wasn't<00:00:15.150> favorable<00:00:15.660> how<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.200> you<00:00:16.290> think<00:00:16.530> it's

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
wasn't favorable how do you think it's

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.970 
wasn't favorable how do you think it's
fair<00:00:17.280> to<00:00:17.310> others<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:18.020> saw<00:00:19.020> my<00:00:19.170> own<00:00:19.290> bracket<00:00:19.740> and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
fair to others I saw my own bracket and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.970 
fair to others I saw my own bracket and
I<00:00:20.550> checked<00:00:20.970> people<00:00:21.810> which<00:00:22.050> i<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:22.290> in<00:00:22.650> Europe

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
I checked people which i think in Europe

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.040 
I checked people which i think in Europe
are<00:00:23.160> comparable<00:00:23.640> skill<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.060> me<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.869> thought

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
are comparable skill to me and I thought

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.750 
are comparable skill to me and I thought
only<00:00:25.260> maybe<00:00:25.500> soccer<00:00:25.860> had<00:00:26.250> an<00:00:26.340> enviable

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
only maybe soccer had an enviable

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.269 
only maybe soccer had an enviable
bracket<00:00:27.380> not<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.770> it<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.220> be

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
bracket not not like it was going to be

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.060 
bracket not not like it was going to be
easy<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.730> him<00:00:29.759> but<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.150> thought<00:00:30.360> Brett<00:00:31.070> strelok

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
easy for him but I thought Brett strelok

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.770 
easy for him but I thought Brett strelok
first<00:00:32.340> round<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.910> then<00:00:32.970> who<00:00:33.120> he<00:00:33.239> had<00:00:33.360> second

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
first round and then who he had second

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.689 
first round and then who he had second
round<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.110> don't<00:00:34.500> cry<00:00:34.650> remember<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.670> I

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
round and don't cry remember but I

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.430 
round and don't cry remember but I
thought<00:00:35.910> mostly<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> had<00:00:36.720> like<00:00:36.900> an<00:00:37.080> average

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
thought mostly I had like an average

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.729 
thought mostly I had like an average
bracket<00:00:37.830> not<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> hardest<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.699> the<00:00:38.879> easiest

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
bracket not the hardest not the easiest

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.540 
bracket not the hardest not the easiest
definitely<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.769> thought<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> be

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
definitely I thought it was going to be

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.430 
definitely I thought it was going to be
hard<00:00:41.760> only<00:00:42.269> two<00:00:42.420> people<00:00:42.720> pass<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.260> there's

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
hard only two people pass and there's

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.890 
hard only two people pass and there's
like<00:00:43.650> three<00:00:44.400> four<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:45.030> Koreans<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.690> grid

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
like three four for Koreans in my grid

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.200 
like three four for Koreans in my grid
so<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.830> thought<00:00:47.070> yeah<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.670> wasn't<00:00:47.850> going<00:00:48.089> to<00:00:48.150> be

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
so I thought yeah it wasn't going to be

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.509 
so I thought yeah it wasn't going to be
easy<00:00:48.269> but<00:00:49.080> i<00:00:49.320> did<00:00:49.559> also<00:00:49.739> see<00:00:50.040> there<00:00:50.250> wasn't

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
easy but i did also see there wasn't

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.030 
easy but i did also see there wasn't
very<00:00:51.089> high<00:00:51.269> level<00:00:51.570> jerks<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:52.080> my<00:00:52.199> grid<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.010> i

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
very high level jerks on my grid so i

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.590 
very high level jerks on my grid so i
was<00:00:53.190> very<00:00:53.280> surprised<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.479> end

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
was very surprised that in the end

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.090 
was very surprised that in the end
target<00:00:55.379> made<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.650> to<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.830> winner's<00:00:55.979> bracket

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
target made it to the winner's bracket

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.619 
target made it to the winner's bracket
finals<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.729> that<00:00:56.850> i<00:00:56.940> had<00:00:57.089> to<00:00:57.180> play<00:00:57.360> against

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
finals and that i had to play against

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.090 
finals and that i had to play against
the<00:00:57.750> zerg<00:00:57.960> because<00:00:58.530> i<00:00:58.620> thought<00:00:58.799> it<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:58.949> going

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the zerg because i thought it was going

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.390 
the zerg because i thought it was going
to<00:00:59.159> be<00:00:59.250> all<00:00:59.400> protest<00:00:59.790> and<00:00:59.879> Terrence<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:02.250> got

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
to be all protest and Terrence you got

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.640 
to be all protest and Terrence you got
to<00:01:02.519> play<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.820> between<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> second<00:01:03.540> match<00:01:03.690> how

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
to play in between the second match how

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.750 
to play in between the second match how
close<00:01:04.890> were<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> games<00:01:05.400> from<00:01:05.549> your

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
close were the games from your

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.149 
close were the games from your
perspective<00:01:05.960> not<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> couple<00:01:07.440> of<00:01:07.530> key<00:01:07.740> moments

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
perspective not a couple of key moments

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.660 
perspective not a couple of key moments
which<00:01:08.280> bring<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.909> your<00:01:09.000> mind<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.400> quite

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
which bring it to your mind to be quite

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.530 
which bring it to your mind to be quite
honest<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:13.770> wasn't<00:01:14.010> close<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:15.150> in

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
honest it wasn't close at all like in

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
honest it wasn't close at all like in
both<00:01:15.780> games<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.710> very<00:01:16.920> first<00:01:17.130> attack<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.670> he

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
both games the very first attack that he

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.719 
both games the very first attack that he
did<00:01:18.000> i<00:01:18.030> crumbled<00:01:18.540> like<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> deck<00:01:20.700> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
did i crumbled like a like a deck of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.029 
did i crumbled like a like a deck of
cards<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.840> there<00:01:22.229> isn't<00:01:22.469> really<00:01:22.560> any<00:01:22.799> way<00:01:22.890> to

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
cards so there isn't really any way to

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.940 
cards so there isn't really any way to
ameliorate<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.880> except<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.630> say<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.560> know

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
ameliorate it except to say that I know

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.789 
ameliorate it except to say that I know
some<00:01:26.399> mistakes<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:26.939> made<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.509> he<00:01:28.109> played

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
some mistakes that I made but he played

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.730 
some mistakes that I made but he played
a<00:01:28.829> lot<00:01:29.070> better<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:30.060> don't<00:01:30.719> think<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.020> micro<00:01:31.409> was

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
a lot better I don't think the micro was

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.840 
a lot better I don't think the micro was
a<00:01:31.770> hundred<00:01:32.039> percent<00:01:32.130> maybe<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.700> has<00:01:32.820> something

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
a hundred percent maybe it has something

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.510 
a hundred percent maybe it has something
to<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.570> wrist<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:35.070> terms<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to do with this wrist but in terms of

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.760 
to do with this wrist but in terms of
deception<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.359> timing<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.170> strategy<00:01:37.619> I

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
deception and timing and strategy I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.480 
deception and timing and strategy I
think<00:01:38.340> he<00:01:38.460> did<00:01:38.579> he<00:01:39.240> did<00:01:39.390> very<00:01:39.600> good<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.890> was

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
think he did he did very good so I was

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.399 
think he did he did very good so I was
hoping<00:01:41.789> I<00:01:41.909> would<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.210> face<00:01:42.420> MVP<00:01:42.869> again<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
hoping I would not face MVP again in the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.050 
hoping I would not face MVP again in the
loser<00:01:43.590> bracket<00:01:43.679> finals

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
loser bracket finals

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.920 
loser bracket finals
a<00:01:46.380> little<00:01:47.380> break<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:47.680> was<00:01:47.799> again<00:01:48.009> sauce<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.720> was

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
a little break it was again sauce it was

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
a good idea how he plays and even if he

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.880 
a good idea how he plays and even if he
played<00:02:07.000> surprisingly<00:02:07.689> i<00:02:08.019> think<00:02:08.560> i<00:02:08.649> would<00:02:08.800> be

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
played surprisingly i think i would be

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.620 
played surprisingly i think i would be
able<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.130> react<00:02:09.459> quite<00:02:09.610> well<00:02:09.849> I<00:02:10.030> had<00:02:10.450> good

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
able to react quite well I had good

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.110 
able to react quite well I had good
builders<00:02:10.989> orders<00:02:11.560> prepared<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:12.970> end

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
builders orders prepared and in the end

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.720 
builders orders prepared and in the end
I<00:02:13.209> think<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.599> O's<00:02:13.720> match<00:02:13.989> was<00:02:14.580> not<00:02:15.580> very

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
I think the O's match was not very

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.960 
I think the O's match was not very
difficult<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.540> think<00:02:17.019> ace<00:02:17.200> was<00:02:17.709> tougher<00:02:18.400> but

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
difficult I think ace was tougher but

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.180 
difficult I think ace was tougher but
India<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.420> both<00:02:20.200> players<00:02:20.530> can<00:02:20.769> beat<00:02:20.920> me<00:02:21.069> on<00:02:21.100> a

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
India and both players can beat me on a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
good day for them and I can beat them on

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.070

ended<00:03:42.079> up<00:03:42.290> winning<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:42.970> yeah<00:03:43.970> I<00:03:44.269> think<00:03:44.480> he

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
ended up winning so yeah I think he

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.650 
ended up winning so yeah I think he
shouldn't<00:03:45.709> be<00:03:45.739> able<00:03:45.889> to<00:03:46.129> beat<00:03:46.280> me<00:03:46.760> or<00:03:46.790> all<00:03:47.389> saw

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
shouldn't be able to beat me or all saw

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.990 
shouldn't be able to beat me or all saw
race<00:03:47.900> in<00:03:48.199> this<00:03:48.319> current<00:03:48.500> shape<00:03:48.769> but<00:03:49.069> I<00:03:49.310> guess

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
race in this current shape but I guess

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.839 
race in this current shape but I guess
they<00:03:50.840> didn't<00:03:51.169> know<00:03:51.230> his<00:03:51.349> style<00:03:51.530> very<00:03:51.889> well<00:03:52.099> and

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
they didn't know his style very well and

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.000 
they didn't know his style very well and
I<00:03:53.090> did<00:03:53.299> not<00:03:53.660> underestimate<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.500> may<00:03:54.620> be<00:03:54.680> unlike

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
I did not underestimate it may be unlike

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.839 
I did not underestimate it may be unlike
then<00:03:56.680> all<00:03:57.680> of<00:03:57.709> you<00:03:57.919> wins<00:03:58.099> in<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.310> open<00:03:58.549> record

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
then all of you wins in the open record

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.569 
then all of you wins in the open record
except<00:03:59.209> last<00:03:59.419> weigh-in<00:03:59.750> PPP<00:04:00.430> what<00:04:01.430> do<00:04:01.519> you

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
except last weigh-in PPP what do you

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.100 
except last weigh-in PPP what do you
think<00:04:01.669> of<00:04:01.909> the<00:04:02.030> matchup<00:04:02.359> at<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.569> moment

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
think of the matchup at the moment

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.660 
think of the matchup at the moment
how<00:04:03.440> would<00:04:03.590> you<00:04:03.710> assess<00:04:04.010> your<00:04:04.040> strengths<00:04:04.490> in

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
how would you assess your strengths in

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.280 
how would you assess your strengths in
it<00:04:04.760> do<00:04:05.330> you<00:04:05.420> want<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.660> play<00:04:05.840> more<00:04:05.990> people

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
it do you want to play more people

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.640 
it do you want to play more people
people<00:04:06.440> a<00:04:06.560> turn<00:04:06.740> phone<00:04:07.240> no<00:04:08.240> I<00:04:08.270> I<00:04:08.690> mean<00:04:09.110> I<00:04:09.140> don't

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
people a turn phone no I I mean I don't

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.170 
people a turn phone no I I mean I don't
think<00:04:09.830> it<00:04:09.920> really<00:04:09.950> matters<00:04:10.190> what<00:04:10.670> matchup<00:04:10.880> i'm

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
think it really matters what matchup i'm

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.150 
think it really matters what matchup i'm
going<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.420> play<00:04:11.570> i<00:04:11.600> have<00:04:12.140> my<00:04:12.320> strengths<00:04:12.920> i<00:04:13.070> have

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
going to play i have my strengths i have

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.310 
going to play i have my strengths i have
my<00:04:13.280> weaknesses<00:04:13.820> they<00:04:14.630> change<00:04:14.930> all<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.260> time

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
my weaknesses they change all the time

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.640 
my weaknesses they change all the time
so<00:04:15.740> I<00:04:15.770> find<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.220> uses<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:17.900> pin<00:04:18.079> them<00:04:18.230> down<00:04:18.380> I

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
so I find it uses to to pin them down I

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.210 
so I find it uses to to pin them down I
think<00:04:19.720> statistics<00:04:20.720> are<00:04:20.989> for<00:04:21.320> fans<00:04:21.769> and

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
think statistics are for fans and

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.430 
think statistics are for fans and
casters<00:04:23.060> it's<00:04:23.300> really<00:04:23.600> nice<00:04:23.720> but<00:04:24.050> for<00:04:24.320> me<00:04:24.410> I

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
casters it's really nice but for me I

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.290 
casters it's really nice but for me I
don't<00:04:24.800> evaluate<00:04:25.040> like<00:04:25.490> oh<00:04:25.610> this<00:04:25.820> is<00:04:25.940> my<00:04:26.060> best

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.960 
don't evaluate like oh this is my best
is<00:04:26.510> my<00:04:26.540> worst<00:04:26.900> like<00:04:27.680> I<00:04:27.980> know<00:04:28.280> I<00:04:28.400> want<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.850> play

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
is my worst like I know I want to play

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.570 
is my worst like I know I want to play
in<00:04:29.090> each<00:04:29.180> matchup<00:04:29.420> and<00:04:29.930> yeah<00:04:30.890> that<00:04:31.100> that's<00:04:31.340> it

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
in each matchup and yeah that that's it

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:42.430 
in each matchup and yeah that that's it
there's<00:04:31.790> nothing<00:04:32.120> else<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.360> it<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:42.050> don't

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
there's nothing else to it I I don't

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.680

mean<00:04:45.110> fates<00:04:46.010> will<00:04:46.280> have<00:04:46.580> its<00:04:46.730> way<00:04:46.910> this<00:04:47.240> is

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
mean fates will have its way this is

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.810 
mean fates will have its way this is
something<00:04:47.660> I<00:04:47.720> learned<00:04:47.930> so<00:04:48.430> let's<00:04:49.430> say<00:04:49.610> take

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
something I learned so let's say take

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.870 
something I learned so let's say take
its<00:04:50.000> course<00:04:51.370> where<00:04:52.370> do<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:52.520> think<00:04:54.820> what<00:04:55.820> do

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
its course where do you think what do

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.380 
its course where do you think what do
you<00:04:55.940> think<00:04:56.030> hmm<00:04:56.919> well<00:04:57.919> I<00:04:57.950> think<00:04:58.220> my<00:04:58.910> strengths
