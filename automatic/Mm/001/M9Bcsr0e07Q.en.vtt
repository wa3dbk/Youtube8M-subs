for the tubs tip the lids off enough I
was<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.330> good<00:00:24.449> basis<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.260> suspending<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
was a good basis for the suspending the

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.390 
was a good basis for the suspending the
trigger<00:00:27.449> just<00:00:28.019> tip<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.289> piezo<00:00:28.800> basically<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
trigger just tip the piezo basically to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.759 
trigger just tip the piezo basically to
the<00:00:29.490> back<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:30.570> top<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.140> I've<00:00:31.349> got<00:00:31.380> these

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the back on top of it I've got these

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.100 
the back on top of it I've got these
which<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.700> basically<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.809> corn

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
which is this is basically a little corn

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.400 
which is this is basically a little corn
form<00:00:34.739> corn<00:00:35.070> not<00:00:35.880> very<00:00:36.059> good<00:00:36.270> one<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.690> don't<00:00:37.320> have

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
form corn not very good one I don't have

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.160 
form corn not very good one I don't have
the<00:00:37.550> equipment<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.969> order<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.450> make<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.660> better

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the equipment in order to make it better

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.420 
the equipment in order to make it better
so<00:00:41.570> it'll<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> job<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.290> that's<00:00:44.070> basically

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
so it'll do the job and that's basically

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.229 
so it'll do the job and that's basically
made<00:00:44.879> from<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.260> find<00:00:46.680> them<00:00:49.520> these<00:00:50.520> sanding

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
made from if I find them these sanding

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.029 
made from if I find them these sanding
blocks<00:00:53.600> once<00:00:54.600> again<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> pawn<00:00:55.500> shop<00:00:55.530> get

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
blocks once again from the pawn shop get

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.450 
blocks once again from the pawn shop get
five<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.489> them<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> pound<00:00:58.340> after<00:00:59.340> making

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
five of them for a pound after making

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.010 
five of them for a pound after making
them<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.910> bit<00:01:00.270> smaller<00:01:00.660> than<00:01:00.809> i<00:01:00.960> originally

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
them a bit smaller than i originally

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.520 
them a bit smaller than i originally
intended<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.750> you<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:04.080> probably<00:01:04.470> about

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
intended the you can get probably about

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.020 
intended the you can get probably about
what<00:01:04.949> 10<00:01:05.280> triggers<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:08.030> 10

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
what 10 triggers out with that and 10

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.990 
what 10 triggers out with that and 10
corns<00:01:09.420> anywhere<00:01:09.979> appears<00:01:10.979> or<00:01:11.130> literally<00:01:11.729> just

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
corns anywhere appears or literally just

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.280 
corns anywhere appears or literally just
a<00:01:12.119> bit<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.330> stereo<00:01:12.630> Wyatt<00:01:13.549> straight<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:15.290> Jack

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
a bit of stereo Wyatt straight to Jack

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.710 
a bit of stereo Wyatt straight to Jack
output<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.880> tip<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.450> drum

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
output there that just tip to the drum

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.510 
output there that just tip to the drum
for<00:01:18.900> now<00:01:19.020> find<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> better<00:01:19.560> way<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.799> fix<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.460> I

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
for now find a better way to fix that I

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.609 
for now find a better way to fix that I
think<00:01:20.810> obviously<00:01:21.810> God<00:01:22.259> make<00:01:22.409> sure<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
think obviously God make sure the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.450 
think obviously God make sure the
sovereign<00:01:23.009> connections<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.520> decent<00:01:25.250> now<00:01:26.250> this

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
sovereign connections a decent now this

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.999 
sovereign connections a decent now this
here<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.509> reason<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.810> picked<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.829> as

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
here and the reason I picked that is as

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.950 
here and the reason I picked that is as
you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.159> see<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.790> little<00:01:30.060> tabs<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
you can see this for little tabs on the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.210 
you can see this for little tabs on the
outside<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> was<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> use

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
outside of you and I was going to use

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.120 
outside of you and I was going to use
those<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.880> try<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.420> attach<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.710> now

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
those to try and attach it to this now

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.440 
those to try and attach it to this now
what<00:01:35.340> I've<00:01:35.400> done<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.670> I've<00:01:35.939> gone<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.270> local

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
what I've done is I've gone to a local

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.560 
what I've done is I've gone to a local
sort<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.960> them<00:01:37.310> fabric<00:01:38.310> store<00:01:38.640> boys<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.390> one

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
sort of them fabric store boys is one

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
sort of them fabric store boys is one
hour<00:01:39.720> go<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.409> there's<00:01:41.000> obviously

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
hour go to but there's obviously

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.370 
hour go to but there's obviously
probably<00:01:42.299> don't<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.509> those<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.840> America<00:01:43.259> if

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
probably don't have those in America if

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.399 
probably don't have those in America if
you're<00:01:43.500> watching<00:01:43.619> from<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:45.320> got<00:01:46.320> this

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you're watching from there got this

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.819 
you're watching from there got this
elastic<00:01:46.950> fabric<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:47.939> sit<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.829> stretched

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
elastic fabric you can sit up stretched

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.620 
elastic fabric you can sit up stretched
it<00:01:50.070> both<00:01:50.340> ways<00:01:50.549> across<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.060> kit<00:01:51.329> and

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.090 

obviously<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:57.110> fixes<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.740> other<00:01:58.890> side

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
obviously this fixes on the other side

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.730 
obviously this fixes on the other side
of<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.640> I'll<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.180> move<00:02:01.140> over<00:02:01.290> here<00:02:03.680> is<00:02:04.680> a

of it so I'll just move over here is a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.410 
of it so I'll just move over here is a
snare<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.280> guts<00:02:05.549> out

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.150
