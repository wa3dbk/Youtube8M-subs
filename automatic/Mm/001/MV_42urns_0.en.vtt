00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
you the way I make up an S pan these are

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.480 
you the way I make up an S pan these are
the<00:00:09.030> nests<00:00:09.269> Phelps<00:00:09.840> what<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> do<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.860> shaped<00:00:11.280> them

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
the nests Phelps what I do I shaped them

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.400 
the nests Phelps what I do I shaped them
in<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.759> nest<00:00:11.910> pan<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.450> then<00:00:12.570> they<00:00:12.690> cook<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.170> cut

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
in the nest pan and then they cook I cut

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.140 
in the nest pan and then they cook I cut
out<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.889> V<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:15.089> they<00:00:15.330> form<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:16.080> nice<00:00:16.440> shape<00:00:17.150> within

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
out a V so they form a nice shape within

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.349 
out a V so they form a nice shape within
the<00:00:18.300> nest<00:00:18.480> pan<00:00:18.859> and<00:00:19.859> then<00:00:20.010> I've<00:00:20.670> talked<00:00:21.210> to

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the nest pan and then I've talked to

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.710 
the nest pan and then I've talked to
using<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:22.289> hot<00:00:22.619> glue<00:00:22.650> gun<00:00:22.890> now<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:24.060> seems<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.539> do

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
using a hot glue gun now it seems to do

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.870 
using a hot glue gun now it seems to do
the<00:00:24.750> job<00:00:25.230> really<00:00:25.680> well<00:00:25.949> when<00:00:26.430> putting<00:00:26.670> these

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
the job really well when putting these

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
is you cut up cut them up into pieces

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.869 
is you cut up cut them up into pieces
about<00:00:55.350> an<00:00:55.770> inch<00:00:55.920> long<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.730> gonna

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
about an inch long and I'm just gonna

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.549 
about an inch long and I'm just gonna
place<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.559> bottom<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.000> nest<00:01:00.180> pan

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
place it in the bottom of the nest pan

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.709 
place it in the bottom of the nest pan
and<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.100> put<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> felt<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.570> on

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
and then I'm going to put the felt in on

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.020 
and then I'm going to put the felt in on
top<00:01:05.240> like<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> glue<00:01:07.500> gun

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
top like that and then with the glue gun

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.870 
top like that and then with the glue gun
I'm<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.869> glue<00:01:10.799> around<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.640> edges

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
I'm just going to glue around the edges

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.980 
I'm just going to glue around the edges
of<00:01:12.270> my<00:01:12.540> er<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> nest<00:01:14.310> where<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.299> felt<00:01:15.600> put

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
of my er of the nest where the felt put

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.620 
of my er of the nest where the felt put
the<00:01:16.110> felt<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.909> just<00:01:17.909> glue<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.299> all<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> way

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the felt in just glue it all the way

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:27.280 
the felt in just glue it all the way
around<00:01:19.340> stick<00:01:20.340> years<00:01:20.670> ago

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.560 

so<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.530> pretty<00:01:28.710> easy<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.490> I've<00:01:30.060> tried<00:01:30.420> all

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
so it's pretty easy to do I've tried all

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.410 
so it's pretty easy to do I've tried all
the<00:01:30.659> methods<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.770> thought<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.909> last<00:01:33.090> year

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the methods but I thought that last year

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.490 
the methods but I thought that last year
this<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.990> worked<00:01:34.729> really<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:35.970> well<00:01:36.500> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
this this worked really really well the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.010 
this this worked really really well the
nests<00:01:37.740> felts<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.580> Miss<00:01:38.759> felt<00:01:39.479> stayed<00:01:39.840> in

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
nests felts the Miss felt stayed in

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.109 
nests felts the Miss felt stayed in
quite<00:01:40.350> well<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.250> also<00:01:41.580> stopped<00:01:41.909> any

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
quite well and it's also stopped any

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.499 
quite well and it's also stopped any
mites<00:01:42.649> trying<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.740> climb<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.340> from<00:01:45.090> below

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.289 

below<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> felt<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> plastic<00:01:49.710> ker<00:01:50.299> let's

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
below the felt in the plastic ker let's

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.620 
below the felt in the plastic ker let's
plan<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.170> pull<00:01:52.560> around<00:01:53.299> through<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.420> round

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
plan so I pull around through it round

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.480 
plan so I pull around through it round
like<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:56.119> bit<00:01:57.119> more<00:01:57.330> in<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.479> corner<00:01:57.990> there

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
like that bit more in that corner there

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.940 
like that bit more in that corner there
because<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.970> hens<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> cops<00:02:01.080> will<00:02:01.320> pull

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
because the hens and the cops will pull

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.430 
because the hens and the cops will pull
at<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.670> they'll<00:02:03.149> try<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.630> rip<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.259> out

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
at this and they'll try and rip it out

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.310 
at this and they'll try and rip it out
and<00:02:04.830> all<00:02:04.979> sorts<00:02:05.429> so<00:02:05.780> try<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.869> glue<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.140> in

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
and all sorts so try and glue it in

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.070 
and all sorts so try and glue it in
fairly<00:02:07.740> firm<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:09.509> I've<00:02:09.780> got

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
fairly firm like that and then I've got

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.830 
fairly firm like that and then I've got
this<00:02:10.310> smite<00:02:11.310> organic<00:02:12.239> powder<00:02:13.130> which<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.840> it's

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
this smite organic powder which is it's

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.970 
this smite organic powder which is it's
harmless<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.040> birds<00:02:17.510> but<00:02:18.769> it<00:02:19.769> does

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
harmless to the birds but it does

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.309 
harmless to the birds but it does
actually<00:02:20.550> dry<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.330> mites<00:02:21.720> out<00:02:21.989> if<00:02:22.200> they're

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
actually dry the mites out if they're

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.699 
actually dry the mites out if they're
getting<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.590> nest<00:02:22.860> pan<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.400> I'm<00:02:23.910> going<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.750> put

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
getting the nest pan so I'm going to put

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.220 
getting the nest pan so I'm going to put
some<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.069> powder<00:02:29.239> better<00:02:30.239> if<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.510> better

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
some of this powder better if I better

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.610 
some of this powder better if I better
if<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.590> open<00:02:31.829> it<00:02:31.890> first<00:02:33.049> put<00:02:34.049> it<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.440> that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
if I open it first put it in like that

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.840 
if I open it first put it in like that
and<00:02:36.320> then<00:02:37.320> I'm<00:02:37.440> just<00:02:37.590> going<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.810> smooth<00:02:39.810> it

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
and then I'm just going to smooth it

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.160 
and then I'm just going to smooth it
smooth<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.000> around<00:02:42.329> into<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.690> bottom<00:02:43.019> of<00:02:43.079> the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
smooth it around into the bottom of the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.000 
smooth it around into the bottom of the
pan<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.680> then<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.579> always<00:02:45.090> thought<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.989> bit<00:02:46.890> of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
pan and then I always thought a bit of

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.430 
pan and then I always thought a bit of
nesting<00:02:47.430> material<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.780> bottom<00:02:48.930> as<00:02:49.260> well

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
nesting material in the bottom as well

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.210 
nesting material in the bottom as well
to<00:02:49.680> help<00:02:49.860> encourage<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:51.690> hen<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.440> build<00:02:53.100> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
to help encourage the hen to build the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.720 
to help encourage the hen to build the
nest

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
nest

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.120 
nest
I<00:02:53.760> only<00:02:53.880> put<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.209> bit<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.600> like<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.040> spread<00:02:56.040> it

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
I only put a bit in like that spread it

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.569 
I only put a bit in like that spread it
around<00:02:56.750> this<00:02:57.750> helps<00:02:57.810> pull<00:02:58.799> up<00:02:58.950> bits<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.370> make

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
around this helps pull up bits and make

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.830 
around this helps pull up bits and make
the<00:02:59.730> nest<00:03:00.109> and<00:03:01.109> this<00:03:01.739> is<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.070> nest<00:03:02.840> material

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
the nest and this is the nest material

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.460 
the nest and this is the nest material
I'm<00:03:03.930> using<00:03:05.060> got<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.150> off<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.420> internet<00:03:06.570> it

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
I'm using got it off the internet it

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.289 
I'm using got it off the internet it
seems<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.190> be<00:03:08.310> really<00:03:08.459> good<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:08.940> used<00:03:09.150> it

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
seems to be really good have used it

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.900 
seems to be really good have used it
last<00:03:09.540> year<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.100> I'm<00:03:11.100> going<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.340> try<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.549> get<00:03:11.850> in

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
last year so I'm going to try to get in

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.520 
last year so I'm going to try to get in
this<00:03:12.000> year<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.390> all<00:03:12.540> sorts<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.959> fibers<00:03:13.380> in

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
this year to all sorts of fibers in

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.560 
this year to all sorts of fibers in
there<00:03:13.739> man-made<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.579> synthetic<00:03:15.269> and

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
there man-made and synthetic and

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.449 
there man-made and synthetic and
unnatural<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:18.470> it's<00:03:19.470> quite<00:03:19.650> good<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:20.340> I've

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
unnatural so it's quite good so I've

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.670 
unnatural so it's quite good so I've
just<00:03:20.489> put<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.880> bit<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.530> then

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
just put a bit in like that and then

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.160 
just put a bit in like that and then
that<00:03:22.920> will<00:03:23.130> now<00:03:23.370> go<00:03:23.670> into<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.900> nest

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
that will now go into the to the nest

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.039 
that will now go into the to the nest
into<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.829> cage<00:03:26.040> sorry<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:27.660> I'll<00:03:27.780> put<00:03:28.019> some

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
into the cage sorry and I'll put some

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.990 
into the cage sorry and I'll put some
nesting<00:03:28.799> material<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> bars<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.910> cage

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
nesting material in the bars of the cage

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.930 
nesting material in the bars of the cage
and<00:03:30.680> see<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:31.769> their<00:03:31.980> hens<00:03:32.280> get<00:03:32.579> on<00:03:32.700> with<00:03:32.850> it
