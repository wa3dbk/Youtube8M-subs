00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello everyone in this video I'll show you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.839
 some advantages and disadvantages of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.900
 some operating systems such as the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.509
 linux unix and the mac we will start with the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.000
 mac one of the first advantages that 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.890
 find is the graphic interface the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.260
 macro has the virus which will come to you 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.060
 very good if you are a novice that you execute 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.939
 anything that they send you for the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.279
 messenger or by email is not 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.619
 never block their graphic quality is 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.390
 there are very few viruses 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.390
 they enter the windows there are several 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.730
 they have more power they usually have 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.370
 better aesthetics although sometimes they are not like that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.350
 They are easy to use and among many 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.110
 things more but as nothing is perfect 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.510
 neither is this operating system there 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.930
 less programs for him and it costs more than 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.489
 the windows your shadow follows the software 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.579
 too limited compared to the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.410
 pc that at a scientific level it shows just 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.840
 in the fall of the market more than in the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.899
 universities will leave 25 years for the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.300
 step to pc until then you found a 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.790
 lots of software but suddenly there 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.920
 programs counted with dropper 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.690
 and nobody says that the old soft is 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.850
 bad but it does not take advantage of 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.040
 Machine features is more 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.380
 complicated to find people who can 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.540
 fix in case of failures and you can 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.800
 find several mistakes and I do not want that 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.800
 I'll pass the following 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.049
 i 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.979
 m 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.609
 here 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.609
 and 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.260
 the living 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.229
 its advantages the best market cost 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.690
 free or a symbolic price for the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.909
 cde have a huge amount of 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.590
 free software for this major system 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.690
 stability for something they use it in 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.760
 high performance servers environment 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.979
 graphic better than windows aero 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.080
 there are Linux distributions for 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.320
 various types of equipment up to 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.970
 64 - bit machines vulnerabilities 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.890
 are detected and corrected more 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.890
 quickly than any other system 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.530
 operational disadvantages of linus for 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.170
 some things you must know how to use my the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.720
 most of the and s &amp; p do not give support for 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.239
 something other than windows does not exist much 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.790
 commercial software many games no 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.459
 they run in the light finally in a leeds 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.320
 its advantages are we 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.920
 download it for free from the internet 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.959
 or buy it at an affordable price 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.880
 requirements works exclusively 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.739
 in text mode without the need for 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.380
 load a graphical environment and can 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.840
 run on any machine to have 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.400
 its unix-based kernel inherits that 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.720
 stability that has always characterized 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.730
 to unix systems 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.530
 at server level we can find 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.570
 that the security of the unics versus 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.000
 other servers in the market is a lot 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.730
 Major recognizes the majority of others 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.520
 operating systems in a network runs 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.710
 various applications and processes 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.840
 simultaneously speed their environment 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.360
 graphic to execute or applications 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.090
 they make their speed much higher 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.460
 to the current operating systems their 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.560
 disadvantages are the following some 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.870
 minutes have companies that 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.150
 support so there is no 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.520
 solid support like that of other systems 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.100
 operational thanks to the environment 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.890
 windows their and applications designed 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.590
 specifically for him every one is already 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.630
 easier to integrate and use 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.090
 a maximum of 16 processors 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.410
 simultaneously against the 64 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.840
 processors of other systems 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.450
 operative good up here has arrived 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.580
 my information and do not limit yourself with what 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.709
 that I show you can prove that they do not go 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:51.260
 to leave nothing and they can expand their 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.260
 knowledge says goodbye to you to me
