Hey, guys.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.930
This is Lacey Baier with A Sweet Pea Chef
and today, I'm gonna be making my cauliflower

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.930
mashed potatoes.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.000
I have to admit, I was a little wary of trying
mashed cauliflower for the first time, but

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.230
I kept reading over and over and over about
all this different bloggers are making mashed

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.930
cauliflower and how good it was and how comparable
it was to mashed potatoes.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.670
So once I actually started cutting some regular
potatoes out of my diet, I gave it a shot

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.670
and you know what?

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.210
It's super good, and it's so easy to make.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.270
So if you've been nervous about trying this
out for yourself, too, watch this video and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.650
I hope to convince you just how good and tasty
and fun this is gonna be.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.960
Let's get started.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.299
So what we're gonna do to start is we're gonna
start boiling some water over high heat on

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:11.461
the stove in a deep pot and that's gonna be
used to steam the cauliflower and while we're

00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:12.461
doing that, we're gonna cut up the cauliflower.

00:01:12.461 --> 00:01:15.619
When you buy cauliflower at the store, usually
it comes with the stem and the leaves attached.

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.000
So go ahead and break off all those stems
and then slice it in half.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.361
And then carefully, using your knife, go ahead
and make a divot into the stem to get all

00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:24.361
of that out.

00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:27.720
You can leave a little bit in as long as you
have most of it out, go ahead and chop that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.000
cauliflower into quarters or maybe a little
smaller if you want to get it to fit into

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.370
the steamer basket.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.360
Plop it over into the steamer and cover it
for about six to eight minutes until it's

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.250
nice and tender.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.150
So we'll know when the cauliflower is done
when you can insert a fork into it and it's

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.150
super tender.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.150
It just goes in really easily.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.250
Once that's good, go ahead and remove that
carefully and lay it onto a plate lined with

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.580
paper towels, and what I like to do is allow
it to cool some because the more steam that

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.940
stops coming off of the cauliflower and the
dryer it is, the less it's gonna have moisture

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.380
when you mix it in the food processor, so
that's gonna make the texture a lot better.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.480
I also like to pat it down with a paper towel.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.970
So go ahead and do all of that and then add
all that cauliflower and the garlic cloves

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.120
into the bowl of the food processor.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.120
No food processor?

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.120
No problem.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.280
Go ahead and just add those to your large
bowl and we're gonna mash them up by hand

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.890
the old-fashioned way and you can use a potato
masher for that.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.010
It won't be quite as perfectly mashed as a
food processor, but it'll still be tasty.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.770
So now that we have the cauliflower and the
garlic in the food processor, we want to add

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.629
the parmesan, the salt and the pepper.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.520
Go ahead and start pulsing that away.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.950
You want all of the cauliflower to be nicely
chopped up and nicely broken apart, but we

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.560
don't want it fully pureed, so don't puree
it all the way.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.760
And you might find that you need to use the
spatula a few times to break away and to move

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.770
the cauliflower around because they get kind
of stuck, the little stinky buggers.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.250
But once you get that done, you should have
a nice texture.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.849
And if you need a little bit more moisture
in there, add a little bit of almond milk

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.650
or chicken broth to loosen it up a little
bit.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.480
So there you have it, cauliflower mashed potatoes.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.480
All right, guys.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.560
I hope you try this.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.250
It's super good and I think you're gonna love
it.

Thank you very much, I'll see you next time.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.580
Paper towel.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.580
Plate, not a paper towel.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.580
We have the mashed . . . Pureed.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.819
We don't want pureed.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.880
Give it a try.
