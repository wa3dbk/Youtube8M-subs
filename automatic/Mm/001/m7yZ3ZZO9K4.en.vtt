for<00:01:40.020> cleaning<00:01:40.439> you're<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.549> use<00:01:41.759> a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
for cleaning you're going to use a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.910 
for cleaning you're going to use a
solution<00:01:42.360> which<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.780> call<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> restore<00:01:43.740> kit

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
solution which we call a restore kit

actually an oil the restore is actually

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.340 
actually an oil the restore is actually
sprayed<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.710> solution<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.820> set
