with the dye kita pepper zine well when
they<00:00:26.970> looked<00:00:27.210> at<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.510> study<00:00:27.840> they<00:00:27.930> found

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
they looked at this study they found

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.679 
they looked at this study they found
some<00:00:28.560> shenanigans<00:00:28.859> as<00:00:29.400> well<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
some shenanigans as well and one of the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.600 
some shenanigans as well and one of the
things<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.170> when<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.500> mix<00:00:31.740> up<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> dye<00:00:32.250> kita

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
things is when you mix up the dye kita

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.340 
things is when you mix up the dye kita
peppers<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.180> with<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> animal's<00:00:33.840> food<00:00:34.079> you

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
peppers in with the animal's food you

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.770 
peppers in with the animal's food you
have<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.649> modernize<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.390> evenly

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
have to modernize it so that it's evenly

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.560 
have to modernize it so that it's evenly
distributing<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> animal<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.180> see<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
distributing the animal can see it and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.790 
distributing the animal can see it and
avoid<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:41.059> well<00:00:42.059> I've<00:00:42.210> seen<00:00:42.480> pictures<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
avoid it well I've seen pictures of the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.160 
avoid it well I've seen pictures of the
feed<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.399> they<00:00:44.730> left<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.270> big<00:00:45.480> clumps<00:00:45.989> of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
feed and they left it in big clumps of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.569 
feed and they left it in big clumps of
the<00:00:46.230> rats<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.680> eating<00:00:46.950> around<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.430> not

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the rats for eating around it not

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.549 
the rats for eating around it not
actually<00:00:48.059> eating<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.329> decade<00:00:48.840> peppers<00:00:49.379> in

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
actually eating the decade peppers in

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.160 
actually eating the decade peppers in
there<00:00:50.460> was<00:00:50.610> also<00:00:50.820> evidence<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:52.110> were

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
there was also evidence that they were

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.920 
there was also evidence that they were
giving<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> Dyke<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.219> pepra<00:00:53.489> zeen<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
giving the Dyke you to pepra zeen to the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.979 
giving the Dyke you to pepra zeen to the
control<00:00:55.590> animals<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:57.329> course<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.719> came

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
control animals and of course this came

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.869 
control animals and of course this came
out<00:00:58.020> because<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> original<00:00:58.980> study<00:00:59.670> they

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
out because in the original study they

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.360 
out because in the original study they
found<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.210> 47<00:01:00.780> fold<00:01:00.989> increase<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.500> brain<00:01:01.890> tumors

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
found a 47 fold increase in brain tumors

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.090 
found a 47 fold increase in brain tumors
in<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.579> daiki<00:01:03.449> pepper<00:01:04.080> zine<00:01:04.409> repeat<00:01:04.769> study

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
in the daiki pepper zine repeat study

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
in the daiki pepper zine repeat study
they<00:01:05.640> said<00:01:05.909> Oh<00:01:05.939> we'll<00:01:06.060> look<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.689> control

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
they said Oh we'll look the control

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.399 
they said Oh we'll look the control
animals<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.920> there<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.110> aspartame<00:01:10.110> fed

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
animals in there and the aspartame fed

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.170 
animals in there and the aspartame fed
animals<00:01:10.619> at<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.130> same<00:01:11.430> instance<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.000> brain

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
animals at the same instance of brain

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.660 
animals at the same instance of brain
tumors<00:01:12.420> well<00:01:13.290> when<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> neuropathology<00:01:14.220> has

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
tumors well when the neuropathology has

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.859 
tumors well when the neuropathology has
looked<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.090> said<00:01:15.270> well<00:01:15.420> that's<00:01:15.600> kind<00:01:15.810> of

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
looked at it said well that's kind of

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.780 
looked at it said well that's kind of
strange<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.500> now<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:17.009> control<00:01:17.400> animals

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
strange because now your control animals

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.600 
strange because now your control animals
have<00:01:18.450> very<00:01:18.930> high<00:01:19.590> ansys<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.220> brain<00:01:20.430> tumors

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
have very high ansys of brain tumors

that's not naturally found in his bike

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.710 
that's not naturally found in his bike
and<00:01:22.880> then<00:01:23.880> when<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.090> looked<00:01:24.299> up<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.509> feed

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
and then when they looked up to feed

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.179 
and then when they looked up to feed
they<00:01:24.930> found<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.320> there<00:01:25.530> were<00:01:25.590> some<00:01:25.770> mix<00:01:25.950> ups

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
they found out there were some mix ups

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.370 
they found out there were some mix ups
of<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> feed<00:01:26.640> submitted<00:01:27.210> IQ<00:01:27.540> pepra<00:01:27.990> zeen<00:01:28.200> was

fact it's not really fact what they
claim<00:02:53.390> is<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.900> when<00:02:54.769> you<00:02:54.890> take<00:02:55.160> in<00:02:55.459> fruit<00:02:56.209> you

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
claim is that when you take in fruit you

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.449 
claim is that when you take in fruit you
take<00:02:56.900> in<00:02:57.110> more<00:02:57.610> methanol<00:02:58.610> they<00:02:59.510> don't<00:03:00.349> add<00:03:00.950> the

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
take in more methanol they don't add the

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.930 
take in more methanol they don't add the
fact<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.940> in<00:03:02.390> nature<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:04.250> methanol<00:03:04.760> and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
fact that in nature the methanol and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.640 
fact that in nature the methanol and
fruit<00:03:05.269> is<00:03:05.540> bound<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.260> something<00:03:06.530> called

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
fruit is bound to something called

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.569 
fruit is bound to something called
pectin<00:03:07.630> humans<00:03:08.630> like<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.410> enzyme<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.250> split

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
pectin humans like the enzyme to split

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.400 
pectin humans like the enzyme to split
the<00:03:10.700> methanol<00:03:11.150> off<00:03:11.390> from<00:03:11.599> pectin<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.230> goes

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
the methanol off from pectin so it goes

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.440 
the methanol off from pectin so it goes
through<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.769> body<00:03:12.970> without<00:03:13.970> doing<00:03:14.329> any

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
through the body without doing any

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.720 
through the body without doing any
damage<00:03:14.660> whatsoever<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:15.560> body<00:03:15.799> doesn't<00:03:16.190> get

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
damage whatsoever the body doesn't get

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.430 
damage whatsoever the body doesn't get
exposed<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.660> methanol<00:03:18.019> because<00:03:18.319> it's

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
exposed to the methanol because it's

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.890 
exposed to the methanol because it's
bound<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.799> pectin<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.150> even<00:03:20.569> though<00:03:20.600> there's

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
bound to pectin so even though there's

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.629 
bound to pectin so even though there's
more<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.380> it's<00:03:21.650> totally<00:03:22.010> harmless<00:03:22.220> and

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
more of it it's totally harmless and

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.360 
more of it it's totally harmless and
fruit<00:03:22.880> but<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:23.840> with<00:03:24.049> aspartame<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.920> have<00:03:25.130> the

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
fruit but in with aspartame you have the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.970 
fruit but in with aspartame you have the
pure<00:03:25.639> unadulterated<00:03:26.120> free<00:03:27.079> methanol<00:03:27.739> and

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
pure unadulterated free methanol and

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.590 
pure unadulterated free methanol and
then<00:03:28.100> from<00:03:28.310> l<00:03:28.489> died<00:03:28.639> it's<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:28.970> small<00:03:29.180> amount<00:03:29.389> but

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
then from l died it's a small amount but

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.789 
then from l died it's a small amount but
the<00:03:29.720> body<00:03:29.870> can't<00:03:30.170> get<00:03:30.319> rid<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.620> it's

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
the body can't get rid of it it's

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.099 
the body can't get rid of it it's
cumulative<00:03:31.430> phenomenon<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:32.600> we<00:03:32.690> have<00:03:32.810> very

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
cumulative phenomenon so we have very

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.460 
cumulative phenomenon so we have very
very<00:03:33.319> toxic<00:03:33.700> products<00:03:34.750> methyl<00:03:35.750> alcohol<00:03:35.900> is

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
very toxic products methyl alcohol is

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.410 
very toxic products methyl alcohol is
just<00:03:37.280> deadly<00:03:37.609> and<00:03:38.319> probably<00:03:39.970> provides<00:03:40.970> most

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
just deadly and probably provides most

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.990 
just deadly and probably provides most
of<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:42.290> poisoning<00:03:42.889> attributed<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.519> ethyl

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
of the poisoning attributed to ethyl

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.840 
of the poisoning attributed to ethyl
alcohol<00:03:44.120> knowledge<00:03:45.049> it<00:03:45.500> is<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.430> deadly

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
alcohol knowledge it is it is the deadly

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.650 
alcohol knowledge it is it is the deadly
one<00:03:47.060> aside<00:03:48.019> from<00:03:48.139> the<00:03:48.290> pectin<00:03:48.650> story<00:03:48.980> in<00:03:49.700> fruit

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
one aside from the pectin story in fruit

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.680 
one aside from the pectin story in fruit
in<00:03:50.840> nature<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.530> also<00:03:52.040> are<00:03:52.340> taking<00:03:52.790> in<00:03:53.000> equal

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
in nature you also are taking in equal

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.199 
in nature you also are taking in equal
amounts<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:54.200> ethanol<00:03:54.859> you<00:03:55.370> get<00:03:55.549> both<00:03:55.760> methanol

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
amounts of ethanol you get both methanol

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.940 
amounts of ethanol you get both methanol
and<00:03:56.359> ethanol<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:57.019> so<00:03:57.170> they<00:03:57.290> counteract<00:03:57.650> each

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
and ethanol and so they counteract each

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.140 
and ethanol and so they counteract each
other<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.400> there<00:03:58.489> is<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:58.940> there's

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
other and there is so there's

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.420 
other and there is so there's
essentially<00:03:59.870> no<00:03:59.989> impact<00:04:00.769> you're<00:04:01.310> not

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
essentially no impact you're not

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.890 
essentially no impact you're not
poisoning<00:04:01.940> yourself<00:04:02.030> when<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.540> take<00:04:02.750> in

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
poisoning yourself when you take in

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.629 
poisoning yourself when you take in
fruit<00:04:03.170> I<00:04:03.349> believe<00:04:03.709> you're<00:04:04.250> poisoning

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
fruit I believe you're poisoning

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.039 
fruit I believe you're poisoning
yourself<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.239> take<00:04:05.419> an<00:04:05.569> aspirin<00:04:05.870> time

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
yourself and you take an aspirin time

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.900 
yourself and you take an aspirin time
what's<00:04:07.010> what's<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.430> difference<00:04:07.819> between

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
what's what's the difference between

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.140 
what's what's the difference between
methyl<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:08.780> ethyl<00:04:08.900> alcohol<00:04:09.970> okay<00:04:10.970> it's<00:04:11.120> a

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150

this<00:06:47.840> brain<00:06:48.110> damage<00:06:48.470> and<00:06:48.620> animals<00:06:49.040> and<00:06:49.990> they

this brain damage and animals and they

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.740 
this brain damage and animals and they
went<00:06:51.200> back<00:06:51.410> to<00:06:51.680> Cyril<00:06:52.040> and<00:06:52.250> we<00:06:52.820> waited<00:06:53.360> to<00:06:53.510> hear

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
went back to Cyril and we waited to hear

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.270 
went back to Cyril and we waited to hear
what<00:06:53.810> Cyril<00:06:54.350> was<00:06:54.410> going<00:06:54.590> to<00:06:54.650> do<00:06:54.740> about<00:06:54.830> this<00:06:55.130> so

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
what Cyril was going to do about this so

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.820 
what Cyril was going to do about this so
the<00:06:55.400> next<00:06:55.550> thing<00:06:55.700> we<00:06:55.910> knew<00:06:56.090> I<00:06:56.470> would<00:06:57.470> say<00:06:57.650> that

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
the next thing we knew I would say that

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.600 
the next thing we knew I would say that

mid seventy three they applied to the

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.570 
mid seventy three they applied to the
FDA<00:07:05.390> for<00:07:05.930> a<00:07:05.960> food<00:07:06.320> additive<00:07:06.680> petition<00:07:07.130> to<00:07:07.400> use

as<00:07:08.259> a<00:07:08.289> sweetener<00:07:08.639> so<00:07:09.639> I<00:07:09.669> called<00:07:10.419> the<00:07:10.569> FDA<00:07:10.870> and<00:07:11.169> I

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
sense dr. Olney was asked by GD searle

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.990 
sense dr. Olney was asked by GD searle
to<00:07:17.740> conduct<00:07:18.069> a<00:07:18.159> study<00:07:18.220> because<00:07:18.729> there<00:07:18.879> was

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 
to conduct a study because there was

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.960 
to conduct a study because there was
some<00:07:19.180> concerns<00:07:19.870> and<00:07:20.259> it's<00:07:20.979> interesting<00:07:21.639> to

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:21.970 
some concerns and it's interesting to

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.029 
some concerns and it's interesting to
note<00:07:22.150> that<00:07:22.180> these<00:07:22.419> concerns<00:07:22.930> came<00:07:23.379> up<00:07:23.620> before

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 
note that these concerns came up before

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:26.100 
note that these concerns came up before
a<00:07:24.069> lot<00:07:24.280> of<00:07:24.400> the<00:07:24.490> major<00:07:24.699> testing<00:07:25.330> into<00:07:25.990> the

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
a lot of the major testing into the

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.129 
a lot of the major testing into the
toxicity<00:07:26.800> of<00:07:26.830> aspartame<00:07:27.430> became<00:07:27.789> apparent

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139 
toxicity of aspartame became apparent

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:31.409 
toxicity of aspartame became apparent
but<00:07:29.139> my<00:07:29.650> thinking<00:07:29.979> as<00:07:30.250> an<00:07:30.400> FDA<00:07:30.669> investigator

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:31.419 
but my thinking as an FDA investigator

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:34.559 
but my thinking as an FDA investigator
is<00:07:31.569> that<00:07:31.720> GD<00:07:32.169> searle<00:07:32.879> already<00:07:33.879> knew<00:07:34.240> that

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:34.569 
is that GD searle already knew that

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:37.770 
is that GD searle already knew that
going<00:07:35.259> into<00:07:35.620> this
