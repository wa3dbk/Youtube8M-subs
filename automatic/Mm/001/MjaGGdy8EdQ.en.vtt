00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
but I get the distinct impression that

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.199 
but I get the distinct impression that
as<00:03:39.100> they<00:03:39.250> were<00:03:39.370> scooping<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:39.910> out<00:03:40.000> of<00:03:40.150> the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.539 
textured can off I got the distinct
impression<00:03:43.959> that<00:03:44.380> again<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:45.010> just<00:03:45.040> came<00:03:45.400> in

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
impression that again it just came in

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.890 
impression that again it just came in
like<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.730> tube<00:03:46.060> at<00:03:46.269> least<00:03:46.450> they<00:03:46.540> were<00:03:46.660> using

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
like a tube at least they were using

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.590 
like a tube at least they were using
their<00:03:47.110> caulking<00:03:47.560> guns<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.970> put<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.269> in<00:03:49.390> there

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
their caulking guns to put it in there

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.490 
their caulking guns to put it in there
but<00:03:50.640> I'm<00:03:51.640> still<00:03:51.970> just<00:03:52.120> not<00:03:52.390> its<00:03:53.140> kind<00:03:53.440> of

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
but I'm still just not its kind of

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.390 
but I'm still just not its kind of
flavorless

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.589

loved<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.930> Crips<00:04:01.970> does<00:04:02.970> actually<00:04:03.239> make<00:04:03.420> them

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
loved the Crips does actually make them

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.369 
loved the Crips does actually make them
there<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:05.000> unless<00:04:06.000> restaurants<00:04:06.750> make<00:04:06.989> the

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
there and unless restaurants make the

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.080 
there and unless restaurants make the
food<00:04:07.590> they're<00:04:08.040> actually<00:04:08.579> make<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.939> food

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
food they're actually make the food

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.610 
food they're actually make the food
there<00:04:09.360> this<00:04:09.659> is<00:04:09.810> not<00:04:09.989> as<00:04:10.170> good<00:04:10.349> and<00:04:12.409> so<00:04:13.409> I<00:04:13.439> mean

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
there this is not as good and so I mean

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.249 
there this is not as good and so I mean
if<00:04:13.709> you're<00:04:13.859> in<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.010> pink<00:04:14.450> if<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.569> don't<00:04:15.720> have

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
if you're in a pink if you don't have

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.939 
if you're in a pink if you don't have
one<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.680> better<00:04:16.859> places<00:04:17.100> near<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:18.949> or

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
one of the better places near you or

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.830 
one of the better places near you or
something<00:04:20.310> like<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.970> think<00:04:21.479> it'll

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
something like that I think it'll

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.570 
something like that I think it'll
suffice<00:04:22.109> if<00:04:22.590> you're<00:04:22.919> more<00:04:23.160> in<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.340> rush<00:04:25.580> it's

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
suffice if you're more in a rush it's

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.710 
suffice if you're more in a rush it's
probably<00:04:26.759> better<00:04:27.240> but<00:04:27.570> it's<00:04:29.419> just<00:04:30.419> for<00:04:30.630> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
probably better but it's just for the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.219 
probably better but it's just for the
money<00:04:31.130> it's<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.250> good<00:04:32.460> deal<00:04:32.639> but<00:04:33.210> I'd<00:04:34.020> rather

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
money it's a good deal but I'd rather

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.850 
money it's a good deal but I'd rather
eat<00:04:34.470> better<00:04:34.710> I'd<00:04:34.949> rather<00:04:35.550> pay<00:04:36.500> two<00:04:37.500> dollars

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
eat better I'd rather pay two dollars

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.969 
eat better I'd rather pay two dollars
