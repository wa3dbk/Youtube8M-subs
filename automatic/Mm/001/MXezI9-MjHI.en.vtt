00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.649 
have little it's a little perforations
there<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.430> goes<00:01:17.640> through<00:01:17.939> you've<00:01:18.450> got<00:01:18.630> a

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
there so that goes through you've got a

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.899 
there so that goes through you've got a
large<00:01:18.960> camera<00:01:19.560> cut<00:01:19.770> out<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.400> works<00:01:20.640> well

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
large camera cut out so that works well

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.690 
large camera cut out so that works well
in<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.659> case<00:01:21.990> acts<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> wallet<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> an

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
in this case acts as a wallet and an

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.490 
in this case acts as a wallet and an
iphone<00:01:24.060> case<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.470> can

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
iphone case so here you can see you can

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.100 
iphone case so here you can see you can
just<00:01:25.860> slip<00:01:26.070> credit<00:01:26.460> cards<00:01:26.790> back<00:01:27.030> here<00:01:27.360> has<00:01:27.780> two

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
just slip credit cards back here has two

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.560 
just slip credit cards back here has two
slits<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.590> credit<00:01:29.040> cards<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:30.390> that's

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
slits for credit cards so that's

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.999 
slits for credit cards so that's
probably<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> max<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.500> could<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.799> you

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
probably the max that you could do you

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.319 
probably the max that you could do you
could<00:01:32.130> probably<00:01:32.340> slip<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:32.909> more<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.299> there

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
could probably slip one more in there

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.080 
could probably slip one more in there
but<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:33.869> going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.380> very<00:01:34.409> tight<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.880> just

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
but it's going to be very tight but just

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.530 
but it's going to be very tight but just
a<00:01:36.180> cool<00:01:36.390> case<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.990> still<00:01:37.229> slim<00:01:38.060> cool<00:01:39.060> design

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
works well this is very high quality and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.469 
works well this is very high quality and
just<00:01:43.259> impressed<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.159> case<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.329> may
