00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
not a lot of people do that but it's

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.030 
not a lot of people do that but it's
actually<00:00:09.269> pretty<00:00:09.660> easy<00:00:09.719> you're<00:00:10.290> putting<00:00:10.920> ink

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
actually pretty easy you're putting ink

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.080 
actually pretty easy you're putting ink
through<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.280> screen<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.730> same<00:00:11.910> way<00:00:12.030> you

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
through the screen the same way you

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.280 
through the screen the same way you
putting<00:00:12.389> through<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.599> screen<00:00:12.780> for<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.990> t-shirt

putting through the screen for a t-shirt

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.570 
putting through the screen for a t-shirt
but<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.799> substrates<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.309> little<00:00:14.490> bit

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
but the substrates a little bit

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.670 
but the substrates a little bit
different<00:00:14.910> let's<00:00:15.389> show<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.599> how<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.470> first

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
different let's show you how the first

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.590 
different let's show you how the first
thing<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:16.980> we're<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.760> use<00:00:18.570> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
thing that we're going to do is use a

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.240 
thing that we're going to do is use a
different<00:00:18.960> ink<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.289> can't<00:00:19.529> use<00:00:19.680> plastisol

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
different ink you can't use plastisol

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.439 
different ink you can't use plastisol
ink<00:00:20.430> when<00:00:20.550> your<00:00:20.670> screen<00:00:20.880> printing<00:00:21.119> stickers

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
ink when your screen printing stickers

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.200 
ink when your screen printing stickers
so<00:00:22.050> today<00:00:22.380> we're<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.830> use<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.340> gloss

most popular style of ink because it's
the<00:00:52.170> most<00:00:52.320> stable<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.730> we're

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the most stable so that's what we're

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.459 
the most stable so that's what we're
going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.090> printing<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:54.510> today<00:00:54.840> now<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
going to be printing with today now the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.990 
going to be printing with today now the
downside<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.100> these<00:00:56.190> inks<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.760> they<00:00:56.850> are

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
downside of these inks is that they are

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.459 
downside of these inks is that they are
sticky<00:00:57.480> because<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.899> solvents<00:00:58.410> in

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
sticky because they have solvents in

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.569 
sticky because they have solvents in
them<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> want<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.129> use<00:00:59.219> them<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
them so you want to use them in a

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.119 
them so you want to use them in a
ventilated<00:01:00.180> area<00:01:00.510> also<00:01:01.260> they<00:01:01.739> need<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.039> be

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
ventilated area also they need to be

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.709 
ventilated area also they need to be
printed<00:01:02.430> through<00:01:02.579> higher<00:01:02.789> mesh<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.390> typically

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
printed through higher mesh we typically

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.240 
printed through higher mesh we typically
recommend<00:01:03.899> printing<00:01:04.290> through<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> 230<00:01:05.070> mesh

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
recommend printing through a 230 mesh

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.830 
recommend printing through a 230 mesh
screen<00:01:05.549> which<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.479> we're<00:01:06.659> printing

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
screen which is what we're printing

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.300 
screen which is what we're printing
through<00:01:07.049> today<00:01:07.290> by<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> way<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.100> sticker

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
through today by the way the sticker

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.530 
through today by the way the sticker
printing<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.150> cool

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
printing is really cool

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
company called print liberation so

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.620 
company called print liberation so
here's<00:01:17.040> our<00:01:17.220> ink<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.270> notice<00:01:18.509> it's

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
here's our ink now if you notice it's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.940 
here's our ink now if you notice it's
pretty<00:01:18.810> thick<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.259> need<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> thin<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.710> down

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
pretty thick so we need to thin it down

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.950 
pretty thick so we need to thin it down
now<00:01:20.790> because<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> solvent<00:01:21.689> based<00:01:21.750> ink

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
now because this is a solvent based ink

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
now because this is a solvent based ink
it's<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> dry<00:01:22.530> extremely<00:01:23.130> fast<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.700> we

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it's going to dry extremely fast and we

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.700 
it's going to dry extremely fast and we
want<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.450> slow<00:01:24.630> down<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.930> drying<00:01:25.200> process

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
want to slow down that drying process

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.289 
want to slow down that drying process
and<00:01:25.950> make<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.400> little<00:01:26.520> bit<00:01:26.640> easier<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.000> print

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
and make it a little bit easier to print

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.789 
and make it a little bit easier to print
with<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.960> we're<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> take<00:01:28.470> what's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
with so we're going to take what's

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.679 
with so we're going to take what's
called<00:01:28.950> thinner<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.549> put<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> ink

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
called thinner and put it in the ink

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.520 
called thinner and put it in the ink
so<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.619> our<00:01:31.740> thinner<00:01:32.210> right<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
so this is our thinner right here and it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.440 
so this is our thinner right here and it
can<00:01:34.740> also<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.220> used<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.520> cleaning<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> ink<00:01:36.240> up

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
can also be used for cleaning the ink up

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.300 
can also be used for cleaning the ink up
because<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.530> air<00:01:37.650> dry<00:01:37.799> ink<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.159> need

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
because this is the air dry ink you need

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.069 
because this is the air dry ink you need
to<00:01:38.400> print<00:01:38.610> very<00:01:38.970> very<00:01:39.240> fast<00:01:39.509> with<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
to print very very fast with it if you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.289 
to print very very fast with it if you
print<00:01:40.380> slow<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.040> it'll<00:01:41.460> dry<00:01:41.820> your<00:01:42.000> screen

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
print slow with it it'll dry your screen

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.060 
print slow with it it'll dry your screen
and<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.899> dry<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.170> your<00:01:43.290> screen<00:01:43.619> you're<00:01:43.920> not

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
and if dry on your screen you're not

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.679 
and if dry on your screen you're not
gonna<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.250> printing<00:01:44.509> anything

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
gonna be printing anything

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.260 
gonna be printing anything
so<00:01:46.170> let's<00:01:46.590> actually<00:01:46.770> mix<00:01:47.280> about<00:01:47.640> three<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
so let's actually mix about three to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.429 
so let's actually mix about three to
five<00:01:48.450> percent<00:01:48.630> we're<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
five percent we're going to go on the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.530 
five percent we're going to go on the
lower<00:01:49.680> end<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> equation<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:51.180> find<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
lower end of the equation we find that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.850 
lower end of the equation we find that
if<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.750> mix<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> too<00:01:52.290> much<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.680> ink

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
if you mix it too much if the ink

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.130 
if you mix it too much if the ink
becomes<00:01:53.100> too<00:01:53.310> thin<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.729> starts<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.509> spider<00:01:54.869> out

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
becomes too thin it starts to spider out

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
becomes too thin it starts to spider out
screen<00:01:56.100> printing<00:01:56.399> stickers<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> little<00:01:57.329> bit

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
screen printing stickers is a little bit

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.609 
screen printing stickers is a little bit
more<00:01:57.509> difficult<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.020> screen<00:01:58.229> print<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.469> t-shirt

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
more difficult in screen print a t-shirt

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.990 
more difficult in screen print a t-shirt
because<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.979> t-shirt<00:01:59.369> if<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.549> think<00:01:59.729> about<00:01:59.790> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
because a t-shirt if you think about it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.080 
because a t-shirt if you think about it
as<00:02:00.290> you<00:02:01.290> know<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.920> got<00:02:02.159> some<00:02:02.189> give<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.880> it

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
as you know it's got some give to it it

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.719 
as you know it's got some give to it it
receives<00:02:03.479> egg<00:02:03.750> moves<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.439> little<00:02:04.560> bit<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:05.070> piece

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
receives egg moves a little bit a piece

of<00:02:05.880> sticker<00:02:06.060> paper<00:02:06.329> vinyl<00:02:06.689> doesn't<00:02:07.590> move<00:02:07.680> at

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
of sticker paper vinyl doesn't move at

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.130 
of sticker paper vinyl doesn't move at
all<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.670> hard<00:02:08.849> substrate<00:02:09.270> making<00:02:10.080> a

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
all so it's a hard substrate making a

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.360 
all so it's a hard substrate making a
little<00:02:10.349> bit<00:02:10.440> more<00:02:10.560> difficult<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:10.979> print<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.340> we

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
little bit more difficult to print so we

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.710 
little bit more difficult to print so we
have<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.730> make<00:02:11.910> sure<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.270> proper<00:02:12.390> off

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
have to make sure we have proper off

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.830 
have to make sure we have proper off
contact

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
contact

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.540 
contact
and<00:02:13.959> put<00:02:14.530> our<00:02:14.650> screen<00:02:14.950> directly<00:02:15.160> onto<00:02:15.430> our

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
and put our screen directly onto our

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.280 
and put our screen directly onto our
platen<00:02:16.030> whatsoever<00:02:16.690> has<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.050> have<00:02:17.140> good

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
platen whatsoever has to have good

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.440 
platen whatsoever has to have good
amount<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.560> off<00:02:17.709> contact<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.430> also<00:02:18.970> RN<00:02:19.180> has<00:02:19.360> to

amount of off contact and also RN has to

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.809 
amount of off contact and also RN has to
be<00:02:19.540> mixed<00:02:19.810> correctly<00:02:20.379> so<00:02:21.069> we're<00:02:21.340> going<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.640> put

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
be mixed correctly so we're going to put

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.460 
be mixed correctly so we're going to put
a<00:02:21.849> little<00:02:22.060> bit<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.599> I'm<00:02:22.780> using<00:02:23.019> a<00:02:23.230> gram

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
a little bit of this in I'm using a gram

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.290 
a little bit of this in I'm using a gram
scale<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:24.129> measuring<00:02:24.640> by<00:02:24.819> weight<00:02:25.090> I'm<00:02:25.269> not

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
scale and measuring by weight I'm not

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.820 
scale and measuring by weight I'm not
going<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.569> mix<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.930> lot<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.319> ink<00:02:26.470> in<00:02:26.590> here<00:02:26.709> I'm

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
going to mix a lot of ink in here I'm

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.220 
going to mix a lot of ink in here I'm
only<00:02:26.890> going<00:02:27.129> to<00:02:27.160> mix<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.459> little<00:02:27.489> bit<00:02:27.849> and<00:02:28.230> it's

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
only going to mix a little bit and it's

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.729 
only going to mix a little bit and it's
very<00:02:29.560> runny<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:31.599> I'm<00:02:31.720> measuring<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:32.410> the

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
very runny and I'm measuring it on the

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:33.900 
very runny and I'm measuring it on the
gram<00:02:33.069> level

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
gram level

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.059 
gram level
alright<00:02:34.720> mixing<00:02:35.049> one<00:02:35.260> gram<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.530> thinner<00:02:35.830> and

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
alright mixing one gram of thinner and

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.619 
alright mixing one gram of thinner and
because<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.670> thinner<00:02:36.849> is<00:02:36.940> not<00:02:37.090> very<00:02:37.330> easy<00:02:37.390> to

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
because the thinner is not very easy to

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.990 
because the thinner is not very easy to
pour<00:02:37.959> we're<00:02:38.560> actually<00:02:38.769> going<00:02:39.129> to<00:02:39.250> be<00:02:39.489> put<00:02:39.790> in<00:02:39.940> a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
pour we're actually going to be put in a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.430 
pour we're actually going to be put in a
little<00:02:40.180> cap<00:02:40.420> here<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.590> we'll<00:02:41.739> mix<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.099> in<00:02:43.440> there

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
little cap here so we'll mix it in there

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.280 
little cap here so we'll mix it in there
we<00:02:44.590> go<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:46.090> we'll<00:02:46.239> mix<00:02:46.360> up<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.660> ink<00:02:46.810> okay

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
we go and then we'll mix up the ink okay

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.050 
we go and then we'll mix up the ink okay
once<00:02:47.590> done<00:02:47.769> mixing<00:02:48.040> go<00:02:48.549> ahead<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.790> cap<00:02:49.030> your

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
once done mixing go ahead and cap your

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.420 
once done mixing go ahead and cap your
ink<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:50.349> an<00:02:50.470> air<00:02:50.590> dry<00:02:50.739> ink<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.160> will

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
ink this is an air dry ink so it will

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.610 
ink this is an air dry ink so it will
dry<00:02:51.670> out<00:02:51.700> if<00:02:52.000> there's<00:02:52.150> any<00:02:52.360> air<00:02:52.599> reaching<00:02:53.500> the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
dry out if there's any air reaching the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.539 
dry out if there's any air reaching the
ink<00:02:53.799> itself<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.959> then<00:02:55.959> we'll<00:02:56.290> actually<00:02:57.250> apply

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
ink itself and then we'll actually apply

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.580 
ink itself and then we'll actually apply
this<00:02:57.760> ink<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.150> screen<00:02:58.569> now<00:02:59.170> we're<00:02:59.349> not

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
this ink to the screen now we're not

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.940 
this ink to the screen now we're not
going<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.950> print<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:01.019> until<00:03:02.019> we're<00:03:02.260> ready<00:03:02.650> so

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
going to print it until we're ready so

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.440 
going to print it until we're ready so
we'll<00:03:03.069> put<00:03:03.250> in<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.400> base<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.910> screen<00:03:04.209> and

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
we'll put in the base of the screen and

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.780 
we'll put in the base of the screen and
then<00:03:04.900> we'll<00:03:05.049> prepare<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.379> substrate<00:03:05.890> okay<00:03:06.610> now

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
then we'll prepare a substrate okay now

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.979 
then we'll prepare a substrate okay now
that<00:03:06.849> inks<00:03:07.120> in<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.299> screen<00:03:07.569> we<00:03:07.660> need<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.870> move

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
that inks in the screen we need to move

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.569 
that inks in the screen we need to move
quickly<00:03:08.290> because<00:03:08.500> this<00:03:08.769> is<00:03:08.890> an<00:03:09.010> air<00:03:09.129> dry<00:03:09.370> ink

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
quickly because this is an air dry ink

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.520 
quickly because this is an air dry ink
so<00:03:10.209> we're<00:03:10.329> actually<00:03:10.450> going<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.900> use<00:03:11.049> spray

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
so we're actually going to use spray

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.949 
so we're actually going to use spray
adhesive<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.040> print<00:03:12.370> this<00:03:12.810> typically<00:03:13.810> you'd

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
adhesive to print this typically you'd

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.199 
adhesive to print this typically you'd
want<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.170> use<00:03:14.349> some<00:03:14.829> type<00:03:15.069> of<00:03:15.310> vacuum<00:03:15.730> palette

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
want to use some type of vacuum palette

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.270 
want to use some type of vacuum palette
that<00:03:16.750> would<00:03:16.870> work<00:03:17.019> best<00:03:17.319> and<00:03:17.650> then<00:03:18.160> we're

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
that would work best and then we're

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.340 
that would work best and then we're
using<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.670> standard<00:03:19.060> calendar<00:03:19.420> vinyl<00:03:19.870> this

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
using a standard calendar vinyl this

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.039 
using a standard calendar vinyl this
vinyl<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.829> also<00:03:21.130> available<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:21.700> sheets<00:03:22.120> but

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
vinyl is also available in sheets but

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.830 
vinyl is also available in sheets but
for<00:03:23.260> this<00:03:23.380> we're<00:03:23.560> just<00:03:23.590> using<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.329> rolled<00:03:25.329> vinyl

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
for this we're just using a rolled vinyl

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.759 
for this we're just using a rolled vinyl
that's<00:03:25.989> rolled<00:03:26.260> out<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:27.160> we've<00:03:27.310> taken<00:03:27.540> the

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
that's rolled out so we've taken the

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.620 
that's rolled out so we've taken the
spray<00:03:29.769> adhesive<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.459> stick<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:31.090> down<00:03:31.150> real

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
spray adhesive to stick that down real

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.970 
spray adhesive to stick that down real
good<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:32.109> it<00:03:32.170> doesn't<00:03:32.500> move<00:03:32.590> during<00:03:32.829> the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
good so it doesn't move during the

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.849 
good so it doesn't move during the
printing<00:03:33.130> process<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:34.079> then<00:03:35.079> we're<00:03:35.709> going<00:03:35.829> to

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
printing process and then we're going to

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.129 
printing process and then we're going to
flood<00:03:36.250> our<00:03:36.400> screen<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.150> with<00:03:37.780> this<00:03:37.900> type<00:03:38.109> of

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
flood our screen and with this type of

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.690 
flood our screen and with this type of
ink<00:03:38.319> you<00:03:38.410> always<00:03:38.769> want<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.040> keep<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.310> flooded

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
ink you always want to keep it flooded

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.240 
ink you always want to keep it flooded
so<00:03:40.480> our<00:03:40.599> screen<00:03:40.930> is<00:03:41.079> flooded<00:03:41.560> ready<00:03:41.829> to<00:03:41.950> print

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
so our screen is flooded ready to print

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.449 
so our screen is flooded ready to print
and<00:03:42.489> then<00:03:43.180> one<00:03:43.419> solid<00:03:43.930> print<00:03:44.290> we<00:03:44.829> got<00:03:44.980> one<00:03:45.220> pass

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
and then one solid print we got one pass

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:54.270 
and then one solid print we got one pass
of<00:03:45.730> this<00:03:50.430> once<00:03:51.430> you've<00:03:51.609> printed<00:03:51.819> lift<00:03:52.810> up<00:03:53.280> move

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
of this once you've printed lift up move

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.680 
of this once you've printed lift up move
your<00:03:54.430> squeeze<00:03:54.700> you<00:03:54.819> over<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.239> flood<00:03:55.540> the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
your squeeze you over and flood the

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.680 
your squeeze you over and flood the
screen<00:03:55.989> back<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:58.090> that's<00:03:58.209> going<00:03:58.359> to<00:03:58.450> load<00:03:58.599> the

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
screen back and that's going to load the

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.020 
screen back and that's going to load the
screen<00:03:58.930> back<00:03:59.139> up<00:03:59.319> with<00:03:59.500> ink<00:03:59.709> allow<00:04:00.579> it<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:00.940> it

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
screen back up with ink allow it so it

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.229 
screen back up with ink allow it so it
does<00:04:01.180> not<00:04:01.359> dry<00:04:02.340> there<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.519> is<00:04:05.639> so<00:04:06.639> our<00:04:06.760> finished

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
does not dry there it is so our finished

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.240 
does not dry there it is so our finished
sticker<00:04:08.049> print<00:04:08.910> then<00:04:09.910> this<00:04:10.569> actually<00:04:10.780> has

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
sticker print then this actually has

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.440 
sticker print then this actually has
plotter<00:04:12.250> marks<00:04:12.609> so<00:04:12.700> you<00:04:12.760> can<00:04:12.940> take<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.090> plotter

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
plotter marks so you can take a plotter

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.900 
plotter marks so you can take a plotter
and<00:04:13.780> plot<00:04:14.319> these<00:04:14.500> out<00:04:14.739> to<00:04:15.430> cut<00:04:15.579> them<00:04:15.700> out<00:04:15.730> or

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
and plot these out to cut them out or

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.069 
and plot these out to cut them out or
you<00:04:16.000> can<00:04:16.060> just<00:04:16.269> use<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.389> cutter<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.750> cut<00:04:16.959> them

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
you can just use a cutter to cut them

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.429 
you can just use a cutter to cut them
out

00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:19.439 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:21.779 

so<00:04:20.439> we're<00:04:20.560> going<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.709> do<00:04:20.829> one<00:04:21.069> more<00:04:21.099> to<00:04:21.549> clear

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
so we're going to do one more to clear

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:22.950 
so we're going to do one more to clear
the<00:04:21.939> screen<00:04:22.120> out<00:04:22.360> we're<00:04:22.539> going<00:04:22.659> to<00:04:22.719> get<00:04:22.780> all

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
the screen out we're going to get all

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.059 
the screen out we're going to get all
the<00:04:23.110> ink<00:04:23.259> from<00:04:23.349> the<00:04:23.530> bottom<00:04:23.800> of<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.949> screen

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:24.069 
the ink from the bottom of the screen

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:25.619 
the ink from the bottom of the screen
and<00:04:24.310> make<00:04:24.490> one<00:04:24.729> more<00:04:24.909> print<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.330> then<00:04:25.419> leave

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:25.629 
and make one more print and then leave

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:26.700 
and make one more print and then leave
the<00:04:25.780> ink<00:04:25.900> at<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.020> top<00:04:26.229> we're<00:04:26.409> actually<00:04:26.499> going

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
the ink at the top we're actually going

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.499 
the ink at the top we're actually going
to<00:04:26.770> not<00:04:26.919> back<00:04:27.189> flood<00:04:27.550> this<00:04:27.969> is<00:04:28.150> what<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.360> do

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
to not back flood this is what you do

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.649 
to not back flood this is what you do
for<00:04:28.689> the<00:04:28.749> end<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.080> job<00:04:29.289> prior<00:04:29.889> to<00:04:30.069> cleaning

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.700 

so<00:04:34.659> if<00:04:34.719> we<00:04:34.779> notice<00:04:34.900> we<00:04:35.050> leave<00:04:35.199> all<00:04:35.379> the<00:04:35.499> ink<00:04:35.620> on

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
so if we notice we leave all the ink on

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.629 
so if we notice we leave all the ink on
the<00:04:35.800> top<00:04:37.949> there<00:04:38.949> we<00:04:39.069> go<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:41.740> now<00:04:42.430> we'll<00:04:42.580> go

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
the top there we go and now we'll go

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.050 
the top there we go and now we'll go
ahead<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:42.879> clean<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:45.460> first<00:04:45.669> thing<00:04:45.819> we<00:04:45.909> want

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
ahead and clean the first thing we want

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.339 
ahead and clean the first thing we want
to<00:04:46.090> do<00:04:46.180> with<00:04:46.300> cleaning<00:04:46.539> is<00:04:46.779> put<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.050> ink<00:04:47.199> back

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
to do with cleaning is put the ink back

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.189 
to do with cleaning is put the ink back
in<00:04:47.499> the<00:04:47.590> container<00:04:47.889> however<00:04:48.400> if<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.580> mix<00:04:48.909> this

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
in the container however if you mix this

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.629 
in the container however if you mix this
mix<00:04:50.199> it<00:04:50.319> down<00:04:50.469> and<00:04:50.770> thinned<00:04:50.949> it<00:04:51.069> you<00:04:51.460> don't

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
mix it down and thinned it you don't

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.860 
mix it down and thinned it you don't
want<00:04:51.789> to<00:04:51.849> put<00:04:51.969> it<00:04:52.060> directly<00:04:52.150> back<00:04:52.539> into<00:04:52.599> the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
want to put it directly back into the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.959 
want to put it directly back into the
container<00:04:53.110> so<00:04:53.800> what<00:04:54.039> we're<00:04:54.159> going<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.460> do<00:04:54.669> is

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
container so what we're going to do is

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:56.850 
container so what we're going to do is
actually<00:04:55.270> just<00:04:55.569> dispose<00:04:56.139> of<00:04:56.169> this<00:04:56.469> ink<00:04:56.740> so

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
actually just dispose of this ink so

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.320 
actually just dispose of this ink so
we'll<00:04:57.009> go<00:04:57.099> ahead<00:04:57.159> and<00:04:57.279> cap<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.729> container<00:04:58.090> and

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
we'll go ahead and cap the container and

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.240 
we'll go ahead and cap the container and
then<00:04:59.080> we'll<00:04:59.830> clean<00:05:00.039> it<00:05:00.069> using<00:05:00.550> solvent<00:05:02.250> for

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
then we'll clean it using solvent for

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.469 
then we'll clean it using solvent for
cleaning<00:05:03.520> purposes<00:05:03.550> an<00:05:03.969> old<00:05:04.090> shirt<00:05:04.300> works

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
cleaning purposes an old shirt works

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.290 
cleaning purposes an old shirt works
well<00:05:04.719> to<00:05:04.840> protect<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.229> platen<00:05:05.620> or<00:05:06.150> going<00:05:07.150> to

well to protect the platen or going to

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.119 
well to protect the platen or going to
use<00:05:07.509> a<00:05:07.539> couple<00:05:07.870> different<00:05:07.960> products<00:05:08.409> here<00:05:08.620> one

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:09.129 
use a couple different products here one

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.559 
use a couple different products here one
product<00:05:09.430> you<00:05:09.490> can<00:05:09.610> use<00:05:09.729> is<00:05:09.909> screen<00:05:10.240> opener

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
product you can use is screen opener

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.899 
product you can use is screen opener
that's<00:05:11.199> a<00:05:11.349> very<00:05:11.560> fast-moving<00:05:12.129> product<00:05:12.729> it'll

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
that's a very fast-moving product it'll

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:14.909 
that's a very fast-moving product it'll
clean<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.180> screen<00:05:13.449> extremely<00:05:13.960> fast<00:05:14.229> the

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
clean the screen extremely fast the

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.350 
clean the screen extremely fast the
other<00:05:15.069> product<00:05:15.400> can<00:05:15.520> uses<00:05:15.789> the<00:05:15.939> fitter<00:05:16.180> that

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
other product can uses the fitter that

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.640 
other product can uses the fitter that
we<00:05:16.479> discussed<00:05:16.839> and<00:05:17.080> then<00:05:17.199> there's<00:05:17.409> also

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
we discussed and then there's also

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.100 
we discussed and then there's also
solvent<00:05:18.249> cleaner<00:05:18.370> so<00:05:18.819> solvent<00:05:19.689> cleaner<00:05:19.870> is<00:05:20.080> a

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
solvent cleaner so solvent cleaner is a

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.800 
solvent cleaner so solvent cleaner is a
little<00:05:20.349> bit<00:05:20.469> more<00:05:20.620> eco<00:05:21.039> friendly<00:05:21.069> and<00:05:21.819> smells

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
little bit more eco friendly and smells

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.170 
little bit more eco friendly and smells
a<00:05:22.960> lot<00:05:23.199> better<00:05:23.560> so<00:05:24.490> typically<00:05:24.879> this<00:05:24.969> would<00:05:25.120> be

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
a lot better so typically this would be

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.379 
a lot better so typically this would be
used<00:05:25.419> in<00:05:25.599> squirt<00:05:25.900> bottle<00:05:26.550> versus<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.909> screen

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
used in squirt bottle versus the screen

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.700 
used in squirt bottle versus the screen
opener<00:05:28.659> but<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:28.839> screen<00:05:29.020> opener<00:05:29.289> is<00:05:29.379> really

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
opener but the screen opener is really

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.070 
opener but the screen opener is really
good<00:05:29.830> for<00:05:29.979> those<00:05:30.099> quick<00:05:30.430> fast<00:05:31.029> cleans<00:05:31.419> we're

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
good for those quick fast cleans we're

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.570 
good for those quick fast cleans we're
going<00:05:32.199> to<00:05:32.289> use<00:05:32.379> just<00:05:32.409> some<00:05:32.680> paper<00:05:32.889> towels<00:05:33.189> you

going to use just some paper towels you
can<00:05:33.729> also<00:05:33.879> use<00:05:34.089> or<00:05:34.990> old<00:05:35.259> rags<00:05:36.189> will<00:05:36.909> work<00:05:37.120> fine

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
can also use or old rags will work fine

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.600 
can also use or old rags will work fine
as<00:05:37.539> well<00:05:37.750> and<00:05:38.020> if<00:05:38.620> you<00:05:38.710> see<00:05:38.949> this<00:05:39.129> we're<00:05:39.430> just

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
you can rack these or you can just lay

you can rack these or you can just lay
them<00:06:22.659> out<00:06:22.750> and<00:06:22.839> open<00:06:23.110> air<00:06:23.229> surfaces<00:06:23.710> and<00:06:23.830> they

them out and open air surfaces and they

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:25.679 
them out and open air surfaces and they
will<00:06:24.039> dry<00:06:24.279> so<00:06:25.000> now<00:06:25.089> we're<00:06:25.180> going<00:06:25.270> to<00:06:25.360> cut<00:06:25.539> these
