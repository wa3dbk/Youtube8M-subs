before<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.900> replace<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.850> take<00:00:23.850> usually<00:00:24.300> has

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
before you replace it I take usually has

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.140 
before you replace it I take usually has
about<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.260> three<00:00:25.590> gallon<00:00:25.830> take<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:27.060> you

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
about I think a three gallon take so you

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.759 
about I think a three gallon take so you
should<00:00:27.510> do<00:00:27.660> as<00:00:27.779> much<00:00:27.930> as<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.109> can<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.470> store

if<00:00:37.920> three<00:00:38.129> gallons<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.520> know<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> Pitti

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
if three gallons you know the Pitti

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.600 
if three gallons you know the Pitti
layer<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.329> should<00:00:39.570> be<00:00:39.690> good<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:40.020> you

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
layer you should be good for you

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.740 
layer you should be good for you
let's<00:00:41.610> do<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> second<00:00:42.360> thing<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.570> want

let's do that the second thing you want
to<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:43.219> you<00:00:44.219> want<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.460> get<00:00:44.550> yourself<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:45.180> towel

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
to do you want to get yourself a towel

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.619 
to do you want to get yourself a towel
perfectly<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> clean<00:00:47.190> towel<00:00:47.430> put<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> towel<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
perfectly a clean towel put a towel to

the west because you're going to be

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.200 
the west because you're going to be
creating<00:00:51.059> some<00:00:51.300> wet<00:00:51.930> messes<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:53.059> so<00:00:54.059> give

creating some wet messes here so give
yourself<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.600> towel<00:00:54.809> third<00:00:55.770> thing<00:00:56.039> you're<00:00:56.850> go

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
yourself a towel third thing you're go

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.340 
yourself a towel third thing you're go
ahead<00:00:57.300> you're<00:00:57.480> gonna<00:00:57.600> turn<00:00:57.719> off<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.140> water

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
ahead you're gonna turn off the water

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.770 
ahead you're gonna turn off the water
valve<00:00:59.030> once<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> water<00:01:00.510> valve

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
valve once you have the water valve

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.460 
valve once you have the water valve
turned<00:01:01.050> off<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:02.100> daddy<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> take

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
turned off you daddy to go to the take

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.450 
turned off you daddy to go to the take
you're<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.650> want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.830> turn<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.100> off<00:01:05.159> as

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
you're going to want to turn that off as

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.940 
you're going to want to turn that off as
well<00:01:05.960> both<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.140> those<00:01:07.229> turned<00:01:07.560> off<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.460> did

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
well both of those turned off you did

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
well both of those turned off you did
well<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.220> ahead<00:01:11.400> open<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> spigot<00:01:12.420> so

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
well to go ahead open up the spigot so

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.330 
well to go ahead open up the spigot so
it<00:01:12.900> kind<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.080> releases<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.650> air<00:01:13.799> pressure<00:01:14.100> out

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
it kind of releases the air pressure out

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.109 
it kind of releases the air pressure out
of<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.580> guess<00:01:15.570> that's<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> third<00:01:16.110> thing

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
of it guess that's the third thing

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.870 
of it guess that's the third thing
fourth<00:01:18.119> thing<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.330> want<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:19.640> while<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
fourth thing you want to do is while the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.749 
fourth thing you want to do is while the
system<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.330> standing<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:22.220> you<00:01:23.220> want<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.490> remove

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
system is standing up you want to remove

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.140 
system is standing up you want to remove
your<00:01:24.090> GTO<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:25.590> gag<00:01:25.830> your<00:01:26.340> set<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> bit<00:01:26.759> filters

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
your GTO your gag your set a bit filters

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120 
your GTO your gag your set a bit filters
and<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.229> pretty<00:01:28.380> much<00:01:28.560> you're<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and you pretty much you're just going to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.510 
and you pretty much you're just going to
take<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.280> rich<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.150> came<00:01:30.329> with<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> system

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
take that rich that came with the system

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.999 
take that rich that came with the system
this<00:01:32.520> filter<00:01:32.790> rich<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.270> you're<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.259> go<00:01:34.439> into

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
this filter rich here you're to go into

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.249 
this filter rich here you're to go into
a<00:01:35.040> clockwise<00:01:35.579> position<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.049> going

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
a clockwise position and then it's going

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.770 
a clockwise position and then it's going

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
steady cup tight it is going to be kind

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.870 
steady cup tight it is going to be kind
of<00:02:50.690> heavy<00:02:50.870> because<00:02:51.800> it's<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.220> filters<00:02:52.580> and

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880
