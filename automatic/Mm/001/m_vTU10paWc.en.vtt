00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
 audio people and welcome to 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.780
 a new shader update video 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.920
 present today and in this video 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.950
 I'll give you the final version of my 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.990
 shaders jap this will be the absolute last 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.090
 be there myself with mine 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.220
 Latin at the end is therefore in the good sense 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.779
 I have no idea what I have 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.730
 could add now without that 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.290
 it's too much performance because how 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.420
 Everyone knows my dad is a no-go 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.980
 Performance shader and that should 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.530
 of course, that should not be 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.890
 ultimate shaders will not be used by anyone 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.140
 can 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.540
 Well, anyway , it went back to me 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.450
 in another view and I'll show you 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.640
 because once the features of the new cadre was 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.190
 here too is the 5.0 and her 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.890
 will it immediately 10 now when we are in 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.240
 the 6.0 change namely we do that 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.700
 you see, you are still here 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.790
 an extra version 6.0 but here I come 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.150
 later we hit the 60 mark 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.220
 and you see it has become extreme 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.720
 So changed only, have I 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.060
 actually only one thing now 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.649
 No fucking added the new version 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.979
 only one thing is mine too 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:23.219
 not remembered to be exact 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.829
 that's the new one, and that's right 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.270
 So I noticed that now than I did 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.619
 i played with rudi place 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.299
 then first with module is a bit 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.229
 played so long because I once such a 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.439
 little more than an hour 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.850
 and I noticed that and that 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.569
 one time in the squad one thing was missing 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.340
 and that of the ss I have none 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.469
 clue what the abbreviation stands for 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.380
 in any case, this is how it works and how it works 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.119
 that's a bit of a turn on now 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.729
 to plant them and in general to everyone 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.859
 block a tiny shadow on it 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.469
 I know every one here 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.240
 I could see right here 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.779
 maybe you can see it well 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.299
 See that you are so small on the song 

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:06.450
 shadows are so tiny and small 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.729
 the captain extreme contrast effect what 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.890
 makes the whole look really good 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.870
 and det is just the big change in the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.910
 shader but unfortunately again 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.590
 performance pulls that means ten apps 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.390
 less like in the 50th 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.830
 that does not mean the people unfortunately 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.560
 could play more of the 5.0 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.240
 still need to be on the 4.0 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.590
 leave for the 4.0 it still the 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.970
 version the least performance 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.460
 attracts 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.310
 Well, in any case, then we come 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.050
 but now for the 6.0 extra because 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.120
 that's why I made it extra 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.680
 It's also called extra for a few 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.990
 people who had a special request 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.420
 but I in the original shader 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.160
 as well as he could not do that 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.390
 that he lob a performance china is 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.930
 and then it has nothing to do with it 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.870
 search 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.960
 it is about the shadow quality, the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.340
 shadow quality in which everyone is here 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.310
 not the best 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.870
 with intention because the sharper the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.800
 Shadows are the more performance 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.020
 is pulled 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.430
 that is clear that you are there you can 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.800
 do not change anything because you have to 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.690
 superior minecraft has no no has 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.140
 lead markets twittert predetermined shadow 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.000
 and no given world that 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.000
 means the computer has to be all in shadow 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.610
 real time edges and the sharper the 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.110
 Shadows are up to the sea 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.490
 render and will be the problem 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.840
 That's why I have the extra version 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.220
 Made for the people who like to be in yours 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.830
 although shader they actually play 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.989
 have a powerful pc and the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.670
 I'm looking out for people now 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.470
 easy lay down the might be a 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.000
 new video now a few frames below 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.530
 turn it on now and you 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.570
 See the shadow quality has changed 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.290
 So much improved that is here 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.660
 now the quality now and that is the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.250
 quality before you see it has become 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.160
 extremely changed you can see the quality 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.410
 from the current shader here from the 6.0 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.060
 normal but of course change here too 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.650
 here is that is already on the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.880
 many will play at the highest level 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.870
 I come with this shadow quality 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.590
 have no idea is off it's afloat 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.390
 do 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.610
 definitely nice us multi has 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.959
 I always like to be four and now 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.620
 with the extra version it stops 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.030
 of course, had extremely starfish 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.550
 there it was actually to the 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.530
 last and final shader notions 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.410
 and I hope you liked that 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.600
 and then next time and me 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.120
 would say weight like or because 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.040
 and it is a little stupid please now 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.510
 from me helps me a bit the 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.240
 To spread shader I have one 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.490
 tweet in minecraft forum posted the 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.220
 already over 13,000 creekside 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.100
 where 13,000 clicks you really say 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.900
 and I would be very happy if you 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.550
 man is a little bit would spread 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.020
 still because i want everyone with shader 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.350
 this is actually the goal 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.120
 this shader and that is mine 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.800
 Goodbye and see you in the 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.800
 next video look de
