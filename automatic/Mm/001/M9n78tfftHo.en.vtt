00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.460 

we're<00:00:07.700> going<00:00:07.820> to<00:00:07.880> fit<00:00:08.120> some<00:00:08.330> run-flat<00:00:09.230> tires

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:09.470 
we're going to fit some run-flat tires

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.780 
we're going to fit some run-flat tires
using<00:00:10.040> a<00:00:10.100> conventional<00:00:10.370> tire<00:00:10.730> changer

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
using a conventional tire changer

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.310 
using a conventional tire changer
just<00:00:11.910> run<00:00:12.059> through<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> procedures<00:00:13.140> that<00:00:13.260> you

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
just run through the procedures that you

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.959 
just run through the procedures that you
might<00:00:13.530> come<00:00:13.710> across<00:00:13.800> when<00:00:14.639> you're<00:00:14.760> fitting

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
might come across when you're fitting

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.850 
might come across when you're fitting
run<00:00:15.120> flat<00:00:15.300> tires<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.800> ultra<00:00:16.800> high

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
run flat tires and ultra high

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.040 
run flat tires and ultra high
performance<00:00:16.890> tires<00:00:17.540> okay<00:00:18.540> so<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> first

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
performance tires okay so the first

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.310 
performance tires okay so the first
thing<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.320> need<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.470> do<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.740> break<00:00:19.950> the<00:00:20.070> bead

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
thing we need to do is break the bead

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.660 
thing we need to do is break the bead
obviously<00:00:22.320> we've<00:00:22.439> got<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.590> be<00:00:22.740> careful<00:00:22.950> with<00:00:23.310> a

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
obviously we've got to be careful with a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.839 
obviously we've got to be careful with a
lot<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.619> BMW<00:00:25.619> wheels<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.610> you<00:00:27.270> have<00:00:27.300> a

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
lot of BMW wheels and so on you have a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.089 
lot of BMW wheels and so on you have a
tire<00:00:29.849> pressure<00:00:30.060> sensor<00:00:30.540> which<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.560> normally

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
tire pressure sensor which is normally

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
tire pressure sensor which is normally
on<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> valve<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.730> sometimes<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.329> at<00:00:33.510> 180

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
on the valve but sometimes it's at 180

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.080 
on the valve but sometimes it's at 180
degrees<00:00:34.559> from<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.890> valve<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.790> ordinarily

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
degrees from the valve so ordinarily

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.030 
degrees from the valve so ordinarily
we'd<00:00:36.329> break<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> bead<00:00:36.809> at<00:00:37.140> 90<00:00:37.470> degrees<00:00:37.800> from

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
we'd break the bead at 90 degrees from

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.610 
we'd break the bead at 90 degrees from
the<00:00:38.190> valve<00:00:38.930> what<00:00:39.930> we've<00:00:40.050> got<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the valve what we've got on here is a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.520 
the valve what we've got on here is a
plastic<00:00:41.510> protector<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.930> there's<00:00:43.410> no

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
plastic protector so that there's no

00:00:43.530 --> 00:01:08.670 
plastic protector so that there's no
metal<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.950> metal<00:00:44.220> contact<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:45.150> the<00:00:45.240> rim

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.720 

so<00:01:09.680> now<00:01:09.770> we've<00:01:09.890> broken<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.250> back<00:01:10.400> bead<00:01:10.580> all

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
so now we've broken the back bead all

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.090 
so now we've broken the back bead all
the<00:01:10.760> way<00:01:10.850> around<00:01:11.210> we<00:01:11.930> can<00:01:12.080> clamp<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:12.500> on<00:01:12.770> the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
the way around we can clamp it on the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.080 
the way around we can clamp it on the
turntable<00:01:13.640> using<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.030> clamping<00:01:14.570> jaws<00:01:16.090> now

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
turntable using the clamping jaws now

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.120 
turntable using the clamping jaws now
we're<00:01:17.210> going<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.360> clamp<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.780> wheel<00:01:18.140> into<00:01:18.470> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
we're going to clamp the wheel into the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.770 
we're going to clamp the wheel into the
jaws<00:01:19.460> using<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:19.910> clamping<00:01:20.270> jaws

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
jaws using the clamping jaws

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.560 
jaws using the clamping jaws
we've<00:01:21.290> got<00:01:21.470> plastic<00:01:22.160> protectors<00:01:22.700> on<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.360> jaws

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
we've got plastic protectors on the jaws

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.890 
we've got plastic protectors on the jaws
at<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.840> moment<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.940> just<00:01:25.940> to<00:01:26.119> again<00:01:26.390> stop<00:01:26.720> any

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
at the moment and just to again stop any

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.590 
at the moment and just to again stop any
metal<00:01:27.140> on<00:01:27.229> metal<00:01:27.260> contact<00:01:28.390> because<00:01:29.390> some

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
metal on metal contact because some

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.630 
metal on metal contact because some
wheels<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:30.020> might<00:01:30.200> have<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.590> mount<00:01:30.950> face<00:01:31.310> down

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
wheels you might have to mount face down

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.020 
wheels you might have to mount face down
and<00:01:32.210> obviously<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:32.990> metal<00:01:33.410> jaw<00:01:34.220> is<00:01:34.460> going<00:01:34.970> to

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
and obviously this metal jaw is going to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.440 
and obviously this metal jaw is going to
foul<00:01:35.990> on<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.290> rim<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:36.650> cause<00:01:37.280> damage<00:01:37.490> so

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
foul on the rim and cause damage so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.240 
foul on the rim and cause damage so
we've<00:01:38.570> got<00:01:38.690> these<00:01:38.780> plastic<00:01:39.160> protectors<00:01:40.160> on

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
we've got these plastic protectors on

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.060 
we've got these plastic protectors on
the<00:01:40.340> jaws<00:01:40.520> here<00:01:41.110> okay<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:42.170> if<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.470> locate<00:01:42.890> the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
the jaws here okay so if I locate the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.820 
the jaws here okay so if I locate the
rim<00:01:43.490> into<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.000> two<00:01:44.180> back<00:01:44.450> jaws<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.680> they're

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
rim into the two back jaws so they're

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.770 
rim into the two back jaws so they're
inside<00:01:46.280> of<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.610> jaws<00:01:46.820> not<00:01:47.180> on<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.330> outside

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
inside of the jaws not on the outside

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.980 
inside of the jaws not on the outside
I<00:01:48.250> can<00:01:49.250> then<00:01:49.369> gently<00:01:51.250> post<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.430> jaws<00:01:52.640> in<00:01:52.990> so

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
I can then gently post the jaws in so

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.320 
I can then gently post the jaws in so
they're<00:01:54.140> in<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.320> correct<00:01:54.560> position<00:01:55.149> once<00:01:56.149> I'm

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
they're in the correct position once I'm

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.749 
they're in the correct position once I'm
happy<00:01:56.660> that<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.840> jaws<00:01:57.050> are<00:01:57.950> in<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.160> located

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
happy that the jaws are in the located

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.460 
happy that the jaws are in the located
in<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.910> correct<00:01:59.119> position<00:01:59.509> I<00:01:59.600> can<00:01:59.810> activate

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
in the correct position I can activate

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.900

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
the bead all the way down okay so I'm

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.050 
the bead all the way down okay so I'm
going<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.530> demonstrate<00:02:48.680> using<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.430> magic

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
going to demonstrate using the magic

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.780 
going to demonstrate using the magic

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.650 
one okay so once you've got the tire to
the<00:04:28.060> level<00:04:28.360> of<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:29.160> D<00:04:30.160> mount<00:04:30.370> head<00:04:30.550> or<00:04:31.390> we<00:04:31.510> now

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
the level of the D mount head or we now

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.300 
the level of the D mount head or we now
have<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:31.930> do<00:04:32.080> is<00:04:32.200> just<00:04:32.350> push<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.890> tire<00:04:33.100> lever

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
have to do is just push the tire lever

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.280 
have to do is just push the tire lever
down<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.730> just<00:04:34.270> make<00:04:34.360> sure<00:04:34.720> that<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:35.050> tire

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
down and just make sure that the tire

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.260 
down and just make sure that the tire
has<00:04:35.560> actually<00:04:35.860> reached<00:04:36.040> above<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.850> level<00:04:37.120> of

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
has actually reached above the level of

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.030 
has actually reached above the level of
the<00:04:37.510> knuckle<00:04:37.900> of<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.169> D<00:04:38.440> mount<00:04:38.620> head<00:04:38.800> here

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
the knuckle of the D mount head here

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.950 
the knuckle of the D mount head here
once<00:04:39.790> wrote<00:04:39.970> that<00:04:40.000> position<00:04:40.480> we<00:04:40.810> can<00:04:40.900> then

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
once wrote that position we can then

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.670 
once wrote that position we can then
just<00:04:41.260> proceed<00:04:41.590> with<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.860> turntable<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:42.790> just

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
just proceed with the turntable and just

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.630 
just proceed with the turntable and just
watch<00:04:44.680> as<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:44.919> removes<00:04:45.190> it

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.400 

so<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:51.420> next<00:04:51.570> thing<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:51.810> need<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:51.990> do<00:04:52.170> is<00:04:52.260> with

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
so the next thing I need to do is with

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.320 
so the next thing I need to do is with
the<00:04:52.440> new<00:04:52.650> tire<00:04:52.920> when<00:04:53.490> I'm<00:04:53.580> before<00:04:53.880> I<00:04:53.910> remount

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
the new tire when I'm before I remount

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.380 
the new tire when I'm before I remount
it<00:04:54.570> I<00:04:54.780> want<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.650> get<00:04:56.100> some<00:04:56.280> lubrication<00:04:56.700> so<00:04:57.360> I

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
it I want to get some lubrication so I

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.390 
it I want to get some lubrication so I
paste<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:58.080> just<00:04:58.110> paste<00:04:58.920> it<00:04:59.160> around<00:04:59.310> the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
paste and just paste it around the

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.570 
paste and just paste it around the
inside<00:04:59.630> of<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.780> bead<00:05:01.100> just<00:05:02.100> make<00:05:02.340> sure<00:05:02.490> that's

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
inside of the bead just make sure that's

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.670 
inside of the bead just make sure that's
nice<00:05:02.790> and<00:05:03.030> lubricated<00:05:03.320> freeze<00:05:04.320> when<00:05:04.560> you're

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
nice and lubricated freeze when you're

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.050 
nice and lubricated freeze when you're
remounting<00:05:07.460> okay<00:05:08.460> so<00:05:08.520> we're<00:05:08.760> going<00:05:08.850> to<00:05:08.910> use

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
remounting okay so we're going to use

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.360 
remounting okay so we're going to use
the<00:05:09.270> bead<00:05:09.780> blocks<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.320> remount<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.010> tire<00:05:11.220> as

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
the bead blocks to remount the tire as

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
the bead blocks to remount the tire as
well<00:05:12.590> register<00:05:13.590> what<00:05:14.280> I<00:05:14.310> do<00:05:14.370> is<00:05:14.580> as<00:05:14.700> I<00:05:14.820> turn<00:05:15.300> the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
well register what I do is as I turn the

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.920 
well register what I do is as I turn the
turntable<00:05:15.630> just<00:05:16.110> put<00:05:16.740> these<00:05:16.830> into<00:05:17.160> here<00:05:17.370> and

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
turntable just put these into here and

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.800 
turntable just put these into here and
then<00:05:19.670> we're<00:05:20.670> going<00:05:20.760> to<00:05:20.820> use<00:05:20.880> this<00:05:21.090> arm<00:05:21.360> it's

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
then we're going to use this arm it's

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.810 
then we're going to use this arm it's
just<00:05:21.990> going<00:05:22.140> to<00:05:22.400> instead<00:05:23.400> of<00:05:23.490> holding<00:05:23.790> down

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
just going to instead of holding down

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.340 
just going to instead of holding down
you're<00:05:24.150> going<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.300> use<00:05:24.480> this<00:05:24.630> this<00:05:24.900> arm<00:05:25.110> here

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
you're going to use this this arm here

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.600 
you're going to use this this arm here
and<00:05:25.710> then<00:05:25.920> your<00:05:26.040> the<00:05:26.160> roller<00:05:26.370> which<00:05:26.580> is

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
and then your the roller which is

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.850 
and then your the roller which is
constantly<00:05:27.060> feeding<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.540> tire<00:05:27.780> down<00:05:28.530> into

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
constantly feeding the tire down into

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.710 
constantly feeding the tire down into
the<00:05:28.950> well<00:05:29.130> of<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.580> wheel<00:05:29.760> so<00:05:30.180> as<00:05:30.240> we<00:05:30.390> just<00:05:30.420> turn

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
the well of the wheel so as we just turn

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.190 
the well of the wheel so as we just turn
the<00:05:30.750> turntable<00:05:31.020> it<00:05:31.380> does<00:05:31.650> it<00:05:31.770> will<00:05:31.860> itself
