on in this game get to mining and get to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.330 
on in this game get to mining and get to
harvesting<00:01:39.659> those<00:01:39.840> trees<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.950> soon<00:01:41.189> as

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
harvesting those trees and as soon as

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.219 
harvesting those trees and as soon as
you<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.549> small<00:01:41.909> plot<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.299> land<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.960> would

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
you get a small plot of land I would

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.249 
you get a small plot of land I would
highly<00:01:44.070> suggest<00:01:44.509> focusing<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.659> lumber

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
highly suggest focusing on lumber

to look for one that's for any size

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.620 
to look for one that's for any size
because<00:02:23.820> that's<00:02:24.150> where<00:02:24.360> you're<00:02:24.450> gonna<00:02:24.510> be

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
because that's where you're gonna be

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.570 
because that's where you're gonna be
able<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.840> place<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.230> small<00:02:25.500> houses<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.160> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
able to place the small houses and the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.960 
able to place the small houses and the
small<00:02:26.940> farm<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.410> small<00:02:28.710> farm<00:02:29.040> plots<00:02:29.280> once

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
small farm the the small farm plots once

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.520 
small farm the the small farm plots once
you<00:02:30.090> find<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.450> place<00:02:30.480> right<00:02:30.960> now<00:02:31.140> it's<00:02:31.350> going<00:02:31.470> to

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
you find a place right now it's going to

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.990 
you find a place right now it's going to
be<00:02:31.620> very<00:02:31.770> hard<00:02:32.070> if<00:02:32.220> you're<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.580> Alpha<00:02:32.880> to

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
be very hard if you're in the Alpha to

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.550 
be very hard if you're in the Alpha to
find<00:02:33.210> something<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.690> low-level<00:02:33.990> zone<00:02:34.350> so

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
find something in the low-level zone so

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.960 
find something in the low-level zone so
I<00:02:34.590> suggest<00:02:35.040> looking<00:02:35.160> in<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.520> higher-level

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
I suggest looking in the higher-level

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.660 
I suggest looking in the higher-level
zones<00:02:36.330> once<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.140> find<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.470> place<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:38.160> just<00:02:38.190> set

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
zones once you find a place you just set

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.520 
zones once you find a place you just set
down<00:02:38.850> your<00:02:38.910> house<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.840> decide<00:02:40.290> what

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
down your house you decide what

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.200 
down your house you decide what
direction<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:41.160> want<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.430> face<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.850> in<00:02:41.970> and

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
direction you want to face it in and

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.720 
direction you want to face it in and
then<00:02:42.600> it's<00:02:42.750> time<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.410> take<00:02:43.770> those<00:02:44.010> materials

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
then it's time to take those materials

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.660 
then it's time to take those materials
turn<00:02:45.690> them<00:02:45.900> into<00:02:46.050> trade<00:02:46.440> packs<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:47.070> carry

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
turn them into trade packs and carry

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.790 
turn them into trade packs and carry
those<00:02:47.880> trade<00:02:48.210> backs<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.900> your<00:02:49.200> house<00:02:49.410> for

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
those trade backs to your house for

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.710 
those trade backs to your house for
construction<00:02:50.490> now<00:02:50.910> at<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> same<00:02:51.330> time<00:02:51.570> that

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
construction now at the same time that

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.690 
construction now at the same time that
we<00:02:51.810> built<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.140> house<00:02:52.320> we<00:02:52.560> also<00:02:52.740> built<00:02:53.070> my<00:02:53.250> 16

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
we built the house we also built my 16

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.180 
we built the house we also built my 16
by<00:02:53.880> 16<00:02:53.940> farm<00:02:54.630> plot<00:02:54.900> again<00:02:55.560> Here<00:02:55.740> I<00:02:55.770> am<00:02:55.890> with<00:02:56.160> my

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
by 16 farm plot again Here I am with my

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.370 
by 16 farm plot again Here I am with my
buddy<00:02:56.580> Oscar<00:02:56.850> as<00:02:57.390> we<00:02:57.840> put<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.170> thing

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
buddy Oscar as we put this thing

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.680 
buddy Oscar as we put this thing
together<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.340> once<00:02:59.610> again<00:02:59.790> just<00:03:00.300> like<00:03:00.390> with

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
together so once again just like with

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.180 
together so once again just like with
the<00:03:00.870> boat<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.470> fairly<00:03:01.800> straightforward

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
the boat it's a fairly straightforward

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.940 
the boat it's a fairly straightforward
process<00:03:02.910> it's<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.750> matter<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.110> time<00:03:04.620> to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
process it's just a matter of time to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.770 
process it's just a matter of time to
get<00:03:05.160> all<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.610> required<00:03:06.000> materials<00:03:06.600> together

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
get all the required materials together

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.020 
get all the required materials together
first<00:03:07.590> thing<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.890> do<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.220> head<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.520> Mirage

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
first thing you do is head to Mirage

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.210
