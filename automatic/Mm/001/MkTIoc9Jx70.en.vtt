 the prototype category of the championship 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.830
 Italian of the mountain was confirmed 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.940
 also in the ninth round of the championship 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.179
 disputed in gubbio is more than ever 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.370
 balanced and engaging they seem 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.080
 now light years away the times when 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.170
 he was a single pilot to dominate the 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.850
 season this year on eight races 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.530
 the prototypes in fact did not take the 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.530
 away in the Camonica valley 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.720
 we had five different winners 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.180
 after the three statements of savoldi le 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.309
 two of ireland and the victories of disasters 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.050
 pezzolla this time it's touched 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.790
 rich net to win a victory 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.380
 absolute in food n for doubtful bracconi e 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.420
 this in fact the real name of the pilot 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.850
 Osella 's success achieved 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.620
 on the Madonna of the top represents the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.590
 first statement in a race of 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.260
 rich italian league stands 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.640
 going through a truly magical moment 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.489
 after the excellent second place conquered 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.020
 to rieti in the sixth round of the championship 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.300
 the Arezzo had won big the 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.170
 climbing of the thorn then presenting himself 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.329
 in Umbrian land in great shape but on 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.100
 route of the throats of the Bottaccione ha 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.020
 found a franz egger waiting for him 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.560
 in search of his second 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.659
 personal affirmation and skirmishes 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.909
 between the two they started already in the tests 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.280
 Saturday with a call and response from 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.079
 high technical content 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.569
 rick was in fact the fastest in the 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.639
 first ascent while shyer imposed himself 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:30.880
 in the second resulting the best 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:32.529
 of the day but in the ricky race has 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.520
 practically closed the speech on the 

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:36.039
 final results 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.679
 already in the first ascent sketching like 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.499
 lightning on the fast track of 4 km 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.450
 while the South Tyrolean rival could not 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.520
 take full advantage of the performance of the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.679
 his locks accusing more than two 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.450
 seconds of delay 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.639
 the excellent fabrizio was inserted between the two 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.270
 bellhops who on the streets of the house do not 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:57.369
 he was really spared in the second one 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.079
 manche jager tried to recover it 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.729
 disadvantage but could only a 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.279
 equal the time of rich of the 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.030
 second ascent recovering however the 

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:08.770
 square of honor 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.060
 to the detriment of bellboys very good third 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.030
 nice also the brawl for the positions 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.310
 close to the podium it prevailed by arming 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.850
 honest and stanislao on the sea 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.430
 encouraging bielanski in seventh place 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.930
 centered by denny zardo who brought 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.050
 to the absolute debut in hillclimbing 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.760
 the latest creation pad prototype 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.950
 of the Florentine builder but the fulcrum 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.920
 of the fight for the championship in the race 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.750
 of gubbio has moved to class p2 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.180
 where they returned to compete as they already were 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.390
 happened to fasano rosario iaquinta e 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.070
 mirco savoldi and we must immediately say that 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.890
 the response of the ninth test of 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.780
 championship was a tie since 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.000
 iaquinta dominated the tests while 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.620
 savoldi won the car race was going 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.790
 today it was eighty percent 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.870
 I had a great time because he has 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.580
 track is really nice well kept 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.200
 It seems a track so to me everything 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.160
 that look like track makes me very much 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.019
 happy and very very performing 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.269
 second round in the race with a gap 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.709
 total of just over a second yes 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.780
 still maintains the command of the 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.450
 championship classification for only three 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.239
 tests from the term the few cents to the 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.709
 first ascent another few to the second 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.110
 having him 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.450
 we continue to keep the head of the 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.900
 ranking and we will try to repeat it 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.940
 that as much as possible but both savoldi and 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.560
 iaquinta to win the title of 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.170
 Italian champion will have to deal 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.140
 with mario beans winner also a 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.269
 gubbio of the class p3 the pilot of the 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.070
 Val d'Elsa stable has built his own 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.859
 ninth win of the season in particular 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.609
 in the second run ahead of lucio 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.079
 ferrari and fabrizio peroni very much 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.320
 satisfied however at the end of the race 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.640
 the Trentino lucio ferrari also appeared 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.810
 eager to compete in the test of 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.080
 bondone house 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.390
 I had never participated in this race 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.300
 like a fun race even if short 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.100
 in two manche is beautiful I liked it and 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.490
 I'm also happy with the result 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.520
 second place behind a mario beans 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.380
 that is going very fast with a p 3 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.690
 for me this year is a car 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.690
 new we made the king we are 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.290
 doing very good times and we hope 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.290
 to continue 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.389
 in some ways it can be considered 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.180
 the driver of the turning point in 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.190
 tricolor antonino hill climbs la 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.410
 old indeed has the great merit of 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.800
 to have been among the first to believe in 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.169
 super climb cars and if today in the 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.479
 food competitions we believe are committed 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.910
 these beautiful cars capable of 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.479
 incredible performance and fascination 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.320
 the public 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.690
 the merit is also a bit his when 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.190
 in fact the pilot from Potenza decided to 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.259
 dispute the entire season of 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.759
 mountain championship with an alpha 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:05.669
 155 ex dtm his idea was evaluated with 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.889
 great skepticism of most 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.430
 the car was both exceptional but at least 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.139
 on a little card suits climbs 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.810
 car designed for launched starts 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.110
 very powerful but maybe too much 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.500
 sophisticated with a setup that 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.060
 needed many kilometers of tests 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.750
 and instead it was not so 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.360
 the old in 1996 season of his 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.729
 official debut in the cdm won the 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.199
 Italian title of the super climb with 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.409
 a championship final indeed 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.360
 thrilling 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:40.969
 but we know better the color bearer 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.039
 of the power promotor passing from his 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:44.929
 debut at the federal course of cassaria 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.419

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:02.300
 the adventure with the alpha romeo with a 155 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:04.729
 v6 ti the debut is those with a bang 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.559
 with the victory conquered in Viterbo it is 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.559
 the third step of the centered podium 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:11.389
 in the run of the champions 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:16.159
 the rest is the story of our days 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:17.809
 in 1996 it had to do with the alpha 155 v6 the 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:20.149
 title of super Italian champion 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:23.179

 beautiful season 1996 the season in 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:36.319
 course is really turning out to be true 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.329
 unrepeatable with 9 successes centered at 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:40.490
 record breaking in as many races 

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:42.800
