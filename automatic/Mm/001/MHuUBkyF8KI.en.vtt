00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:03.073
 (light jazz piano music) 

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:06.741
 [Voiceover] Just a few years after 

00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:08.647
 what was the palace of the Medici family completed 

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:10.262
 get a few blocks away from him 

00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:11.747
 another rich Florentine family 

00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:13.709
 she also built a palace. 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.880
 [Voiceover] It was actually a boom in the construction of palaces 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.982
 after the Medici had built their own. 

00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:20.501
 So now we're looking at Rucealli Palace, 

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.461
 whose architect was famous Alberti. 

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:25.447
 Alberti was a brilliant humanist. 

00:00:25.447 --> 00:00:27.664
 He wrote an important book on architecture 

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:29.707
 and the famous painting book. 

00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:30.903
 Alberti's "About Architecture" 

00:00:30.903 --> 00:00:32.759
 is probably the most important treatise 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.325
 about architecture by 10 books on architecture 

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.358
 from the ancient roman Vitruvia. 

00:00:37.358 --> 00:00:38.821
 [Voiceover] Yes, which have only been discovered 

00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.098
 a few decades earlier. 

00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:41.745
 So here's a complete revival 

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:43.406
 architecture of ancient Rome. 

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:46.401
 We can observe this a little at the Medici Palace, 

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:50.163
 but it was very much reflected in the Rucellai Palace by Alberti. 

00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:51.301
 [Voiceover] Fascinating is that 

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:54.621
 Alberti looks back at Vitruvio's ancient work, 

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.978
 see the standardized dictionary 

00:00:56.978 --> 00:01:00.159
 and uses it in his own shy way 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.481
 which foreshadows its historicism. 

00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:03.839
 [Voiceover] Announces his look back 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.545
 on the architecture of ancient Rome. 

00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:07.438
 Alberti stayed in Rome 

00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:09.760
 he studied the ancient Roman archaeological. 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.617
 [Voiceover] And this kalsicism is not evident 

00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:13.440
 only in individual elements 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.004
 but also in emphasis on dimensions and harmony. 

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:20.336
 Giovanni Rucellai was a wealthy Florentine family 

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:21.903
 wool manufacturers. 

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:23.343
 [Voiceover] Like most rich Florentines, 

00:01:23.343 --> 00:01:24.584
 in this way they gained their wealth. 

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.757
 [Voiceover] At this particular moment 

00:01:25.757 --> 00:01:26.895
 history of Florence 

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:28.381
 It was important to Rucellai 

00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:31.539
 he expressed his loyalty to the Medici family. 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.280
 Alberti clearly referred to 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.243
 Medici Palace, 

00:01:34.243 --> 00:01:36.902
 and you can see it in the facade layout 

00:01:36.902 --> 00:01:38.783
 to the three main floors. 

00:01:38.783 --> 00:01:40.874
 But we also have very important differences here, 

00:01:40.874 --> 00:01:42.812
 which can be seen mainly on masonry. 

00:01:42.812 --> 00:01:45.576
 For example, this building is much finer, 

00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:48.315
 it's gone this massive, dark, rustic brickwork 

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:50.219
 we saw on the previous building. 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:51.797
 [Voiceover] Right, it seemed, 

00:01:51.797 --> 00:01:54.758
 that the Medici Palace is almost like a fortress 

00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:56.593
 and recalled the Palazzo Vecchio. 

00:01:56.593 --> 00:01:58.357
 [Voiceover] This building is more intellectual 

00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:02.188
 with its geometry, clarity, it is a sense of intellect. 

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.336
 [Voiceover] So we see more classic elements here 

00:02:04.336 --> 00:02:06.437
 than we saw at the Medici Palace. 

00:02:06.437 --> 00:02:09.014
 There are pilasters, full arches, 

00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:11.278
 although we have already seen it at Medici Palace. 

00:02:11.278 --> 00:02:15.017
 But between the floors there is a simple ledge 

00:02:15.017 --> 00:02:17.710
 more classical puts 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.195
 which makes us feel horizontal, 

00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:23.038
 and between ground floor and first floor 

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:25.570
 it is filled with decorative patterns. 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.091
 We see the Medici family sign 

00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:29.795
 a diamond ring with three lips coming out of it 

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:32.270
 and between the second and third floors 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.776
 we see the Rucellai family sign 

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:37.249
 that is, a sail that seems tense in the wind. 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.023
 [Voiceover] When you start from the bottom 

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:38.797
 as well as the Medici Palace, 

00:02:38.797 --> 00:02:39.571
 there are benches on the ground floor 

00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.196
 which encourages the citizens of the city 

00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:44.052
 to come and rest. 

00:02:44.052 --> 00:02:45.132
 [Voiceover] So downstairs 

00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:46.315
 it really works as a ground floor. 

00:02:46.315 --> 00:02:48.011
 It feels meaningful 

00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:49.532
 which is based on this diamond pattern. 

00:02:49.532 --> 00:02:52.028
 [Voiceover] And how to move to the facade 

00:02:52.028 --> 00:02:53.677
 you will see three groups of pilasters. 

00:02:53.677 --> 00:02:56.137
 Each with a different type of warhead. 

00:02:56.137 --> 00:02:57.612
 Below you see variations on the Tuscan tradition, 

00:02:57.612 --> 00:03:00.549
 or the simplest and full. 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.314
 Ionic shapes above them 

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:03.314
 and the top of the Corinthian. 

00:03:03.314 --> 00:03:04.334
 [Voiceover] And we can see this order distribution 

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:06.052
 also at Kolossea in Rome 

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.793
 where is the Tuscan order beneath, 

00:03:08.793 --> 00:03:11.288
 the middle floor is decorated with the Ionic order 

00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:13.274
 and above is Corinthian. 

00:03:13.274 --> 00:03:16.049
 So Alberti is obviously watching 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.185
 in ancient Rome and architecture. 

00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:18.812
 [Voiceover] But the emphasis is not on verticals 

00:03:18.812 --> 00:03:20.228
 even when the pilasters penetrate 

00:03:20.228 --> 00:03:22.654
 from the ground floor to the top. 

00:03:22.654 --> 00:03:24.454
 The pilasters are interrupted 

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:25.812
 with these elaborate qualities 

00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:27.494
 that emphasize horizontalism 

00:03:27.494 --> 00:03:29.376
 building anchor attribute. 

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.605
 [Voiceover] The building has never been completed. 

00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:33.729
 Approximately 2/3 of what Alberti intended was there. 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.528
 Being unfinished can be seen on the right, 

00:03:35.528 --> 00:03:38.269
 there would be a third entrance. 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.509
 [Voiceover] Alberti did more than just a facade. 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.215
 The structure was remodeled from within, 

00:03:42.215 --> 00:03:44.270
 by combining a number of previously existing independent structures. 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.906
 [Voiceover] Alberti could also design Loggia, 

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:49.832
 which is attached to the corner of the palace. 

00:03:49.832 --> 00:03:53.385
 There is an open space with full arches 

00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:56.390
 magnificent columns with Corinthian capitals 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.444
 and pilasters on the inner wall 

00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:01.986
 which is also very classicizing. 

00:04:01.986 --> 00:04:03.948
 This loggia could actually be built 

00:04:03.948 --> 00:04:05.690
 to celebrate the wedding between 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.452
 a member of the Medici family and a member of the Rucellai family. 

00:04:08.452 --> 00:04:10.403
 So to join these two powerful Florentine families. 

00:04:10.403 --> 00:04:12.725
 [Voiceover] It is important to note here 

00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:15.952
 that it is no longer an open loggia. 

00:04:15.952 --> 00:04:17.345
 It is now glass 

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:19.341
 and serves as a shoe store. 

00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:20.747
 Originally it would be an open space 

00:04:20.747 --> 00:04:21.988
 that protected the people who walked through it. 

00:04:21.988 --> 00:04:23.603
 This reminds us that although it was a palace, 

00:04:23.603 --> 00:04:26.110
 he was seen as a public good. 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.048
 This contributed to the beauty and harmony of the city. 

00:04:29.048 --> 00:04:31.184
 [Voiceover] So we can see the Palace building 

00:04:31.184 --> 00:04:34.271
 loggia, square in front, 

00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:36.629
 as part of the city's beautification, 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.044
 which took place in the 15th century. 

00:04:39.044 --> 00:04:41.482
 The city pride that led the citizens of Florence 

00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:43.443
 to be interested in beautifying their city 

00:04:43.443 --> 00:04:46.009
 great works of sculpture and architecture. 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.170
 [Voiceover] So here, in the middle of the 15th century, 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.211
 in the center of Florence 

00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:52.150
 we see the birth of what humanism looks like 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.347
 applied to private architecture. 

00:04:53.347 --> 00:04:56.284
 (light jazz piano song)
