you're to do is before you actually
close<00:00:39.720> your<00:00:40.080> row<00:00:40.260> you'll<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.220> adding<00:00:41.580> your

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
next color so to do so you would go

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.890 
next color so to do so you would go
through<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.699> same<00:00:44.940> loop<00:00:45.150> as<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.570> would<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
through the same loop as you would to

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.500 
through the same loop as you would to
make<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.260> slip<00:00:46.470> sticks<00:00:46.800> stitch<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:48.120> instead

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
make your slip sticks stitch but instead

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
make your slip sticks stitch but instead
of<00:00:48.690> grabbing<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> color<00:00:49.470> that's<00:00:49.650> already<00:00:50.010> on

here<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.360> grab<00:00:51.629> your<00:00:51.960> second<00:00:52.440> color<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
here you grab your second color and you

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.700 
here you grab your second color and you
simply<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.790> pull<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.720> through<00:00:58.080> both<00:00:58.470> holes

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
simply just pull that through both holes

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.399 
simply just pull that through both holes
as<00:00:59.159> if<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.180> did<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.540> other<00:01:00.750> regular<00:01:01.140> slip

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.919 
and to secure it you
do<00:01:10.270> one<00:01:10.509> stitch<00:01:10.859> now<00:01:11.859> also<00:01:12.509> this<00:01:13.509> is<00:01:13.750> how<00:01:13.899> I

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
do one stitch now also this is how I

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:17.249 
do one stitch now also this is how I
usually<00:01:14.170> strand<00:01:14.909> my<00:01:15.909> crochet<00:01:16.479> projects<00:01:17.109> and

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
usually strand my crochet projects and

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.709 
usually strand my crochet projects and
that<00:01:17.799> is<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.189> take<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.610> loose<00:01:18.820> strings<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.509> to

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
that is to take the loose strings and to

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.779 
that is to take the loose strings and to
work<00:01:19.929> them<00:01:20.200> into<00:01:20.590> your<00:01:20.740> crochet<00:01:21.159> project<00:01:21.670> so

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
work them into your crochet project so

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.910 
work them into your crochet project so
that<00:01:22.000> you<00:01:22.149> don't<00:01:22.329> have<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.630> do<00:01:22.810> any<00:01:23.350> knotting

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
that you don't have to do any knotting

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.029 
that you don't have to do any knotting
or<00:01:24.039> anything<00:01:24.369> like<00:01:24.609> that<00:01:24.670> so<00:01:25.649> this<00:01:26.649> pattern

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
or anything like that so this pattern

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.600 
or anything like that so this pattern
calls<00:01:27.250> for<00:01:27.569> two<00:01:28.569> half<00:01:29.469> double<00:01:29.679> crochet<00:01:30.280> into

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
calls for two half double crochet into

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.850 
calls for two half double crochet into
each<00:01:30.909> stitch<00:01:31.090> around<00:01:31.689> okay

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
each stitch around okay

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.010 
each stitch around okay
so<00:01:33.520> what<00:01:33.850> we're<00:01:33.939> going<00:01:33.969> to<00:01:34.090> do<00:01:34.329> is<00:01:34.600> we're<00:01:34.840> going

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.569 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:01:35.110> yarn<00:01:35.439> over<00:01:35.709> go<00:01:36.689> through<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.979> same<00:01:39.219> stitch

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
to yarn over go through the same stitch

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.969 
to yarn over go through the same stitch
and<00:01:39.909> make<00:01:40.750> sure<00:01:40.990> that<00:01:41.289> your<00:01:41.500> hook<00:01:41.799> is

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
and make sure that your hook is

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.449 
and make sure that your hook is
underneath<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.750> three<00:01:44.099> strands<00:01:45.099> that<00:01:45.310> you

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
underneath the three strands that you

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.839 
underneath the three strands that you
have<00:01:45.640> going<00:01:45.970> on<00:01:46.090> in<00:01:46.329> the<00:01:46.450> back<00:01:46.630> here<00:01:46.929> okay<00:01:47.849> when

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:48.849 
have going on in the back here okay when

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.569 
have going on in the back here okay when
you<00:01:48.970> pull<00:01:49.239> up<00:01:49.360> your<00:01:49.509> loop<00:01:49.829> make<00:01:50.829> sure<00:01:51.159> that<00:01:51.369> you

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
you pull up your loop make sure that you

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.240 
you pull up your loop make sure that you
go<00:01:51.819> underneath<00:01:53.849> like<00:01:54.849> so<00:01:55.770> then<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:56.920> yarn<00:01:57.099> over

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
go underneath like so then you yarn over

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.100 
go underneath like so then you yarn over
and<00:01:57.759> pull<00:01:57.880> through<00:01:58.569> all<00:01:59.259> loops<00:02:00.039> on<00:02:00.849> the<00:02:01.060> hook

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
and pull through all loops on the hook

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.029 
and pull through all loops on the hook
so<00:02:02.110> again<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:04.509> that<00:02:04.840> would<00:02:05.049> be<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:05.860> would<00:02:05.979> be

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
so again so that would be that would be

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.069 
so again so that would be that would be
two<00:02:06.369> so<00:02:07.119> we're<00:02:07.239> going<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.599> the<00:02:07.689> next<00:02:07.719> stitch

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
two so we're going in the next stitch

two so we're going in the next stitch
for<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.379> next<00:02:08.649> two<00:02:08.829> yarn<00:02:09.519> over<00:02:09.910> go<00:02:10.319> through

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
for the next two yarn over go through

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.190 
for the next two yarn over go through
the<00:02:11.470> stitch

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.400 

pull<00:02:14.920> up<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.160> loop<00:02:15.310> yarn<00:02:15.819> over<00:02:16.540> again<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.290> go

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
pull up a loop yarn over again and go

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.410 
pull up a loop yarn over again and go
through<00:02:17.440> all<00:02:17.860> three<00:02:18.130> on<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.580> hook<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.360> we

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
through all three on the hook and we

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.979 
through all three on the hook and we
have<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:19.989> go<00:02:20.110> back<00:02:20.319> into<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.800> same<00:02:21.099> stitch<00:02:21.989> by

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
have to go back into that same stitch by

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.960 
have to go back into that same stitch by
yarning<00:02:23.410> over<00:02:23.560> pulling<00:02:24.180> up<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.300> loop<00:02:25.330> yarn<00:02:26.970> over

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
yarning over pulling up a loop yarn over

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.410 
yarning over pulling up a loop yarn over
again<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.860> through<00:02:29.860> our<00:02:30.040> three<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.180> make

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
again and through our three so you make

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.660 
again and through our three so you make
two<00:02:31.690> stitches<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.319> each<00:02:32.470> one<00:02:32.980> all<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.550> way

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
two stitches in each one all the way

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.360 
two stitches in each one all the way
around<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.989> should<00:02:38.260> be<00:02:38.380> 20<00:02:38.530> stitches<00:02:38.950> in

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
around and that should be 20 stitches in

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:52.610 
around and that should be 20 stitches in
total

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.370 

now<00:02:53.620> what<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:53.890> usually<00:02:54.160> do<00:02:54.580> is<00:02:55.000> when<00:02:55.990> I<00:02:56.020> usually

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
now what I usually do is when I usually

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.410 
now what I usually do is when I usually
have<00:02:56.680> about<00:02:56.890> three<00:02:57.310> whole<00:02:57.550> stitches<00:02:58.000> complete

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
have about three whole stitches complete

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
technique to hold those strands behind

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.350 
technique to hold those strands behind
the<00:04:25.350> actual<00:04:25.770> project<00:04:26.280> so<00:04:26.490> that's<00:04:26.639> one<00:04:26.970> in<00:04:27.180> that

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
the actual project so that's one in that

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.510 
the actual project so that's one in that
