reason for it is that you don't end up
with<00:01:48.810> two<00:01:49.259> sticky<00:01:49.920> clumpy<00:01:50.310> hands<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:51.119> my

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
with two sticky clumpy hands with my

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.789 
with two sticky clumpy hands with my
other<00:01:51.509> hand<00:01:51.630> now<00:01:51.990> I'm<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> go<00:01:52.380> into<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
other hand now I'm going to go into the

other hand now I'm going to go into the
other<00:01:53.130> dry<00:01:53.909> mixture<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.990> what's<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.320> drive

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
other dry mixture so what's in the drive

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.039 
other dry mixture so what's in the drive
so<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.700> equal<00:01:57.299> parts<00:01:57.329> Anson<00:01:57.899> Mills
