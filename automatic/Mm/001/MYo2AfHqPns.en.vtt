00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.559
 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel how 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.049
 I do now I have this tip for 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.060
 to be able to cut a rope rope 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.039
 another type of cord without needing 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.630
 Scissors or knives either because 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.430
 we're camping and we do not have a 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.050
 knife or are we at any party 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.939
 children and we want to cut some rope 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.079
 but nobody finds the scissors or by 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.029
 any other situation that is 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.380
 may occur or present and this 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.149
 we will achieve with the same string as 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.380
 we want to cut so let's see how 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.510
 do what 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.070
 we take in this case the rope that does not 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.650
 matter whether it's plastic or type 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.570
 rope and we measure how much we need and 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.520
 we mark it or we calculate it more or less 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.620
 where we want it to be able to locate the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.390
 where are we going to cut it 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.160
 immediately we put the end of the rope 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.170
 under our right foot and the other 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.450
 piece of it under ones own 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.520
 left or vice versa taking into account 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.380
 that the part that we want to cut must 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.180
 stay in the middle as I show them 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.460
 onscreen 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.590
 and doing this we take a part of the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.600
 rest of the rope and we went below 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.490
 of the part that we will cut and hold 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.470
 with one hand one end of the cable and the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.720
 another end with the other hand as if 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.130
 we were to pull it or entangle it and here what 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.720
 what we are going to do is that we are going to apply 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.090
 a movement up and down 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.040
 to cause such friction that the rope 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.170
 can be cut does not have to be with 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.119
 a lot of force but also not very soft 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.100
 point is to be continuous and how can 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.050
 see is cut pretty fast and without major 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.060
 effort as you can see in 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.860
 the video and we'll have the piece of 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.270
 Tecate the size we want and without 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.130
 need to use scissors 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.670
 knife or any razor to be able 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.799
 do what 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.360
 we can do the same with another kind of 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.060
 strings like in this case with some 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.920
 shoelaces if we needed it we took 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.020
 the needle and as we did with the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.909
 We measure it or if we want to mark 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.340
 the exact part so that we have the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.170
 size we want we tread the end 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.390
 of this with the right foot and the other with 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.009
 the left foot or vice versa and like 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.869
 we have to be careful to leave the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.299
 part that we want to cut in the part of 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.860
 in the middle we take the rest of the shoe 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.600
 another string and we do the same 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.670
 movement that we made with the rope 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.800
 up and down so 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.179
 constant and as you can see it 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.580
 cuts in the same way and with the same 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.440
 ease that the rope and so we already have 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.549
 the piece of string we need to 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.549
 use it in whatever we want 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.910
 They can also cut the rope 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.920
 lace or other type of cord in this 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.480
 case the merchant with the needle and 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.610
 It will cut very simply too 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.990
 as you can see in the video 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.990
 and with almost no effort 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.290
 as you could see we can cut 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.000
 different types of rope without the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.830
 need to use scissors or some 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.270
 type of knife either because no 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.340
 we have at hand because we are 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.900
 camp or ride we do not find 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.700
 our scissors and we need it from 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.410
 urgency or simply because we already know 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.970
 that there are other ways to do it and so 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.410
 we like to cut 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.850
 be for the reason that you want 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.130
 but I think this guy will be a lot 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.500
 help someday 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.810
