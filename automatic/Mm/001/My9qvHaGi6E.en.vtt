okay<00:00:02.070> so<00:00:02.129> here's<00:00:02.730> my<00:00:03.110> imitation<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.339> Weber

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
okay so here's my imitation of the Weber

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.519 
okay so here's my imitation of the Weber
tree<00:00:05.910> actually<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.359> didn't<00:00:06.839> try<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.020> make<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.290> web

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
tree actually I didn't try to make a web

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.040 
tree actually I didn't try to make a web
a<00:00:07.560> tree<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:08.010> saw<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> spiral<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> couple<00:00:09.660> years<00:00:09.840> ago

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
a tree I saw a spiral a couple years ago

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.450 
a tree I saw a spiral a couple years ago
before<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.500> Weber<00:00:10.650> tree<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.130> thought<00:00:11.340> was

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
before the Weber tree that I thought was

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.700 
before the Weber tree that I thought was
kind<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.700> cool<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.120> then<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.139> saw<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.469> Weber

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
kind of cool and then I saw the Weber

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.919 
kind of cool and then I saw the Weber
tree<00:00:13.950> last<00:00:14.190> year<00:00:14.400> like<00:00:14.549> many<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.910> us<00:00:15.000> did<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.780> I

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
tree last year like many of us did and I

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.420 
tree last year like many of us did and I
thought<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.139> should<00:00:16.830> try<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.010> make<00:00:17.190> one<00:00:17.340> of

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
thought I should try to make one of

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.099 
thought I should try to make one of
those<00:00:17.520> but<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.060> didn't<00:00:18.449> want<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> make<00:00:18.690> one<00:00:18.900> so

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
those but I didn't want to make one so

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.019 
those but I didn't want to make one so
large<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.770> way<00:00:19.890> he<00:00:19.920> did

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
large as the way he did

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.700 
large as the way he did
I<00:00:21.090> wanted<00:00:21.600> something<00:00:21.840> smaller<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.590> I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
I wanted something smaller because I

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.050 
I wanted something smaller because I
already<00:00:22.800> had<00:00:23.010> my<00:00:23.130> mega<00:00:23.369> tree<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.880> didn't

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
already had my mega tree and I didn't

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
already had my mega tree and I didn't
really<00:00:24.210> want<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.420> change<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.890> decided

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
really want to change that so I decided

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.099 
really want to change that so I decided
to<00:00:26.460> make<00:00:26.670> these<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.330> actually<00:00:27.420> make<00:00:27.750> two<00:00:27.779> of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
to make these and actually make two of

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.259 
to make these and actually make two of
them<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.500> made<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.460> where<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> strands<00:00:30.090> went

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
them I made one where the strands went

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.479 
them I made one where the strands went
up<00:00:30.359> at<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.599> angle<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.199> then<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.040> made<00:00:32.219> another

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
up at this angle and then I made another

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.979 
up at this angle and then I made another
one<00:00:32.610> with<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> strands<00:00:33.329> would<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> other

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
one with a strands would up at the other

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.810 
one with a strands would up at the other
angle<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:35.010> way<00:00:35.190> when<00:00:35.399> they<00:00:35.489> were<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.700> help

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
angle that way when they were to help

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.729 
angle that way when they were to help
opposites<00:00:36.390> into<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> yards<00:00:37.350> they<00:00:37.469> would<00:00:37.620> look

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
opposites into the yards they would look

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.229 
opposites into the yards they would look
like<00:00:37.890> they<00:00:38.070> were<00:00:38.160> spinning<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.790> opposite

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
like they were spinning in opposite

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.240 
like they were spinning in opposite
directions<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.870> each<00:00:40.020> other<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:40.770> necessary

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
directions of each other not necessary

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.920 
directions of each other not necessary
to<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.910> that's<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:42.750> I

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
to do that but that's what I was I

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.889 
to do that but that's what I was I
wanted<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:44.059> most<00:00:45.059> guys<00:00:45.239> use<00:00:45.570> guidelines

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
wanted to do most guys use guidelines

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.920 
wanted to do most guys use guidelines
and<00:00:46.520> they<00:00:47.520> started<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> top<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.300> pole<00:00:48.539> and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and they started the top of the pole and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.490 
and they started the top of the pole and
they<00:00:49.050> go<00:00:49.200> down<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.390> commend<00:00:52.320> them

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
they did a great job the ones I saw this
year<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.840> making<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> lines<00:00:55.559> nice<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.100> clean

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
year of making the lines nice and clean

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.979 
year of making the lines nice and clean
and<00:00:56.460> straight<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.940> don't<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.270> how<00:00:57.449> they<00:00:57.930> were

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
and straight I don't know how they were

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.650 
and straight I don't know how they were
able<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.379> do<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.730> I'm<00:00:59.730> sure<00:01:00.000> if<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.180> all<00:01:00.300> try

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
able to do that I'm sure if we all try

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.139 
able to do that I'm sure if we all try
it<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.870> could<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.579> wanted

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
it we could do that but I wanted

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.640 
it we could do that but I wanted
something<00:01:03.420> where<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.750> knew<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> lines

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
something where I knew what the lines

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.240 
something where I knew what the lines
could<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> made<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.060> PVC<00:01:07.250> so

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
could be so I made this out of PVC so

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.410 
could be so I made this out of PVC so
you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.460> see<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> did<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.119> put<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> bunch

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you can see what I did is I put a bunch

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.940 
you can see what I did is I put a bunch
of<00:01:09.570> 45<00:01:10.049> together<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.680> make<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> top

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
of 45 together to make the top

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.330 
of 45 together to make the top
I<00:01:13.060> attach<00:01:14.060> them<00:01:14.590> by<00:01:15.590> using<00:01:15.799> caps<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:18.340> screw

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
I attach them by using caps and screw

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.560 
I attach them by using caps and screw
the<00:01:19.490> caps<00:01:19.729> into<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:22.520> for<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.939> ring<00:01:23.450> I

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
the caps into the the for the ring I

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.980 
the caps into the the for the ring I
made<00:01:23.750> at<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:23.960> top

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.429 

to<00:01:30.560> give<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:30.890> support<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.549> made<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.439> midsection

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
to give it support I made a midsection

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.899 
to give it support I made a midsection
here<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:36.500> goes<00:01:36.649> around<00:01:36.890> gave<00:01:37.250> us<00:01:37.369> support<00:01:37.759> and

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
here it goes around gave us support and

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.539 
here it goes around gave us support and
then<00:01:38.509> of<00:01:38.659> course<00:01:38.899> the<00:01:39.439> bottom<00:01:39.830> section<00:01:40.340> which

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
then of course the bottom section which

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.170 
then of course the bottom section which
is<00:01:40.729> here

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.310 

each<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.410> these<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:47.370> about<00:01:48.020> eight<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.080> a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
each one of these is about eight and a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.280 
each one of these is about eight and a
half<00:01:49.350> inches<00:01:51.770> as<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.160> see<00:01:53.370> so<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.900> had<00:01:55.260> a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
half inches as you can see so I had a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.810 
half inches as you can see so I had a
tea<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:56.180> then<00:01:58.310> sixteen<00:01:59.310> eight<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.760> a<00:01:59.790> half

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
tea and then sixteen eight and a half

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.870 
tea and then sixteen eight and a half
inch<00:02:00.090> sections<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.780> then<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.260> 45<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.640> glued

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
inch sections and then a 45 and I glued

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:16.920 
inch sections and then a 45 and I glued
them<00:02:03.030> together

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.650 

as<00:02:17.409> you<00:02:17.650> can<00:02:17.739> see<00:02:17.950> there

as you can see there

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.720 
as you can see there
and<00:02:20.140> then<00:02:20.320> I<00:02:20.440> brought<00:02:20.650> those<00:02:20.890> up<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.490> here<00:02:23.730> let

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
and then I brought those up to here let

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.600 
and then I brought those up to here let
me<00:02:24.760> get<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.060> measurements<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:26.520> well<00:02:27.520> as

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
me get the measurements of that well as

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.230 
me get the measurements of that well as
you<00:02:27.730> can<00:02:27.820> see<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:29.050> about<00:02:29.320> 39<00:02:29.880> inches<00:02:30.880> from

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
you can see this is about 39 inches from

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.750 
you can see this is about 39 inches from
this<00:02:31.840> cross<00:02:32.530> here<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:33.010> had<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.280> use<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.430> cross

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
this cross here I had to use a cross

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.240 
this cross here I had to use a cross
here<00:02:34.150> down<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.310> T<00:02:36.520> down<00:02:36.850> here<00:02:41.250> these

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
here down to the T down here these

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:51.080 
here down to the T down here these
pieces<00:02:42.670> are<00:02:47.430> approximately<00:02:48.720> four<00:02:49.720> inches

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
pieces are approximately four inches

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.750 
pieces are approximately four inches
going<00:02:52.090> into<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.420> cross<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:53.130> then<00:02:54.130> into<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
going into the cross and then into the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.070 
going into the cross and then into the
45<00:02:59.610> and<00:03:00.610> as<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.970> can<00:03:01.120> see<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.420> top<00:03:01.660> section

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
45 and as you can see the top section

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:10.770 
45 and as you can see the top section
here<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.500> also<00:03:02.970> about<00:03:03.970> 39<00:03:04.810> inches

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.090 
much problems you can make it an 8 feet
9<00:03:21.370> feet<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:23.110> let<00:03:23.260> me<00:03:23.350> show<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:23.530> how<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:23.709> decided

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
9 feet so let me show you how I decided

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.030 
9 feet so let me show you how I decided
on<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.970> coil<00:03:25.360> that<00:03:25.900> I<00:03:25.990> call<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.410> on<00:03:26.860> the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
on the the coil that I call it on the

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.540 
on the the coil that I call it on the
one<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.220> did<00:03:27.550> just<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:28.510> happen<00:03:28.870> I<00:03:28.989> use<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.550> light

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
one I did just so happen I use a light

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.580 
one I did just so happen I use a light
strands<00:03:30.880> of<00:03:31.060> 100<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.720> was<00:03:31.870> able<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.170> wrap<00:03:32.410> it

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
strands of 100 and I was able to wrap it

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.559 
strands of 100 and I was able to wrap it
around<00:03:32.680> once<00:03:33.250> from<00:03:33.520> the<00:03:33.640> top<00:03:33.670> down<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.209> bottom

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
around once from the top down the bottom

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.180 
around once from the top down the bottom
top<00:03:34.930> down<00:03:35.140> on<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.290> bottom<00:03:35.590> when<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:35.860> was<00:03:36.040> first

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
top down on the bottom when I was first

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.400 
top down on the bottom when I was first
trying<00:03:36.550> this<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.000> then<00:03:37.569> go<00:03:37.720> back<00:03:37.930> up<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.200> top

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
trying this and then go back up the top

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.729 
trying this and then go back up the top
so<00:03:39.130> basically<00:03:39.970> it's<00:03:40.270> really<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.690> light<00:03:41.440> strand

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
so basically it's really a light strand

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.199 
so basically it's really a light strand
of<00:03:41.860> 50<00:03:42.130> would<00:03:42.220> go<00:03:42.400> all<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.550> way<00:03:42.610> around<00:03:42.760> but

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
of 50 would go all the way around but

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.180 
of 50 would go all the way around but
what<00:03:43.360> I<00:03:43.390> did<00:03:43.630> is<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.870> doubled<00:03:44.290> it<00:03:44.320> up<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.739> started

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
what I did is I doubled it up I started

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.030 
what I did is I doubled it up I started
at<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.370> bottom<00:03:45.610> I<00:03:46.140> wrapped<00:03:47.140> my<00:03:47.320> way<00:03:47.500> around<00:03:47.650> to

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
at the bottom I wrapped my way around to

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.470 
at the bottom I wrapped my way around to
the<00:03:48.130> top<00:03:48.310> flipped<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:48.910> over<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.300> came<00:03:49.420> back

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
the top flipped it over and came back

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.320 
the top flipped it over and came back
down<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.290> bottom<00:03:50.620> so<00:03:51.030> let<00:03:52.030> me<00:03:52.120> show<00:03:52.269> you

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
down to the bottom so let me show you

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.870 
down to the bottom so let me show you
how<00:03:52.540> I<00:03:52.600> did<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:52.950> okay<00:03:53.950> so<00:03:54.190> here's<00:03:54.430> what<00:03:54.580> I<00:03:54.610> did<00:03:54.730> I

how I did it okay so here's what I did I
started<00:03:55.300> at<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.450> bottom<00:03:55.569> I<00:03:56.400> wrapped<00:03:57.400> the

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
started at the bottom I wrapped the

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.970 
started at the bottom I wrapped the
strands<00:03:58.060> around<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.600> tree<00:04:00.510> like<00:04:01.510> this

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
strands around the tree like this

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.240 
strands around the tree like this
I'll<00:04:03.489> go<00:04:03.640> slower<00:04:03.940> so<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:04.209> don't<00:04:04.360> get<00:04:04.420> dizzy

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
I'll go slower so you don't get dizzy

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.820 
I'll go slower so you don't get dizzy
all<00:04:06.250> right<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.110> top

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
all right to the top

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.830 
all right to the top
i<00:04:09.860> looped<00:04:10.580> it

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:24.690 

and<00:04:14.260> then<00:04:14.560> brought<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:14.980> back<00:04:15.010> down

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.260 

to<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.360> bottom<00:04:25.710> so<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.920> make<00:04:27.100> mine<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:28.090> need

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
to the bottom so to make mine you need

know you need to make sixteen at 39

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.860 
know you need to make sixteen at 39
inches<00:04:42.190> for<00:04:42.460> these<00:04:42.580> pieces<00:04:43.150> that<00:04:43.360> go<00:04:43.600> up<00:04:43.720> and

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.700 

now<00:05:20.210> one<00:05:20.419> of<00:05:20.449> the<00:05:20.569> things<00:05:20.810> I<00:05:20.990> didn't<00:05:21.349> do<00:05:21.500> and<00:05:21.650> I

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
now one of the things I didn't do and I

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.679 
now one of the things I didn't do and I
thought<00:05:21.889> about<00:05:22.189> with<00:05:23.090> that<00:05:23.210> whole<00:05:23.449> of<00:05:23.599> the

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:23.689 
thought about with that whole of the

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.749 
thought about with that whole of the
opening<00:05:24.110> there<00:05:24.259> you<00:05:24.409> could<00:05:24.560> actually<00:05:24.740> put<00:05:25.159> a

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
opening there you could actually put a

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.550 
opening there you could actually put a
globe<00:05:26.240> in<00:05:26.449> there<00:05:26.659> or<00:05:26.960> something<00:05:27.289> I<00:05:27.439> was

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
globe in there or something I was

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.719 
globe in there or something I was
thinking<00:05:27.590> about<00:05:27.770> putting<00:05:27.979> some<00:05:28.219> kind<00:05:28.400> of<00:05:28.460> bulb

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
thinking about putting some kind of bulb

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.529 
thinking about putting some kind of bulb
or<00:05:29.090> ball<00:05:30.069> last<00:05:31.069> ball<00:05:31.400> then<00:05:31.699> I<00:05:31.759> could<00:05:31.939> put<00:05:32.060> LEDs

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
or ball last ball then I could put LEDs

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.649 
or ball last ball then I could put LEDs
in<00:05:32.750> and<00:05:33.050> light<00:05:33.620> it<00:05:33.800> up<00:05:33.919> -<00:05:34.159> or<00:05:35.090> you<00:05:35.300> could<00:05:35.419> put<00:05:35.599> a

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
in and light it up - or you could put a

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.990 
in and light it up - or you could put a
star<00:05:35.960> coming<00:05:36.259> out<00:05:36.469> of<00:05:36.620> it<00:05:36.800> or<00:05:37.159> you<00:05:37.879> know

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
star coming out of it or you know

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.240 
star coming out of it or you know
whatever<00:05:38.419> you<00:05:38.750> angel<00:05:39.500> if<00:05:39.650> you<00:05:39.740> wanted<00:05:39.979> to<00:05:40.129> if

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
whatever you angel if you wanted to if

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.320 
whatever you angel if you wanted to if
you<00:05:40.280> can<00:05:40.430> make<00:05:40.580> an<00:05:40.669> angel<00:05:40.969> small<00:05:41.150> enough<00:05:43.330> now

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
you can make an angel small enough now

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.059 
you can make an angel small enough now
the<00:05:44.389> one<00:05:44.780> thing<00:05:44.990> that<00:05:45.650> I<00:05:45.680> would<00:05:45.830> recommend

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:46.069 
the one thing that I would recommend

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:48.520 
the one thing that I would recommend
that<00:05:46.520> I<00:05:46.639> didn't<00:05:46.969> do<00:05:47.120> not<00:05:47.750> being<00:05:48.050> so<00:05:48.229> bright<00:05:48.469> I

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
that I didn't do not being so bright I

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.559 
that I didn't do not being so bright I
didn't<00:05:48.860> do<00:05:48.979> it<00:05:49.129> is<00:05:49.460> this<00:05:50.090> is<00:05:50.240> all<00:05:50.389> glued

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
didn't do it is this is all glued

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.020 
didn't do it is this is all glued
together<00:05:50.780> so<00:05:51.560> now<00:05:51.889> I<00:05:51.919> can't<00:05:52.340> take<00:05:52.580> it<00:05:52.729> apart

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
together so now I can't take it apart

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.510 
together so now I can't take it apart
what<00:05:53.690> I<00:05:53.719> would<00:05:53.960> have<00:05:54.050> done<00:05:54.259> what<00:05:55.219> I'm<00:05:55.310> probably

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
what I would have done what I'm probably

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.369 
what I would have done what I'm probably
going<00:05:55.699> to<00:05:55.759> do<00:05:55.879> now<00:05:56.060> is<00:05:56.539> I'm<00:05:56.810> going<00:05:56.990> to<00:05:57.080> I'm

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:57.379 
going to do now is I'm going to I'm

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:00.089 
going to do now is I'm going to I'm
going<00:05:57.590> to<00:05:57.680> cut<00:05:57.919> here<00:05:58.849> and<00:05:59.120> I<00:05:59.539> want<00:05:59.690> to<00:05:59.750> put<00:05:59.840> a

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
going to cut here and I want to put a

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.649 
going to cut here and I want to put a
coupling<00:06:01.099> there<00:06:01.520> and<00:06:01.969> I'm<00:06:02.120> going<00:06:02.300> to<00:06:02.330> use<00:06:02.479> that

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
coupling there and I'm going to use that

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.059 
coupling there and I'm going to use that
to<00:06:02.840> screw<00:06:03.110> it<00:06:03.229> together<00:06:03.379> so<00:06:03.740> I'm<00:06:03.830> gonna<00:06:03.949> do

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069 
to screw it together so I'm gonna do

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:05.980 
to screw it together so I'm gonna do
that<00:06:04.219> on<00:06:04.340> either<00:06:04.460> side<00:06:04.849> and<00:06:05.150> down<00:06:05.750> at<00:06:05.870> the

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
that on either side and down at the

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.920 
that on either side and down at the
bottom<00:06:06.379> at<00:06:07.219> the<00:06:07.370> top<00:06:07.610> I'm<00:06:08.270> not<00:06:08.539> sure<00:06:08.750> how<00:06:08.870> I'm

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
bottom at the top I'm not sure how I'm

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.180 
bottom at the top I'm not sure how I'm
gonna<00:06:09.110> do<00:06:09.199> that<00:06:09.349> yet<00:06:09.590> I'll<00:06:09.740> figure<00:06:09.919> that<00:06:10.039> out

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
gonna do that yet I'll figure that out

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.629 
gonna do that yet I'll figure that out
yet<00:06:11.319> I'll<00:06:12.319> have<00:06:12.440> to<00:06:12.590> probably<00:06:13.039> make<00:06:13.250> a<00:06:13.279> new<00:06:13.490> one

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
yet I'll have to probably make a new one

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.459 
yet I'll have to probably make a new one
and<00:06:13.879> make<00:06:14.029> it<00:06:14.150> so<00:06:14.240> that<00:06:14.389> I<00:06:14.479> can<00:06:14.629> I<00:06:14.840> could<00:06:15.229> screw

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:15.469 
and make it so that I can I could screw

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:18.610 
and make it so that I can I could screw
it<00:06:15.590> in<00:06:15.740> and<00:06:16.009> these<00:06:16.669> two<00:06:16.909> here<00:06:17.259> so<00:06:18.259> that<00:06:18.379> I<00:06:18.469> can

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
it in and these two here so that I can

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.309 
it in and these two here so that I can
take<00:06:18.740> it<00:06:18.889> apart<00:06:19.159> at<00:06:19.279> least<00:06:19.310> store<00:06:19.759> it<00:06:19.819> in<00:06:19.939> half

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
take it apart at least store it in half

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.510 
take it apart at least store it in half
of<00:06:21.319> course<00:06:21.560> you<00:06:21.680> could<00:06:21.800> always<00:06:21.949> just<00:06:22.159> put<00:06:22.400> the

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
of course you could always just put the

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.119 
of course you could always just put the
pieces<00:06:22.729> together<00:06:23.029> without<00:06:23.930> any<00:06:24.409> glue<00:06:24.860> and

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
pieces together without any glue and

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:27.580 
pieces together without any glue and
just<00:06:25.159> screw<00:06:26.060> oh<00:06:26.090> man<00:06:26.360> you<00:06:26.990> know<00:06:27.050> I<00:06:27.139> would<00:06:27.319> say

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
just screw oh man you know I would say

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.290 
just screw oh man you know I would say
recommend<00:06:28.129> putting<00:06:28.400> these<00:06:28.520> long<00:06:28.819> pieces<00:06:29.090> of

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
recommend putting these long pieces of

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.689 
recommend putting these long pieces of
239<00:06:29.960> pieces<00:06:30.409> inch<00:06:30.710> pieces<00:06:31.250> in<00:06:31.370> the<00:06:31.460> cross

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699 
239 pieces inch pieces in the cross

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.059 
239 pieces inch pieces in the cross
together<00:06:32.210> so<00:06:33.080> you<00:06:33.139> could<00:06:33.319> store<00:06:33.560> those<00:06:33.740> flat

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:34.069 
together so you could store those flat

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:37.420 
together so you could store those flat
and<00:06:34.370> then<00:06:34.990> maybe<00:06:35.990> glue<00:06:36.229> together<00:06:36.379> the<00:06:36.710> 45s<00:06:37.250> in

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
and then maybe glue together the 45s in

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.909 
and then maybe glue together the 45s in
the<00:06:37.520> eight<00:06:37.639> and<00:06:37.759> a<00:06:37.819> half<00:06:37.879> inch<00:06:38.180> pieces<00:06:38.919> and

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
the eight and a half inch pieces and

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.430 
the eight and a half inch pieces and
glue<00:06:40.069> together<00:06:40.219> these<00:06:40.610> 45s<00:06:41.389> and<00:06:41.810> their<00:06:42.199> pieces

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
glue together these 45s and their pieces

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.800 
glue together these 45s and their pieces
and<00:06:42.860> then<00:06:43.400> put<00:06:43.759> them<00:06:44.060> in<00:06:44.210> and<00:06:44.449> screw<00:06:44.719> them

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
and then put them in and screw them

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.129 
and then put them in and screw them
together<00:06:44.960> first<00:06:46.419> PVC<00:06:47.419> isn't<00:06:47.690> always<00:06:47.810> so<00:06:47.990> easy

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
together first PVC isn't always so easy

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.050 
together first PVC isn't always so easy
to<00:06:48.349> take<00:06:48.500> apart<00:06:48.800> once<00:06:49.039> you<00:06:49.190> push<00:06:49.400> it<00:06:49.550> together

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
to take apart once you push it together

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.240 
to take apart once you push it together
so<00:06:50.509> the<00:06:51.110> screwing<00:06:51.379> method<00:06:51.770> you<00:06:51.860> know<00:06:51.949> screwing

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
so the screwing method you know screwing

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.510 
so the screwing method you know screwing
it<00:06:52.339> together<00:06:52.610> may<00:06:52.909> not<00:06:53.120> be<00:06:53.270> that<00:06:53.449> easy<00:06:53.719> but<00:06:54.520> you

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
it together may not be that easy but you

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.920 
it together may not be that easy but you
know

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
know

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.510 
know
I'd<00:06:56.080> give<00:06:56.320> it<00:06:56.440> a<00:06:56.470> try<00:06:56.500> you<00:06:56.979> can<00:06:57.070> also<00:06:57.250> take<00:06:57.460> some

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
I'd give it a try you can also take some

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.840 
I'd give it a try you can also take some
sandpaper<00:06:58.030> and<00:06:58.389> stand<00:06:58.630> the<00:06:58.780> end<00:06:58.990> of<00:06:59.380> the<00:06:59.850> PVC

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:00.850 
sandpaper and stand the end of the PVC

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.200 
sandpaper and stand the end of the PVC
pipe<00:07:01.270> so<00:07:01.570> that<00:07:02.080> it<00:07:02.199> goes<00:07:02.620> into<00:07:02.680> the<00:07:03.220> coupling

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
pipe so that it goes into the coupling

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.270 
pipe so that it goes into the coupling
or<00:07:04.419> to<00:07:04.539> the<00:07:04.660> 45<00:07:05.169> a<00:07:05.199> little<00:07:05.650> bit<00:07:05.740> easier<00:07:06.130> that

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 
or to the 45 a little bit easier that

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.689 
or to the 45 a little bit easier that
might<00:07:06.400> make<00:07:06.550> it<00:07:06.580> easier<00:07:06.729> to<00:07:07.000> come<00:07:07.150> out<00:07:07.440> but

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 
might make it easier to come out but

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:11.310 
might make it easier to come out but
this<00:07:09.699> is<00:07:09.759> this<00:07:10.419> is<00:07:10.570> just<00:07:10.720> something<00:07:10.930> of<00:07:11.229> how

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
this is this is just something of how

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.129 
this is this is just something of how
I'd<00:07:11.560> made<00:07:11.800> mine<00:07:12.100> and<00:07:12.789> for<00:07:13.449> the<00:07:13.539> people<00:07:13.810> that

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139 
I'd made mine and for the people that

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:17.370 
I'd made mine and for the people that
had<00:07:14.620> asked<00:07:15.009> about<00:07:15.220> it
