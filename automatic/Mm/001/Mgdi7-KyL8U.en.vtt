00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.259
 For me today is about a side job 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.390
 because work so beautiful there are like 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.509
 I connect life outside of the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.699
 Studies in university life 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.989
 because it's a thing you do 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.460
 underestimated so I can have 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.520
 underestimated and completely honest 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.250
 admit but come for the first time now 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.449
 one succeeds one studies one one one studies 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.329
 word applies is just so you have to rent 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.000
 you have to pay what you have to eat something 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.309
 you have to live more or more 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.469
 less so also cinema costs money and 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.679
 also with friends ingo costs 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.149
 money cucumbers scheller cost money so it 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.159
 moving in itself is like that was one 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.260
 awesome thing cause you first 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.600
 making purchases easy at home 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.489
 because there are mum's kitchen equipped 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.230
 is and your own is not 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.020
 if you move but pots and 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.310
 cups and plates and cucumbers 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.259
 So put Schiller in these cucumbers 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.520
 me very gnawed when I moved 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.140
 that was not such an investment 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.540
 absolutely did not want to see but the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.329
 somehow it was necessary because vegetable itself 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.750
 Do not stop so well he can do such a thing 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.040
 is a bit awkward and had it 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.810
 I did not expect that at the beginning 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.040
 everything is so crazy money costs 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.009
 i had in munich last year 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.780
 worked and of course have aside 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.930
 laid as I knew I was pulling 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.280
 now out and have a move and have 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.430
 because they cost me too 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.200
 that will be so nonsense 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.310
 Purchases will happen again 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.439
 That's what makes me look a bit like that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.140
 the track thrown or even that one 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.469
 Vacuum cleaner to be purchased first 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.789
 needs and not simply there has 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.039
 Now, let's do it 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.880
 forgot it 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:58.289
 and that was why it was super fast for me 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.009
 Of course I need it very fast now 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.810
 back in the job because of me though 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.560
 get my older support 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.069
 but like I said a bit 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.519
 would be self-sufficient and 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.170
 no student would get and stays there 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.760
 only the possibility to go to work 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.389
 or hope that somewhere a 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.849
 scholarship gets what is the last 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:24.409
 probably not like that now 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.260
 probably stayed with me because of that 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.709
 just work but there keep the job 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.459
 searched 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.139
 Of course that's relative in theory 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.430
 easy in practice has yet to be 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:38.959
 harder turned out than me 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.799
 Just thought because the timetable as 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.669
 student but it is so part-time jobs 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.919
 not always suitable i had many 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:50.030
 jobs instantly on advertised 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.209
 they would have said yes 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.689
 pass by trial 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.329
 Interview We look at that 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:59.599
 which then failed because of that 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.219
 I never spend very long time at a time 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.919
 i have a lecture in the 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:06.680
 Lecture in the afternoon clear between 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:08.719
 This time is where I have time 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.310
 but layers, for example, the bakery 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.840
 begin in the early and go up to 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.290
 noon or early afternoon it went 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.689
 in the evening and that's just not for me 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.389
 works and then I had to first 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.220
 what find something in such small 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.209
 between times or in the short 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.159
 if only in the afternoon 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.799
 have a lecture and then afterwards 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.169
 work can go or in the morning 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.609
 and then thank god also what 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:37.879
 found and am also very happy and 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.590
 Can do something like this but me 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.530
 of course had to die all this time 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.099
 i am working in my schedule 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.829
 install somehow because study is mine 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.500
 main focus here not the first 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.560
 Nebenjob and I want to, of course 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.239
 what to do for my studies and at the best 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.739
 Eventually write good exams 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:03.139
 and have a good degree 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.669
 that is, the lectures are indeed the 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.169
 main ingredient but the whole thing needs 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.729
 somehow before and after 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.549
 I will have to read text so even 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.370
 none is a very intense reading 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:16.049
 studying like me 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.979
 have asked and I have manipulated 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.290
 the last two weeks that I mean 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.880
 lectures after I get ready 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.199
 but what I have in front of these with and 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.630
 the slides the professor the 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.400
 Professor uploads in one 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.919
 summary practically together 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.830
 so I led a few sheets of paper 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.440
 I can not file and for the 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.169
 Examination learning at the end of the semester 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.639
 can advise 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.900
 And of course that's what it takes 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.970
 takes all the time 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.440
 with me it is at the moment so with me must 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.270
 I have read and work 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.310
 do I actually need the time the 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.800
 Lecture took a while back 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.050
 turn to the whole beautiful paper 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.669
 bring 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.070
 and it was crazy for me 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.380
 important to have a good schedule 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.690
 and to know exactly when I'm doing something 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.120
 and my appointments are like laid 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:10.110
 and i have to send the calendar 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.350
 has all my appointments in vienna and he is 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.639
 pretty much follows but I can only 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.080
 everyone recommends his appointments 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.849
 write down otherwise you'll somehow 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.639
 messed up if you are a bit 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:23.010
 forgetful and like meals 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.930
 confuses and then it can 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.729
 but so also work super well 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.010
 I have nowhere in any way 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.900
 feeling that I'm overwhelmed because of me 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.080
 By the way, I work a bit 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.090
 I do not work much in any way 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.910
 have a small side job to 450 euro 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:42.139
 base and that's good that is 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.280
 By the way, more easily manageable and 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:48.780
 installers away and a lot on the way 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.789
 but it is in no way so that 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.260
 I feel like I can 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.789
 study can not do justice and can 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.020
 do not live up to my free time 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:06:00.090
 or can not help my girlfriend 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.699
 and of course that's probably for 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.300
 someone who thinks about it now 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:08.280
 I work this beside studying 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.500
 quite good to hear yes you can next to the 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.820
 study work yes you have to 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.680
 little planning and a bit 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.060
 bring organizations and of course 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.660
 also lucky enough to find a job 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.020
 the 1 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.690
 possible but then it is super feasible 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.820
 and there are, for example , the 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:29.200
 leipzig the student job exchange from 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.700
 Student work where employers hire 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.980
 then I know that they 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.160
 turn on your ad to students and 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.330
 the students do not always meet five days 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.010
 week was also like that 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.160
 between times you have and so you can 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.770
 For in any case be appropriate for 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.620
 and then regardless of bafög or 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.150
 to collect some money from scholarships 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.220
 to make your life beautiful 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.320
 without doing the study somehow from the 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.970
 to lose sight and I hope so 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.970
 could help you until next time
