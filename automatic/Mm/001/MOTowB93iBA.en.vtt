00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
that you put them down fast this is why

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.230 
that you put them down fast this is why
I<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:16.110> my<00:02:16.260> weapon<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.890> when<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.790> open<00:02:18.120> that

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.240 
I have my weapon and when you open that
sir<00:02:18.480> coffee<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.020> might<00:02:19.050> wake<00:02:19.500> up<00:02:19.710> father's

girlfriend she can hit you but I think

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.640 
girlfriend she can hit you but I think
her<00:02:23.430> nagging<00:02:23.880> hurts<00:02:24.180> more<00:02:24.510> than<00:02:24.570> hits<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.470> it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
her nagging hurts more than hits so it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.740 
her nagging hurts more than hits so it
says<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.280> same<00:02:26.520> as<00:02:26.760> father<00:02:27.090> did

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
he taught that paper pack was not enough

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.780 
he taught that paper pack was not enough
so<00:02:30.750> he<00:02:30.900> decided<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.650> wrap<00:02:31.890> her<00:02:32.100> up<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.580> teach

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
safe from her nagging also what is very

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.880 
safe from her nagging also what is very
important<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.840> have<00:02:46.200> space<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.530> your

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
important is to have space in your

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.160 
important is to have space in your
inventory<00:02:46.950> because<00:02:47.790> if<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.180> get<00:02:48.360> escaped<00:02:48.840> and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
inventory because if you get escaped and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.020 
inventory because if you get escaped and
your<00:02:49.290> inventory<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:49.860> full<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.430> drops<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
your inventory is full it drops on the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.570 
your inventory is full it drops on the
ground<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:52.140> would<00:02:52.350> suck<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.130> teleport

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
ground and it would suck if you teleport

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.390 
ground and it would suck if you teleport
away<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.600> this<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:54.959> why<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.200> often<00:02:55.560> loot<00:02:55.920> assess

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400

in the last room before I open those
urns<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:59.430> make<00:02:59.610> sure<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.450> enough<00:03:00.750> time<00:03:01.050> and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
urns to make sure I have enough time and

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.400 
urns to make sure I have enough time and
also<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.980> have<00:03:02.160> room<00:03:02.370> for<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.940> now<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.870> think<00:03:04.080> it

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
also I have room for it now I think it

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.290 
also I have room for it now I think it
is<00:03:04.590> time<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:05.040> see<00:03:05.250> what<00:03:05.489> all<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.730> caught<00:03:06.120> with

is time to see what all I caught with

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.050 
is time to see what all I caught with
that<00:03:06.450> 1000<00:03:07.020> openings<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.250> if<00:03:08.489> I<00:03:08.610> don't<00:03:08.820> count

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060

also<00:03:50.880> sell<00:03:51.150> those<00:03:51.390> tears<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:52.110> Simon<00:03:52.620> who<00:03:52.799> buys

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
also sell those tears to Simon who buys

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.289 
also sell those tears to Simon who buys
parks<00:03:53.549> for<00:03:53.790> 1,000<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.780> seals<00:03:55.290> for<00:03:56.060> 750<00:03:57.060> cold

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
parks for 1,000 and seals for 750 cold

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.289 
parks for 1,000 and seals for 750 cold
so<00:03:58.260> if<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.650> saw<00:03:58.860> seals<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.489> parks<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.820> him<00:04:00.090> I

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
so if I saw seals and parks to him I

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.670 
so if I saw seals and parks to him I
would<00:04:00.450> make<00:04:01.250> 180<00:04:02.250> 5k<00:04:03.060> but<00:04:03.959> I'm<00:04:04.140> not<00:04:04.290> going<00:04:04.560> to

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
start them nor my telethon because I

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.990 
start them nor my telethon because I
