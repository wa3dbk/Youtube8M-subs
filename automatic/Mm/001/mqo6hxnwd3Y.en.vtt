00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 and a lot 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.610
 new matches charlie 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.150
 it is surely you will have stayed a 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.460
 little freaked out of death we finished 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.850
 to see what is opposite now at the beginning 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.680
 of the clip I the truth that I stayed 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.260
 flipado are not the following because 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.420
 you will see what is in that game now 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.010
 in a minute 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.500
 will happen again and I will have it in 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.660
 slow motion so you can see well what 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.190
 what happened because I'm staying 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.620
 I'm not sure if they have 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.320
 returned the ya billings of elmo from uav to 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.510
 3 that people shot for shooting and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.350
 suddenly the missile was falling on you in the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.130
 head 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.760
 is that I was already blown away and is that more 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.980
 when I go with a good run because 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.070
 I'm going with a pretty good streak table 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.780
 melo sansÃ³ everything I take out the web blog took out 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.930
 the package again 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 bind a package is released 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.490
 the bomber here and these two that are 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.650
 doing they would be playing the text 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.410
 because one was crouching the other I do not know 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.270
 what I was doing but good as 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.130
 you can see is click with a good run 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.580
 people try to go for me and at the end 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.820
 At the end of it all, my uncle kills me more 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.590
 absurdity of the game with death is 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.550
 which is incredible because now you will see 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.140
 when we arrived at minute 23 hello my 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.570
 partner has taken me the paladin him 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.580
 I say come I'm going to put you with you like that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.940
 I'm going to do a little on tiptoe and like that 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.160
 I also took out the palatine 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.660
 you know that when a partner is 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.060
 compare well you can go up with him to 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.410
 support him here I realize that 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.640
 There is one with me 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.640
 can you come out who is with me 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.360
 is doing there in all the 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.100
 stations is behind rental unit 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.800
 the punch of this I go with a good 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.810
 you can see that the streak I have nothing 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.240
 pretty good here he killed this one and 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.870
 I get the paladin god I'm not going to 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.950
 throw yet because I'm doing very well and I'm going 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.590
 to try to get the DNA out of my DNA 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.480
 I say oh my mother how am I? I'm going to 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.540
 I'm going to try to get the pump out 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:36.200
 of adn ay I will not take out for lenin 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.390
 so on this map there are times that 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.840
 do not 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.510
 Not a long time ago 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.000
 I have the vulcan, I 'm going to try 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.000
 launch looking somewhere else 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.590
 protected to know more or less by 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.599
 where are they because you already know that I do not know 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.870
 loses a lot of time is a streak 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.810
 pretty fast you launch the missile is the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.680
 missile the beam and then with whatever 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.660
 in front 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:08.490
 and here you are going to realize that there is a 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.260
 a guard that is allied and that is what 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.360
 pass 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.970
 now there will be a kid who will want 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.120
 destroy the guard and aiming the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.280
 guard kills me I do not know how but what 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.190
 you go to see that now I enter so 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.110
 happily around here through the door and I 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.170
 I'm going to see here there's an uncle shooting in 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.490
 traveling I will go and suddenly die 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.040
 look at the repetition is that shooting goes away 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.380
 to war beat and turn around and it's coming 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.350
 to me is that sometimes I did mission that 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.910
 has a gust detector or something 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.530
 to see him in slow motion 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.250
 piccardo well that the kid has fired 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.070
 and suddenly I'm not dying 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.080
 I do not know why I was blown away in the 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.160
 repetition because I have broken the streak 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.160
 activate super good 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:03.670
 He has gone back and hit me 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.670
 because I have a detector in the ass 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.670
 amazing 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.060
 because I like
