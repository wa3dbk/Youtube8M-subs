there's<00:05:07.430> this<00:05:07.610> one<00:05:07.669> and<00:05:08.120> I<00:05:08.930> guess<00:05:09.080> it's<00:05:09.230> a

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
there's this one and I guess it's a

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.560 
there's this one and I guess it's a
spray<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.919> actually<00:05:10.460> I've<00:05:10.640> learned<00:05:10.940> instead

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
spray and actually I've learned instead

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.060 
spray and actually I've learned instead
of<00:05:11.690> trying<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:11.990> like<00:05:12.140> spraying<00:05:12.680> it<00:05:12.950> on

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
of trying it like spraying it on

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.980 
of trying it like spraying it on
yourself<00:05:13.460> put<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:14.120> in<00:05:14.240> your<00:05:14.419> palm<00:05:14.600> your<00:05:14.810> hand

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
yourself put it in your palm your hand

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.540 
yourself put it in your palm your hand
and<00:05:15.140> then<00:05:15.260> mix<00:05:15.470> around<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:15.919> last<00:05:16.130> longer<00:05:16.370> that

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
and then mix around and last longer that

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.710 
and then mix around and last longer that
way<00:05:16.669> because<00:05:16.850> when<00:05:17.000> you<00:05:17.090> spray<00:05:17.300> it<00:05:17.480> it<00:05:17.540> could

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
way because when you spray it it could

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.830 
way because when you spray it it could
like<00:05:17.840> kind<00:05:18.320> of<00:05:18.880> even<00:05:19.880> parts<00:05:20.300> of<00:05:20.390> your<00:05:20.510> body<00:05:20.720> and

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
like kind of even parts of your body and

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.540 
like kind of even parts of your body and
you're<00:05:20.960> wasting<00:05:21.290> some<00:05:21.440> of<00:05:21.500> it<00:05:21.680> so<00:05:21.890> there's

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
you're wasting some of it so there's

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.760 
you're wasting some of it so there's
this<00:05:22.730> and<00:05:24.400> next<00:05:25.400> thing<00:05:25.520> is<00:05:25.820> I<00:05:26.180> got<00:05:26.360> this

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
this and next thing is I got this

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.530 
this and next thing is I got this
because<00:05:27.770> you<00:05:28.130> know<00:05:28.190> it<00:05:28.340> says<00:05:28.550> body<00:05:28.820> firming

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
because you know it says body firming

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.590 
because you know it says body firming
treatment<00:05:29.750> and<00:05:30.260> I<00:05:30.320> think<00:05:30.770> I<00:05:30.890> got<00:05:31.070> this<00:05:31.280> at<00:05:31.580> I<00:05:32.390> do

actually<00:05:44.000> after<00:05:44.390> my<00:05:44.419> getaway<00:05:44.750> I<00:05:45.020> was<00:05:45.260> hoping<00:05:45.440> I

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
actually after my getaway I was hoping I

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.050 
actually after my getaway I was hoping I
was<00:05:45.560> gonna<00:05:45.650> come<00:05:45.890> beforehand<00:05:46.460> but<00:05:46.550> it<00:05:46.700> didn't
