00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.260
 very good to all youtube friends I 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.240
 I am young and this time I bring you 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.250
 a new video of the dc universe online in 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.379
 which we will learn how to use the 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.660
 ratchet center the site of this 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.210
 tutorial I'm doing because recently 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.510
 a user I keep it for facebook and 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.609
 good would it seemed a good idea is 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.220
 a tutorial about that since then in the 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.349
 trinque decentran city has two 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.170
 additional functions new part of 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.980
 granted for 20 seconds of 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.840
 increase by two seconds for two stands 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.090
 Well, what he did is the cook 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.710
 I am very clear that most of the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.110
 users who watch my videos are heroes 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.110
 So, I have an estuary here in the 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.820
 USPC server does not use much but 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.970
 the receipts using for this 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.890
 tutorial in the first one I'll tell you 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.589
 where the central trinquet is purchased 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.150
 although to find this trim that the 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.160
 only way to obtain it is buying 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.809
 it can not be acquired on a beach 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.000
 they have a law also a tour nothing of 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.190
 that 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.950
 and then to acquire it we have to go to 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.320
 canary page and well we know that is the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.510
 text area first because there in the 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.430
 entrance then that sign that says 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.590
 roof and also the icon of this this 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.840
 you're already like a circle with a 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:28.030
 line one with a strip in the middle 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.399
 the area where it is located where we can 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.990
 buy this ratchet this central city 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.539
 and to be able to enter that area 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.359
 we need the tlc of lighting lighting 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.479
 strikes that is the flash dlc or if not 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:42.340
 you have it and nothing but good if you're 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.219
 of the legendary then obviously having 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.259
 all times by automatically 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:49.770
 you can enter that one that we're going to go 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.770
 here to the area 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.210
 where is it located in the portal for 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.110
 enter the center on site 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.110
 I hope not to get lost 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.979
 I think it 's all 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.250
 yes very well here is central city let's 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.250
 get in 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.510
 well before continuing, I wanted to 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.600
 also thank all those people 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:15.000
 who watch my videos that give me their 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.780
 likes that comment my videos of truth 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.700
 what's that 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.480
 It encourages me a lot to continue climbing 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.459
 videos although this is this is central 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.110
 city ​​we are going to 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.460
 appear in this area Map 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.300
 villains appear from the other side 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.280
 street over there and then here we go 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.800
 to find a series of boxes where 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.460
 we can buy even armor weapons 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.130
 and necklaces among other things each of 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.220
 those boxes because you have equipment for 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.600
 certain role for example one of them 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.220
 can be of weight and the other of 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.830
 controller does not bring hitler and the other one 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.510
 I'm going to look for the one from then 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.610
 to find the one you want, let's go 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.830
 see here to tell you this once 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.200
 box has the 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.280
 this driver is here he has 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.280
 teams of 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:13.790
 Hitler teams have teams to be 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:17.120
 in tank equipment and is that this 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.560
 house is equipment for weight and well 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.989
 you are going to look for all of this here 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.810
 costs triumph marks and how can 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.700
 see here is the trinquet we bought it and 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.530
 well, we do not use it, only we 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.410
 we add to 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.230
 there to our slot where the 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.209
 trinquets I also have to say that for 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.760
 use this ratchet outfit that I do not know 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.990
 how much is I think it's 10 points is 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.580
 a feat a feat well those who 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.290
 I wanted to comment when we 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.930
 we use this trinquen the only disadvantage 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.970
 that has or the only annoying thing is that 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.250
 after we passed after it was 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.290
 it takes away from you the effect of being 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.310
 they remove the transformation because I think that 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.350
 you have to wait about one to think 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.510
 that five minutes to be able to go back to 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.160
 use it although it appears and available 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.010
 because we will not be able to use it go 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.470
 to see contention ok if we use the trinquet 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.940
 First, we are going to add this 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.060
 is here in the case that I am a hitler 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.780
 because for 20 seconds it's going to give me 432 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.920
 of restoration and will increase me to 1.039 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.020
 of power 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.810
 only using one but also 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.770
 has other advantages because when 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.570
 use lee I'll do it once 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.340
 because it would be very annoying to wait 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.640
 reuse this train that since 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.280
 I have to wait about 45 3 minutes 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.280
 I do not know very well I'm not sure ok 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.560
 then we use it in this case 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.350
 I eat how I started, I have the key 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.940
 number 8 in the case of those who play in 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.150
 console for example that that 3 that 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.680
 obviously this game 0 is in pc 3 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.680
 Well, you are going to use the key 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.840
 a button there that is to use the 30 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.170
 we use it once and then and if 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.170
 we use again and we use 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:06.330
 we press the attack click 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.720
 secondary weapon for example in the 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.370
 PC case is the right click true in 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.020
 the case of the consoles because I did not know 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.030
 tell him but you know is the attack 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.850
 secondary weapon then we use 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.590
 can be transformed as well as style 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.690
 flash we use again and we leave 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.160
 include right pressed and it's going to be 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.200
 this attack 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.460
 that this attack is to hurt the 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.520
 only weakness that it has is that it 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.320
 can interrupt and if we use it and 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.230
 we use the left click that is the 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.740
 primary clip then in the case of the hit 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.729
 does this place a group shield not to 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:44.210
 four people telling you 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:46.909
 and then in the case of us, only 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.680
 you can do twice the skill 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.240
 of special in the case for example it 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.460
 challenge between a controller but not 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.580
 is controller and what he did was that 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.680
 he cured some in some roles I think 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.809
 that he will heal and in others he will put that 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.309
 shield those are the two functions that 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:03.900
 well I did not know before 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:06.580
 shield and I found out 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.510
 well, a long time ago but I did not know 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.450
 so 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.760
 in short guys we can remember that 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.200
 it's once we use it we're going to 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.350
 it seems that it is available but not 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.240
 we can use will do that and well 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.820
 in summary to finish with this 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.580
 small tutorial so if we use a 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.410
 Once the trinquet will transform us like this 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.540
 as flash and more will add the studs 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.550
 will increase the states that 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.030
 says for 20 seconds and we return it to 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.680
 use and we left the right click 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.900
 pressed then it's going to be like like a 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.490
 attack advance the fist to lift the 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.790
 fist and it's going to be like an attack and 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.730
 special that has weakness is a 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.830
 attack for damage you can use it in 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.000
 pvp pp I do not recommend it much because 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.000
 he has vulnerability 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.610
 if we use it again and press 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.410
 we left the left pressed then 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.390
 goes in the case of the killer is going to take a 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.220
 shield in the case of the other roles 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.960
 Well I do not know, just try it with a 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:06.550
 controller and what he did was that he 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:09.040
 cured that as well as this power of 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.400
 electric to heal 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.140
 obviously you guys want to do 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.760
 obviously this order does not affect 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.620
 because for example if I use the tri 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.710
 it stayed right now and I want to take out the 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:24.270
 shield that is like pressing again 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:26.070
 the trinquet and using the trinquet and 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.870
 giving him left click obviously 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.120
 will take the shield not necessarily 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.560
 has there is a specific order what 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.600
 important is that we first have the 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.040
 shield forgiveness the ratchet obviously 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.500
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.750

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.450

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.540
 of the character that I'm going to create that more 

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.760
 I'm going to say badly yet because I know 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.350
 can say tomorrow but today what I'm going to 

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.250
 do is level up to give them 

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:04.110
 you a clearer idea of how to upload 

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.700
 level or to help you guys good 

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.420
 guys without having to add that era 

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.420

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.150
