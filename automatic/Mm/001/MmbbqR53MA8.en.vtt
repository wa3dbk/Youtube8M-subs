00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.650
 hello good kids we are here with 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.830
 a new video this time on ps3 and it was 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.050
 some days that nothing came up 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.779
 playboy with the remington with laser sight 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.279
 and long and secondary cannon was 23 is 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.700
 the class that I have mentioned to you 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.870
 I use to get a job and everything 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:37.500
 this but right now I would change the ship 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.480
 23 for the cab 40 since I see it more more 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.420
 effective for when we see ourselves like this 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.500
 hurried good as you see we were going 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.060
 losing 73 to 100 was a team like that in 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
 this map usually change quite 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.530
 I think that from the maps that are most 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.210
 campea along with plaza that are usually 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.880
 climb up there to the typical ones 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.920
 well I think it's one of the most 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.260
 the people but good I got locked up 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.339
 here a bit with the streak that came that 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.400
 I carry the turret he is the guardian and in the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.650
 well then I can bury them myself 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.299
 same a little bit we do not depend so much on 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.920
 equipment to be able to enclose them even though 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.200
 They carry pm is puesteros bust 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.829
 right away but good at the guardian we 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.749
 It helps to know where they are going 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.659
 right away that someone is going 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:26.310
 there, he warns us and we can have the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.520
 backs well a little more covered but 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.090
 you see that it did not last long and nothing 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 class I take her with a scavenger this time 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.979
 to get a job and things from these 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.229
 I like to take it with my hands 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.899
 agile because it is born in sea ​​puts a 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.030
 insertion and you go out to catch all the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.540
 backup but good this time 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.790
 I preferred to go drunk and when 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.550
 I want to try a streak so better 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.470
 scavenger that that agile hands good and 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.970
 Attention to the one that fails that less evil 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.310
 that did not know the first and a half 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.860
 time and still to charge me what was in 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.170
 the corner but good is this map 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.670
 advisor is the best part to catch here 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.030
 answer is this part d 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.090
 from audi right now I do not know I think 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.420
 It's my defense and well, you've seen and 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.489
 the nuclear with the scorpion that was almost 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.640
 almost equal controlling this part 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.350
 of the response and it lasted almost the same but 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.810
 Well this time did not take me down vega 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.850
 is missing a bit because here did not stop 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.680
 to charge me if we try not to 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.590
 surpass this part of here the door 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.350
 is the part where they come down right now and 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.880
 the stairs on the right as the 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.800
 we can lock up pretty well always 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.739
 that we do not exceed to get a 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.780
 work already would be another thing because 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.430
 we would have to go to the right or 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.680
 try to go around up there 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.380
 Where are the campers with the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.030
 frank but good to try so 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.280
 gusts you can be the best part good 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.620
 this one that propelled and did not not know 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.470
 some and what steps but luckily 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.730
 he did not give me and well, there controlling 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.989
 with the turret and the guard not in the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.450
 another part as you see me was 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.870
 working quite well because that's it 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.490
 this streak dwells for to also do 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.340
 other casualties is 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.410
 perfect because you put the turret 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.830
 above all you put it far away where 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.130
 you do not want them to go and the guardian 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.470
 where do you want to enter for 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.540
 get the other low then the 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.810
 turret does not happen through the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.790
 part that you do not want and do not stop going 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.070
 for where the guardian is 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.430
 that apart from pointing those are the 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.450
 leaves a little lost because then that we 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.709
 help us 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.930
 to charge us the best while 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.910
 they are there a little stunned and good there 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.220
 You can see how they were falling, I already had 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.720
 almost a nuclear I tried not to risk 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.450
 but I saw them here that were coming out 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.280
 everyone was going for this but I said to see if 9 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.860
 I have one or two left and I'll take it 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.330
 but I had two just up that seems 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.670
 they were with the franc but good and 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.769
 get it out I load a couple more 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.959
 but hey it was pretty fast as 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.000
 you have seen this part is that I 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.840
 I love this part of the map but it's a 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.780
 map quite difficult to catch and nothing 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.959
 There they shot me a gun and I do not know anymore 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.209
 if it was with the s12 or with the other but that 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.359
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.359
 next
