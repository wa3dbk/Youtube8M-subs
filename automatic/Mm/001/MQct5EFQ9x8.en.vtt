frontal way as we might have expected in

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.500 
frontal way as we might have expected in
the<00:00:25.800> more<00:00:25.949> medieval<00:00:26.160> tradition<00:00:26.789> exactly

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the more medieval tradition exactly

instead<00:00:27.900> Francis<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.039> kneeling<00:00:29.760> he's<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.510> a

naturalistic landscape or the beginnings

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.450 
naturalistic landscape or the beginnings
we<00:00:33.960> could<00:00:34.140> say<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> van<00:00:34.770> Angeles<00:00:35.280> tick

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.970 
we could say a van Angeles tick
landscape<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.360> as<00:00:37.230> he<00:00:37.440> receives<00:00:37.860> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
three-dimensional presence really

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.980 
three-dimensional presence really

painting I want to go back to that point
you<00:01:21.960> made<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> moment<00:01:22.380> ago<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you made a moment ago of the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.070 
you made a moment ago of the
naturalistic<00:01:23.909> landscape<00:01:24.330> because<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.930> is

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
naturalistic landscape because this is

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.510 
naturalistic landscape because this is
certainly<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.530> naturalism<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.369> would

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
certainly not naturalism as we would

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.060 
certainly not naturalism as we would
expect<00:01:26.549> now<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.299> 21st<00:01:27.750> century<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.799> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
expect now in the 21st century but it is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.980 
expect now in the 21st century but it is
at<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> very<00:01:29.880> beginning<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> 14th<00:01:30.689> or<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
very end of the 13th century quite an

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.420 
very end of the 13th century quite an
extraordinary<00:01:33.590> innovation<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.710> place<00:01:34.950> this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
extraordinary innovation to place this

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.640 
extraordinary innovation to place this
really<00:01:36.299> physical<00:01:36.900> figure<00:01:37.229> as<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.500> had

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
really physical figure as you had

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.890 
really physical figure as you had
described<00:01:38.070> him<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.549> an<00:01:39.060> environment<00:01:39.659> with

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
described him in an environment with

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.140 
described him in an environment with
trees<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> mountain<00:01:41.009> clearly<00:01:41.670> his<00:01:41.850> scale

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
trees with a mountain clearly his scale

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.880 
trees with a mountain clearly his scale
doesn't<00:01:42.570> match<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.110> buildings<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
doesn't match the buildings and the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
doesn't match the buildings and the
trees<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:45.030> there's<00:01:45.329> an<00:01:45.479> effort<00:01:45.810> here<00:01:45.960> by

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
trees but there's an effort here by

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.100 
trees but there's an effort here by
Giotto<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.590> place<00:01:46.979> him<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.460> earth<00:01:47.850> not<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.930> in

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
Giotto to place him on earth not just in

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.139 
Giotto to place him on earth not just in
a<00:01:49.200> heavenly<00:01:49.500> space<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.030> this

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
a heavenly space so we see this

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.999 
a heavenly space so we see this
extraordinary<00:01:51.570> gold-filled<00:01:52.409> background<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
extraordinary gold-filled background the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.000 
linked to sort of ecological movements
and<00:03:43.850> often<00:03:44.510> seen<00:03:44.660> as<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.840> patron<00:03:45.410> of<00:03:45.500> nature<00:03:45.830> I

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.520 
love the way he reaches out toward the
animals<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:50.060> way<00:03:50.209> that<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.870> figures<00:03:51.200> are

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
animals the way that the figures are

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.039 
animals the way that the figures are
very<00:03:52.190> stark<00:03:52.610> against<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.299> gold<00:03:53.630> background

very stark against that gold background
so<00:03:54.769> they're<00:03:54.920> this<00:03:55.070> heavenly<00:03:55.610> realm<00:03:56.000> but

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
so they're this heavenly realm but

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.830 
so they're this heavenly realm but
simultaneously<00:03:57.130> in<00:03:58.130> an<00:03:58.459> earthly<00:03:58.760> realm<00:03:59.299> it

seems<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.320> me<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:00.470> Giotto<00:04:00.830> has<00:04:01.010> United<00:04:02.000> both

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239
