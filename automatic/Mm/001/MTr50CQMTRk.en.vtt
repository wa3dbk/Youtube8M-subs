00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
corner why 2007 half was that's 212 so I

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.530 
corner why 2007 half was that's 212 so I
don't<00:03:33.639> know<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.880> that<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.030> for<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.329> Crimson

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
their limited edition for 30-odd but I

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.490 
their limited edition for 30-odd but I
don't<00:03:39.670> think<00:03:39.819> they<00:03:39.910> are<00:03:40.150> because<00:03:40.989> they<00:03:41.200> were

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
don't think they are because they were

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.479 
don't think they are because they were
in<00:03:41.620> like<00:03:42.069> it<00:03:42.450> hard<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.660> get<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:43.959> off<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:45.190> came

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
in like it hard to get it off it came

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.610 
in like it hard to get it off it came
out<00:03:45.639> about<00:03:45.849> a<00:03:46.060> little<00:03:46.419> gift<00:03:46.720> from<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:47.109> birthday

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
out about a little gift from a birthday

00:03:47.620 --> 00:04:01.360 
out about a little gift from a birthday
quality<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:50.250> yeah<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.639> wonder<00:03:52.630> comparison

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.580 

so<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:02.519> is<00:04:02.549> equal<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:04.370> insoles<00:04:05.370> here<00:04:06.590> holdin

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
so this is equal to insoles here holdin

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.520 
so this is equal to insoles here holdin
on<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:08.390> so<00:04:09.390> obviously<00:04:09.480> this<00:04:09.959> one<00:04:10.140> even<00:04:10.230> have

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
on you so obviously this one even have

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:19.849 
on you so obviously this one even have
it<00:04:10.650> because<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.129> gel<00:04:11.459> that's<00:04:11.730> one<00:04:18.289> do<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.440> same

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
it because of gel that's one do the same

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.180 
it because of gel that's one do the same
thickness<00:04:20.220> except<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.419> end<00:04:22.410> here<00:04:23.039> we

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
thickness except on that end here we

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.080 
thickness except on that end here we
chose<00:04:23.490> no<00:04:23.789> it's<00:04:24.060> actually<00:04:24.240> thicker<00:04:24.810> in<00:04:25.229> this

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
chose no it's actually thicker in this

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.080 
chose no it's actually thicker in this
they're<00:04:27.090> both<00:04:27.270> really<00:04:30.020> real<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.940> she<00:04:32.940> was
