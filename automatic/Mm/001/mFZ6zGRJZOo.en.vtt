me so it was a lot of fun one of the
biggest<00:00:58.620> challenges<00:00:59.190> were<00:00:59.399> cleanliness<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
biggest challenges were cleanliness and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.789 
biggest challenges were cleanliness and
really<00:01:01.440> really<00:01:02.430> making<00:01:02.609> sure<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> shapes<00:01:03.120> red

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
really really making sure the shapes red

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
so I feel like with those things like

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.880 
so I feel like with those things like
were<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> things<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:07.530> always<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
were the things that are always in the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.050 
were the things that are always in the
back<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.070> our<00:01:08.280> heads<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.670> was<00:01:08.850> doing<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
back of our heads as we was doing the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.000 
back of our heads as we was doing the
dances<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:09.869> good<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
dances like it's good to have the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.800 
dances like it's good to have the
character<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.790> charisma<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.570> stuff

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
character the charisma all that stuff

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.660 
character the charisma all that stuff
but<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.890> didn't<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.280> shapes<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
but if we didn't have the shapes and the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.499 
but if we didn't have the shapes and the
cleanliness<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.240> would<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.479> just

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
cleanliness and it would have just

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.749 
cleanliness and it would have just
completely<00:01:16.350> fell<00:01:16.619> apart<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.130> think<00:01:17.490> those<00:01:17.610> were

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
completely fell apart I think those were

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.460 
completely fell apart I think those were
the<00:01:17.880> two<00:01:18.090> major<00:01:18.420> things<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.020> had<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.290> like

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the two major things that we had to like

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.219 
the two major things that we had to like
constantly<00:01:20.009> keep<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.610> definitely<00:01:21.390> well

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
constantly keep up on definitely well

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.140 
constantly keep up on definitely well
the<00:01:22.350> truth<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.799> think<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.670> real<00:01:23.880> beauty

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the truth is I think the the real beauty

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.030 
the truth is I think the the real beauty
of<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:25.049> routine<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.770> type<00:01:26.009> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
of the routine and this type of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.160 
of the routine and this type of
choreography<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.630> focus<00:01:27.990> is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
choreography is that the the focus is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.289 
choreography is that the the focus is
the<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.799> combination<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> two<00:01:29.909> people

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the the combination of the two people

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.179 
the the combination of the two people
you<00:01:30.479> know<00:01:30.600> no<00:01:30.900> one<00:01:31.079> person<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:31.890> steal

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
you know no one person can really steal

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.039 
you know no one person can really steal
away<00:01:32.310> from<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.150> image<00:01:33.270> when<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.570> created

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
away from the image when it's created

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
away from the image when it's created
properly<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.009> i<00:01:35.040> think<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.400> was<00:01:35.549> really<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
properly so i think that was really the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.929 
properly so i think that was really the
key<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.360> when<00:01:36.810> they<00:01:36.960> made<00:01:37.140> their<00:01:37.979> lines<00:01:38.280> make

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
key is when they made their lines make

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.210 
key is when they made their lines make
these<00:01:39.270> shapes<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.840> became<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.710> focus<00:01:41.070> so

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
these shapes that became the focus so

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.109 
these shapes that became the focus so
you<00:01:41.280> didn't<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> worry<00:01:41.820> about<00:01:41.970> like
