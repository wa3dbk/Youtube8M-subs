00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
maybe I don't know the logitech

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.180 
maybe I don't know the logitech
darkfield<00:06:13.050> that's<00:06:13.440> the<00:06:13.650> laser<00:06:13.860> that<00:06:14.070> you

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
darkfield that's the laser that you

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.750 
darkfield that's the laser that you
can't<00:06:14.430> see<00:06:15.260> and<00:06:16.260> then<00:06:16.380> I'll<00:06:16.590> get<00:06:16.770> this<00:06:17.010> and

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
can't see and then I'll get this and

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.610 
can't see and then I'll get this and
prepare<00:06:18.060> to<00:06:18.090> my<00:06:18.300> performance<00:06:18.810> MX

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
prepare to my performance MX

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.250 
prepare to my performance MX
a<00:06:19.650> hundred<00:06:19.979> dollar<00:06:20.190> mouse<00:06:20.430> right<00:06:20.639> here<00:06:21.260> and

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
a hundred dollar mouse right here and

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.170 
a hundred dollar mouse right here and
you<00:06:22.410> see<00:06:22.590> the<00:06:22.680> difference<00:06:23.070> it's<00:06:23.639> a<00:06:23.699> dark<00:06:23.970> field

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
you see the difference it's a dark field

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.050 
you see the difference it's a dark field
laser<00:06:24.680> you<00:06:25.680> could<00:06:25.860> if<00:06:26.100> you<00:06:26.250> if<00:06:26.490> I<00:06:26.639> put<00:06:26.970> them

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
laser you could if you if I put them

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.990 
laser you could if you if I put them
batters<00:06:27.360> and<00:06:27.540> turn<00:06:27.660> it<00:06:27.780> on<00:06:28.520> you<00:06:29.520> cannot<00:06:29.790> see

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
batters and turn it on you cannot see

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.250 
batters and turn it on you cannot see
little<00:06:30.210> laser<00:06:30.360> at<00:06:30.570> all<00:06:30.750> you<00:06:30.930> can't<00:06:31.139> see

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
little laser at all you can't see

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.540 
little laser at all you can't see
anywhere<00:06:32.900> all<00:06:33.900> right<00:06:33.960> if<00:06:34.740> I<00:06:34.889> get<00:06:34.949> this<00:06:35.280> mouse

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
anywhere all right if I get this mouse

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.360 
anywhere all right if I get this mouse
and<00:06:35.880> turn<00:06:36.419> it<00:06:36.540> on<00:06:36.690> it's<00:06:37.380> just<00:06:37.470> a<00:06:37.650> normal<00:06:37.949> LED

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
and turn it on it's just a normal LED

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.510 
and turn it on it's just a normal LED
laser<00:06:38.610> like<00:06:39.600> that<00:06:39.840> and<00:06:40.139> we<00:06:40.830> get<00:06:40.949> this<00:06:41.250> it

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
laser like that and we get this it

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.969 
laser like that and we get this it
should<00:06:41.910> it<00:06:42.240> should<00:06:42.270> be<00:06:42.630> a<00:06:42.870> very<00:06:43.380> very<00:06:43.740> very

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 
should it should be a very very very

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:47.450 
should it should be a very very very
very<00:06:44.340> very<00:06:44.940> tiny<00:06:45.720> and<00:06:46.110> very<00:06:46.380> accurate<00:06:46.919> laser<00:06:47.070> I

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
very very tiny and very accurate laser I

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.230 
very very tiny and very accurate laser I
mean<00:06:48.210> this<00:06:48.300> laser<00:06:48.570> is<00:06:48.720> like<00:06:48.990> it's<00:06:49.949> like<00:06:50.130> a

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
mean this laser is like it's like a

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.439 
mean this laser is like it's like a
super<00:06:51.240> super<00:06:51.419> sharp<00:06:51.810> red<00:06:52.550> laser<00:06:53.550> it<00:06:54.060> is<00:06:54.360> the

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:54.449 
super super sharp red laser it is the

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:58.100 
super super sharp red laser it is the
laser<00:06:54.660> not<00:06:54.990> an<00:06:55.110> LED<00:06:56.270> so<00:06:57.270> here's<00:06:57.479> that<00:06:57.630> stuff<00:06:57.870> as

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
laser not an LED so here's that stuff as

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:04.700 
laser not an LED so here's that stuff as
hyper<00:06:58.500> scoring<00:07:00.590> yeah<00:07:03.199> you<00:07:04.199> stop<00:07:04.440> like<00:07:04.680> that

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
hyper scoring yeah you stop like that

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.159 
hyper scoring yeah you stop like that
short<00:07:05.160> like<00:07:05.340> that<00:07:05.419> and<00:07:06.419> you<00:07:06.660> can<00:07:06.750> see<00:07:06.870> the<00:07:06.960> size

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:07.169 
short like that and you can see the size

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:11.090 
short like that and you can see the size
difference<00:07:07.199> not<00:07:07.949> not<00:07:08.340> really<00:07:08.940> but<00:07:09.919> this<00:07:10.919> is

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 
difference not not really but this is

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.150 
difference not not really but this is
just<00:07:11.280> nice<00:07:11.460> metal<00:07:12.240> or<00:07:12.389> Chrome<00:07:12.690> it's<00:07:13.320> real<00:07:13.680> it's

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
just nice metal or Chrome it's real it's

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.969 
just nice metal or Chrome it's real it's
cold<00:07:14.550> and<00:07:15.030> it<00:07:15.150> feels<00:07:15.330> good<00:07:15.510> this<00:07:16.350> just<00:07:16.710> uses

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:16.979 
cold and it feels good this just uses

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:20.629 
cold and it feels good this just uses
glossy<00:07:17.669> plastic<00:07:17.880> it<00:07:18.660> matches<00:07:19.380> my<00:07:19.590> my<00:07:20.340> setup

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 
glossy plastic it matches my my setup

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.370 
glossy plastic it matches my my setup
