00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
on my laptop and editing on the big

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.040 
on my laptop and editing on the big
screen<00:00:38.829> in<00:00:38.860> my<00:00:39.190> home<00:00:39.399> theater<00:00:39.670> while<00:00:40.600> typing

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
screen in my home theater while typing

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.819 
screen in my home theater while typing
on<00:00:41.200> my<00:00:41.579> regular<00:00:42.579> laptop<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.719> then<00:00:44.590> you<00:00:44.710> can

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
on my regular laptop and then you can

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.130 
on my regular laptop and then you can
also<00:00:44.950> drag<00:00:45.430> files<00:00:45.910> between<00:00:46.600> so<00:00:46.899> you<00:00:46.930> can

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
also drag files between so you can

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.200 
also drag files between so you can
quickly<00:00:47.590> copy<00:00:47.860> and<00:00:48.129> paste<00:00:48.370> or<00:00:48.640> share<00:00:49.180> files

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
quickly copy and paste or share files

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.850

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
between the two places

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.049 
between the two places
so<00:00:51.039> it's<00:00:51.730> better<00:00:52.450> than<00:00:52.629> a<00:00:52.719> KVM<00:00:53.610> dwyer<00:00:54.610> list<00:00:54.910> cuz

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
so it's better than a KVM dwyer list cuz

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.139 
so it's better than a KVM dwyer list cuz
it<00:00:55.120> works<00:00:55.210> over<00:00:55.420> my<00:00:55.629> wireless<00:00:56.050> network<00:00:56.410> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.569 
it works over my wireless network and
it's<00:00:58.149> pretty<00:00:58.539> lag<00:00:58.840> free<00:00:59.410> I've<00:00:59.620> played<00:01:00.100> rift

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
it's pretty lag free I've played rift

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.200 
it's pretty lag free I've played rift

something
like<00:02:17.709> that<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.580> lets<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:18.940> do<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.299> you

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
like that this lets you do that you

a better interface most the time then
the<00:02:30.640> wireless<00:02:31.420> keyboard<00:02:32.110> mouse<00:02:32.530> combos<00:02:33.069> so<00:02:33.720> I

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
the wireless keyboard mouse combos so I

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.199 
the wireless keyboard mouse combos so I
love<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.980> makes<00:02:36.129> me<00:02:36.310> more<00:02:36.489> productive<00:02:36.670> I've

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
love it it makes me more productive I've

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.149 
love it it makes me more productive I've
used<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.690> for<00:02:37.720> years<00:02:38.079> I<00:02:38.319> was<00:02:38.530> glad<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.799> see<00:02:38.950> they

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
used it for years I was glad to see they

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.030 
used it for years I was glad to see they
released<00:02:39.489> it<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.930> setup<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.409> very<00:02:41.530> easy

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
released it and the setup is very easy

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.890 
released it and the setup is very easy
because<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.519> basically<00:02:42.790> says<00:02:43.329> here's<00:02:43.750> the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
because it basically says here's the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.839 
because it basically says here's the
name<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.500> computer<00:02:44.769> here's<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.519> security

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
name of the computer here's the security

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.000 
name of the computer here's the security
code<00:02:46.209> go<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.019> other<00:02:47.200> computer<00:02:47.709> put<00:02:47.950> the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
code go to the other computer put the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.680 
code go to the other computer put the
name<00:02:48.129> of<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.310> computer<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.790> put<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.329> security

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
name of the computer in put the security

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.530 
name of the computer in put the security
code<00:02:49.870> in<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:50.260> they<00:02:50.560> can<00:02:50.739> act<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.299> so<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.390> will

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
code in and they can act and so it will

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.680 
code in and they can act and so it will
also<00:02:52.840> work<00:02:53.019> with<00:02:53.549> four<00:02:54.549> computers<00:02:55.180> per<00:02:55.420> block

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
also work with four computers per block

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.050 
also work with four computers per block
but<00:02:56.500> if<00:02:56.739> there<00:02:57.190> are<00:02:57.220> other<00:02:57.519> people<00:02:57.730> on<00:02:57.940> your

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
but if there are other people on your

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.650 
but if there are other people on your
network<00:02:58.510> they<00:02:59.319> won't<00:02:59.620> see<00:02:59.950> your<00:03:00.280> computers<00:03:00.940> to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
network they won't see your computers to

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.110 
network they won't see your computers to
connect<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.170> them<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.560> it's<00:03:03.120> reasonably

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
connect to them so it's reasonably

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.360 
connect to them so it's reasonably
secure<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:04.810> don't<00:03:05.500> know<00:03:05.650> whether<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:06.010> packets

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
secure I don't know whether the packets

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.800 
secure I don't know whether the packets
are<00:03:06.489> encrypted<00:03:06.879> on<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.060> back<00:03:07.209> end<00:03:07.450> or<00:03:07.629> any<00:03:07.750> of

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
are encrypted on the back end or any of

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.349 
are encrypted on the back end or any of
that<00:03:07.930> stuff<00:03:08.109> so<00:03:08.819> who<00:03:09.819> knows<00:03:10.000> whether<00:03:10.209> or<00:03:10.299> not

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
that stuff so who knows whether or not

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.330 
that stuff so who knows whether or not
you<00:03:10.569> could<00:03:10.690> do<00:03:10.780> keyboard<00:03:11.260> logging<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.099> didn't

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
you could do keyboard logging I didn't

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.440 
you could do keyboard logging I didn't
read<00:03:12.519> all<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:13.180> stuff<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:13.840> um<00:03:14.819> it's<00:03:15.819> it's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
read all the stuff but um it's it's

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.660 
read all the stuff but um it's it's
great<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.019> I'm<00:03:17.560> assuming<00:03:17.890> it's<00:03:18.220> pretty<00:03:18.430> good

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
great and I'm assuming it's pretty good

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.059 
great and I'm assuming it's pretty good
because<00:03:18.970> it's<00:03:19.150> written<00:03:19.299> by<00:03:19.510> Truong<00:03:20.379> doe<00:03:20.680> who
