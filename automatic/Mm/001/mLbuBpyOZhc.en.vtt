this quick note the transformation on

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.200 
this quick note the transformation on
the<00:00:11.280> sky<00:00:11.690> the<00:00:12.690> vehicle<00:00:13.049> mode<00:00:13.200> it's<00:00:14.059> just<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
the sky the vehicle mode it's just a

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.099 
the sky the vehicle mode it's just a
slight<00:00:15.780> well<00:00:16.369> it's<00:00:17.369> not<00:00:17.580> exactly<00:00:17.940> as<00:00:18.630> its

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
slight well it's not exactly as its

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.019 
slight well it's not exactly as its
described<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.100> an<00:00:20.220> instruction<00:00:20.699> mainly

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
described in an instruction mainly

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.870 
described in an instruction mainly
because<00:00:21.529> data<00:00:22.529> why<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.859> default<00:00:23.340> has<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.730> it

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
because data why the default has it it

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.450 
because data why the default has it it
would<00:00:24.060> be<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> little<00:00:24.510> more<00:00:24.869> how<00:00:25.800> should<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.189> say

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
would be a little more how should we say

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.480 
would be a little more how should we say
hooked<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:28.050> proper<00:00:28.410> way<00:00:28.560> would<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:29.130> this

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
hooked up the proper way would have this

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.970 
hooked up the proper way would have this
more<00:00:30.210> like<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.630> one<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.830> it

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
more like this one but here I have it

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.470 
more like this one but here I have it
cattle<00:00:32.369> no<00:00:32.520> more<00:00:33.170> lowered<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.420> by<00:00:36.420> the

cattle no more lowered here and by the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.420 
cattle no more lowered here and by the
only<00:00:36.899> problem<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.559> its<00:00:37.860> heads<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.280> little

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
only problem that is its heads a little

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.380

and<00:01:06.090> see<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:10.380> handlebars<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.360> fold<00:01:12.840> them

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
and see the handlebars you can fold them

in<00:01:13.490> I'm<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:14.939> cell<00:01:15.210> delay<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:21.140> ok

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
in I'm get to my cell delay here ok

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.929 
in I'm get to my cell delay here ok
let's<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.650> i<00:01:23.159> theta<00:01:23.549> i<00:01:24.000> fold<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.850> out<00:01:26.850> of

let's get this i theta i fold in out of

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.149 
let's get this i theta i fold in out of
the<00:01:27.060> way

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the way

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.090 
the way
okay<00:01:30.030> that's<00:01:30.179> pretty<00:01:30.390> much<00:01:30.539> it<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:31.100> just

slide the head if it's into position if

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.969 
slide the head if it's into position if
it's<00:01:34.950> not<00:01:35.130> right<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.490> already<00:01:39.710> got<00:01:40.710> Coast

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it's not right they already got Coast

after<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.690> guess<00:03:12.989> transformation<00:03:13.680> joint<00:03:13.920> here

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
after I guess transformation joint here

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.180 
after I guess transformation joint here
see<00:03:16.260> here<00:03:16.560> we<00:03:16.680> got<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:18.410> Civil<00:03:19.410> here<00:03:19.879> pivot

really um that's it I guess I'll make a
quick<00:04:00.900> transformation<00:04:01.620> back<00:04:01.829> and<00:04:02.160> will<00:04:02.910> end

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
quick transformation back and will end

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.040

transformations post count slide the
head<00:04:58.970> forward<00:04:59.480> and<00:05:00.460> here<00:05:01.460> we<00:05:01.580> go<00:05:01.780> it's

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
head forward and here we go it's

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.160 
head forward and here we go it's
supposed<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.140> sign<00:05:03.680> go<00:05:03.830> forward<00:05:04.220> like<00:05:04.370> this

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
supposed to sign go forward like this

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.270 
supposed to sign go forward like this
and<00:05:06.170> we<00:05:06.500> got<00:05:06.680> this<00:05:08.380> it<00:05:09.380> count<00:05:09.680> goes<00:05:09.860> up<00:05:10.070> and

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
and we got this it count goes up and

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.840 
and we got this it count goes up and
covers<00:05:10.730> that<00:05:10.880> like<00:05:11.090> this<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:13.340> push<00:05:13.640> the

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
covers that like this and push the

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.670 
covers that like this and push the
wheels<00:05:14.120> back<00:05:14.600> in<00:05:16.720> okay<00:05:17.720> and<00:05:17.750> then<00:05:18.200> we<00:05:18.350> attach

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
wheels back in okay and then we attach

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.710 
wheels back in okay and then we attach
this<00:05:19.010> a<00:05:21.070> little<00:05:22.070> bit<00:05:22.580> oh<00:05:22.820> I'm<00:05:23.360> sure<00:05:23.540> it's

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
this a little bit oh I'm sure it's

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.610 
this a little bit oh I'm sure it's
probably<00:05:23.960> best<00:05:24.170> if<00:05:24.440> I<00:05:26.080> good<00:05:27.080> this<00:05:27.350> way<00:05:27.620> here

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
probably best if I good this way here

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.450 
probably best if I good this way here
touch<00:05:30.620> it<00:05:31.010> and<00:05:31.700> then<00:05:31.970> here<00:05:32.240> we<00:05:32.270> can<00:05:33.460> twist

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
touch it and then here we can twist

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.450 
touch it and then here we can twist
around

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
around

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.629 
around
okay<00:05:37.300> that's<00:05:37.539> the<00:05:37.750> default<00:05:38.009> I<00:05:39.009> guess<00:05:39.520> the

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
okay that's the default I guess the

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.900 
okay that's the default I guess the
default<00:05:40.030> vehicle<00:05:40.389> mode<00:05:40.539> right<00:05:41.020> there<00:05:41.789> can<00:05:42.789> we

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
default vehicle mode right there can we

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.529 
default vehicle mode right there can we
back<00:05:43.090> down<00:05:43.120> little<00:05:43.660> bitch<00:05:43.780> here<00:05:44.440> we<00:05:44.680> go<00:05:45.539> okay
