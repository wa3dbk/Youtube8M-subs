they've already created a Halloween
texture<00:01:08.760> pack<00:01:08.939> how<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:09.450> change<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:10.020> up

year Halloween is the same thing over
and<00:01:14.220> over<00:01:14.760> again<00:01:14.850> throughout<00:01:15.360> each<00:01:15.630> year<00:01:16.020> so

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and over again throughout each year so

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.170 
and over again throughout each year so
what<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.830> they<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.009> differently<00:01:17.549> that's<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
what can they do differently that's the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.030 
what can they do differently that's the
only<00:01:18.360> problem<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.960> idea<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.890> is

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
only problem with that idea but it is

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.429 
only problem with that idea but it is
still<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.640> possibility<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.720> they<00:01:22.020> might<00:01:22.200> make

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
still a possibility that they might make

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.440 
still a possibility that they might make
another<00:01:22.920> Halloween<00:01:23.369> texture<00:01:23.820> pack<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.210> more

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
probably they could introduce a new

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940 
probably they could introduce a new
Halloween<00:01:27.030> skin<00:01:27.570> pack<00:01:27.780> instead<00:01:28.290> last<00:01:28.710> year

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
game developers like 343 studios and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.399 
game developers like 343 studios and
Twisted<00:01:38.640> Pixel<00:01:38.869> studios<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.229> you've

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
Twisted Pixel studios like that you've

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.870 
Twisted Pixel studios like that you've
probably<00:01:40.619> already<00:01:40.860> heard<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.520> they<00:01:41.640> got<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
probably already heard of but they got a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.760 
probably already heard of but they got a
load<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.270> different<00:01:42.390> studios<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.320> make<00:01:43.500> their

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
load of different studios to make their

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.370 
load of different studios to make their
own<00:01:43.890> skin<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.610> minecraft<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:46.020> they<00:01:46.170> put

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
own skin on minecraft and then they put

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.289 
own skin on minecraft and then they put
these<00:01:46.560> skins<00:01:46.890> into<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> charity<00:01:47.670> skin<00:01:48.090> pack

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
these skins into the charity skin pack

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.230 
these skins into the charity skin pack
and<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.750> think<00:01:48.990> most<00:01:49.380> or<00:01:49.710> all<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.520> profits

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and I think most or all of the profits

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.880 
and I think most or all of the profits
made<00:01:51.479> from<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.930> went<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> certain<00:01:52.409> charity

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
made from that went to a certain charity

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.710 
made from that went to a certain charity
I<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.399> no<00:01:53.490> idea<00:01:53.759> what<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.030> was<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.540> could

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
I have no idea what it was but it could

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.450 
I have no idea what it was but it could
do<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.869> again<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.500> year<00:01:55.770> last<00:01:56.100> year<00:01:56.340> they

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
do that again this year last year they

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.910 
do that again this year last year they

made some truly epic skins including my
old<00:01:59.189> skin<00:01:59.549> which<00:01:59.759> they've<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.210> transferred

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
old skin which they've not transferred

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.810 
old skin which they've not transferred

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
over to the Xbox one or ps4 which I'm

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.120 
over to the Xbox one or ps4 which I'm
very<00:02:02.850> annoyed<00:02:03.600> at<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.439> know<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.890> year

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
very annoyed at but you know this year

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.740 
very annoyed at but you know this year
if<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:05.490> do<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.790> again<00:02:05.939> they<00:02:06.270> could<00:02:06.479> come<00:02:06.659> up

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
if they do that again they could come up

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
if they do that again they could come up

doing stuff like that so I'm sure that
they'll<00:02:47.709> do<00:02:47.890> tank<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.340> year<00:02:48.550> for<00:02:48.760> Halloween

they'll do tank this year for Halloween

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.120 
they'll do tank this year for Halloween
so<00:02:49.209> just<00:02:49.630> be<00:02:49.750> very<00:02:49.990> aware<00:02:50.080> I<00:02:50.590> hope<00:02:50.800> they<00:02:50.980> do

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
so just be very aware I hope they do

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.040 
so just be very aware I hope they do
make<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.520> new<00:02:51.730> skin<00:02:52.060> pact<00:02:52.300> that<00:02:52.330> would<00:02:52.600> be<00:02:52.690> great

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
make a new skin pact that would be great

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.449 
make a new skin pact that would be great
but<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.440> highly<00:02:53.890> doubt<00:02:54.010> they're<00:02:54.190> going<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.340> make

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
but I highly doubt they're going to make

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.100 
but I highly doubt they're going to make
a<00:02:54.489> new<00:02:54.700> texture<00:02:55.000> pack<00:02:55.180> but<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.600> always<00:02:55.930> a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
a new texture pack but it is always a

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.170 
a new texture pack but it is always a
possibility<00:02:56.650> if<00:02:57.130> not<00:02:57.489> they<00:02:57.730> will<00:02:57.910> probably

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
possibility if not they will probably

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.630 
possibility if not they will probably
re-release<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.200> old<00:02:59.680> Halloween<00:03:00.190> texture

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
re-release the old Halloween texture

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.830 
re-release the old Halloween texture
pack<00:03:00.820> we're<00:03:01.090> not<00:03:01.239> sure<00:03:01.450> what<00:03:01.630> they're<00:03:01.750> gonna

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
pack we're not sure what they're gonna

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.300 
pack we're not sure what they're gonna
do<00:03:02.050> but<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.470> know<00:03:02.590> let's<00:03:02.890> just<00:03:02.950> think<00:03:03.190> about

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
do but you know let's just think about
