00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.349 

so<00:00:05.350> what<00:00:05.650> we<00:00:05.800> have<00:00:05.980> here<00:00:06.160> as<00:00:06.370> a<00:00:06.819> project<00:00:07.180> is<00:00:07.330> a

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:07.359 
so what we have here as a project is a

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.959 
so what we have here as a project is a
automated<00:00:08.139> pothole<00:00:08.530> filling<00:00:08.740> what<00:00:09.010> what<00:00:09.730> is

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:09.969 
automated pothole filling what what is

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.660 
automated pothole filling what what is
it<00:00:10.570> is<00:00:10.690> expected<00:00:11.170> to<00:00:11.230> do<00:00:11.410> is<00:00:11.620> it<00:00:12.070> has<00:00:12.160> to<00:00:12.370> find

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
it is expected to do is it has to find

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.670 
it is expected to do is it has to find
port<00:00:13.480> holes<00:00:13.660> and<00:00:13.869> load<00:00:13.990> and<00:00:14.139> then<00:00:14.350> fill<00:00:14.530> them

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
port holes and load and then fill them

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.130 
port holes and load and then fill them
automatically<00:00:15.309> so<00:00:15.789> now<00:00:15.940> we<00:00:16.630> will<00:00:16.690> start<00:00:16.810> our

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
automatically so now we will start our

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.689 
automatically so now we will start our
demonstration<00:00:17.740> of<00:00:18.190> the<00:00:18.580> project<00:00:20.580> what<00:00:21.580> you

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
demonstration of the project what you

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.029 
demonstration of the project what you
can<00:00:21.849> see<00:00:22.089> here<00:00:22.960> is<00:00:23.080> happening<00:00:23.439> is<00:00:23.560> the<00:00:23.740> bot<00:00:23.890> has

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
can see here is happening is the bot has

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.009 
can see here is happening is the bot has
moved<00:00:24.279> forward<00:00:24.490> it<00:00:25.119> has<00:00:25.300> detected<00:00:25.449> that<00:00:25.839> there

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.019 
moved forward it has detected that there

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.099 
moved forward it has detected that there
is<00:00:26.109> a<00:00:26.169> hole<00:00:26.380> in<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.589> road<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:27.189> net<00:00:27.339> so<00:00:28.150> it<00:00:28.449> has

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
is a hole in the road the net so it has

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.989 
is a hole in the road the net so it has
started<00:00:29.380> the<00:00:29.769> Hopa<00:00:29.980> mechanism<00:00:30.490> and<00:00:30.730> it's

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:30.999 
started the Hopa mechanism and it's

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.550 
started the Hopa mechanism and it's
filling<00:00:31.329> the<00:00:31.720> slippery<00:00:32.079> beads<00:00:32.349> into<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.800> hole

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
filling the slippery beads into the hole

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.060 
filling the slippery beads into the hole
so<00:00:35.560> we<00:00:35.710> have<00:00:36.059> made<00:00:37.379> there<00:00:38.379> is<00:00:38.440> a<00:00:38.469> shuttle<00:00:38.739> on

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
so we have made there is a shuttle on

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.180 
so we have made there is a shuttle on
the<00:00:39.250> hopper<00:00:39.820> mechanism<00:00:40.329> which<00:00:40.770> which<00:00:41.770> is

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
the hopper mechanism which which is

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.610 
the hopper mechanism which which is
actually<00:00:42.600> made<00:00:43.600> to<00:00:43.780> control<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.320> number<00:00:44.530> of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
actually made to control the number of

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.740 
actually made to control the number of
beads<00:00:44.800> falling<00:00:45.190> at<00:00:45.399> one<00:00:46.000> particular<00:00:46.149> time<00:00:46.539> so

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
beads falling at one particular time so

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.869 
beads falling at one particular time so
that<00:00:46.899> too<00:00:47.260> many<00:00:47.379> beads<00:00:47.620> should<00:00:47.829> not<00:00:48.039> fall<00:00:48.250> and

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
that too many beads should not fall and

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.180 
that too many beads should not fall and
the<00:00:49.480> hole<00:00:49.660> should<00:00:49.840> be<00:00:49.989> filled<00:00:50.199> only<00:00:50.469> to<00:00:51.100> the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
the hole should be filled only to the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.020 
the hole should be filled only to the
appropriate<00:00:51.609> amount

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
appropriate amount

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.569 
appropriate amount
now<00:00:52.750> since<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.680> bot<00:00:53.859> has<00:00:53.980> already<00:00:54.309> failed<00:00:54.489> the

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
now since the bot has already failed the

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.099 
now since the bot has already failed the
hole<00:00:54.789> it<00:00:55.030> has<00:00:55.090> detected<00:00:55.629> that<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:57.519> hole<00:00:57.699> is

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
hole it has detected that the hole is

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.110 
hole it has detected that the hole is
now<00:00:59.109> no<00:00:59.620> more<00:00:59.769> existent<00:01:00.219> and<00:01:00.399> it<00:01:00.670> has<00:01:00.820> decided

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
now no more existent and it has decided

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.500 
now no more existent and it has decided
to<00:01:01.300> move<00:01:01.570> forward<00:01:01.899> again<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:05.350> since<00:01:06.040> it's

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
to move forward again now since it's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.090 
to move forward again now since it's
above<00:01:07.510> another<00:01:07.810> hole<00:01:07.990> it<00:01:08.110> is<00:01:08.170> detected<00:01:08.920> that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
above another hole it is detected that

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.140 
above another hole it is detected that
one<00:01:09.160> and<00:01:09.490> had<00:01:09.940> started<00:01:10.210> filling<00:01:10.540> it<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:13.030> you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
one and had started filling it as you

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.060 
one and had started filling it as you
can<00:01:13.270> see<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.840> balls<00:01:14.080> are<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.410> little<00:01:14.860> bit

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
can see the balls are a little bit

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.300 
can see the balls are a little bit
bouncy<00:01:15.250> on<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.420> thermocol<00:01:16.810> specially<00:01:17.310> now

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
bouncy on the thermocol specially now

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.700 
bouncy on the thermocol specially now
again<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:18.910> bot<00:01:19.090> has<00:01:19.300> detected<00:01:20.260> that<00:01:20.290> it<00:01:20.590> has

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
again the bot has detected that it has

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.800 
again the bot has detected that it has
already<00:01:21.190> filled<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:22.000> hole<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:22.360> has<00:01:22.570> moved

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
already filled the hole and has moved

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.060 
already filled the hole and has moved
forward<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.990> now<00:01:26.140> as<00:01:26.290> you<00:01:26.350> can<00:01:26.530> see<00:01:26.590> as<00:01:26.830> has

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
forward so now as you can see as has

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.010 
forward so now as you can see as has
been<00:01:27.220> marked<00:01:27.580> by<00:01:27.640> arrows<00:01:28.030> on<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.270> arena<00:01:28.540> it

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
been marked by arrows on the arena it

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.450 
been marked by arrows on the arena it
will<00:01:29.140> follow<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.470> path<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:32.860> as<00:01:33.010> you<00:01:33.160> can<00:01:33.310> see

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
will follow the path now as you can see

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.460 
will follow the path now as you can see
the<00:01:33.580> bot<00:01:33.790> has<00:01:34.030> moved<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.930> next<00:01:35.170> lane<00:01:35.350> of

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
the bot has moved to the next lane of

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.350 
the bot has moved to the next lane of
the<00:01:35.500> road<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.890> has<00:01:36.130> started<00:01:36.370> moving<00:01:36.880> forward

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
the road and has started moving forward

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.420 
the road and has started moving forward
on<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.720> lane<00:01:40.110> now<00:01:41.110> it<00:01:41.260> has<00:01:41.440> detected<00:01:41.980> another

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
on that lane now it has detected another

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:50.130 
on that lane now it has detected another
hole<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.640> has<00:01:42.910> started<00:01:43.240> filling<00:01:43.480> it<00:01:43.690> again

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.600 

so<00:01:51.140> again<00:01:51.439> it<00:01:51.619> has<00:01:51.799> been<00:01:51.829> able<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.460> fill

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
so again it has been able to fill

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.120 
so again it has been able to fill
another<00:01:52.880> hole<00:01:53.170> completely<00:01:54.170> actually<00:01:54.950> not

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
another hole completely actually not

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.200 
another hole completely actually not
completely<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:56.060> started<00:01:56.450> again<00:01:56.539> so<00:02:01.210> there's

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
completely it started again so there's

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.149 
completely it started again so there's
another<00:02:02.570> interesting<00:02:03.470> thing<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:04.009> would

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
another interesting thing that I would

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.499 
another interesting thing that I would
like<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.460> mention<00:02:05.350> we<00:02:06.350> have<00:02:06.850> assumed<00:02:07.850> so<00:02:08.330> this

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
like to mention we have assumed so this

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.540 
like to mention we have assumed so this
is<00:02:08.630> kind<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.349> a<00:02:09.619> reasonable<00:02:10.190> assumption<00:02:10.399> that

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
is kind of a reasonable assumption that

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.320 
is kind of a reasonable assumption that
generally<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.450> holes<00:02:11.959> are<00:02:12.230> in<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.970> middle<00:02:14.239> of

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
generally the holes are in the middle of

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.589 
generally the holes are in the middle of
a<00:02:14.420> road<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.720> since<00:02:15.709> we<00:02:16.670> have<00:02:16.819> just<00:02:17.030> one<00:02:17.239> sensor

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
a road and since we have just one sensor

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.860 
a road and since we have just one sensor
and<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:19.010> board<00:02:19.220> may<00:02:19.700> sometimes<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.690> image

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
and the board may sometimes the image

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.150 
and the board may sometimes the image
processing<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.290> not<00:02:21.410> very<00:02:21.590> accurate<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:22.040> the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
processing is not very accurate so the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.430 
processing is not very accurate so the
board<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:23.150> gets<00:02:23.420> deviated<00:02:23.959> from<00:02:23.989> its<00:02:24.260> path

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
board just gets deviated from its path

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.600 
board just gets deviated from its path
so<00:02:24.680> we<00:02:24.709> have<00:02:24.980> employed<00:02:26.890> proper<00:02:27.890> algorithm<00:02:28.160> to

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
so we have employed proper algorithm to

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.729 
so we have employed proper algorithm to
hit<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.299> board<00:02:29.480> correct<00:02:29.780> its<00:02:29.959> path<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:30.709> that

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
hit the board correct its path so that

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.890 
hit the board correct its path so that
it<00:02:31.010> moves<00:02:31.250> as<00:02:31.760> close<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.450> center<00:02:32.599> of<00:02:32.810> the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
it moves as close to the center of the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.789 
it moves as close to the center of the
road<00:02:32.989> as<00:02:33.170> possible<00:02:37.720> again<00:02:38.720> in<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.410> third<00:02:39.590> lane

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
road as possible again in the third lane

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.320 
road as possible again in the third lane
of<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:39.950> road<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.340> has<00:02:40.489> again<00:02:40.790> detected<00:02:41.239> the

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
of the road it has again detected the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.150 
of the road it has again detected the
hole<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:41.900> start<00:02:42.200> Infinite<00:02:42.590> has<00:02:42.739> started

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
hole and I start Infinite has started

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.009 
hole and I start Infinite has started
filling<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:43.910> again<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.330> has<00:02:44.480> been<00:02:44.510> able<00:02:44.810> to

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
filling it so again it has been able to

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.630 
filling it so again it has been able to
fill<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.349> hole<00:02:45.500> completely<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:46.220> has<00:02:46.370> moved

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
fill the hole completely and has moved

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.850 
fill the hole completely and has moved
forward<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:47.630> now<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:47.959> reaching<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.440> end<00:02:48.530> of

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
forward so now it is reaching the end of

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.079 
forward so now it is reaching the end of
the<00:02:49.370> arena<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.880> will<00:02:50.030> just<00:02:50.360> stop<00:02:50.870> there
