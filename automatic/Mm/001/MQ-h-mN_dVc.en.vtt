 because it is admissible she is just

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.540
 but such water is harmless 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.940
 but also useful substances and not even like 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.940
 sea â€‹â€‹and river dwellers 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.950
 ticket minerals and nakba 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.610

 if used distilled 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.610
 water for several years 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.190
 experts 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.620
 if not theoretically 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.230
 gastrointestinal tract one of them 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.730
 this percentage cherish the same so this or 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.730
 no however and if so what is he 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.110
 his unique research 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.270
 us physical network development 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.760

 worn pipes and give and walk to our 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.250
 taps help quality but here's the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.409
 natural useful water obtained 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.390
 from wells and mountain sources so

 the way i mine is only a few 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.080
 companies this requires much larger 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.000
 cost but the result is no living water 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.250
 additives here 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.549
 only we

 whether she filed and received wells 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.829
 cost the same so experts 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.530
 advise just read carefully
