00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.430
 very good morning in this section we are going to 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.990
 study the lip and this logically the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.200
 we will be dividing it into 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.930
 three areas a cutaneous area an area 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.150
 intermediate and a mucous area the area 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.650
 cutaneous if we approach 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.960
 to be able to observe that it contains the same 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.300
 characteristics of a thin skin a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.910
 flat certified epithelium that was tim 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.280
 hoisted we observe here the basal layer and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.500
 its last layer which is the stratum corneum 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.350
 It contains a lot of filaments 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.960
 of cells with large filaments of 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.210
 keratin inside and below we go 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.280
 to find a lot of tissue 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.440
 conjunctive delso irregular we observe 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.680
 Collagen fibers arranged 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.020
 irregularly 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.110
 also within this conjunctive turn 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.040
 dense irregular or not contrary several 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.750
 striated skeletal muscle aces 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.490
 another characteristic that we are going to 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.800
 find here is that we're going to observe 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.260
 Hair follicles and sebaceous glands 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.190
 for example here we observe a 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.880
 hair follicle we observe the hair and 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.340
 We see how it goes into space 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.500
 outside 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.320
 and we also look at the glands 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.450
 sebaceous here also that we observe 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.020
 the sebaceous glands adjacent to 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.659
 hair follicle the second area that 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.079
 we are going to describe observe in 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.819
 the lip is going to be the intermediate area in 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.799
 the intermediate will correspond to the 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:45.789
 red zone that we see in our 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.490
 lip is this color than color 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.340
 reddish is going to be given because here it's going to 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.289
 there are too many papillae which are 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.000
 to contain large quantities of glasses 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.700
 blood are going to be papillae 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.619
 vascular the epithelium of this area goes to 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.659
 be a flat certified epithelium not 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.000
 keratin hoisted this peter is not 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.890
 characteristic of the mucous membranes of the entire 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.090
 mucosa of the oral cavity and some 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.310
 parts of the pharynx also of the esophagus 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.010
 then we will continue with the third 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.709
 portion that is the inner portion of 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.360
 lip or mucus portion of the lip 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.950
 It is the same as the portion 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.440
 intermediate will contain 'peter or the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.990
 flat certificate not keratin hoisted 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.020
 which will be on a large 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.760
 amount of dense connective tissue 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.210
 irregular that is all this that 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.790
 we observe here how is a mucosa the 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.250
 mucous membranes have to have a lot 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.880
 of liquid on its surface so that we 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.890
 go to dehydrate then it's a 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.520
 there is a great need for there to be 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.520
 these glands these glands are going to 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.130
 pour your secretion towards the surface 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.420
 of the mucosa through these ducts 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.550
 those conduits that we see here 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.319
 that are conduits writers of these 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.470
 glands if we observe has a 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.630
 simple cylindrical epithelium in some 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.020
 zones is observed as for example here 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.970
 a double chain a double in doubles 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.349
 cores which could be a desk 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.349
 stratified cylindrical 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.620
 now if we see this is the cancellation of 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.430
 type well not a thing and here we see more 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.300
 conduits 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.850
 I'm here is a capillary 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.070
 we also observe that they have the 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.160
 morphological characteristic of a fate 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:39.420
 mucous a site to capture a real light 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.550
 a light-colored phylo acid acid cytoplasm 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.880
 due to the large amount of grains 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:49.150
 oxygen and its nuclei that are going to be the 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.519
 graduates rejected towards the periphery 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.189
 in the middle of the whole lip we are going to 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.530
 find this great muscle mass 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:59.319
 large skeletal striated 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.720
 comparison of the size of the cut this 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.450
 muscle will match the headset 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.879
 of the lips if we get closer we're going 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.829
 to be able to observe that here is being 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.650
 cut crosswise but we see the 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.540
 features of the striated muscle 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.950
 skeletal we see how its core is 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.859
 find in the periphery 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.540
 nuclei rejected to the periphery here 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.930
 we see a capillary 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.860
 etcetera also in this in the air then 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.680
 there are going to be many endings 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.270
 nervous so or you can identify 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.270
 many nervous basics
