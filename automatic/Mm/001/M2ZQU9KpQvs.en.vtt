00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
bad guy which is what I did not do there

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.000 
bad guy which is what I did not do there
was<00:00:33.660> moments<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> last<00:00:34.380> video<00:00:34.710> where<00:00:34.980> I

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
was moments in the last video where I

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.040 
was moments in the last video where I
showed<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.520> actual<00:00:35.850> ending<00:00:36.210> where<00:00:36.420> he<00:00:36.780> just

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
showed the actual ending where he just

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.500 
showed the actual ending where he just
he<00:00:38.010> tells<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.430> everything<00:00:38.460> you're<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.180> king

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
he tells you everything you're the king

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.000 
he tells you everything you're the king
and<00:00:39.809> all<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.320> then<00:00:40.410> flies<00:00:40.739> when<00:00:40.980> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and all that and then flies when a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.250 
and all that and then flies when a
helicopter<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.360> kill<00:00:42.629> him<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
helicopter if you kill him it just the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.229 
helicopter if you kill him it just the
credits<00:00:43.620> start<00:00:43.680> rolling<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.090> only

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
credits start rolling and the only

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.290 
credits start rolling and the only
difference<00:00:45.719> between<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.120> you<00:00:48.120> can

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
difference between that one and you can

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.840 
difference between that one and you can
actually<00:00:48.450> shoot<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.870> chopper<00:00:49.559> at<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.640> very

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
actually shoot the chopper at the very

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.580 
actually shoot the chopper at the very
end<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.300> all<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.660> happens<00:00:52.050> after<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.320> it's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
end but all that happens after that it's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.470 
end but all that happens after that it's
a<00:00:52.649> radio<00:00:52.920> conversation<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.030> already

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
a radio conversation that you already

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.389 
a radio conversation that you already
had<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.870> there's<00:00:55.050> one<00:00:55.260> ending<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.129> can

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
had so there's one ending that I can

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.880 
had so there's one ending that I can
actually<00:00:56.579> show<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.530> seen

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
so we'll see what happens this is

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.210 
so we'll see what happens this is
actually<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> ending<00:01:03.390> as<00:01:03.750> soon<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.890> start

about 13 minutes but to save you guys on
time<00:01:35.150> I'll<00:01:36.150> probably<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.689> go<00:01:36.840> ahead<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
time I'll probably just go ahead and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.660 
time I'll probably just go ahead and
transition<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.920> was<00:01:38.040> actually<00:01:38.159> gonna<00:01:38.369> say

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
transition what I was actually gonna say

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.429 
transition what I was actually gonna say
was<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> probably<00:01:39.180> didn't<00:01:39.509> show<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.990> intro

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
was I probably didn't show the intro

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.469 
was I probably didn't show the intro
again<00:01:40.470> cuz<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.130> kind<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> pointless<00:01:41.579> just

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
again cuz it's kind of pointless just

for watching it's probably gonna be a
kind<00:05:05.139> of<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:05.259> short<00:05:05.560> video<00:05:05.740> but<00:05:06.280> I<00:05:06.310> had<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.550> lot<00:05:06.699> of

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
kind of a short video but I had a lot of

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.029 
kind of a short video but I had a lot of
people<00:05:07.000> request<00:05:07.419> to<00:05:07.569> see<00:05:07.810> it<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.830> I<00:05:08.919> was

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
people request to see it and I was

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.260 
people request to see it and I was
actually<00:05:09.129> kind<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.460> curious<00:05:09.759> how<00:05:09.819> I<00:05:09.969> was<00:05:10.150> gonna

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
actually kind of curious how I was gonna

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.879 
actually kind of curious how I was gonna
go<00:05:10.509> as<00:05:10.659> well<00:05:10.840> I<00:05:11.020> don't<00:05:11.409> know<00:05:11.530> if<00:05:11.650> I<00:05:11.740> could

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
go as well I don't know if I could

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.290 
go as well I don't know if I could
really<00:05:12.039> show<00:05:12.280> you<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.490> other<00:05:12.669> two<00:05:12.759> endings

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
really show you the other two endings

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.520 
really show you the other two endings
because<00:05:13.389> there's<00:05:13.659> no<00:05:13.780> way<00:05:13.900> to<00:05:13.960> for<00:05:14.139> me<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.259> go

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
because there's no way to for me to go

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.020 
because there's no way to for me to go
back<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:14.740> replay<00:05:15.129> some<00:05:15.580> of<00:05:15.699> the<00:05:15.759> older

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
back and replay some of the older

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.050 
back and replay some of the older
missions<00:05:16.590> but<00:05:17.590> those<00:05:18.069> aren't<00:05:18.490> really<00:05:18.849> much

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
missions but those aren't really much

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.490 
missions but those aren't really much
different<00:05:19.599> so<00:05:19.810> I<00:05:19.840> thought<00:05:20.050> I'd<00:05:20.139> leads<00:05:20.319> to<00:05:20.409> an

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
different so I thought I'd leads to an

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.010 
different so I thought I'd leads to an
alternate<00:05:20.949> ending<00:05:21.069> and<00:05:21.659> just<00:05:22.659> tell<00:05:22.780> you<00:05:22.870> guys

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
alternate ending and just tell you guys

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.390 
alternate ending and just tell you guys
