00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.770
 hey welcome to my channel i am mpr and in 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.830
 this time I will show you how 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.250
 use them shoulder with gta 5 inside 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.250
 Headboard 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.550
 ah 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.529
 a lot of people give trouble to me 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.450
 gave problems until I found the 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.000
 solution for that we need to create 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.000
 all profiles we start with the first 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 and the folder where you have these 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.809
 games I have on this route 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.180
 we created play 7 to 5 but only 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.129
 we do this we do not touch anything and we create 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.140
 a second profile that is 5 because 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.580
 Well look very easy if we have to 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.580
 load the game with gta 5 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.989
 playing the soles the hill so for 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.940
 fix it 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.520
 we need to load the game with vegetable 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.520
 5 to solve it we create another profile 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.320
 with gta 5 but what happens if 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.320
 we load the complete game 7 to 5 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.310
 it seems that game is loading 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.640
 very good for now palante palante 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.640
 palante 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.909
 good in aggregation 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.860
 and are the black screens stones 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.140
 indefinitely forcing us to press 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.820
 control delete open administrator 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.820
 of tasks and close the program 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.540
 closing here so so not 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.810
 play the game 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.550
 we create let's go to options 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.720
 and given compatibility list 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:01.160
 a new a new file what will be 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:07.280
 gta 5 that the game April and we say that 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:11.450
 ignore this fact this and this ok and you 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.340
 We give to keep good then now as 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.980
 will load but 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.890
 we want to put a couple of filters 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:25.959
 gta 5 libertÃ©s only the fx 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:31.080
 it does not mean either that it abuses advanced 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.080
 twix here to put the the ub 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.120
 always activated correct and triple 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.120
 buffer with a rate of 60 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.879
 and in suite fx to activate and must import 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.940
 a downloaded profile 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.069
 h 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.810
 but without clicks 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.030
 I go to everything 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.400
 to be a little bit more have the best 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.000
 yes 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.560
 nothing but the profile so although what 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.900
 let's make all the changes in the file 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:13.900
 gta 5 to start then I have to 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.700
 start it with this with the gta v voucher and 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.590
 the configurations to put it to 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.049
 our taste the game should be done 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.239
 in this file ok 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.090
 here you have seen that here it took everything 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.599
 all the configuration in gta 5 and we'll see 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.599
 to see what happens 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.880
 likewise the 32nd charge 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.380
 alright we go well 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.280
 i 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.800
 two 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:59.730
 and now it is possible that the error does not jump 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.330
 from before like there is a failure that is 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.280
 because the game is closed improperly 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.310
 If you leave then they give you to retry and 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.069
 point you leave ya twinned that does not come out 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.620
 then nothing to play the game 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.209
 this hits me a lot jumped that 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.209
 demographic need 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.870
 to try 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.180
 let's see now 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.229
 It looks like he 's grabbing the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.229
 always jumping 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.100
 and good here is the session and ready 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.210
 good is loaded 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.129
 let's go out the menu and go 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.330
 directly to what the game is what 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:54.569
 wants to teach the difference of southern 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.960
 activated peking turned off so that 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.960
 dance better 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.720
 well here you can see the configuration 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.090
 of graphics that the filter of efe that already 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.240
 I have it deactivated because I have a 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.860
 emulation by radio a pro that does 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.400
 by software that consumes less resources 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.760
 that the game and well we already know that 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.450
 consume a resource or something more fluid etc 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.450
 etc etc 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.999
 here is the good 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:37.510
 and more let's go there 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:40.240
 bale to the simulation is not so good 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:45.690
 like the game itself but how can you see 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.690
 the many saw teeth as well as 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:57.960
 and well, it goes through here and we're going to see a 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:06:01.550
 little the sweater that here the filter 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.550
 to see here 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.169
 activated 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.169
 one disabled 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.820
 it shows you note but good the first 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.280
 filter that I have seen you can not do 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.919
 you from one euro filter to your whole or 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.169
 well look for better filters say 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.990
 this is the first filter seen only 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.759
 to see if it worked and teach a little 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.830
 how to load it 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:31.100
 I hope the video but useful how much 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.870
 less be entertaining and I leave you here in 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.840
 the link from my previous the video a 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.740
 analysis on and without Christ that the 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.470
 china a new trilogy of games 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:45.740
 arcade you can create a form of a soft 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:49.039
 so if you like video feel on line 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.000
