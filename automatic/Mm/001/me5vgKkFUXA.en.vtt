you don't want people to the dice

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.389 
you don't want people to the dice
because<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.120> slows<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> game<00:00:54.629> down<00:00:55.399> doesn't

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
because it slows the game down doesn't

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.950 
because it slows the game down doesn't
mean<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.550> need<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> jump<00:00:57.000> over<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.629> top<00:00:57.899> of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
mean you need to jump over on top of

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.680 
mean you need to jump over on top of
everybody<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.469> does<00:00:58.620> set<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> dice<00:00:59.690> always

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
everybody it does set the dice always

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
everybody it does set the dice always
make<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> customers<00:01:01.320> hit<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> back<00:01:01.710> wall<00:01:01.739> so

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
make the customers hit the back wall so

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
make the customers hit the back wall so
I'm<00:01:02.489> guessing<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.940> rough<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.449> me<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.840> that

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
I'm guessing it rough with me on that

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.109 
I'm guessing it rough with me on that
one<00:01:04.220> this<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:05.399> you've<00:01:05.550> missed<00:01:05.759> the<00:01:05.880> wall

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
one this because you've missed the wall

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.370 
one this because you've missed the wall
every<00:01:06.390> once<00:01:06.660> what<00:01:06.869> doesn't<00:01:07.050> mean<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.229> can

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
every once what doesn't mean you can

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.050 
every once what doesn't mean you can
jump<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:07.890> over<00:01:07.920> or<00:01:08.460> should<00:01:08.490> jump<00:01:08.820> all<00:01:09.030> over

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
jump all over or should jump all over

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.290 
jump all over or should jump all over
and<00:01:09.860> discourage<00:01:10.860> rhythm<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:11.759> rollers

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.840 
and discourage rhythm really rollers
from<00:01:12.420> shooting<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> dice<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.700> most<00:01:14.700> people

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
from shooting the dice and most people

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.279 
from shooting the dice and most people

know<00:01:56.399> let's<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> giant<00:01:57.450> claw<00:01:57.630> machine

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
know let's like the giant claw machine

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.900 
know let's like the giant claw machine
here<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.979> actually<00:01:59.160> are<00:01:59.369> some<00:01:59.489> pictures<00:01:59.670> in

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
here they actually are some pictures in

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.150 
here they actually are some pictures in
is<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.599> dice<00:02:00.899> must<00:02:01.229> stay<00:02:01.410> together<00:02:01.470> in<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
is the dice must stay together in the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.309 
is the dice must stay together in the
air<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.399> land<00:02:02.580> together<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.209> the<00:02:03.840> reason<00:02:03.989> why

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
air and land together and the reason why

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.290 
air and land together and the reason why
they<00:02:04.470> have<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.649> do<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.039> is<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:05.910> they

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
they have to do this is because they

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.969 
they have to do this is because they
wanted<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.899> stay<00:02:07.110> together<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.679> specific

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
wanted to stay together on a specific

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.040 
wanted to stay together on a specific
access<00:02:08.729> their<00:02:09.450> supposed<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> hit<00:02:09.899> right

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
access their supposed to hit right

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.510 
access their supposed to hit right

to be able to come into play if it's
done<00:02:27.810> correctly<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:30.150> method<00:02:30.450> is

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
done correctly and the method is

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.110 
done correctly and the method is
designed<00:02:30.959> eliminate<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.769> a6<00:02:32.340> combination

designed eliminate the a6 combination

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.410 
designed eliminate the a6 combination
that<00:02:33.719> is<00:02:33.780> an<00:02:34.049> eliminator

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
that is an eliminator

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.250 
that is an eliminator
they're<00:02:36.420> trying<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:36.689> restrict<00:02:37.049> it<00:02:39.049> now<00:02:40.049> here's

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
they're trying to restrict it now here's

they're trying to restrict it now here's
here's<00:02:40.650> how<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.859> dicer<00:02:41.310> set<00:02:41.579> now<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:41.909> is

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
here's how the dicer set now this is

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.879 
here's how the dicer set now this is
this<00:02:42.209> one<00:02:42.810> way<00:02:42.959> if<00:02:43.049> you<00:02:43.139> pick<00:02:43.319> up<00:02:43.439> any<00:02:43.560> books<00:02:43.769> in

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
this one way if you pick up any books in

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.860 
this one way if you pick up any books in
rhythm<00:02:44.189> rollin<00:02:44.489> you'll<00:02:45.060> see<00:02:45.299> this<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.689> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
rhythm rollin you'll see this is the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.979 
rhythm rollin you'll see this is the
main<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.349> main<00:02:46.379> idea<00:02:46.739> is<00:02:47.129> to<00:02:47.819> is<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.150> try<00:02:48.959> to

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
main the main idea is to is to try to

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.879 
main the main idea is to is to try to
keep<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.739> a6<00:02:50.219> from<00:02:50.370> coming<00:02:50.609> apply<00:02:51.889> the

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
keep the a6 from coming apply the

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.800 
keep the a6 from coming apply the
standard<00:02:53.250> combination<00:02:53.760> has<00:02:53.909> a<00:02:53.969> six<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.719> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
standard combination has a six on the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.330 
standard combination has a six on the
outward<00:02:55.230> sides<00:02:55.590> if<00:02:55.859> you<00:02:55.980> notice<00:02:56.189> in<00:02:56.280> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
outward sides if you notice in the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.979 
outward sides if you notice in the
picture<00:02:56.639> you'll<00:02:57.150> see<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:57.510> six<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.870> know

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
picture you'll see the six you know

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.099 
picture you'll see the six you know
there's<00:02:58.170> an<00:02:58.260> ace<00:02:58.379> on<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.590> other<00:02:58.739> side<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.900> also

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
there's an ace on the other side it also

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.679 
there's an ace on the other side it also
has<00:03:01.469> what<00:03:01.650> they<00:03:01.680> call<00:03:01.769> hard<00:03:02.730> way<00:03:02.909> combinations

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
has what they call hard way combinations

through this quick again we know that

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:13.939 
through this quick again we know that
they're<00:04:13.139> trying<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.409> limit<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.799> number

rolls to one every six point five rolls

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.629 
rolls to one every six point five rolls
so<00:04:22.409> we<00:04:22.530> are<00:04:22.680> talking<00:04:22.949> about<00:04:23.039> a<00:04:23.190> lot<00:04:23.370> there

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
so we are talking about a lot there

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.089 
so we are talking about a lot there
however<00:04:24.270> it's<00:04:24.870> very<00:04:25.169> very<00:04:25.380> difficult<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.889> do

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
however it's very very difficult to do

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.969 
however it's very very difficult to do

they can overcome that now let's go back

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.160 
they can overcome that now let's go back

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
to the myths and the math let's look at

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.370 
to the myths and the math let's look at
the<00:04:57.260> truth<00:04:58.510> my<00:04:59.510> feeling<00:04:59.900> is<00:04:59.960> you<00:05:00.080> embrace

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
the truth my feeling is you embrace

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.960 
the truth my feeling is you embrace
customers<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:00.950> think<00:05:01.100> they<00:05:01.190> can<00:05:01.220> corolla<00:05:01.670> dice

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
customers to think they can corolla dice

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.240 
customers to think they can corolla dice
and<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:03.050> reason<00:05:03.440> why<00:05:03.590> is<00:05:03.620> there<00:05:04.010> might<00:05:04.220> be

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
and the reason why is there might be

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.640 
and the reason why is there might be
might<00:05:04.850> be<00:05:04.900> three<00:05:05.900> or<00:05:05.960> four<00:05:06.170> people<00:05:06.350> in<00:05:06.590> the

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
might be three or four people in the

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.750 
might be three or four people in the
whole<00:05:06.800> country<00:05:07.390> that<00:05:08.390> can<00:05:08.600> control<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:09.080> dots

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
whole country that can control the dots

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.880 
whole country that can control the dots
might<00:05:10.760> be<00:05:12.700> right<00:05:13.700> so<00:05:14.360> most<00:05:14.570> people<00:05:14.800> it's<00:05:15.800> just

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
might be right so most people it's just

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.290 
might be right so most people it's just
like<00:05:16.130> anything<00:05:16.280> else<00:05:16.610> like<00:05:16.880> I<00:05:16.970> didn't<00:05:17.240> I

like anything else like I didn't I

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.850 
like anything else like I didn't I
