let's<00:00:01.620> review<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:02.100> little<00:00:02.429> guy<00:00:03.319> the<00:00:04.319> USB

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
let's review this little guy the USB

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:29.010 
let's review this little guy the USB
pass-through<00:00:06.799> from<00:00:07.799> fasttech

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.920 

about<00:00:30.020> eight<00:00:30.230> bucks<00:00:30.849> the<00:00:31.849> cord<00:00:32.390> is<00:00:32.599> ninety

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
about eight bucks the cord is ninety

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.160 
about eight bucks the cord is ninety
four<00:00:33.230> point<00:00:34.130> five<00:00:34.340> centimeters<00:00:35.120> long<00:00:35.390> which

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
four point five centimeters long which

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.100 
four point five centimeters long which
equals<00:00:36.920> up<00:00:37.190> to<00:00:37.520> three<00:00:38.390> point<00:00:38.720> one<00:00:38.989> feet<00:00:39.579> okay

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
equals up to three point one feet okay

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.740 
equals up to three point one feet okay
this<00:00:42.110> is<00:00:42.350> variable<00:00:43.130> voltage<00:00:43.370> although<00:00:44.149> you

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
this is variable voltage although you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.799 
this is variable voltage although you
can't<00:00:45.050> go<00:00:45.320> up<00:00:45.500> in<00:00:45.760> point<00:00:46.760> one<00:00:46.940> increments<00:00:47.690> like

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
can't go up in point one increments like

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.380 
can't go up in point one increments like
everything<00:00:48.320> else<00:00:48.500> we're<00:00:48.710> used<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:49.059> okay<00:00:50.059> with

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
everything else we're used to okay with

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.849 
everything else we're used to okay with
what<00:00:50.570> you<00:00:50.690> have<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:51.050> do<00:00:51.199> to<00:00:51.350> adjust<00:00:51.440> the

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
what you have to do to adjust the

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:59.979 
what you have to do to adjust the
voltage<00:00:52.100> click<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.149> button<00:00:58.329> four<00:00:59.329> times<00:00:59.359> and

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
voltage click the button four times and

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.669 
voltage click the button four times and
then<00:01:00.079> it<00:01:00.230> changes<00:01:00.590> colors<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:03.170> will<00:01:03.350> let<00:01:03.500> you

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
then it changes colors that will let you

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.240 
then it changes colors that will let you
know<00:01:03.710> that<00:01:03.859> it's<00:01:04.430> changed<00:01:05.050> and<00:01:06.050> then<00:01:06.890> it<00:01:07.010> fires

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
know that it's changed and then it fires

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.640 
know that it's changed and then it fires
in<00:01:07.580> that<00:01:07.700> color<00:01:07.970> every<00:01:08.270> time<00:01:08.480> and<00:01:09.260> once<00:01:09.470> it

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
in that color every time and once it

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.730 
in that color every time and once it
does<00:01:09.800> the<00:01:10.010> multicolor<00:01:10.700> flash<00:01:11.230> that<00:01:12.230> basically

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
does the multicolor flash that basically

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.500 
does the multicolor flash that basically
means<00:01:12.950> that<00:01:13.070> it's<00:01:13.310> off<00:01:13.460> ok<00:01:13.940> you<00:01:14.000> push<00:01:14.390> the

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
means that it's off ok you push the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.700 
means that it's off ok you push the
button<00:01:14.810> nothing<00:01:14.990> happens

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
button nothing happens

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.539 
button nothing happens
okay<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:16.750> push<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:17.900> four<00:01:18.140> times<00:01:18.350> it'll<00:01:18.829> start

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
okay so push it four times it'll start

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.420 
okay so push it four times it'll start
back<00:01:19.850> it'll<00:01:20.360> round-robin<00:01:20.780> it<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:21.439> go<00:01:22.220> back<00:01:22.369> to

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
back it'll round-robin it so go back to

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.569 
back it'll round-robin it so go back to
the<00:01:22.610> lowest<00:01:23.119> setting<00:01:23.360> okay<00:01:24.350> one<00:01:25.130> thing<00:01:25.159> that<00:01:25.549> I

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
the lowest setting okay one thing that I

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.200 
the lowest setting okay one thing that I
noticed<00:01:26.119> on<00:01:26.329> this<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:26.899> that<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:28.610> colors<00:01:29.000> in

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
noticed on this is that the colors in

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.450 
noticed on this is that the colors in
the<00:01:29.299> description<00:01:29.960> they<00:01:30.079> have<00:01:30.259> is<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.920> fast<00:01:31.189> tech

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
the description they have is a fast tech

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.350 
the description they have is a fast tech
website<00:01:31.790> are<00:01:32.829> backwards<00:01:33.829> but<00:01:34.490> only<00:01:34.790> two<00:01:35.180> of

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
website are backwards but only two of

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.020 
website are backwards but only two of
them<00:01:35.509> are<00:01:35.570> backward<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:36.409> say<00:01:36.619> yeah<00:01:37.610> they<00:01:37.820> say

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
them are backward to say yeah they say

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.660 
them are backward to say yeah they say
purple<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.840> three<00:01:39.259> volts<00:01:39.740> but<00:01:40.040> it's<00:01:40.219> actually

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
purple is three volts but it's actually

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.130 
purple is three volts but it's actually
blue<00:01:40.969> that's<00:01:41.240> three<00:01:41.540> volts

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
blue that's three volts

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.770 
blue that's three volts
okay<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:43.399> then<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:45.759> what<00:01:46.759> they<00:01:46.939> say<00:01:47.180> is<00:01:47.329> blue

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
okay and then the what they say is blue

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.410 
okay and then the what they say is blue
at<00:01:48.140> three<00:01:48.409> point<00:01:48.680> 6<00:01:49.040> volts<00:01:49.130> is<00:01:49.729> actually

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
at three point 6 volts is actually

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.649 
at three point 6 volts is actually
really<00:01:50.689> purple<00:01:51.409> okay<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:52.850> blue<00:01:53.119> is<00:01:53.329> three

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
really purple okay so blue is three

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:02.289 
really purple okay so blue is three
volts<00:01:54.140> purple<00:01:54.979> is<00:01:56.950> 3<00:01:57.950> point<00:01:58.219> 6<00:01:58.520> volts<00:01:59.170> red<00:02:00.170> is<00:02:01.299> 4

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
volts purple is 3 point 6 volts red is 4

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.109 
volts purple is 3 point 6 volts red is 4
point<00:02:02.600> 2<00:02:02.689> volts<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.560> green<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:04.369> 4<00:02:04.670> point<00:02:04.969> 8

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
point 2 volts and green is 4 point 8

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.840 
point 2 volts and green is 4 point 8
volts<00:02:05.920> okay<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.430> actual<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:09.050> actual

this and then you plug it into the USB
of<00:03:26.960> the<00:03:27.320> computer<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.459> that<00:03:28.489> your<00:03:28.790> USB<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.540> have

of the computer so that your USB is have

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.770 
of the computer so that your USB is have
power<00:03:30.350> okay<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.550> do<00:03:31.730> run<00:03:32.060> a<00:03:32.120> wired<00:03:32.450> keyboard

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
power okay I do run a wired keyboard

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.320 
power okay I do run a wired keyboard
just<00:03:33.650> because<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.250> batteries<00:03:34.670> are<00:03:34.910> a<00:03:34.940> pain<00:03:35.239> in

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
just because the batteries are a pain in

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.600 
just because the batteries are a pain in
the<00:03:35.420> butt<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.900> it's<00:03:36.320> a<00:03:36.410> desktop<00:03:36.800> so<00:03:37.280> there's

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
the butt and it's a desktop so there's

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.750 
the butt and it's a desktop so there's
no<00:03:37.790> need<00:03:38.000> for<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.360> wireless<00:03:39.190> okay<00:03:40.220> but<00:03:40.610> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
no need for a wireless okay but the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.380 
no need for a wireless okay but the
mouse<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.000> Wireless<00:03:43.660> all<00:03:44.660> right<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:46.120> let's<00:03:47.120> get

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
mouse is Wireless all right so let's get

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.180 
mouse is Wireless all right so let's get
on<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.110> performance<00:03:48.770> there's<00:03:48.980> not<00:03:49.160> a

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
on to the performance there's not a

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.920 
on to the performance there's not a
whole<00:03:49.459> lot<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:49.820> could<00:03:50.090> say<00:03:50.360> about<00:03:50.390> this

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
whole lot you could say about this

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.979 
whole lot you could say about this
except<00:03:51.410> for<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.620> fact<00:03:51.709> that<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.640> is<00:03:52.790> handy<00:03:53.510> it

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
except for the fact that it is handy it

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.850 
except for the fact that it is handy it
does<00:03:54.320> work<00:03:54.650> well<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.640> I<00:03:56.450> like<00:03:57.080> it<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.440> don't<00:03:57.500> use

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
does work well and I like it I don't use

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.250 
does work well and I like it I don't use
it<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:58.100> whole<00:03:58.340> lot<00:03:58.370> but<00:03:59.209> it<00:03:59.300> is<00:03:59.450> nice<00:03:59.780> and<00:03:59.810> the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
it a whole lot but it is nice and the

say you haven't that requires you to do
a<00:04:26.150> lot<00:04:26.300> of<00:04:26.450> driving<00:04:26.690> it'd<00:04:26.900> be<00:04:27.050> great<00:04:27.230> for<00:04:27.500> that

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.910 

that's<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.180> lowest<00:04:33.360> setting<00:04:33.930> there<00:04:34.170> three

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
that's the lowest setting there three

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:48.710 
that's the lowest setting there three
point<00:04:35.220> six<00:04:35.520> volts<00:04:45.920> and<00:04:46.920> that<00:04:47.490> honestly<00:04:48.000> for

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
point six volts and that honestly for

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.630 
point six volts and that honestly for
three<00:04:48.960> point<00:04:49.230> six<00:04:49.500> volts<00:04:49.950> is<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.100> little<00:04:50.460> high

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
three point six volts is a little high

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.610 
three point six volts is a little high
it's<00:04:50.910> actually<00:04:51.360> giving<00:04:51.660> me<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:51.840> burn<00:04:54.440> so<00:04:55.440> let's

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
it's actually giving me a burn so let's

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.010 
it's actually giving me a burn so let's
break<00:04:55.920> out<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.400> meter<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.360> see<00:04:57.570> if<00:04:57.690> that<00:04:57.870> will

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
break out the meter and see if that will

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:17.190 
break out the meter and see if that will
work<00:04:58.220> and<00:04:59.220> this<00:04:59.490> is<00:04:59.550> what<00:04:59.880> it's<00:05:00.030> doing

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.800 

are<00:05:17.800> they<00:05:17.950> doing<00:05:18.310> that<00:05:18.340> but<00:05:18.910> it<00:05:19.270> feels<00:05:19.540> like

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
are they doing that but it feels like

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
are they doing that but it feels like
it's<00:05:19.990> too<00:05:20.200> hot

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
it's too hot

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.790 
it's too hot
and<00:05:21.250> therefore<00:05:21.670> it<00:05:21.790> probably<00:05:22.330> is<00:05:22.540> so<00:05:23.470> I

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
and therefore it probably is so I

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.330 
and therefore it probably is so I
believe<00:05:24.130> it's<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.430> little<00:05:24.640> too<00:05:24.880> overpowered

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
believe it's a little too overpowered

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.280 
believe it's a little too overpowered

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
the power regulation isn't all that

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.410 
the power regulation isn't all that
great<00:05:29.680> in<00:05:29.980> here<00:05:30.190> okay<00:05:30.460> there's<00:05:30.970> really<00:05:31.180> not

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
great in here okay there's really not

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.770

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
what it is at least you do have options

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.260 
what it is at least you do have options

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
that's going to do it for the best tech

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.470 
that's going to do it for the best tech
