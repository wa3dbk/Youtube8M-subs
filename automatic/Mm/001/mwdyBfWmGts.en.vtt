00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.089
 we will try how unique is this Serra 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.960
 The result increases when you next to a man and then what me 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.949
 Everything has happened here is natural 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.149
 since the departure 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.919
 van der Vaart 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.140
 yes, too 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.230
 and then percent because the sociological all the more difficult and then I was allowed 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.210
 normal drive was not so my first reaction was so run or 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.430
 driving at home 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.470
 and percent then have relied on me 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.929
 the chance in was not so we've got the on 4 today there was year 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.989
 For example, 20 percent of those who are one with him for one long are one percent of that 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:49.900
 percent 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.220
 there is no normal game stand in the expected to get ahead 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.240
 the same place was given to the percent being so tough percent that partially 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.069
 also the same happened from that it already tells that she wet 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:03.460
 just happened in a similar form 15 years ago is soon in the list on 

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.520
 the Nordschleife that we have passed the Afghan history of so many things 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.520
 are not directly percent of course then but 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.510
 Per cent that's because I can not guess right now 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.409
 this whole Valdez Motorsport breathed 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.060
 Perseverance, not even Horst Fehlhaber 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.780
 Route was due to set itself 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.090
 a small part of a very small but small part of his 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.800
 yes an incredible days so I think that's very personal 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.710
 my 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.979
 So my opinion of racing sport as Lightman is quite different 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.380
 Respect l late brakes percent accelerate early 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.859
 she is not in the case 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.050
 so it should be the main thing that sportsman choice that this 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.510
 Percent of the spell theme is slow in return for it quickly 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.240
 the curve 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.439
 ours "I can always stop this as late as possible and with this 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.810
 Tactics percent you get her nothing so so with the host TVI 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.979
 difficult for me after the departure this afternoon for course 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.110
 proper respect rafting challenge very clear and percent 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.690
 yes I'm looking for then percent 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.159
 but what percent what had to bring so test bring and 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.119
 for the first laps in training I'm also glad of old 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.520
 really danger as a loser 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.150
 so a little bit percent 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.109
 yes that up 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:10.949
 Torgefahr itself but not but it is already percent 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.689
 It's going to start so much again and Sierre will do it so well 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.359
 worked so torn Lesachtal I can not say anything yet that 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:18.999
 will finally come in the next few days 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.319
 the coaching today of Mahler his his boys that was foreseeable year 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.979
 was 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.249
 yes, the guys that have been active for decades, you know 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:30.299
 exactly what they are talking about, they have a wealth of experience from which they feed 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.529
 can and yes the tips the people know as well as the people 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:38.559
 have to tackle who need something here and there so it's great he recommended it 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:39.109
 is 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.139
 So that's the difficulty on so many levels that it certainly can 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.049
 nobody will delete from outside 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.119
 Nissan is similar happened so far I have to be honest 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.259
 I do not know anything 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:49.739
 I do not even have one percent
