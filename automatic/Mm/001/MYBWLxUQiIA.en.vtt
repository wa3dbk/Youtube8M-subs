going<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.360> be<00:00:03.449> showcasing<00:00:03.659> polymer<00:00:04.560> net

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
going to be showcasing polymer net

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.530 
going to be showcasing polymer net
shield<00:00:05.040> from<00:00:05.279> Sonax<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.120> their<00:00:06.270> paint

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
shield from Sonax this is their paint

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.049 
shield from Sonax this is their paint
sealant<00:00:07.160> so<00:00:08.160> I'm<00:00:08.400> going<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.610> give<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:08.880> guys<00:00:09.030> a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
basic overview of the product and also

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.640 
basic overview of the product and also
put<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.219> through<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.490> water<00:00:11.700> test

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
put it through the water test

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.200 
put it through the water test
so<00:00:13.650> polymer<00:00:14.099> net<00:00:14.340> shield<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.000> sonex's

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
so polymer net shield is one of sonex's

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.439 
so polymer net shield is one of sonex's
most<00:00:15.719> durable<00:00:16.199> paint<00:00:16.560> sealants<00:00:17.150> you<00:00:18.150> can<00:00:18.300> see

most durable paint sealants you can see

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.000 
most durable paint sealants you can see
on<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.690> front<00:00:18.840> here<00:00:19.109> they<00:00:19.320> advertise<00:00:19.770> about

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
on the front here they advertise about

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.189 
on the front here they advertise about
six<00:00:20.430> months<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.820> durability<00:00:21.390> from<00:00:21.990> their

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
six months of durability from their

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
hybrid polymer technology and the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.560 
hybrid polymer technology and the
canister<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.710> also<00:00:26.070> an<00:00:26.189> aerosol<00:00:26.670> form<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.510> you

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
canister is also an aerosol form so you

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.509 
canister is also an aerosol form so you
get<00:00:28.019> two<00:00:28.199> hundred<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.619> ten<00:00:28.769> milliliters<00:00:29.340> of

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
an aerosol product in here and that much

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.549 
an aerosol product in here and that much
products<00:00:33.120> should<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.540> between<00:00:34.170> about

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
products should get you between about

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.709 
products should get you between about
six<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.100> seven<00:00:35.399> applications<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> mid-size

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
six and seven applications on a mid-size

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.260 
six and seven applications on a mid-size
car<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> that's<00:00:38.340> definitely<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.030> lot<00:00:39.120> of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
car so that's definitely not a lot of

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.610 
car so that's definitely not a lot of
product<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:39.930> for<00:00:39.989> something<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.530> you're

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
going to only have to use once every six

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.940 
going to only have to use once every six
months<00:00:42.570> you're<00:00:43.200> still<00:00:43.440> getting<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.710> lot<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
months you're still getting a lot of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.090 
months you're still getting a lot of
performance<00:00:44.520> out<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> one<00:00:45.030> application<00:00:46.100> now

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
where this product really excels is the

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.460 
where this product really excels is the
surface<00:04:49.820> tension<00:04:50.120> durability<00:04:50.840> is<00:04:50.990> incredibly

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
surface tension durability is incredibly

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.260 
surface tension durability is incredibly
strong<00:04:51.740> so<00:04:52.610> you're<00:04:52.729> going<00:04:52.850> to<00:04:52.880> be<00:04:53.000> able<00:04:53.120> to

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
strong so you're going to be able to

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.150 
strong so you're going to be able to
wash<00:04:53.479> it<00:04:53.690> week<00:04:53.900> after<00:04:54.080> week<00:04:54.290> after<00:04:54.650> week<00:04:54.800> and

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
wash it week after week after week and

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.920 
wash it week after week after week and
it's<00:04:55.250> going<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.430> be<00:04:55.669> beating<00:04:56.449> water<00:04:56.600> like

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
it's going to be beating water like

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.140 
it's going to be beating water like
crazy<00:04:57.199> like<00:04:57.470> this<00:04:57.680> for<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.460> long<00:04:58.699> period<00:04:59.060> of

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
crazy like this for a long period of

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.110 
crazy like this for a long period of
time<00:04:59.210> and<00:05:00.169> I<00:05:01.010> really<00:05:01.250> think<00:05:01.400> that<00:05:01.460> polymer<00:05:01.850> net

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
time and I really think that polymer net

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.820 
time and I really think that polymer net

definitely<00:06:21.830> a<00:06:21.860> difficult<00:06:22.580> product<00:06:23.090> to<00:06:23.240> apply

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
definitely a difficult product to apply

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.290 
definitely a difficult product to apply
and<00:06:23.780> remove<00:06:23.979> but<00:06:24.979> the<00:06:25.460> end<00:06:25.669> result<00:06:26.120> is

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
and remove but the end result is

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.820 
and remove but the end result is
definitely<00:06:26.780> impressive<00:06:27.110> the<00:06:27.440> water<00:06:27.620> beading

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
definitely impressive the water beading

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.529 
definitely impressive the water beading
is<00:06:28.070> probably<00:06:28.430> the<00:06:28.729> strongest<00:06:28.910> that<00:06:29.270> you<00:06:29.389> can

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539 
is probably the strongest that you can

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.740 
is probably the strongest that you can
get<00:06:29.720> for<00:06:29.960> a<00:06:29.990> product<00:06:30.289> on<00:06:30.530> paint<00:06:30.830> so<00:06:31.010> far<00:06:31.310> and<00:06:31.750> it

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
get for a product on paint so far and it

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.500 
get for a product on paint so far and it
does<00:06:32.990> this<00:06:33.169> without<00:06:33.490> sacrificing<00:06:34.490> shine<00:06:35.300> or

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
does this without sacrificing shine or

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.290 
does this without sacrificing shine or
gloss<00:06:36.159> what<00:06:37.159> it<00:06:37.250> does<00:06:37.430> sacrifice<00:06:38.000> is

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
gloss what it does sacrifice is

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.089 
gloss what it does sacrifice is
slickness<00:06:38.659> so<00:06:39.020> again<00:06:39.320> if<00:06:39.530> you're<00:06:39.680> looking<00:06:39.979> for
