00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
we want to lay our plants out with their

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.530 
we want to lay our plants out with their
proper<00:00:06.720> spacing<00:00:07.170> these<00:00:08.099> snapdragons<00:00:09.059> happen

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
proper spacing these snapdragons happen

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.209 
proper spacing these snapdragons happen
to<00:00:09.690> look<00:00:09.840> best<00:00:10.110> when<00:00:10.349> they're<00:00:10.559> planted<00:00:11.099> about

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
to look best when they're planted about

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.810 
to look best when they're planted about
8<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.150> 10<00:00:12.210> inches<00:00:12.420> apart<00:00:13.130> so<00:00:14.130> before<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.490> plant

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
8 to 10 inches apart so before I plant

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.590 
8 to 10 inches apart so before I plant
them<00:00:16.550> I'm<00:00:17.550> just<00:00:17.789> going<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.000> set<00:00:18.270> them<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
them I'm just going to set them in the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.370 
them I'm just going to set them in the
ground<00:00:20.330> so<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.660> decide<00:00:21.990> where<00:00:22.260> they're

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
ground so I can decide where they're

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:38.389 
ground so I can decide where they're
going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.650> go<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:37.559> even<00:00:38.010> though<00:00:38.040> these<00:00:38.340> are

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
going to go so even though these are

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.130 
going to go so even though these are
falling<00:00:38.910> over<00:00:39.210> i'll<00:00:39.360> still<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.809> able<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
falling over i'll still be able to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.410 
falling over i'll still be able to
figure<00:00:40.410> out<00:00:40.770> where<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.070> want<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> be<00:00:42.149> when

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
figure out where I want them to be when

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.740 
figure out where I want them to be when
I<00:00:42.450> plant<00:00:42.930> them<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:47.610> way<00:00:47.820> i<00:00:47.850> am<00:00:48.149> sure<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.600> i
