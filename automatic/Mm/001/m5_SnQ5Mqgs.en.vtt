00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.010
 now how about friends my name is 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.860
 august and this is a tutorial of 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.200
 automotive mechanics and let's check the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.240
 crankshaft sensor of a Corsica 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.600
 1.4 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.330
 double camshaft model 2002 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.680
 The multimeter materials 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:36.370
 extension ratchet and given 10 millimeters and 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.130
 a couple of right alligators later 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.440
 we will see why the position is good 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.440
 of the lower part sensor 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.360
 here is our catalyst 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.280
 correct oil filter 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.050
 about if I had already disconnected 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.130
 previously 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.130
 Well they are going to loosen 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.960
 taking out the screw 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.190
 when they remove their sensor 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.820
 check this catch or league well 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.590
 it's important because they can 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.300
 avoid leaks 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.260
 this car has a leak 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.260
 in this stop 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.480
 Right 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.560
 as well 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.560
 let's review it 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.770
 with the alligators 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:58.650
 they are going to put them inside the sensor here 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:05.570
 you can see the pins 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.570
 they are going to place one in each pin 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.870
 it's a bit difficult I'm recording 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.930
 single 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.069
 as well 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.260
 she gave him 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:24.290
 a reading of 2.5 almost right 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.189
 a resistive unit but I want that 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.189
 see what is happening 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.590
 Right 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.590
 there is a variation in reading 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.810
 this tells us that the sensor is fine 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.810
 Right 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.150
 Well, the only thing that remains 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:59.540
 is to reassemble 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:03.079
 and check that the league is in good 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.030
 in good condition, well, taking advantage of the 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.040
 video want to know where is 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.040
 positioned the camshaft sensor 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.760
 you have to remove it 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.760
 this mob to be able to access 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.310
 correct to carry the screws 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.440
 well, good 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.490
 I hope this little tutorial helps you 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.100
 of mechanics 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.740
 and if you have any comments some 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.250
 suggestion some other car to check 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:47.110
 Well I can give you an answer 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:50.280
 well well thank you very much 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.280
 an excellent day
