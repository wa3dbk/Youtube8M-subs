00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.050 
money in a very short period of time
third<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.380> notoriety<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.460> think<00:01:41.939> it's

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
third is the notoriety I think it's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.270 
third is the notoriety I think it's
really<00:01:42.240> stupid<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.070> win<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
really stupid but if you win a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.859 
really stupid but if you win a
tournament<00:01:44.520> people<00:01:45.060> tend<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.540> who<00:01:45.720> you

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
tournament people tend to know who you

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
tournament people tend to know who you
are<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.380> big<00:01:46.649> win<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> big<00:01:47.460> World<00:01:47.640> Series

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
you know it tends to be associated with

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.620 
you know it tends to be associated with
good<00:01:52.649> players<00:01:53.040> although<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:54.119> was<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.390> win<00:01:54.540> in

good players although it was just win in
one<00:01:54.720> tournament<00:01:55.049> isn't<00:01:55.380> really<00:01:55.619> indicative

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
one tournament isn't really indicative

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.410 
one tournament isn't really indicative
of<00:01:56.159> anything<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:56.909> indicative<00:01:57.180> of

these<00:02:28.110> people<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.769> there's<00:02:29.160> something

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
these people and there's something

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.100 
these people and there's something
special<00:02:29.700> about<00:02:29.970> saying<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.510> wanted<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.080> earn

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
special about saying I wanted to earn

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.990 
special about saying I wanted to earn
him<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.799> in<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.069> cash<00:02:32.280> game<00:02:32.549> it's<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:32.879> its

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
him it and in a cash game it's just its

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.940 
him it and in a cash game it's just its
ongoing<00:02:33.290> repetition<00:02:34.290> where<00:02:34.440> tournament<00:02:34.860> it's

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
ongoing repetition where tournament it's

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.220 
ongoing repetition where tournament it's
like<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.190> wanted<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.670> beat<00:02:35.879> it

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
like I wanted I beat it

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.009 
like I wanted I beat it
and<00:02:37.849> finally<00:02:38.849> which<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.090> think<00:02:39.360> are<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.599> what's

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
and finally which I think are the what's

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.569 
and finally which I think are the what's
the<00:02:40.140> biggest<00:02:40.560> thing<00:02:40.620> about<00:02:40.709> tournaments<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.430> I

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
the biggest thing about tournaments is I

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:42.979 
the biggest thing about tournaments is I
think<00:02:41.640> tournaments<00:02:42.269> are<00:02:42.360> much<00:02:42.510> easier<00:02:42.540> to

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
think tournaments are much easier to

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.140 
think tournaments are much easier to
play<00:02:43.230> all<00:02:44.129> right<00:02:44.310> they're<00:02:44.489> much<00:02:44.670> easier<00:02:45.030> to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
play all right they're much easier to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.300 
play all right they're much easier to
play<00:02:45.360> because<00:02:45.629> with<00:02:46.590> tournaments<00:02:47.160> you

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
play because with tournaments you

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.059 
play because with tournaments you
basically<00:02:48.049> there<00:02:49.049> are<00:02:49.140> certain<00:02:49.440> junctions<00:02:50.010> or

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
basically there are certain junctions or

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.410 
basically there are certain junctions or
certain<00:02:50.340> parts<00:02:50.549> of<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.849> tournament<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.299> in

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
certain parts of a tournament like in

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.229 
certain parts of a tournament like in
that<00:02:51.540> push<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:52.019> 10<00:02:52.349> big<00:02:52.530> blind<00:02:52.799> stage<00:02:53.129> or<00:02:53.489> you

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
that push of 10 big blind stage or you

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.580 
that push of 10 big blind stage or you
know<00:02:54.359> right<00:02:54.810> across<00:02:55.019> right<00:02:55.230> around<00:02:55.470> the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
know right across right around the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.630 
know right across right around the
bubble<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.040> there<00:02:56.129> are<00:02:56.190> certain<00:02:56.430> points

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
bubble and there are certain points

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.240 
bubble and there are certain points
where<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.840> decisions<00:02:58.260> are<00:02:58.349> yes<00:02:58.590> or<00:02:58.769> no<00:02:58.950> all

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
where the decisions are yes or no all

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.440 
where the decisions are yes or no all
right<00:02:59.430> you're<00:02:59.790> there<00:02:59.970> making<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.239> right

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
right you're there making a right

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.970 
right you're there making a right
decision<00:03:00.599> or<00:03:00.959> incorrect<00:03:01.290> decision<00:03:01.650> like<00:03:01.769> no

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
decision or incorrect decision like no

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.920 
decision or incorrect decision like no
you<00:03:02.040> can't<00:03:02.489> call<00:03:02.640> there<00:03:02.849> it's<00:03:03.030> all<00:03:03.480> inter<00:03:03.690> fold

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
you can't call there it's all inter fold

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.780 
you can't call there it's all inter fold
and<00:03:04.109> because<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.769> decision-making<00:03:05.310> process

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
and because the decision-making process

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.819 
and because the decision-making process
is<00:03:05.910> more<00:03:06.120> defined<00:03:06.569> I<00:03:06.959> think<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.680> lot

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
is more defined I think it's a lot

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.949 
is more defined I think it's a lot
easier<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.760> learn<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.239> play<00:03:09.450> right<00:03:09.690> and

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
easier to learn to play right and

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.599 
easier to learn to play right and
actually<00:03:10.379> play<00:03:10.620> right<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.099> that's<00:03:11.250> one<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.519> the

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
actually play right so that's one of the

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.819 
actually play right so that's one of the

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
I think they're a lot easier to play

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.770 
I think they're a lot easier to play
than<00:03:14.129> cash<00:03:15.769> yeah<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:17.790> really<00:03:18.120> do<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.329> really<00:03:18.660> do

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
about that but there's more clear yes

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.500 
about that but there's more clear yes
than<00:03:23.040> no<00:03:23.069> decisions<00:03:23.609> in<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.819> tournament<00:03:24.209> than

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510

that's insane those those are not
profitable<00:05:43.530> over<00:05:43.680> the<00:05:43.860> long<00:05:44.010> run<00:05:44.040> I<00:05:44.370> don't

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
profitable over the long run I don't

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.730

care<00:05:44.910> if<00:05:45.000> you<00:05:45.120> play<00:05:45.270> with<00:05:45.420> a<00:05:45.480> bunch<00:05:46.320> of<00:05:46.410> monkey

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
care if you play with a bunch of monkey

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.620

like<00:05:46.890> people<00:05:47.160> don't<00:05:47.910> even<00:05:47.970> have<00:05:48.210> a<00:05:48.270> part<00:05:48.480> it's

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
like people don't even have a part it's

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.420 
like people don't even have a part it's
in<00:05:48.780> terrible<00:05:49.170> it's<00:05:49.530> not<00:05:49.710> good<00:05:49.920> it's<00:05:50.040> not<00:05:50.130> good

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
in terrible it's not good it's not good

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.330 
in terrible it's not good it's not good
so<00:05:50.880> as<00:05:51.240> the<00:05:51.780> structures<00:05:52.260> get<00:05:52.500> better<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:53.190> you

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
so as the structures get better the you

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.460 
so as the structures get better the you
know<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.460> good<00:05:54.030> structure<00:05:54.570> is<00:05:54.720> a<00:05:54.750> lot<00:05:55.080> of<00:05:55.230> ships

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
know a good structure is a lot of ships

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.110 
know a good structure is a lot of ships
and<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.860> lot<00:05:55.980> of<00:05:56.010> time<00:05:56.280> to<00:05:56.460> play<00:05:56.640> those<00:05:56.850> chips

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
and a lot of time to play those chips

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.790 
and a lot of time to play those chips
and<00:05:57.330> unfortunately<00:05:58.170> most<00:05:58.380> of<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.590> lower

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
and unfortunately most of the lower

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.770 
and unfortunately most of the lower
stake<00:05:59.130> events<00:05:59.490> don't<00:05:59.730> have<00:05:59.940> good<00:06:00.240> structure

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
stake events don't have good structure

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.080 
stake events don't have good structure
so<00:06:01.050> it's<00:06:01.200> one<00:06:01.770> of<00:06:01.890> the<00:06:01.980> things<00:06:02.250> and<00:06:02.520> and<00:06:02.760> the

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
so it's one of the things and and the
