00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello today we would like 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.200
 show the best application to protect 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:13.320
 your data on the license ios 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.009
 Well, that is, on the ipad iphone ipod without 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.230
 jailbreak 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.779
 if you have a good one there 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.789
 many tracks in the side where I write 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.600
 later for now 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.939
 I would like to tell you by the way these tricks 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.160
 more functional they can be valid 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.160
 become the password for each application and 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.140
 This application which I consider the most 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.860
 the best on the official firmware anyway 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:46.760
 may can not put a password on 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.050
 specific application May 1st un slide 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.570
 The paid version is not much different from 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.719
 free and so download one by one 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.649
 version I do not see the point here it is mine 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.649
 describes and write root are tired and so 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.649
 we press 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.340
 Here I come not the first time just 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.770
 I installed it on eb1 by the way 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.700
 I use and really programs without lags 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 but also asks what password we have 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.580
 we want to use either usually pin 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.369
 either graphic key 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:33.240
 we will use the pattern key 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:35.509
 repeat so it seems you need more well so 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.509
 let it be 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.530
 what do they write 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.110
 draw again 3 times so 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.310
 yes save 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.180
 So 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.980
 allow us to use our 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.170
 location so well firstly you can 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.390
 save all contacts transfer here 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.670
 can save immediately can carry 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.290
 from standard contacts to standard 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.750
 contact they disappear appears 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.350
 here 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:19.380
 pictures from flyers to them, too, can be here 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.380
 so we can go 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.280
 where is the plus you can add that is 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.890
 take pictures first . or 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.540
 add program from library to 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.680
 principle in english but intuitive 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.139
 understandable there is also a web browser which 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.599
 get a standard safari i will say here 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:46.989
 partial flash support not only 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:53.010
 partial well more or less normal in 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.010
 general here's the truth again in English 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.569
 you can say youtube on it 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.659
 watch simultaneously 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.799
 listen to carry her under other pages 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:11.120
 browser side there is no such notes 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:15.560
 it is understandable so help but in principle not 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.579
 will then come to explain here so not 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.170
 great reference book 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:27.099
 in the settings you can specify a password 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.099
 that is, here it is 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.770
 either pin back change to pin well 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:39.230
 do you understand the settings here ? 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:44.370
 i.e. time slideshow 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.700
 This transition is about 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.800
 import and export contacts notes and 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.360
 so on but it is not automatically so 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.580
 here shit his browser home 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.870
 page 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.480
 Search 5 just the same corner naked yahu and 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.790
 security is this tick 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.340
 responsible for taking photographs 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.430
 every entry and exit I can give you now 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.160
 demonstrate this well 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.200
 there is like this picture at the entrance is not 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.590
 done so done that is to eat even if 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.120
 it won't make a mistake later 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.850
 don't make a mistake password your mouth 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.080
 the schedule is difficult our last 2 cases 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:31.790
 samson from 40 here 3 minutes ago 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:37.200
 places count 1 place 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:39.620
 Well, in general, all of this review is different 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.620
 programs
