00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 good to play rugby really what 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.580
 only expendable are the boots of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.790
 tacos generally good forwards 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.690
 come on with this kind of boots are from to 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.030
 aluminum 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.010
 because good to push everything in the 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.250
 Scrum if you wear rubber cleats you usually 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.050
 slide 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.070
 in the three quarters the sun rises with 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.290
 domain when the field is very 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.670
 muddy because of course the cue grabs 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.150
 much more 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.489
 then other things greater this 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.950
 we also use it all is a 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.630
 mouth guard more than anything for the subject 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.309
 of the teeth that is the only thing that is not 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:47.650
 can replace lacquers that is a 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.140
 chichonera is like what the 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.390
 chelsea goalie Peter Cech and 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.790
 simply good is to cushion a 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.370
 hit and the second line especially for 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.320
 I do not know, it did not hurt your ears 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.979
 because so much rubbing in the ml you get 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.260
 they fill with liquid and you get roses 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:07.060
 the leather ones here are shoulder pads 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.159
 that really is a little bit of 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.500
 cushioning are like shoulder pads that 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.020
 get into the jackets is a little bit 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.729
 of foam nothing more and then on top of 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.340
 everything is the playhouse that the 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.799
 we want and every party 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.040
 the first one is blue the second is 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.440
 white and older ones I do not know everyone 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.869
 has any protection is put then 7 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.479
 is something bad that the cordoba better to a 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.659
 bandage that protects your ankle but 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.369
 Priori is what we use 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.969
 but above all the most important thing for 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.469
 play rugby is the ball is good as 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.250
 you can see it has an oval shape like a 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:46.859
 melon and good is harder to go from 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.390
 control that the soccer because over 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.770
 everything when the soil is left you do not know 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.719
 where are you going to vote and do not know in what 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.030
 direction the ball you can intuit it already 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.319
 when you start playing but the first 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.569
 Once we're crazy because you'll put 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.120
 He spoke by eba for another such but 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:03.900
 well with time you get used to 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.670
 the price then around 30 to 45 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.950
 euros that they sell in stores 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.200
 then the competition is a little 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.320
 more expensive about 60 euros 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.180
 but good as buying a ball of 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.860
 10 euros to play 20 euros we can 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.360
 buy the official that you're worth 50 60 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.190
 euros 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.040
 good to see the prices more or less to 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.470
 equip themselves well they are very varied 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.790
 then take the normal high-end range of 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.220
 the boots 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.190
 I can buy rubber boots are for 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.130
 train since they oscillate between 40 euros 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.330
 and what you want to spend 40 to 50 euros 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.940
 the aluminum is usually a little more 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.860
 expensive because clear economies more expensive 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.930
 than the rubber one and they do not usually make us 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.690
 everyone and they are around 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.220
 the 60 euros 60 but like the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.060
 of we will have a range of between 60 and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.810
 150 euros or 200 the helmet only around 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.760
 about 30 euros 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.640
 the producer play quite affordable what 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.770
 You can find it in any store 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.170
 generic sport with about ten 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.700
 euros although yes yes if you go for 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.599
 example to a dentist is much clearer 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.959
 because they treat the shoulder pads to your size 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.130
 they are also around 30 to 50 euros 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.330
 just like the boots you get from a range 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.940
 which is more or better than any brand and 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.569
 another that are the best white brand 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.700
 sporty and good I think that 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.519
 what we have here is the price of everything 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.010
 to start playing with 100 euros 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.340
 I think it goes pretty well and more 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.340
 safe
