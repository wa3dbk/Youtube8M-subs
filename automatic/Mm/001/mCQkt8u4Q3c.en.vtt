00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
and we we pulled it for a bit and said

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.660 
and we we pulled it for a bit and said
you<00:05:48.140> know<00:05:48.260> hey<00:05:48.410> we<00:05:48.890> could<00:05:49.040> probably<00:05:49.190> Powell

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
you know hey we could probably Powell

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.710 
you know hey we could probably Powell
this<00:05:49.850> Creek<00:05:50.140> and<00:05:51.140> probably<00:05:51.800> halfway<00:05:51.980> and<00:05:52.400> then

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
this Creek and probably halfway and then

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.360 
this Creek and probably halfway and then
