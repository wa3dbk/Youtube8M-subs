00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.780 
see so you make the connection and then
just<00:02:29.600> slide<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.960> pin<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.620> lock<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:31.700> into

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
just slide the pin in and lock it into

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.340 
just slide the pin in and lock it into
position<00:02:32.000> although<00:02:32.450> for<00:02:32.750> some<00:02:32.780> reason<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
position although for some reason the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.690 
position although for some reason the
pin<00:02:33.500> on<00:02:33.590> this<00:02:33.680> model<00:02:34.010> is<00:02:34.100> just<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.340> bit<00:02:34.490> too

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
pin on this model is just a bit too

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.430 
pin on this model is just a bit too
short<00:02:34.970> so<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.360> doesn't<00:02:35.630> go<00:02:35.780> fully<00:02:36.080> through

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
short so it doesn't go fully through

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.960 
short so it doesn't go fully through
although<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.190> still<00:02:37.370> forms<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.730> strong

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
although it still forms a strong

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.870 
although it still forms a strong
connection<00:02:38.800> this<00:02:39.800> process<00:02:40.250> just<00:02:40.520> then<00:02:40.700> gets

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
connection this process just then gets

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.790 
connection this process just then gets
repeated<00:02:41.210> at<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.720> module<00:02:42.080> end<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.350> things<00:02:42.560> and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
repeated at the module end of things and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.320 
repeated at the module end of things and
you<00:02:42.860> just<00:02:42.890> get<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.550> connector<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
you just get the connector and the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.720 
you just get the connector and the
module<00:02:44.750> hook<00:02:45.500> them<00:02:45.680> together<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.430> then<00:02:46.610> you

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
module hook them together and then you

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.910 
module hook them together and then you
can<00:02:46.910> lock<00:02:47.060> them<00:02:47.300> with<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.630> pin<00:02:47.960> which<00:02:48.650> on<00:02:48.800> this

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
can lock them with the pin which on this

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.350 
can lock them with the pin which on this
end<00:02:49.130> of<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.340> model<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.700> long<00:02:49.880> enough<00:02:50.150> and

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
end of the model is long enough and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.720 
end of the model is long enough and
makes<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.750> proper<00:02:50.960> connection<00:02:51.710> this<00:02:52.370> sliding

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
makes a proper connection this sliding

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.280 
makes a proper connection this sliding
metal<00:02:53.000> pin<00:02:53.300> system<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.810> certainly<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.170> nicest

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
metal pin system is certainly the nicest

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.280 
metal pin system is certainly the nicest
way<00:02:54.710> of<00:02:54.860> joining<00:02:55.100> model<00:02:55.460> parts<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:55.910> these

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
way of joining model parts like these

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.570 
way of joining model parts like these
the<00:02:57.290> front<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.740> vessel<00:02:58.010> bit<00:02:58.190> then<00:02:58.400> just

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
the front of the vessel bit then just

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.760 
the front of the vessel bit then just
hooks<00:02:58.790> over<00:02:59.000> onto<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.750> connection<00:03:00.290> at<00:03:00.590> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.010 
hooks over onto the connection at the
gooseneck<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.430> then<00:03:02.390> there's<00:03:02.570> only<00:03:02.630> one<00:03:02.750> more

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
gooseneck and then there's only one more

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.660 
gooseneck and then there's only one more
thing<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.380> do<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.680> get<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.070> tractor<00:03:04.490> and

trailer in a usable State and that is to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.800 
trailer in a usable State and that is to
join<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.370> trailer<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.000> tractor<00:03:08.330> and

from WSI so the suspension works well

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.470 
from WSI so the suspension works well
and<00:05:56.110> you<00:05:56.230> can<00:05:56.380> really<00:05:56.530> rock<00:05:56.800> and<00:05:56.980> roll<00:05:57.480> also

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
and you can really rock and roll also

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.850 
and you can really rock and roll also
really<00:05:58.750> good<00:05:58.870> on<00:05:59.020> these<00:05:59.140> units<00:05:59.530> is<00:05:59.710> the

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
really good on these units is the

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.620 
really good on these units is the
steering<00:06:00.340> which<00:06:00.550> is<00:06:00.730> proportional<00:06:01.060> on<00:06:01.450> this

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
steering which is proportional on this

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.080 
steering which is proportional on this
one<00:06:01.840> so<00:06:02.230> the<00:06:02.860> wheels<00:06:03.100> at<00:06:03.280> the<00:06:03.310> back<00:06:03.520> turn<00:06:03.850> more

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
one so the wheels at the back turn more

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.820 
one so the wheels at the back turn more
than<00:06:04.270> those<00:06:04.450> at<00:06:04.660> the<00:06:04.750> front<00:06:04.780> which<00:06:05.260> aids<00:06:05.560> its

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
than those at the front which aids its

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.330 
than those at the front which aids its
cornering<00:06:06.280> and<00:06:06.960> once<00:06:07.960> it<00:06:08.170> set<00:06:08.410> it<00:06:08.620> then<00:06:08.860> traces

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
cornering and once it set it then traces

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.660 
cornering and once it set it then traces
a<00:06:09.370> realistic<00:06:09.970> curve<00:06:11.100> it's<00:06:12.100> also<00:06:12.310> always

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670 
a realistic curve it's also always

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.340 
a realistic curve it's also always
interesting<00:06:13.240> to<00:06:13.360> look<00:06:13.510> into<00:06:13.780> the<00:06:13.900> top<00:06:14.110> of<00:06:14.140> the

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
interesting to look into the top of the

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.170 
interesting to look into the top of the
module<00:06:14.710> and<00:06:14.950> see<00:06:15.130> the<00:06:15.280> various<00:06:15.640> linkages

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
module and see the various linkages

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.120 
module and see the various linkages
working<00:06:16.630> on<00:06:16.750> the<00:06:16.870> steering<00:06:17.140> mechanism<00:06:17.260> as<00:06:17.950> you

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
working on the steering mechanism as you

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.090 
working on the steering mechanism as you
turn<00:06:18.310> the<00:06:18.340> wheels<00:06:19.290> will<00:06:20.290> now<00:06:20.440> move<00:06:20.620> on<00:06:20.800> to<00:06:20.920> some

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
turn the wheels will now move on to some

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.680 
turn the wheels will now move on to some
of<00:06:21.130> the<00:06:21.310> configurations<00:06:21.610> of<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.240> model<00:06:22.570> and

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
of the configurations of the model and

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.970 
of the configurations of the model and
the<00:06:22.750> first<00:06:22.960> thing<00:06:23.110> you<00:06:23.170> can<00:06:23.290> do<00:06:23.440> is<00:06:23.560> to<00:06:23.710> stretch

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
the first thing you can do is to stretch

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.320 
the first thing you can do is to stretch
out<00:06:24.220> the<00:06:24.550> vessel<00:06:24.940> bed

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
out the vessel bed

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.630 
out the vessel bed
it's<00:06:26.200> telescopic<00:06:26.860> and<00:06:27.010> the<00:06:27.100> overall<00:06:27.340> models

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
it's telescopic and the overall models

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.940 
it's telescopic and the overall models
about<00:06:27.760> 60<00:06:28.330> centimetres<00:06:28.960> or<00:06:29.080> 2<00:06:29.290> feet<00:06:29.500> long<00:06:29.740> and

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
about 60 centimetres or 2 feet long and

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.310 
about 60 centimetres or 2 feet long and
here<00:06:30.910> you<00:06:31.000> can<00:06:31.150> see<00:06:31.330> also<00:06:31.600> has<00:06:31.930> its<00:06:32.140> width

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
here you can see also has its width

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.440 
here you can see also has its width
extended<00:06:32.980> to<00:06:33.130> make<00:06:33.250> a<00:06:33.280> wider<00:06:33.640> bed<00:06:33.970> for<00:06:34.210> wide

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.450 
extended to make a wider bed for wide

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.200 
extended to make a wider bed for wide
loads<00:06:34.890> so<00:06:35.890> here<00:06:36.100> comes<00:06:36.280> a<00:06:36.370> vessel<00:06:36.700> on<00:06:36.850> a<00:06:36.880> frame

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
loads so here comes a vessel on a frame

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.630 
loads so here comes a vessel on a frame
to<00:06:37.420> use<00:06:37.600> as<00:06:37.810> a<00:06:37.840> load<00:06:38.140> but<00:06:38.890> that<00:06:39.040> tank<00:06:39.340> is<00:06:39.490> so

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
to use as a load but that tank is so

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.300 
to use as a load but that tank is so
full<00:06:39.880> of<00:06:39.970> holes<00:06:40.180> it's<00:06:40.450> useless

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
full of holes it's useless

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.440 
full of holes it's useless
another<00:06:42.310> feature<00:06:42.550> of<00:06:42.730> the<00:06:42.850> model<00:06:43.090> is<00:06:43.180> that<00:06:43.210> it

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
another feature of the model is that it

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.510 
another feature of the model is that it
comes<00:06:43.690> with<00:06:43.870> a<00:06:43.900> pair<00:06:44.200> of<00:06:44.230> support<00:06:44.620> legs<00:06:45.100> which

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
comes with a pair of support legs which

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.130 
comes with a pair of support legs which
just<00:06:45.820> push<00:06:46.030> into<00:06:46.270> the<00:06:46.660> front<00:06:46.930> of<00:06:47.050> the

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
just push into the front of the

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.620 
just push into the front of the
gooseneck<00:06:47.350> and<00:06:47.940> they<00:06:48.940> could<00:06:49.120> be<00:06:49.240> transported

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
gooseneck and they could be transported

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.210 
gooseneck and they could be transported
like<00:06:49.900> that<00:06:50.110> but<00:06:50.320> another<00:06:50.500> option<00:06:50.620> they<00:06:50.980> give

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
like that but another option they give

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.370 
like that but another option they give
is<00:06:51.490> that<00:06:51.520> they<00:06:51.820> can<00:06:51.970> act<00:06:52.150> as<00:06:52.360> support<00:06:52.510> legs<00:06:52.990> for

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
is that they can act as support legs for

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.870 
is that they can act as support legs for
the<00:06:53.530> gooseneck<00:06:53.740> when<00:06:54.190> it's<00:06:54.340> disconnected

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
the gooseneck when it's disconnected

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.280 
the gooseneck when it's disconnected
from<00:06:54.940> the<00:06:55.090> trailer<00:06:55.480> so<00:06:55.660> you<00:06:55.720> just<00:06:55.870> turn<00:06:56.110> them

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.290 
from the trailer so you just turn them

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.430 
from the trailer so you just turn them
round<00:06:56.470> and<00:06:56.860> push<00:06:57.070> them<00:06:57.280> in<00:06:57.840> you<00:06:58.840> can<00:06:58.990> see<00:06:59.170> here

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
round and push them in you can see here

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.570 
round and push them in you can see here
something<00:06:59.680> that<00:06:59.830> looks<00:07:00.130> like<00:07:00.280> a<00:07:00.310> large

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
something that looks like a large

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.730 
something that looks like a large
bug-eyed<00:07:01.060> monster<00:07:01.600> but<00:07:02.110> I<00:07:02.140> really<00:07:02.440> shouldn't

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
bug-eyed monster but I really shouldn't

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.230 
bug-eyed monster but I really shouldn't
talk<00:07:02.920> like<00:07:03.190> that<00:07:03.220> about<00:07:03.550> the<00:07:03.790> guy<00:07:03.970> in<00:07:04.090> your

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
talk like that about the guy in your

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.440 
talk like that about the guy in your
inch<00:07:04.420> coat<00:07:05.490> this<00:07:06.490> is<00:07:06.670> a<00:07:06.700> really<00:07:07.030> very<00:07:07.180> nice

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
inch coat this is a really very nice

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.150 
inch coat this is a really very nice
