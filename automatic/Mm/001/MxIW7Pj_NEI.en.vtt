slowly<00:03:16.070> separate<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.760> small<00:03:17.030> half<00:03:17.300> of<00:03:17.420> the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
slowly separate the small half of the

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.270 
slowly separate the small half of the
gearbox<00:03:17.720> from<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.320> rest<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.740> engine

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.580 

next<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.400> can<00:03:25.490> start<00:03:25.790> removing<00:03:25.910> gears<00:03:26.590> slide

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
next you can start removing gears slide

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.710 
next you can start removing gears slide
