00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello people we are again in a 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.899
 video from the ios device community 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.269
 time in a tutorial how to put your 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.160
 phone on your pc screen what 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.230
 first thing we're going to do is direct 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.210
 to our search engine and we will put the link 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.980
 that I will leave in the description as 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.140
 you can see this is an official page 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.170
 which is also compatible with iphone 5 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.210
 65 s we are going to do it in a way 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.080
 free so we will tighten in the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.080
 trial version 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.860
 we will start to download 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.930
 automatically and it will take very little 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.719
 time I cancel it and because I already 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.879
 I have downloaded will open a 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.489
 tab where he will explain all the 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:50.379
 steps to follow for the installation but 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.379
 in this way it is much faster 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.609
 once installed we will go to the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.979
 folder where we installed it that is 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:12.600
 Reflector program files and you 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.950
 we will double click on the file 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.950
 searchlights executable 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.510
 we will choose the trial version and we 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.400
 will say that it will only be working 10 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.880
 continuous minutes for each time 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.880
 let's execute 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.469
 then we will go to the bottom 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.469
 left and we will double click 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.420
 now the process is still on your iphone but 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.300
 wait for me to do it to show them 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.190
 on the pc remember that to be able to do 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.960
 the play on your device should be 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.960
 connected to the same wifi network 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.200
 good once your 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.990
 device can perform different 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.490
 functions but I'll show you what to do 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.490

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.840

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.640
