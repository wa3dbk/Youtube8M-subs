00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
dead body but this time around it seems

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.350 
dead body but this time around it seems
like<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.740> are<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.310> get<00:01:35.460> only<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:36.030> heal

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
like you are going to get only one heal

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.080 
like you are going to get only one heal
from<00:01:36.689> every<00:01:37.079> death<00:01:37.320> which<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.950> ok<00:01:38.400> because<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
from every death which is ok because the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.929 
from every death which is ok because the
percentage<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.409> 10%<00:01:41.130> which<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.579> quite<00:01:41.909> a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
percentage is now 10% which is quite a

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.300 
percentage is now 10% which is quite a
lot<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.290> time<00:01:43.470> around<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.890> seems<00:01:44.130> like

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
lot but this time around it seems like

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.130 
lot but this time around it seems like
you<00:01:44.430> are<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.000> heal<00:01:45.360> only<00:01:45.720> once<00:01:45.930> from

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you are going to heal only once from

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.499 
you are going to heal only once from
every<00:01:46.530> death<00:01:46.770> however<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.000> realize

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
every death however you have to realize

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.929 
every death however you have to realize
that<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.409> trade-off<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.670> skill

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that this is a trade-off for the skill

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.179 
that this is a trade-off for the skill
probably<00:01:51.450> being<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.899> passive<00:01:52.350> skill<00:01:52.619> which

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
probably being a passive skill which

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.880 
probably being a passive skill which
means<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.820> doesn't<00:01:54.030> actually<00:01:54.750> block<00:01:55.619> any

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
means that it doesn't actually block any

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.639 
means that it doesn't actually block any
amount<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.610> your<00:01:56.790> mana<00:01:57.030> pool<00:01:57.409> then<00:01:58.409> we<00:01:58.530> have

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
amount of your mana pool then we have

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.560 
amount of your mana pool then we have
another<00:01:58.860> passive<00:01:59.310> skill<00:01:59.579> called<00:01:59.880> blinding
