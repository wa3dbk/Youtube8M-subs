all has resolved

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:28.869
let's begin with the flour

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.739
I have a Kilo flour here, we will see how much we need

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.139
ok

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:42.139
again

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.579
ok

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.979
we won't be needing anymore flour

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.489
looks good

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.519
continue working it

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.509
the dough is done

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.219
it should be like this as you can see

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.009
we did need 900g flour

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.649
cover it up

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:14.259
let it prove for 30 minutes

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:18.229
the filling has cooled down

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.849
now add 250g mozarella

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.219
stir, you can also use sheeps cheese or soft cheese

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.680
or spinach

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.279
put it aside

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.819

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.219

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.900

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.710
let's begin

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.710
take one and put it on

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.400

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.999
distribute

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:39.409

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.009
put a bit of magarine into the pan, not too much

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.839
and now put in the Gözleme

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.909

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.849
next one, continue like this

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.499
take a look beneath

if it's ready

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.009

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.800
put in some magarine again

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.779

put in magarine again

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:57.550
für jede Seite etwas Magarine nehmen

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.349
