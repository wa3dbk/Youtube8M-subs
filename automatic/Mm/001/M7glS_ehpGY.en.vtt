the thing to remind yourself about is

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.480 
the thing to remind yourself about is
that<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> Google<00:00:21.930> toolbar<00:00:22.410> PageRank<00:00:22.920> number

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
that the Google toolbar PageRank number

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.939 
that the Google toolbar PageRank number
one<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:24.180> only<00:00:24.480> updated<00:00:24.869> periodically<00:00:25.230> so

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
one it's only updated periodically so

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.550 
one it's only updated periodically so
you<00:00:26.670> know<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> while<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.900> would<00:00:28.080> update<00:00:28.230> it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
you know for a while we would update it

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.740 
you know for a while we would update it
relatively<00:00:29.099> often<00:00:29.609> now<00:00:29.939> we'll<00:00:30.240> update<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
relatively often now we'll update it a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.590 
relatively often now we'll update it a
few<00:00:30.960> times<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.349> year<00:00:31.380> over<00:00:32.340> time<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.360> PageRank

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
few times a year over time the PageRank

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.590 
few times a year over time the PageRank
is<00:00:33.870> getting<00:00:34.200> less<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.890> toolbar<00:00:35.460> PageRank<00:00:36.329> is

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
is getting less the toolbar PageRank is

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.470 
is getting less the toolbar PageRank is
getting<00:00:36.809> less<00:00:36.989> usage<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.710> because<00:00:38.480> recent

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
getting less usage just because recent

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.940 
getting less usage just because recent
versions<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.960> Internet<00:00:40.290> Explorer<00:00:40.649> don't

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
versions of Internet Explorer don't

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
versions of Internet Explorer don't
really<00:00:41.520> let<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.090> install<00:00:42.480> toolbars<00:00:43.079> as

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
really let you install toolbars as

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.470 
really let you install toolbars as
easily<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.940> chrome<00:00:44.940> doesn't<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
easily and chrome doesn't have the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.779 
easily and chrome doesn't have the
toolbar<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.110> over<00:00:46.440> time<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.579> PageRank

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
toolbar so over time the PageRank

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.209 
toolbar so over time the PageRank
indicator<00:00:48.360> will<00:00:48.570> probably<00:00:48.989> start<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.469> go<00:00:50.129> away

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
indicator will probably start to go away

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.250 
indicator will probably start to go away
a<00:00:50.370> little<00:00:50.610> bit<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.690> also<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.079> case<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
a little bit but it's also the case that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.950 
a little bit but it's also the case that
we<00:00:52.530> only<00:00:52.890> update<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.460> information<00:00:54.120> every

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
we only update this information every

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.380 
we only update this information every
few<00:00:55.170> months<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.370> does<00:00:56.579> take<00:00:56.850> time<00:00:57.090> in

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
few months and so it does take time in

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.540 
few months and so it does take time in
order<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.719> show<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.800> other<00:00:58.980> thing<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> bear

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
order to show up the other thing to bear

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.180 
order to show up the other thing to bear
in<00:00:59.579> mind<00:00:59.699> is<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:01.500> mentioned<00:01:02.039> having

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
in mind is that you mentioned having

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.609 
in mind is that you mentioned having
regular<00:01:02.609> updates<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.480> having<00:01:04.290> proven

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
regular updates and having proven

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
regular updates and having proven
editors<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.159> original<00:01:05.460> content<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.420> that's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
editors with original content but that's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.240 
editors with original content but that's
not<00:01:06.750> what<00:01:06.930> PageRank<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.409> about<00:01:07.650> PageRank<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
not what PageRank is about PageRank is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.550 
not what PageRank is about PageRank is
about<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> number<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.060> links<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.600> site<00:01:09.930> so

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
about the number of links to a site so

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.929 
about the number of links to a site so
check<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.130> make<00:01:11.220> sure<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> good

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
like a tree like structure that leads to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.950 
like a tree like structure that leads to
the<00:01:20.189> individual<00:01:20.640> pages<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.270> good<00:01:21.420> make

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the individual pages can be good make

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.179 
the individual pages can be good make
sure<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> pages<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.830> are<00:01:22.920> really

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
sure that the pages that are really

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
sure that the pages that are really
important<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.180> know<00:01:24.299> maybe<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:25.020> or

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
important are you know maybe just one or

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.830 
important are you know maybe just one or
two<00:01:25.170> links<00:01:25.590> from<00:01:26.009> your<00:01:26.580> home<00:01:27.240> page<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
two links from your home page so that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.600 
two links from your home page so that
the<00:01:28.259> PageRank<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.860> still<00:01:29.070> relatively<00:01:29.520> high

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the PageRank is still relatively high

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.450 
the PageRank is still relatively high
there<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:31.020> then<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.500> make<00:01:31.650> sure<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.310> lot

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
there and then just make sure that a lot

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.830 
there and then just make sure that a lot
of<00:01:32.549> people<00:01:32.790> know<00:01:32.939> about<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.329> content<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
know that it's high quality content

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.910 
know that it's high quality content
because<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.409> lot<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.619> people<00:01:37.829> are

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
because if if a lot of people are

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.679 
because if if a lot of people are
linking<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.250> your<00:01:38.610> site<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.119> those<00:01:39.299> people

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
linking to your site and those people

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.060 
linking to your site and those people
who<00:01:39.930> are<00:01:39.960> linking<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.920> high

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
who are linking to you have high

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.069 
who are linking to you have high
PageRank<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:42.119> you'll<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.540> more<00:01:42.689> likely<00:01:42.930> to

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
PageRank then you'll be more likely to
