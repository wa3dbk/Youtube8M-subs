00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.080 
there because if you leave your bolt in
when<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.620> go<00:02:20.739> to<00:02:20.799> put<00:02:21.310> your<00:02:21.340> impact<00:02:21.819> on<00:02:21.970> this

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
when you go to put your impact on this

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.030 
when you go to put your impact on this
these<00:02:22.630> bolts<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.049> have<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> tendency<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.709> shear

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
these bolts I have a tendency to shear

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.059 
these bolts I have a tendency to shear
off<00:02:24.310> just<00:02:25.269> from<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.660> torque<00:02:26.170> from<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.620> impact

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
off just from the torque from the impact

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.070 
off just from the torque from the impact
so<00:02:27.700> for<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.030> be<00:02:28.180> sure<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.450> can<00:02:28.569> pull<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:28.930> both

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
so for you be sure you can pull you both

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.590 
so for you be sure you can pull you both
out

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600
