 he just wants to do a good season with this team 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.829
 and I'm going to try the percent months with the club's impossible to run out 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.970

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.300

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.900

 I've got a pretty good time too much 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.630
 beautiful 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.800
 history with team 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.540
 that is the season that is less than members and now stand by the prints moment 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.250
 2 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.060
 And to add that moment is the best club of moons when to be so yes 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.630
 number was good on my record 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.610
 well to conjure up the project twice 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.000
 the ambition to be dead wanting to make first class and with nothing with the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.430
 trees can lead 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.560
 yes i have i have your face you draw then 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.970
 just i try to bring mark all i know i have to work hard and i do 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.400
 got good again will have a place in the 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.480
 scott all day long 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.910
 and after that one just goes pathetic it happens but what I'm just happy about 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.080
 to be here and then 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.090
 try to go with the team after first class 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.220
 now he comes to the debate last season was the animal people here went 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.369
 it still the bulkheaded man 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.390
 but then also the season and they see it as a competitive challenge 

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:42.030
 to go 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.810
 jacob cats is always good for an example 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.780
 every player swiss won with could silicio the products 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.939
 getting better so yes a pawn is just a good keeper 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.670
 with collisions with a good hissing sound 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.320
 The Swedish started glad that I just him and each other 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.690
 with push elm to get better and then 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.920
 the coast can just go that the trainer but yes I have I do respect 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.790
 him and 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.470
 Frank the farmer also gets well together
