00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
I'm going to show you how to enable the

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.800 
I'm going to show you how to enable the
battery<00:00:03.629> percentage<00:00:04.110> on<00:00:04.259> Android<00:00:05.069> L

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:05.810 
battery percentage on Android L

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.470 
battery percentage on Android L
unfortunately<00:00:06.810> like<00:00:07.529> KitKat<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:09.059> have<00:00:09.269> to

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
unfortunately like KitKat you have to

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.940 
unfortunately like KitKat you have to
actually<00:00:09.870> enable<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.469> battery<00:00:10.769> percentage

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
actually enable the battery percentage

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.520 
actually enable the battery percentage
yourself<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:12.540> shows<00:00:12.780> up<00:00:12.960> right<00:00:13.139> here<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.440> a

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
yourself that shows up right here and a

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.630 
yourself that shows up right here and a
little<00:00:14.780> status<00:00:15.780> bar<00:00:15.990> up<00:00:16.080> there<00:00:16.520> so<00:00:17.520> it's

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
little status bar up there so it's

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.680 
little status bar up there so it's
actually<00:00:17.850> going<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.000> show<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.240> within<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
actually going to show up within the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
actually going to show up within the
battery<00:00:18.869> icon<00:00:19.350> which<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.100> pretty<00:00:20.369> convenient

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
battery icon which is pretty convenient

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.960 
battery icon which is pretty convenient
and<00:00:21.119> unlike<00:00:22.100> KitKat<00:00:23.100> as<00:00:23.220> well<00:00:23.400> when<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.760> pull

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and unlike KitKat as well when you pull

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.050 
and unlike KitKat as well when you pull
down<00:00:24.000> your<00:00:25.010> little<00:00:26.010> options<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.760> actually

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
down your little options it actually

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.339 
down your little options it actually
doesn't<00:00:27.449> even<00:00:27.510> tell<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.960> about<00:00:28.050> ru

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
doesn't even tell you about ru

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.209 
doesn't even tell you about ru
percentage<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.609> even<00:00:29.880> more<00:00:31.219> valued

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
percentage so this is even more valued

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.030 
percentage so this is even more valued
on<00:00:32.399> L<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.719> hopefully<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.469> official

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
on L so hopefully with the official

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.459 
on L so hopefully with the official
release<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.399> L<00:00:35.579> it'll<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.780> enabled

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
release of L it'll have this enabled

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.139 
release of L it'll have this enabled
right<00:00:37.649> now<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:38.010> not<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.550> let's<00:00:38.760> show<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.000> how

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
right now it's not so let's show you how

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.049 
right now it's not so let's show you how
to<00:00:39.420> get<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.899> enabled<00:00:40.579> it's<00:00:41.579> actually

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
to get it enabled it's actually

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.540 
to get it enabled it's actually
extremely<00:00:42.660> simple<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.710> don't<00:00:43.829> need<00:00:43.950> Roo<00:00:44.250> all

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
extremely simple you don't need Roo all

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.060 
extremely simple you don't need Roo all
you<00:00:44.670> need<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:45.469> application<00:00:46.469> called

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
you need is one application called

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.069 
you need is one application called
battery<00:00:47.399> percentage<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:48.360> KitKat

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
battery percentage for KitKat

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.229 
battery percentage for KitKat
yes<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.739> called<00:00:49.860> KitKat<00:00:50.430> because<00:00:50.850> I'm

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
yes it's called KitKat because I'm

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510 
yes it's called KitKat because I'm
assuming<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.379> developer<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.399> this

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
assuming that the developer for this

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.270 
assuming that the developer for this
application<00:00:53.670> does<00:00:54.210> not<00:00:54.360> yet<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.780> his

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
application does not yet know that his

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.389 
application does not yet know that his
app<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.670> working<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.420> Android<00:00:57.899> L<00:00:58.250> now<00:00:59.250> there

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
app is working for Android L now there

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.400 
app is working for Android L now there
is<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> way<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> unlock<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.930> adb

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
is a way to unlock this with adb

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.709 
is a way to unlock this with adb
commands<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.430> much<00:01:03.059> easier<00:01:03.480> you

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
commands but this is much easier you

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.000 
commands but this is much easier you
don't<00:01:03.750> need<00:01:04.080> anything<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.710> don't<00:01:04.799> need<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
don't need anything you don't need a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.590 
don't need anything you don't need a
plug<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.400> device<00:01:05.670> all<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> need<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
plug in your device all you need is the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.179 
plug in your device all you need is the
application<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.850> once<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.030> open<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.390> it's

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
application and once you open it it's

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.179 
application and once you open it it's
just<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.490> check<00:01:11.820> enable<00:01:12.750> about<00:01:13.439> 80<00:01:13.590> percent<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
just a check enable about 80 percent and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.859 
just a check enable about 80 percent and
then<00:01:14.820> you're<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.240> reboot<00:01:15.630> your

then you're just going to reboot your
device<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.590> we're<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> reboot<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.220> right

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
device so we're going to reboot it right

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.800 
device so we're going to reboot it right
now<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.790> I'm<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.390> show<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.600> the

now and I'm going to show you the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.620 
now and I'm going to show you the
percentage<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.409> top<00:01:20.030> let's<00:01:21.030> actually<00:01:21.210> show

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
percentage up top let's actually show

percentage up top let's actually show
you<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> percent<00:01:22.320> right<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:23.299> so<00:01:24.299> you

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
you the percent right now so you

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.910 
you the percent right now so you
actually<00:01:25.140> there's<00:01:25.259> no<00:01:25.350> percent<00:01:25.650> let's<00:01:25.799> show

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
actually there's no percent let's show

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.020 
actually there's no percent let's show
you<00:01:25.979> how<00:01:26.040> there's<00:01:26.400> no<00:01:26.520> percent<00:01:26.880> right<00:01:27.000> now

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
you how there's no percent right now

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.300 
you how there's no percent right now
then<00:01:27.299> I'm<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> reboot<00:01:27.810> right<00:01:27.990> now<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.920> check

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
then I'm a reboot right now so check

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.450 
then I'm a reboot right now so check
that<00:01:29.340> out<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:31.020> device<00:01:31.290> has<00:01:31.560> restarted<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
that out the device has restarted and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.340 
that out the device has restarted and
let's<00:01:32.939> actually<00:01:33.390> zoom<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.320> see

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
let's actually zoom in so you can see

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.929 
let's actually zoom in so you can see
this<00:01:35.270> battery<00:01:36.270> percentage<00:01:36.680> it's<00:01:37.680> simple<00:01:38.490> it's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
this battery percentage it's simple it's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.030 
this battery percentage it's simple it's
a<00:01:39.270> feature<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.869> I'm<00:01:40.200> sure<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.650> us<00:01:40.890> can

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
a feature that I'm sure all of us can

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.100 
a feature that I'm sure all of us can
value<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:41.970> stop<00:01:42.210> trying<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.960> make

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
value so we can stop trying to make

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.039 
value so we can stop trying to make
estimations<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.250> our<00:01:44.549> battery<00:01:44.939> life<00:01:45.210> so

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
estimations of our battery life so

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.719 
estimations of our battery life so
definitely<00:01:46.590> try<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.829> out<00:01:47.040> check<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.549> full

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
definitely try it out check out the full

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.609 
definitely try it out check out the full
article<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.270> link<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.930> application<00:01:49.079> is
