00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.300
 Infinity 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.450
 how is life in infinity that pass finite 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.529
 what is it that has the infinite others 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.489
 challenging 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:17.469
 today we are going to talk about the number of I want to present in society 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.489
 to a number that seems like they live the infinite the no 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.599
 stress that here with us 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:25.560
 is called 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.560
 the number 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.869
 let's assume cost has always those 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.030
 and that they can not lose a ball 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.940
 Rothenberg in Basque 100 percent interest per annum 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.670
 I can tell you what the ship is 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.180
 this system 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.460
 he deposits it and sits waiting for his house when the year passes you 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.710
 how much money has beard something that at 10 200 pesos 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.320
 100 pesos at 100 percent interest 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.060
 the deception has 200 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.350
 who however not and provide to be something else that would happen 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.959
 if I go and the bank and I ask the bank have to deposit the money 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:07.170
 for six months the same 100% interest the same I always know but in 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.210
 instead of waiting a year I went to the six months to retouch the capital plus the 

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.930
 interest 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.040
 when I go and I do not have how it was nothing more than if the car is fine is the 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.990
 half of the year 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.940
 I have always my originals 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.609
 massa now 50 pesos that half the interest 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:29.129
 then the 50 and the 150 I return to deposit the 150 when they passed others 

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:33.659
 six months that is to year old original version now how much money 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.460
 I have 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.079
 I have the 150 that I did not put 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.649
 again at 100 percent per year but nothing more than six months is 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.969
 say that I have to multiply by 1 points 5 how much money I have 225 pesos 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.799
 they do not realize what is convenient then not to do it once a year 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.890
 if it is not convenient to do it twice a year 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.930
 now clear 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.060
 I already did it once a year they gave me 200 pesos then twice a year 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.230
 225 and yet four times a year that is to say I go once per quarter 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:09.599
 What's up 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.700
 that what happens always at one hundred percent per year now counts according to 100 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.060
 pesos he waited three months then he recovered the interest he gives me for those 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.159
 three more months of capital and then to reinvest 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.680
 and waited six months but I repeat again 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.530
 and about nine months and a year how much money do I have one makes the account 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.890
 and discovers that he gives 244 comma with 41 cents 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.939
 more than 244 pesos 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.619
 that is to say if I put him a year instead of having 7 200 pesos 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:45.979
 I know what I can do in that sense the new one then they go back to each 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:51.029
 six touch him 225 leaves once every three months which left 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.590
 capitalizations four times in the year 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.590
 if it reaches 144 with 14 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:58.449
 for bernal 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.739
 now instead of doing it once a year twice a year four times per 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.289
 I want to do it once a month 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:05.870
 only once a month 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.390
 so I go to the bank 12 times in the year how much money I'm going to have 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.670
 excited because I think that at some point if I continue to do so I will get 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.650
 infinite however I realize that it goes once a year came to 261 with 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.330
 30 261 pesos 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.969
 eat 30 cents 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.149
 but of course a little more than that 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:30.059
 if I'm going to increase it that way I'm not going to go only once a year once per 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:31.129
 month to the bank 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.649
 what I'm going to do is that once a week 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:39.169
 I have 52 months to go and when I do it 52 times because I have money that 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.599
 exhibits the 269 pesos 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:43.540
 It is done 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.620
 instead of going once a week, live once a day, go up 365 months to 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.529
 Bank 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:53.379
 one has to exhibit 65 times to the bank 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.300
 you have to go every day the counselor is there 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.380
 but one imagine and if I keep doing it this way 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.639
 every time the amount of money that I'm going to make 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.010
 will allow you to work more 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.010
 it was only to the bank my job is to go to the bank 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.649
 goal with a better life 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:11.189
 and what happens is that at the end of the year 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:17.040
 I have a little more than the 171 pesos with 46 cents then 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.440
 it is true that I have more to write down so much more had started with 200 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.190
 soldiers 125 precious 144 pass by 265 but I the 171 and what happens if a 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.219
 once per hour 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:35.999
 even though the 271 as 81 and if once per minute because if there was not now 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:40.659
 way now I feel the bank was putting every minute they are always 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.889
 plus the interest during the amount of minutes that were already 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.889
 and he reached 2 171 as 82 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.800
 I'm not going to do it every second the bank I allow myself 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.380
 the idea is then that if I did not do it once per second 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.200
 Anyway, it does not exceed a lot more than 270 thousand pesos. It costs 82 cents and 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.860
 some fraction 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.180
 that is to say that even though it is almost instantaneously 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:14.099
 the money that I have at the end of the year no less great what I did if not 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.710
 could do it infinitely say at every moment of the year 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.830
 exceeds adt in ace the 271 with 82 81 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.009
 and when he does not talk about this little act to which the mining sector is approaching 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.300
 I'm presenting in society 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.620
 retail 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.780
 it seems once off
