00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.500
 I don't think anyone would expect to get up in the morning and find themselves in a war between two secret organizations. 

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.001
 I'm sure I'm not. But I'm still here. 

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:20.002
 On one side there are Templars, nowadays this company runs under the name Abstergo. They are dealing with business management. 

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:29.003
 Politics, economics, technology. Until then, they will not stop until each person serves them. Literally. 

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:35.004
 The Assassins, a determined group of people who fought for the freedom of the people, fought against them. 

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.005
 I fell in love with the brotherhood. 

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:45.506
 A few weeks ago, the Templars found me. They've been caught. They were tied to a machine they built and forced to work. 

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:51.507
 Called Animus. I spent most of my time here. Finding the memories of my ancestors 

00:00:52.308 --> 00:00:56.008
 to discover their entire life, which is locked into the depths of my DNA. 

00:00:56.709 --> 00:01:02.009
 I first lived the memories of Altair Ibn-La'Ahad, an Assassin from the Crusades. 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 The Templars wanted to know where to find something they know about Eden. It is an ancient relic that can direct people to their own will. 

00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:19.011
 Once they got what they were looking for, they decided that my usefulness was so great. But Lucy saved her. 

00:01:20.512 --> 00:01:25.012
 Lucy. When things started to turn to russia, he told me that he was an Assassin and helped me escape. 

00:01:26.413 --> 00:01:28.513
 I hoped my little adventures would end here. 

00:01:29.514 --> 00:01:33.014
 But it was just the beginning. I went back to another Animus. 

00:01:36.015 --> 00:01:43.015
 Now I am living with the memories of my Renaissance ancestor, Ezio Auditore da Firenze. 

00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:47.416
 I'm not just referred to as Assassin through the "bleeding" effect. 

00:01:48.017 --> 00:01:52.017
 I can also do well if the Templars are going to make us slave. 

00:01:53.018 --> 00:01:58.018
 They've found us. We broke into our hiding place and we felt at the moment that we needed to find a place to hide. 

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.019
 There was nothing to do and time was wasting. 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 My name is Desmond Miles, and that's my story. 

00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:05.021
