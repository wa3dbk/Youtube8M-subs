00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
we have character Monday Wednesday

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.210 
we have character Monday Wednesday
Friday<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:19.260> learned<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.710> bunch<00:00:19.740> of

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
Friday and we learned a bunch of

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.980 
Friday and we learned a bunch of
different<00:00:20.640> styles<00:00:20.789> which<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.539> really<00:00:21.930> fun

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
different styles which is really fun

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.529 
different styles which is really fun
actually<00:00:22.289> because<00:00:22.850> normally<00:00:23.850> character<00:00:24.480> you

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
actually because normally character you

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.679 
actually because normally character you
just<00:00:24.720> do<00:00:24.840> bar<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.500> then<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.539> got

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
just do bar and then that's it so we got

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.560 
just do bar and then that's it so we got
to<00:00:27.810> do<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> Russian<00:00:28.529> dance<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.609> Spanish

my<00:00:43.559> favorite<00:00:44.190> style<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.579> character<00:00:44.940> was

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
my favorite style of character was

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.380 
my favorite style of character was
probably<00:00:45.950> Russian<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.760> because<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.090> like

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
probably Russian just because it's like

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.850 
probably Russian just because it's like
a<00:00:48.539> being<00:00:48.809> really<00:00:49.230> fun

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
the Russian movement is very different

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.530 
the Russian movement is very different
from<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.830> classical<00:01:08.920> movement<00:01:09.640> like<00:01:09.880> there's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
from the classical movement like there's

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.510 
from the classical movement like there's
a<00:01:10.600> lot<00:01:10.750> of<00:01:10.780> things<00:01:10.930> turned<00:01:11.200> in<00:01:11.500> in<00:01:11.830> your

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
a lot of things turned in in your

character<00:01:12.940> shoes<00:01:13.090> for<00:01:13.330> one<00:01:13.450> so<00:01:13.690> you're<00:01:13.960> always

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
character shoes for one so you're always

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.110 
character shoes for one so you're always
like<00:01:14.380> on<00:01:14.560> flat<00:01:14.890> modes<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.430> time<00:01:15.610> there's<00:01:16.060> a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
like on flat modes the time there's a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
the whole style and technique of

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400 
the whole style and technique of
characters<00:01:24.880> extremely<00:01:25.840> different<00:01:26.050> from

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
characters extremely different from

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.219 
characters extremely different from
classical<00:01:27.280> being<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.270> character<00:01:28.630> class<00:01:28.810> and

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
classical being the character class and

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.260 
classical being the character class and

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
doing all this energetic dancing was is

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.360 
doing all this energetic dancing was is
really<00:01:32.229> hard<00:01:32.440> to<00:01:32.470> keep<00:01:32.650> our<00:01:32.800> energy<00:01:32.920> up<00:01:33.130> just

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
really hard to keep our energy up just

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.190 
really hard to keep our energy up just
cuz<00:01:33.490> it's<00:01:33.640> a<00:01:33.760> it<00:01:34.270> was<00:01:34.390> our<00:01:34.479> last<00:01:34.540> class<00:01:34.930> of<00:01:34.990> the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200

day<00:01:35.290> so<00:01:35.860> it<00:01:35.920> was<00:01:36.040> really<00:01:36.940> challenging<00:01:37.210> that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
day so it was really challenging that

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.999 
day so it was really challenging that
part<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:37.900> it<00:01:37.990> but<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.380> was<00:01:38.470> also<00:01:38.560> really<00:01:38.890> fun

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009

never<00:02:32.190> really<00:02:32.450> took<00:02:33.450> time<00:02:33.720> off<00:02:33.800> I'll<00:02:34.800> round<00:02:35.100> up

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
never really took time off I'll round up

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.370 
never really took time off I'll round up
timeout<00:02:35.640> off<00:02:35.820> at<00:02:36.030> least<00:02:36.240> so<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.900> just<00:02:37.170> didn't

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380
