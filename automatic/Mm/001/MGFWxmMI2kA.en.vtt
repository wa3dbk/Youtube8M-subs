00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.540 

okay<00:00:01.530> now<00:00:01.979> we're<00:00:02.100> going<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.250> talk<00:00:02.399> about

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
okay now we're going to talk about

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.039 
okay now we're going to talk about
bradycardia

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
bradycardia

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.579 
bradycardia
since<00:00:04.500> our<00:00:04.710> pals<00:00:05.009> 2010<00:00:05.690> bradycardia<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.899> when

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
since our pals 2010 bradycardia and when

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.930 
since our pals 2010 bradycardia and when
they<00:00:07.710> talk<00:00:07.890> about<00:00:07.919> bradycardia<00:00:08.670> they're

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
they talk about bradycardia they're

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.240 
they talk about bradycardia they're
talking<00:00:09.389> about<00:00:09.540> people<00:00:10.440> have<00:00:10.590> bradycardia

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
talking about people have bradycardia

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.450 
talking about people have bradycardia
and<00:00:11.460> cardio<00:00:12.120> respiratory<00:00:12.360> compromise<00:00:13.460> so

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
and cardio respiratory compromise so

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.359 
and cardio respiratory compromise so
they<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.759> pulse<00:00:15.089> but<00:00:15.570> they<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.470> poor

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
they have a pulse but they have poor

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.840 
they have a pulse but they have poor
perfusion<00:00:18.320> if<00:00:19.320> they<00:00:19.800> ever<00:00:20.010> lose<00:00:20.310> their<00:00:20.580> pulse

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
perfusion if they ever lose their pulse

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.840 
perfusion if they ever lose their pulse
then<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.270> need<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.570> go<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.730> to<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
then you need to go to the to the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.880 
then you need to go to the to the
algorithms<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:24.900> talk<00:00:25.170> about<00:00:25.410> pulseless

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
algorithms that talk about pulseless

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.670 
algorithms that talk about pulseless
arrest<00:00:26.750> now<00:00:27.750> you'll<00:00:28.050> remember<00:00:28.199> from<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:28.619> of

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
arrest now you'll remember from one of

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.990 
arrest now you'll remember from one of
the<00:00:28.740> other<00:00:28.859> videos<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.130> said<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> thing

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the other videos we said that the thing

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.940 
the other videos we said that the thing
that<00:00:30.150> often<00:00:30.330> causes<00:00:31.140> arrest<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.920> kids<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
that often causes arrest in kids is a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.580 
that often causes arrest in kids is a
pulmonary<00:00:34.950> arrest<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:36.030> they<00:00:36.870> say<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> first

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
pulmonary arrest so they say the first

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.139 
pulmonary arrest so they say the first
thing<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.829> want<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.219> identify<00:00:38.340> and

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
thing you want to do is identify and

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.700 
thing you want to do is identify and
treat<00:00:39.480> causes<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.989> take<00:00:42.989> care<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
treat causes and so take care of that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.920 
treat causes and so take care of that
airway<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.730> breathing<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.750> will

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
airway and that breathing and that will

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.560 
airway and that breathing and that will
hopefully<00:00:46.260> fix<00:00:47.070> things<00:00:47.430> while<00:00:48.180> you're<00:00:48.300> doing

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
hopefully fix things while you're doing

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.880 
hopefully fix things while you're doing
that<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.870> got<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.050> put<00:00:49.170> them<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.320> oxygen<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
that you got to put them on oxygen a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.520 
that you got to put them on oxygen a
cardiac<00:00:50.219> monitor<00:00:50.300> put<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.390> an<00:00:51.480> IV<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.050> get<00:00:52.440> an

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
cardiac monitor put in an IV and get an

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.279 
cardiac monitor put in an IV and get an
EKG<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.239> time<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:54.899> don't<00:00:55.050> waste

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
EKG if you have time but don't waste

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.650 
EKG if you have time but don't waste
time<00:00:55.530> doing<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.879> does<00:00:57.210> fix

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
time doing it now if that does fix

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.349 
time doing it now if that does fix
things<00:00:58.309> then<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.579> go<00:00:59.730> over<00:00:59.940> here<00:00:59.969> just

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
things then you go over here just

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.590 
things then you go over here just
support<00:01:01.289> ABCs<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.829> give<00:01:01.980> oxygen<00:01:02.390> observe<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
support ABCs to give oxygen observe and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.960 
support ABCs to give oxygen observe and
you<00:01:03.660> might<00:01:03.809> want<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> consult<00:01:04.739> expert<00:01:05.580> meaning

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
you might want to consult expert meaning

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.240 
you might want to consult expert meaning
maybe<00:01:06.600> admit<00:01:06.960> them<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.140> pedes<00:01:07.560> cardiology

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
maybe admit them and pedes cardiology

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.899 
maybe admit them and pedes cardiology
could<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.549> them<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:08.880> someone<00:01:09.479> else<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.490> if<00:01:11.490> it

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
could see them or someone else but if it

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.240 
could see them or someone else but if it
doesn't<00:01:12.299> get<00:01:12.689> fixed<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.250> cardiopulmonary

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
doesn't get fixed so cardiopulmonary

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.600 
doesn't get fixed so cardiopulmonary
compromise<00:01:15.210> continues<00:01:15.960> then<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.770> move<00:01:17.009> here

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
compromise continues then you move here

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.440 
compromise continues then you move here
and<00:01:19.070> they<00:01:20.070> define<00:01:20.520> cardiopulmonary

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
and they define cardiopulmonary

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.219 
and they define cardiopulmonary
compromise<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.299> low<00:01:24.630> blood<00:01:24.869> pressure

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
compromise here as a low blood pressure

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.050 
compromise here as a low blood pressure
altered<00:01:25.680> Mental<00:01:25.979> Status<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.430> shock<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.939> it's

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
altered Mental Status or shock and it's

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
altered Mental Status or shock and it's
actually<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.930> written<00:01:28.140> right<00:01:28.439> next<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
actually just written right next to it

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.840 
actually just written right next to it
so<00:01:29.970> right<00:01:30.600> there

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
so right there

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.580 
so right there
so<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.090> point<00:01:33.360> we've<00:01:33.750> addressed<00:01:34.380> her

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
so at this point we've addressed her

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.280 
so at this point we've addressed her
early<00:01:34.979> their<00:01:35.369> breathing<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.110> oh

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
early their breathing and we see that oh

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.160 
early their breathing and we see that oh
look<00:01:37.320> they're<00:01:37.860> still<00:01:38.430> compromised<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.960> come

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
look they're still compromised we come

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.050 
look they're still compromised we come
down<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:41.040> their<00:01:41.280> heart<00:01:41.490> rate<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.790> less

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
down here if their heart rate is less

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.240 
down here if their heart rate is less
than<00:01:42.119> 60<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.899> they're<00:01:43.020> compromised<00:01:43.770> then

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
than 60 and they're compromised then

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.600 
than 60 and they're compromised then
you're<00:01:44.340> gonna<00:01:44.430> want<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> start<00:01:45.000> CPR<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
you're gonna want to start CPR and

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.910 
you're gonna want to start CPR and
though<00:01:47.610> there's<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.939> diagram<00:01:48.530> doesn't<00:01:49.530> mention

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
though there's a diagram doesn't mention

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.880 
though there's a diagram doesn't mention
it<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.930> accompanying<00:01:51.930> manuscript<00:01:52.500> does<00:01:52.649> and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
it the accompanying manuscript does and

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.620 
it the accompanying manuscript does and
it<00:01:52.950> says<00:01:53.100> you're<00:01:53.310> gonna<00:01:53.399> want<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.729> CPR<00:01:54.000> for

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
it says you're gonna want to do CPR for

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.690 
it says you're gonna want to do CPR for
two<00:01:54.840> minutes<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.530> then<00:01:56.070> you're<00:01:56.219> gonna<00:01:56.310> check

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
two minutes and then you're gonna check

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.899 
two minutes and then you're gonna check
again<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.869> bradycardia<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:59.280> still

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
again to see if the bradycardia is still

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.709 
again to see if the bradycardia is still
going<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.920> does<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.240> then

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
going on and if it does if it is then

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.410 
going on and if it does if it is then
you're<00:02:03.869> gonna<00:02:03.960> want<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.320> give<00:02:04.439> epinephrine

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
you're gonna want to give epinephrine

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.210 
you're gonna want to give epinephrine
and<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:07.110> we<00:02:07.259> talked<00:02:07.500> about<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.920> drugs

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
and as we talked about in the drugs

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.029 
and as we talked about in the drugs
lecture<00:02:08.729> there's<00:02:09.270> two<00:02:09.479> doses<00:02:09.959> there's<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.379> IV

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
lecture there's two doses there's the IV

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.080 
lecture there's two doses there's the IV
and<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> ioad

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
and the ioad

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.840 
and the ioad
and<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:12.900> there's<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.319> endotracheal<00:02:14.220> those

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
and then there's the endotracheal those

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.720 
and then there's the endotracheal those
which<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.209> 10<00:02:15.569> times<00:02:15.900> more<00:02:16.410> other<00:02:17.250> drugs<00:02:17.610> that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
which is 10 times more other drugs that

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.410 
which is 10 times more other drugs that
you<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:18.000> consider<00:02:18.330> giving<00:02:18.930> are<00:02:20.090> atropine<00:02:21.090> and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
you can consider giving are atropine and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.120 
you can consider giving are atropine and
again<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:21.870> give<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.020> IV<00:02:22.410> or<00:02:22.560> IO<00:02:22.590> and

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
again you can give that IV or IO and

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.150 
again you can give that IV or IO and
here's<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.850> dose<00:02:24.120> 20<00:02:24.450> micrograms<00:02:24.840> per<00:02:25.530> kilo<00:02:26.010> or

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
here's a dose 20 micrograms per kilo or

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.190 
here's a dose 20 micrograms per kilo or
point<00:02:26.610> zero<00:02:27.569> two<00:02:28.020> milligrams<00:02:28.770> per<00:02:29.100> kilo<00:02:29.520> and

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
point zero two milligrams per kilo and

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.270 
point zero two milligrams per kilo and
you<00:02:31.200> remember<00:02:31.470> we're<00:02:31.590> gonna<00:02:31.680> get<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.890> minimum

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
you remember we're gonna get the minimum

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.280 
you remember we're gonna get the minimum
dose<00:02:32.640> because<00:02:33.239> if<00:02:33.360> we<00:02:33.450> don't<00:02:33.660> if<00:02:33.750> we<00:02:33.840> give<00:02:33.959> less

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
dose because if we don't if we give less

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.410 
dose because if we don't if we give less
than<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.830> then<00:02:35.520> we<00:02:35.670> could<00:02:35.819> have<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:36.000> paradox

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
than this then we could have a paradox

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
than this then we could have a paradox
or<00:02:36.540> bradycardia<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.350> then<00:02:37.800> also<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:39.440> maximum

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
or bradycardia and then also a maximum

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.559 
or bradycardia and then also a maximum
single<00:02:40.860> dose<00:02:41.010> listed<00:02:41.430> here<00:02:41.550> 0.5<00:02:42.060> milligrams

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
single dose listed here 0.5 milligrams

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.780 
single dose listed here 0.5 milligrams
which<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.810> what<00:02:42.959> we're<00:02:43.080> now<00:02:43.260> called<00:02:43.890> giving<00:02:44.640> to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
which is what we're now called giving to

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.699 
which is what we're now called giving to
adults<00:02:45.030> as<00:02:45.269> well<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:46.019> let's<00:02:46.230> say<00:02:46.350> you've<00:02:46.440> given

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
adults as well so let's say you've given

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.290 
adults as well so let's say you've given
FP<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.160> you've<00:02:47.280> given<00:02:47.519> atropine<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.150> that

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
FP and you've given atropine and that

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.210 
FP and you've given atropine and that
doesn't<00:02:48.690> work<00:02:48.810> what<00:02:49.380> do<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.500> try<00:02:49.709> next<00:02:49.950> well

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
doesn't work what do you try next well

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.410 
doesn't work what do you try next well
you<00:02:50.730> could<00:02:50.880> try<00:02:51.060> transthoracic<00:02:51.870> pacing<00:02:53.420> or

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
you could try transthoracic pacing or

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.120 
you could try transthoracic pacing or
even<00:02:54.660> transvenous<00:02:55.110> pacing<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:55.830> if<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:55.980> have<00:02:56.100> a

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
even transvenous pacing so if I have a

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.059 
even transvenous pacing so if I have a
patient<00:02:56.340> whose<00:02:56.670> bradycardic<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.959> not<00:02:58.680> yet

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
patient whose bradycardic and not yet

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.400 
patient whose bradycardic and not yet
unstable<00:03:00.000> what<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.180> often<00:03:00.480> do<00:03:00.600> is<00:03:00.630> put<00:03:01.290> the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
unstable what I often do is put the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.440 
unstable what I often do is put the
pacer<00:03:01.800> pads<00:03:01.830> on<00:03:02.280> him<00:03:02.310> just<00:03:02.819> so<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:02.940> got<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.300> there

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
pacer pads on him just so I got it there

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.870 
pacer pads on him just so I got it there
just<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:03.900> case<00:03:03.930> because<00:03:04.920> when<00:03:05.760> they're

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
just in case because when they're

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.640 
just in case because when they're
unstable<00:03:06.420> that's<00:03:06.540> not<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.900> best<00:03:07.140> time<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.500> put

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
unstable that's not the best time to put

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.170 
unstable that's not the best time to put
it<00:03:07.739> on<00:03:07.860> but<00:03:08.069> if<00:03:08.190> if<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:08.700> don't<00:03:08.850> have<00:03:09.030> the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
it on but if if you don't have the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.180 
it on but if if you don't have the
choice<00:03:09.420> then<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:10.500> then<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.920> could<00:03:11.100> try

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
choice then just then you could try

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.580 
choice then just then you could try
transthoracic<00:03:11.730> pacing<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.540> put<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.840> pacer

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
transthoracic pacing and put the pacer

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.729 
transthoracic pacing and put the pacer
pads<00:03:13.620> right<00:03:14.069> on<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:15.209> pacing<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.290> particularly

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
pads right on and pacing is particularly

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.039 
pads right on and pacing is particularly
effective<00:03:17.459> for<00:03:17.670> patients<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.540> third-degree

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
effective for patients in third-degree

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.060 
effective for patients in third-degree
heart<00:03:19.260> block<00:03:19.910> or<00:03:21.019> sinus<00:03:22.019> node<00:03:22.070> dysfunction

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
heart block or sinus node dysfunction

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.479 
heart block or sinus node dysfunction
and<00:03:24.060> then<00:03:24.780> we're<00:03:24.930> talking<00:03:25.110> again<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.950> patients

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
and then we're talking again of patients

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.850 
and then we're talking again of patients
who<00:03:26.579> are<00:03:26.670> not<00:03:27.000> responding<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.840> their<00:03:28.620> wind

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
who are not responding to their wind

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.660 
who are not responding to their wind
breathing<00:03:29.660> now<00:03:30.660> pacing<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.320> not<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:32.100> helpful

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
breathing now pacing is not so helpful

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.310 
breathing now pacing is not so helpful
in<00:03:32.850> patients<00:03:33.390> with<00:03:34.370> asystole<00:03:35.370> or<00:03:36.360> cardiac

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.240 
in patients with asystole or cardiac
ischemia<00:03:37.850> but<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:39.570> mean<00:03:40.350> if<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.500> don't<00:03:40.709> know<00:03:40.950> I

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
ischemia but I mean if you don't know I

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.560 
ischemia but I mean if you don't know I
would<00:03:41.519> probably<00:03:41.850> just<00:03:41.940> go<00:03:42.000> ahead<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.420> pay

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
would probably just go ahead and pay

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.210 
would probably just go ahead and pay
some<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.079> works<00:03:43.260> great<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:43.829> doesn't

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
some and if it works great if it doesn't

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.759 
some and if it works great if it doesn't
well<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.390> does<00:03:45.570> it's<00:03:45.959> not<00:03:46.019> gonna<00:03:46.290> work<00:03:46.530> but

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
well it does it's not gonna work but

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.849 
well it does it's not gonna work but
it's<00:03:47.010> better<00:03:47.160> than<00:03:47.250> not<00:03:47.519> trying<00:03:48.260> so<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.410> review

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
it's better than not trying so in review

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.340 
it's better than not trying so in review
if<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.549> patient<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.239> breda<00:03:51.690> kartik<00:03:52.170> and

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
if the patient is breda kartik and

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.259 
if the patient is breda kartik and
they're<00:03:52.440> unstable<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.820> remember<00:03:54.239> that

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
they're unstable and you remember that

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.289 
they're unstable and you remember that
unstable<00:03:55.079> means<00:03:55.609> that<00:03:56.609> they<00:03:56.730> have<00:03:56.850> low<00:03:57.060> blood

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
unstable means that they have low blood

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.390 
unstable means that they have low blood
pressure<00:03:57.690> altered<00:03:58.290> Mental<00:03:58.680> Status<00:03:58.709> or<00:03:59.250> other

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
signs of poor perfusion like shock then

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
airway and breathing because that's

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.050 
airway and breathing because that's
usually<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:06.420> cause<00:04:06.690> in<00:04:07.109> kids<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:08.400> you're

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
gonna do our typical IR mantra IV o2

gonna do our typical IR mantra IV o2
monitor<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.200> get<00:04:13.799> an<00:04:13.920> EKG<00:04:14.220> if<00:04:14.519> you<00:04:14.670> can<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.470> if

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
monitor and get an EKG if you can and if

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.699 
monitor and get an EKG if you can and if
they're<00:04:16.709> still<00:04:17.070> unstable<00:04:17.900> you're<00:04:18.900> gonna<00:04:19.079> do<00:04:19.320> 2

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
they're still unstable you're gonna do 2

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.210 
they're still unstable you're gonna do 2
minutes<00:04:20.159> of<00:04:20.459> CPR<00:04:20.849> before<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.810> check<00:04:22.049> again

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
minutes of CPR before you check again

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.649 
minutes of CPR before you check again
can<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.250> tell<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.760> love<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.180> circular

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
can you tell that I love that circular

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:25.250 
can you tell that I love that circular

so<00:04:25.800> after<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.280> two<00:04:26.490> minutes<00:04:26.790> of<00:04:26.880> CPR<00:04:27.660> if

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
so after the two minutes of CPR if

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.510 
so after the two minutes of CPR if
they're<00:04:28.140> still<00:04:28.530> unstable<00:04:29.220> then<00:04:29.340> you're<00:04:29.430> gonna

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
they're still unstable then you're gonna

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.790 
they're still unstable then you're gonna
give<00:04:29.700> your<00:04:29.790> epi<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.630> you'll<00:04:31.440> probably<00:04:31.530> be

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
give your epi and you'll probably be

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.740 
give your epi and you'll probably be
continuing<00:04:32.340> CPR<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.270> they<00:04:33.390> don't<00:04:33.540> mention

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
continuing CPR so they don't mention

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.000 
continuing CPR so they don't mention
that<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:34.080> have<00:04:34.170> to<00:04:34.200> do<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.500> like<00:04:34.620> they<00:04:34.770> didn't

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
that you have to do it like they didn't

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.370 
that you have to do it like they didn't
need<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.700> pulseless<00:04:36.210> arrest<00:04:36.360> but<00:04:37.230> you're

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
need the pulseless arrest but you're

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.100 
need the pulseless arrest but you're
gonna<00:04:37.530> give<00:04:38.490> up<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.730> first<00:04:39.030> do<00:04:39.270> CPR<00:04:39.780> then<00:04:39.960> give

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
gonna give up you first do CPR then give

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.600 
gonna give up you first do CPR then give
atropine<00:04:40.560> they<00:04:40.770> don't<00:04:40.920> really<00:04:41.010> say<00:04:41.250> that<00:04:41.430> but

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
atropine they don't really say that but

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.520 
atropine they don't really say that but
that's<00:04:42.450> kind<00:04:42.540> of<00:04:42.870> how<00:04:42.960> they're<00:04:43.080> laying<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.410> out

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
that's kind of how they're laying it out

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.150 
that's kind of how they're laying it out
and<00:04:44.010> if<00:04:44.340> atropine<00:04:44.820> doesn't<00:04:45.180> work<00:04:45.300> then<00:04:45.900> try

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
and if atropine doesn't work then try

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.000 
and if atropine doesn't work then try
pacing<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.600> that's<00:04:48.600> it<00:04:49.050> for<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.620> bradycardia

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
pacing and that's it for the bradycardia

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.660 
pacing and that's it for the bradycardia
and<00:04:52.100> so<00:04:53.100> I'll<00:04:53.580> see<00:04:53.940> you<00:04:54.030> at<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.300> next<00:04:54.420> video
