00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.820
 good kids very good how about here 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.090
 we are in a new black gameplay 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.039
 ops 2 this time is not the world time like 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.179
 You see, I'm taking out the diamond m8 and 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.410
 I'm entering a number by teams 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.959
 in which if you have fixed we had 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.080
 losing 14 to 35 and I got into the 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.970
 game and now you will see magic happens more 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.949
 I have done that I entered the command and all 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.019
 inside pal command and the magic happens but 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.119
 good to what I wanted to comment we are going 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.339
 to see I have to tell you simply what 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.900
 first and first of all thank you for 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.210
 really very much 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.200
 the support you are all showing to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.489
 while the world is the truth is that I do not 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.410
 I was waiting for nothing after I had 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.329
 come out the ghost I know that many I 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.829
 he asked and not but still there are times that you 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.600
 you try to make a series the people what 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.920
 ask and then you get the first 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.360
 episode sees everyone in the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.190
 second I miss him and in the third he goes 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.690
 seeing the least and such but broken with the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.980
 it's true that he's not starting and before 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.539
 nothing because I wanted to thank you 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.489
 I'm uploading a video every day 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.690
 so good you have the pegadito channel 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.399
 of the current 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.710
 another thing that I wanted to comment you I put 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.739
 for my twitter and facebook that I was going to 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.929
 do a live show I did not say when but that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.119
 I was going to do a live show and I did not say 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.740
 that then I've been looking at the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.100
 videos the last direct ones that I have done 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.439
 and all 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.759
 above all for people to 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.729
 have clear you know that I can not do 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.409
 direct in hd know they are in 480 thing 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.000
 which for many is good but for others 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.070
 It's bad because it's good because 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.690
 many do not have a connection that 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.899
 say very good, more or less like the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.850
 mine then you can not download 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.320
 the videos in 720 when you're doing 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.299
 a live will be cut and it's a 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.450
 no problem in 480 because it looks good it looks 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.100
 it depends and you can see it all but 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.070
 when it is resolved it is also summarized in 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.299
 480 then it's a fucking diet but it's 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.670
 what's in the direct you already know that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.670
 that works like that so nothing I have not 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.190
 said but it will be a direct from black ops 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.530
 2 we will play league mode here on the channel and 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.140
 It will be on Wednesday at 9 pm 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.750
 Spanish time I do not know what time it will be Mexico 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.399
 good in all south america I do not know what time 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.830
 it will be so that you can watch it by google 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.920
 there are many of these from different areas 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.479
 times where you can see then that now 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.020
 will be your country but what will be said will be 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.630
 21:00 on Wednesday of this week the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.860
 direct league of whites so 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.510
 it simply remains that you would have 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.730
 They wanted me to also thank you 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.780
 especially very much the support that is 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.909
 just as I really did not expect it 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.379
 for absolutely nothing that by the way 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.700
 there are still a few things left 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.299
 happen that you have seen what is happening 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.480
 everything about everything is happening around 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.120
 but there is still the best to come 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.680
 I would say and that you will molar enough 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.480
 that is something that I like to get me out on 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.670
 many uboldi robots that I am already 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.890
 shitting saying too much so good 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.170
 I told you guys on Wednesday at 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.890

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.650

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.180
 Beige 5656 Super Match Draw 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.980
 but I already had spurts me 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.440
 has already removed the dogs in the living 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.660
 I had it and everything under control could be 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.849
 say and the truth that we go back the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.190
 He started with a waning of 20 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.750
 and peak I tried to go for the nuclear and such 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.069
 but they killed me and thank goodness to take me out 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.430
 the streak because if we had not caught 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.450
 water safe so nothing about the said 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.489
 thank you 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.959

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.239
 twitter or whatever you will have there 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.160
