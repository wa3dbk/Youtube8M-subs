energy out but there's a lot of heavy
energetic<00:02:37.370> songs<00:02:37.640> but<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.240> message<00:02:38.510> within

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
energetic songs but the message within

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.480 
energetic songs but the message within
the<00:02:38.990> songs<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.620> know<00:02:39.710> you're<00:02:39.920> going<00:02:40.160> down<00:02:40.310> is

the songs you know you're going down is

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.370 
the songs you know you're going down is
probably<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.850> heaviest<00:02:41.060> most<00:02:41.900> effective

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
probably the heaviest most effective

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.870 
probably the heaviest most effective
song<00:02:42.620> which<00:02:43.310> would<00:02:43.460> probably<00:02:43.700> be<00:02:43.760> the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
song which would probably be the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.250 
song which would probably be the
exception<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.420> rule<00:02:44.510> which<00:02:45.050> is<00:02:45.140> ironic

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
exception to the rule which is ironic

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.900 
exception to the rule which is ironic
because<00:02:45.500> it's<00:02:45.860> my<00:02:45.950> most<00:02:46.250> successful<00:02:46.400> some<00:02:46.850> of
