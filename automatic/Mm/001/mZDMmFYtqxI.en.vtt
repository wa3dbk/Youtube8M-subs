when we started the first mass effect we

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.450 
when we started the first mass effect we
certainly<00:00:32.379> hope<00:00:32.710> that<00:00:32.770> it<00:00:32.980> would<00:00:33.040> become<00:00:33.309> this

huge exciting new science fiction
property<00:00:37.719> and<00:00:37.899> I<00:00:38.559> think<00:00:38.800> that's<00:00:38.950> what's

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
property and I think that's what's

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.610 
property and I think that's what's
happened<00:00:39.730> I<00:00:39.789> think<00:00:39.820> there's<00:00:40.239> a<00:00:40.300> huge<00:00:41.109> fan<00:00:41.409> base

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
happened I think there's a huge fan base

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.899 
happened I think there's a huge fan base
of<00:00:41.859> millions<00:00:42.129> of<00:00:42.190> people<00:00:42.249> out<00:00:42.489> there<00:00:42.550> who<00:00:42.879> are

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909 
of millions of people out there who are
