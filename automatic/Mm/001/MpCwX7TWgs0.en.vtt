colonies all around the world what's

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.809 
colonies all around the world what's
happening<00:03:11.319> here<00:03:11.709> with<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.069> Cape<00:03:12.280> fur<00:03:12.519> seals

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
happening here with the Cape fur seals

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.459 
happening here with the Cape fur seals
is<00:03:12.969> different<00:03:13.359> it's<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.900> number<00:03:14.139> of<00:03:14.260> seals

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:14.469 
is different it's the number of seals

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.839 
is different it's the number of seals
it's<00:03:14.769> one<00:03:14.859> of<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.040> largest<00:03:15.310> ones<00:03:15.579> are<00:03:15.730> on

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
it's one of the largest ones are on

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.319 
it's one of the largest ones are on
another<00:03:16.030> speed<00:03:16.450> up<00:03:16.569> to<00:03:16.719> 60,000<00:03:17.409> I<00:03:18.329> should

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
another speed up to 60,000 I should

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.670 
another speed up to 60,000 I should
leave<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.599> island<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:19.989> goes<00:03:20.019> from<00:03:20.409> shallow

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
leave the island it goes from shallow

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.979 
leave the island it goes from shallow
water<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.400> deeply<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.450> seals<00:03:22.719> have<00:03:22.900> to

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
water to deeply so the seals have to

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.929 
water to deeply so the seals have to
cross<00:03:23.230> over<00:03:23.530> this<00:03:23.650> channel<00:03:23.859> area<00:03:24.189> and<00:03:24.730> that's

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
cross over this channel area and that's

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.280 
cross over this channel area and that's
when<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.180> volume<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:25.719> shocks<00:03:26.019> are

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
when the volume of the shocks are

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.250 
when the volume of the shocks are
cruising<00:03:26.769> waiting<00:03:27.689> now<00:03:28.689> why<00:03:28.900> are<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.079> cross

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
cruising waiting now why are the cross

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.809 
cruising waiting now why are the cross
in<00:03:29.469> the<00:03:29.530> water<00:03:29.739> they<00:03:30.189> have<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.400> go<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.609> feed

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
in the water they have to go and feed

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.580 
in the water they have to go and feed
they<00:03:31.000> know<00:03:31.150> they<00:03:31.269> stage'<00:03:31.599> but<00:03:31.870> hungers<00:03:32.379> are

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
they know they stage' but hungers are

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.439 
they know they stage' but hungers are
the<00:03:32.739> driving<00:03:32.949> affect<00:03:33.370> foods<00:03:33.819> outside<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.299> bay

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
the driving affect foods outside the bay

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.030 
the driving affect foods outside the bay
so<00:03:35.079> they<00:03:35.139> better<00:03:35.290> run<00:03:35.439> engorge<00:03:35.739> there<00:03:35.889> pretty

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
so they better run engorge there pretty

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.059 
so they better run engorge there pretty
much<00:03:36.099> every<00:03:36.430> day<00:03:37.199> we've<00:03:38.199> got<00:03:38.290> an<00:03:38.500> area<00:03:38.680> we<00:03:38.859> call

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
much every day we've got an area we call

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.979 
much every day we've got an area we call
the<00:03:39.189> killing<00:03:39.459> zone<00:03:39.669> the<00:03:39.939> ring<00:03:40.060> of<00:03:40.180> peril<00:03:40.480> the

the killing zone the ring of peril the
ring<00:03:41.109> of<00:03:41.230> death<00:03:41.409> basically<00:03:41.739> that's<00:03:42.219> the<00:03:42.280> most

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
ring of death basically that's the most

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.170

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
of the killers know if any morning most

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.580 
of the killers know if any morning most
of<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.389> attacks<00:03:46.750> in<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.079> ring<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.379> death

of the attacks in the ring of death

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.559 
of the attacks in the ring of death

Sharks cruise the deaths waiting for the

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.550 
Sharks cruise the deaths waiting for the
seals<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.329> swim<00:03:55.569> across<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:56.079> channel<00:03:56.349> and

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
seals to swim across the channel and

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.920 
seals to swim across the channel and
then<00:03:57.489> rocketing<00:03:58.269> straight<00:03:58.569> up<00:03:58.720> from<00:03:58.900> the

then rocketing straight up from the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.490 
then rocketing straight up from the
bottom<00:03:59.319> they<00:03:59.769> strike<00:04:01.169> definitely<00:04:02.169> one<00:04:02.290> place

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
bottom they strike definitely one place

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.839 
bottom they strike definitely one place
you<00:04:02.650> don't<00:04:02.739> want<00:04:02.919> to<00:04:02.979> go<00:04:03.069> swimming<00:04:03.129> this<00:04:03.639> is

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
you don't want to go swimming this is

you don't want to go swimming this is
probably<00:04:04.120> one<00:04:04.269> of<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.449> last<00:04:04.569> places<00:04:04.780> in<00:04:05.079> or<00:04:05.229> do

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
probably one of the last places in or do

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.280 
probably one of the last places in or do
you<00:04:05.470> want<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.680> go<00:04:05.769> swimming<00:04:06.009> I<00:04:06.159> think<00:04:06.340> there

now
yeah<00:04:09.849> then<00:04:10.090> go<00:04:10.180> check<00:04:10.419> on<00:04:10.569> this<00:04:10.659> guy<00:04:10.750> hope

yeah then go check on this guy hope

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.240 
yeah then go check on this guy hope
you'll<00:04:11.259> get<00:04:11.409> it<00:04:11.500> up

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.439 

now<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.310> see<00:04:17.489> this<00:04:17.609> little<00:04:17.880> group<00:04:18.090> of<00:04:18.269> first

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
now you see this little group of first

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:19.310 
now you see this little group of first
Hills<00:04:18.720> right<00:04:18.930> here

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
Hills right here

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.590 
Hills right here
that's<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.459> launch<00:04:20.699> pad<00:04:21.000> that's<00:04:21.299> where<00:04:21.479> they

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
that's the launch pad that's where they

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.300 
that's the launch pad that's where they
stage<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.320> get<00:04:22.440> ready<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.770> light<00:04:22.919> going<00:04:23.130> out

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
stage and get ready to light going out

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.960 
stage and get ready to light going out
so<00:04:23.520> they<00:04:23.669> can<00:04:23.820> feed

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
so they can feed

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.060 
so they can feed
what<00:04:26.510> they<00:04:26.630> say<00:04:26.840> is<00:04:27.050> that<00:04:27.080> once<00:04:27.500> this<00:04:27.740> group

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
what they say is that once this group

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.890 
what they say is that once this group
starts<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.640> lead<00:04:28.880> if<00:04:29.180> they<00:04:29.360> all<00:04:29.510> send<00:04:29.780> get

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
starts to lead if they all send get

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.900 
starts to lead if they all send get
attacked<00:04:30.200> by<00:04:30.440> a<00:04:30.470> shark<00:04:30.560> another<00:04:31.520> group<00:04:31.760> will

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
attacked by a shark another group will

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.400 
attacked by a shark another group will
go<00:04:32.030> ahead<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.360> dash<00:04:32.570> off<00:04:32.870> another<00:04:33.200> direction

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.750 

it<00:04:39.410> looks<00:04:39.590> like<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.830> natural<00:04:40.010> predations<00:04:40.610> are

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
it looks like the natural predations are

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.610 
it looks like the natural predations are
slowing<00:04:41.000> down<00:04:41.300> so<00:04:41.870> let's<00:04:42.020> go<00:04:42.140> ahead<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.470> tow<00:04:42.590> a

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
slowing down so let's go ahead and tow a

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.380 
slowing down so let's go ahead and tow a
decoy<00:04:43.100> here<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.520> see<00:04:43.640> if<00:04:43.730> we<00:04:43.760> can't<00:04:44.060> get<00:04:44.180> some

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
decoy here and see if we can't get some

taking<00:07:53.950> a<00:07:54.010> larger<00:07:54.370> decoy<00:07:54.790> how<00:07:55.270> do<00:07:55.330> we<00:07:55.480> tote<00:07:55.690> it

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 
taking a larger decoy how do we tote it

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.270 
taking a larger decoy how do we tote it
by<00:07:55.960> itself<00:07:56.320> behind<00:07:56.650> the<00:07:56.830> boat<00:07:57.010> I<00:07:59.040> mean<00:08:00.040> they

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280
