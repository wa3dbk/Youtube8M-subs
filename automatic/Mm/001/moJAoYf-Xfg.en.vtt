moment seasons of skyrim seems to be the
number<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.780> probable<00:00:43.620> winner<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
number one the probable winner so to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.630 
number one the probable winner so to
speak<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> mb's<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.320> tried<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:47.610> i

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.069 
would like to try some others and see
how<00:00:49.739> they<00:00:49.890> go<00:00:50.039> as<00:00:50.250> well<00:00:50.430> i'm<00:00:50.700> anticipating<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
will be a little easier to test now got

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.590 
will be a little easier to test now got
the<00:00:55.170> sort<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.500> hang<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.390> i'll<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.420> able

the sort of hang of it and i'll be able

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.010 
the sort of hang of it and i'll be able
to<00:00:57.780> test<00:00:58.050> more<00:00:58.440> en<00:00:58.829> BS<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.550> a<00:01:00.030> shorter<00:01:00.989> time

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
to test more en BS in a shorter time

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.210 
to test more en BS in a shorter time
