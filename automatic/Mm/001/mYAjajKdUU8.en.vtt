 [Applause] 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.850
 okra and partly because of the penalty kick used 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.670
 alcohol alcohol 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.109
 PSV won the Europa Cup in that year 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.090
 at least it was for me 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.390
 highlight and that year that I have come 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.180

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.100
 very good team 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.210
 I had what I suffered from one of one 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.440
 groin injury 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.190
 he jerked the came i had right away 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.230
 operated and that is also possible one 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.160
 been with people for half a year 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.640

 on and off say injury came and that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.180
 In fact, in one and a half years I was the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.250
 I actually played PSV 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.510
 always been then it was the beginning it was 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.850
 with injury the other time it was 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.770
 sunny injury but was a bit in it 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.170
 the basis from the basis and yes the fact that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.369
 that we then reached the final and the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.560
 penalties 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.780
 and that I do my bit 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.780
 have worn yes that the voices Mr TV 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.070
 zipper 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.960
 jansen 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.790
 [Applause] 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.250
 and anton janssen was such a delicious one 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:36.000
 big striker with especially nice goals 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:40.040
 [Applause] 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.560
 I sail civil rights for 25 minutes 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.180
 and from the head of my craftsman 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.100
 nice goals as winning ring as 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.780
 player of psv but what are the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.619
 memories of antoine janssen 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.420
 as a trainer of psv young psv 4 very beautiful 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.310
 had years and 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.990
 once the cup with Young PSV at once 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.530
 national champion red 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.360
 and yes very beautiful years with very 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.300
 have fun working also very educational 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.700
 yes yes because if you have a promise team 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.650
 below you then you will come with 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.090
 all facets of it 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.580
 you will have to deal with the trainers profession 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.290
 with the peddles set the players with 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.990
 with with talented young players 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.050
 players players who know through to you 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.320
 you never actually know on Monday 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.780
 actually which group you have was so yes 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.400
 that is a very educational period and 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.230
 were also successes as a trainer of psv 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.530
 here in 2010 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.560
 the national championship with young psv 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.540
 so temptation from anton janssen 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.050
 jansen played two years earlier with 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.210
 young psv calculated against young nec de 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.210
 final to be the better for promise teams 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.580
 so nice game with here and that point 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.580
 from ismaÃ¯l aissati 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.030
 Match Cymbal Final would eventually 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.290
 be decided only by the might 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.030
 a little bit 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.770
 order the number of people who do so 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.680
 gradually old 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.590
 to his coaching career young psv fc 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.540
 oss and then and is in my life 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.940
 that seems like a very tempting career 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.340
 I think look I do n't have it 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.780
 chosen the way of gradualism 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.850
 to follow but that is it that 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.739
 walked the way and that also has 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.989
 to make myself and to my character 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.910
 and there are also very different ones 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.790
 examples conceivable 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.769
 movie that has then from one after the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.060
 first to good is seedorf 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.060
 of course a very recent example 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.030
 koeman and actually you who is she who 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.430
 started immediately with vitesse so there too 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.340
 very different examples shit yes lies 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.459
 what your character they what 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.440
 chances are there for you faster 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.090
 no because it was not with me and the pass 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.380
 which we pass on my character is no longer 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.230
 a way as it has gone 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.230
 and I am very satisfied with sweet 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.810
 well 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.430
 a trainer who focuses on content 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.820
 actually involves job and I mean 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.580
 it measures the way of playing football 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:13.030
 a calm trainer I think so 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.440
 clearly state your limits and where 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.890
 good way to play football 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:26.290
 that combined with result well 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:28.419
 that's it it's very important and there 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.560
 is there two people nice and not 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:39.130
 offside while the rest are meters 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:43.120
 space has viewed header and then stand 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.580
 two wishes and remained in the back 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.800
 in lazio and then it is not offside 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.410
 whose score is antoine janssen in european 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.240
 connection against FC postage 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.849
 jansen 30 play in the premier league 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.680
 PSV matches scored four goals 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:00.669
 but anton janssen also scored against psv 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.210
 possibility of there is a maybe 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.210
 what to do back 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.590
 this was in the 85 86 season 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.270
 then a few years later season 94 95 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.210
 anton janssen again the beautiful goal 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.000
 in the goffert against psv 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.520
 match that would end two and two 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.690
 militia in 1999 2000 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.690
 this goal from anton janssen 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.650
 it made sense that you were here 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.600
 head coach would be the nrc you are 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.520
 I already feel comfortable with that 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.810
 child of the club that started back then 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.080
 as a professional football 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.760
 it made sense well on i got it or it 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.950
 Logical like but I will be disappointed 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.280
 if they didn't ask me 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.970
 had 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.770
 And yes well that has to be too 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.440
 dealing with your own hill or you or you 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.090
 ready to go yes than he and with 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.760
 circumstances of course 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.240
 and then were lucky lucky 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.250
 asked 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.630
 yes I have not as easy to train 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.820
 that also applies to filip you have 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.190
 do not maintain contact with each other 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.020
 no i have you more so well i know there 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.910
 is too i know i did a lot of a crash 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.180
 I know not dilate Philip Carey 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.560
 good but good if you contact us about it 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.990
 I think everyone should be up 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.130
 own way and you always have 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.840
 people in your area and where you where you 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.390
 times something and asks or consulted me 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.590
 or who can provide feedback 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.270
 anton janssen does not have it easy 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.700
 in nijmegen nec is tough 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.550
 relegation need and to this trainer the 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.820
 job to nec this season in the premier league 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.430
 to keep then this weekend the 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.200
 match in nijmegen against psv at that 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.420
 must go for anton janssen in special 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.190
 match are then think so well then 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.520
 It is also the first time he has us 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.890
 play against psv and well then it is 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.560
 been again before but that was 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.720
 my young psv against psv it was then that 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.770
 cup sure for the bra yes but good it 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.050
 is that it is another capacity 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.340
 ok but what does it mean this is 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.920
 different 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.140
 yes absolutely to you though good that i can give you 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.070
 say it 's that it's a match like 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.840
 all other is 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.790
 naturally and against psv what and when 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.800
 great team but also because you then 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.200
 have a past and 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.690
 and I worked as a player on as a trainer 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.250
 and I had a good time yes 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:20.110
 it is of course a special one 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:23.720
 game but it doesn't take away from it 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.980
 only three points too 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.830
 to distribute to ordinary professor 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.560
 professional for yes yes you have to be there 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.750
 also guaranteeing things that is the best 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.130
 to get that to that match that way 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.880
 approach and found that will be one 

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.950
 naturally difficult competition 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.130
 considering the qualities of pc 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:45.260
 also seen the shape of psv on this 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.810
 For the moment a lot goes on every time 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.700
 counted times better 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.540
 but does not mean that we certainly do field 

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.540
 definitely have a chance
