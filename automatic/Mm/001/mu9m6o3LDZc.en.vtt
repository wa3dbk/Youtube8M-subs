00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
in between the exposure behind that

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.610 
in between the exposure behind that
exposed<00:04:31.370> shock<00:04:31.640> there<00:04:32.080> even<00:04:33.080> pull<00:04:33.260> on<00:04:33.410> it

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
exposed shock there even pull on it

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.220 
exposed shock there even pull on it
tugging<00:04:33.920> on<00:04:33.980> it<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:34.750> it's<00:04:35.750> not<00:04:35.840> going<00:04:36.050> to<00:04:36.110> come

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
out so there's probably honest it gonna

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.620 
out so there's probably honest it gonna
be<00:04:38.360> no<00:04:38.480> need<00:04:38.660> for<00:04:38.720> tying<00:04:39.140> it<00:04:39.260> down<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:40.210> then<00:04:41.210> in
