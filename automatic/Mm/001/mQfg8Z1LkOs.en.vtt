these are just a little soft shoes so I

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.850

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
for walking when he's like fully walking

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.840 
for walking when he's like fully walking
but<00:04:17.290> this<00:04:17.440> will<00:04:17.650> be<00:04:17.739> great<00:04:17.890> for<00:04:18.010> now<00:04:18.370> for<00:04:18.730> the

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:27.129 
so for 249 and I thought these would be

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:31.740 
so for 249 and I thought these would be
really<00:04:27.310> cute<00:04:27.669> with<00:04:28.830> jean<00:04:29.830> skirts<00:04:30.569> for<00:04:31.569> the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
really cute with jean skirts for the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.110 
really cute with jean skirts for the
fall<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:32.409> I<00:04:32.440> couldn't<00:04:32.740> resist<00:04:32.979> these<00:04:33.460> for<00:04:33.909> them

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
fall so I couldn't resist these for them

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.240 
fall so I couldn't resist these for them
so<00:04:34.449> it's<00:04:34.569> another<00:04:34.810> item<00:04:35.080> that<00:04:35.199> my<00:04:35.500> mom<00:04:35.710> got<00:04:35.919> for

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
so it's another item that my mom got for

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.089 
so it's another item that my mom got for
Dylan<00:04:36.580> actually<00:04:37.120> it's<00:04:38.080> just<00:04:38.259> a<00:04:38.409> t-shirt<00:04:38.620> I

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
Dylan actually it's just a t-shirt I

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.159 
Dylan actually it's just a t-shirt I
think<00:04:39.400> this<00:04:39.520> size<00:04:39.789> is<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.030> 3<00:04:40.509> it's<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.810> little<00:04:41.020> bit

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
think this size is a 3 it's a little bit

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.899 
think this size is a 3 it's a little bit
big<00:04:41.500> but<00:04:41.530> he<00:04:41.889> could<00:04:42.039> probably<00:04:42.159> use<00:04:42.490> this<00:04:42.669> by

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 
big but he could probably use this by

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:46.529 
big but he could probably use this by
next<00:04:43.270> winter<00:04:43.710> or<00:04:44.710> this<00:04:45.190> winter<00:04:45.610> into<00:04:46.330> next

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.730 
next winter or this winter into next
year<00:04:46.780> for<00:04:47.379> 299<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.280> this<00:04:48.520> would<00:04:48.909> be<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.060> great

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.790 
but I couldn't resist is amiss only 399
399<00:05:38.289> so<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:39.099> my<00:05:39.279> father<00:05:39.490> loves<00:05:40.000> golf<00:05:40.479> and<00:05:40.960> I

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:43.719 
thought this would be cute maybe if he

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.309 
thought this would be cute maybe if he
teaches<00:05:44.050> him<00:05:44.259> golf<00:05:44.500> one<00:05:44.740> day<00:05:44.889> hole-in-one<00:05:45.610> and

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
but I couldn't pass this up because of

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.580 
but I couldn't pass this up because of
the<00:05:54.310> fact<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:54.639> it's<00:05:54.849> a<00:05:54.969> thought<00:05:55.180> for<00:05:55.389> sure

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
the fact that it's a thought for sure
