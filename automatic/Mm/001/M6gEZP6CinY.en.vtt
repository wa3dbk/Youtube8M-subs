easier paddle outs more energy stronger
shoulders<00:01:59.200> let's<00:02:00.130> get<00:02:00.310> going<00:02:00.610> duck<00:02:01.030> dive

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
shoulders let's get going duck dive

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.910 
shoulders let's get going duck dive
training<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.140> first<00:02:02.320> one<00:02:02.470> it's

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
training so this first one it's

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.859 
training so this first one it's
basically<00:02:03.070> a<00:02:03.520> dumbbell<00:02:04.030> press<00:02:04.299> movement<00:02:04.720> I

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
basically a dumbbell press movement I

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.480 
basically a dumbbell press movement I
don't<00:02:05.229> have<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.350> dumbbell<00:02:05.740> so<00:02:06.009> imagine<00:02:06.400> I've

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
don't have a dumbbell so imagine I've

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.850 
don't have a dumbbell so imagine I've
got<00:02:06.610> one<00:02:06.729> in<00:02:06.759> my<00:02:06.850> hand<00:02:07.349> there's<00:02:08.349> two<00:02:08.560> type<00:02:08.829> of

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
got one in my hand there's two type of

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.859 
got one in my hand there's two type of
pressing<00:02:09.849> there's<00:02:10.090> actually<00:02:10.360> two<00:02:10.509> types<00:02:10.539> of

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
pressing there's actually two types of

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.869 
pressing there's actually two types of
movements<00:02:11.290> open<00:02:11.650> chain<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.159> closed<00:02:12.459> chain

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
movements open chain and closed chain

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.020 
movements open chain and closed chain
open<00:02:13.810> chain<00:02:14.110> would<00:02:14.620> be<00:02:14.830> pushing<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.610> dumbbell

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
open chain would be pushing a dumbbell

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.449 
open chain would be pushing a dumbbell
means<00:02:16.569> you're

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
means you're

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.000 
means you're
an<00:02:17.640> object<00:02:18.090> away<00:02:18.239> from<00:02:18.689> the<00:02:18.780> body<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.260> closed

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
an object away from the body a closed

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.740 
an object away from the body a closed
chain<00:02:20.400> would<00:02:20.730> be<00:02:20.879> like<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> pushup

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
chain would be like a pushup

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.240 
chain would be like a pushup
where<00:02:22.079> you're<00:02:22.230> pushing<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.950> ground

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
where you're pushing and the ground

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.890 
where you're pushing and the ground
can't<00:02:23.579> be<00:02:23.670> pushed<00:02:23.879> away<00:02:24.030> from<00:02:24.359> you<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
can't be pushed away from you so the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.679 
can't be pushed away from you so the
body<00:02:25.170> moves<00:02:25.500> away<00:02:25.680> an<00:02:26.280> example<00:02:26.939> of<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.120> leg<00:02:27.299> open

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
body moves away an example of a leg open

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.349 
body moves away an example of a leg open
or<00:02:27.810> closed<00:02:28.049> chain<00:02:28.409> a<00:02:28.909> squat<00:02:29.909> where<00:02:30.239> you're

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
or closed chain a squat where you're

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.390 
or closed chain a squat where you're
pushing<00:02:30.870> your<00:02:30.989> body<00:02:31.140> away<00:02:31.379> from<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.859> ground

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
pushing your body away from the ground

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.789 
pushing your body away from the ground
that's<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.879> closed<00:02:33.180> chain<00:02:33.629> an<00:02:33.840> open<00:02:34.530> chain

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
that's a closed chain an open chain

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.949 
that's a closed chain an open chain
would<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.099> like<00:02:35.639> a<00:02:35.670> seated<00:02:36.150> leg<00:02:36.299> press<00:02:36.689> where

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
would be like a seated leg press where

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.949 
would be like a seated leg press where
you're<00:02:37.109> pushing<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.370> legs<00:02:38.549> away<00:02:38.730> step<00:02:39.719> dives

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
you're pushing the legs away step dives

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.869 
you're pushing the legs away step dives
are<00:02:40.200> kind<00:02:40.469> of<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.680> combination<00:02:41.129> of<00:02:41.400> open<00:02:41.579> and

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
are kind of a combination of open and

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.190 
are kind of a combination of open and
closed<00:02:42.150> chains<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.659> need<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.870> get<00:02:42.959> good<00:02:43.079> of

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
closed chains you need to get good of

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.349 
closed chains you need to get good of
both<00:02:43.379> I<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.639> use<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:44.969> one<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.299> a

both I like to use this one it's a

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.119 
both I like to use this one it's a
single<00:02:45.719> arm<00:02:45.930> stability<00:02:46.439> ball<00:02:46.590> chest<00:02:46.889> press

this<00:02:47.700> ball<00:02:47.909> is<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.090> little<00:02:48.120> too<00:02:48.450> deflated<00:02:49.019> but

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
this ball is a little too deflated but

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.629 
this ball is a little too deflated but
it's<00:02:49.379> all<00:02:49.500> I've<00:02:49.590> got<00:02:49.620> today<00:02:50.099> so<00:02:50.159> that's<00:02:50.489> what

you're<00:02:50.760> gonna<00:02:50.939> see<00:02:51.980> essentially<00:02:55.310> getting

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
you're gonna see essentially getting

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.679 
you're gonna see essentially getting
some<00:02:56.549> tall<00:02:56.790> hips<00:02:57.120> don't<00:02:58.049> sag<00:02:59.419> you'll<00:03:00.419> train

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
some tall hips don't sag you'll train

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.920 
some tall hips don't sag you'll train
one<00:03:00.930> arm<00:03:01.139> at<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.319> time<00:03:01.879> you<00:03:02.879> can<00:03:02.909> whichever<00:03:03.659> side

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
one arm at a time you can whichever side

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.839 
one arm at a time you can whichever side
is<00:03:03.959> pressing<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.889> can<00:03:05.069> slide<00:03:05.430> out<00:03:05.639> to<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
is pressing you can slide out to the

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.849 
is pressing you can slide out to the
side<00:03:06.060> just<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.659> little<00:03:06.689> you'll<00:03:07.290> feel<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.650> load

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
side just a little you'll feel it load

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.979 
side just a little you'll feel it load
this<00:03:08.129> hip<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.609> this<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.000> real<00:03:09.269> full<00:03:09.719> body

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
this hip so this is the real full body

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.039 
this hip so this is the real full body
full<00:03:10.409> core<00:03:10.680> exercise<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.750> then<00:03:12.750> you're<00:03:12.900> just

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
full core exercise and then you're just

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.379 
full core exercise and then you're just
coming<00:03:13.519> good<00:03:14.519> presses<00:03:16.819> now<00:03:17.819> for<00:03:18.030> these<00:03:18.150> if

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
coming good presses now for these if

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.759 
coming good presses now for these if
you're<00:03:18.480> training<00:03:18.780> endurance<00:03:19.319> you<00:03:19.530> need<00:03:19.680> to

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
you're training endurance you need to

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.949 
you're training endurance you need to
find<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.129> weight<00:03:20.340> that's<00:03:20.489> about<00:03:20.849> you<00:03:21.720> could<00:03:21.840> get

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
find a weight that's about you could get

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.280 
find a weight that's about you could get
20<00:03:22.349> clean<00:03:22.709> reps<00:03:23.129> good<00:03:23.519> clean<00:03:23.819> movements<00:03:24.419> if

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
20 clean reps good clean movements if

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.080 
20 clean reps good clean movements if
you're<00:03:25.470> training<00:03:25.769> for<00:03:26.099> some<00:03:26.250> strength<00:03:26.790> you

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
you're training for some strength you

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.309 
you're training for some strength you
might<00:03:27.269> get<00:03:27.449> a<00:03:27.479> dumbbell<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.109> you're<00:03:28.199> only

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
might get a dumbbell that you're only

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.479 
might get a dumbbell that you're only
doing<00:03:28.440> 6<00:03:29.099> 8<00:03:29.310> reps<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.720> again<00:03:31.079> properly<00:03:32.010> design

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
doing 6 8 reps so again properly design

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.679 
doing 6 8 reps so again properly design
workouts<00:03:34.250> will<00:03:35.250> dictate<00:03:35.790> if<00:03:36.239> you're<00:03:36.510> going

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
workouts will dictate if you're going

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.159 
workouts will dictate if you're going
high<00:03:36.989> rep<00:03:37.290> low<00:03:38.129> rep<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.909> that<00:03:39.150> depends<00:03:39.569> really

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
it back wraps around that's what we're

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:07.529 
it back wraps around that's what we're
doing<00:05:59.499> on<00:06:00.129> the<00:06:00.249> floor<00:06:01.709> sink<00:06:02.849> push<00:06:06.300> some<00:06:07.300> people

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
doing on the floor sink push some people

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.359 
doing on the floor sink push some people
have<00:06:07.689> a<00:06:07.719> lot<00:06:07.990> of<00:06:08.050> problem<00:06:08.439> with<00:06:08.559> that<00:06:08.709> figuring

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:09.369 
have a lot of problem with that figuring

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.589 
have a lot of problem with that figuring
out<00:06:09.490> how<00:06:09.639> to<00:06:09.699> do<00:06:09.819> that<00:06:09.939> movement<00:06:10.179> you<00:06:10.479> can

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
out how to do that movement you can

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:11.790 
out how to do that movement you can
start<00:06:10.869> up<00:06:10.959> against<00:06:11.169> the<00:06:11.289> wall

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
start up against the wall

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.209 
start up against the wall
so<00:06:12.729> that's<00:06:12.909> the<00:06:13.719> serratus<00:06:14.259> has<00:06:14.439> a<00:06:14.469> bunch<00:06:15.099> of

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:15.219 
so that's the serratus has a bunch of

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.659 
so that's the serratus has a bunch of
little<00:06:16.379> outreaches<00:06:17.379> of<00:06:17.409> muscle<00:06:17.919> and<00:06:18.459> so<00:06:18.610> you

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
little outreaches of muscle and so you

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.760 
little outreaches of muscle and so you
want<00:06:18.849> to<00:06:18.879> train<00:06:19.149> various<00:06:20.110> heads<00:06:20.409> of<00:06:20.649> that

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
want to train various heads of that

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.109 
want to train various heads of that
muscle<00:06:21.189> so<00:06:21.719> we<00:06:22.719> could<00:06:22.869> do<00:06:22.959> a<00:06:22.990> set<00:06:23.289> here<00:06:24.089> do<00:06:25.089> a

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:25.119 
muscle so we could do a set here do a

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:29.670 
muscle so we could do a set here do a
set<00:06:25.419> a<00:06:25.449> few<00:06:25.719> inches<00:06:25.869> up<00:06:27.959> we<00:06:28.959> do<00:06:29.080> a<00:06:29.110> set<00:06:29.379> a<00:06:29.409> few

set a few inches up we do a set a few

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.339 
set a few inches up we do a set a few
more<00:06:30.009> inches<00:06:30.309> up<00:06:33.389> slow<00:06:34.389> control<00:06:34.899> don't<00:06:35.139> just
