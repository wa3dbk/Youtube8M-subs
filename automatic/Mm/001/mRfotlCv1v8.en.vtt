00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.330 

took<00:00:48.820> me<00:00:48.970> two<00:00:49.000> years<00:00:49.180> to<00:00:49.570> build<00:00:49.900> it<00:00:50.340> almost

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
took me two years to build it almost

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.090 
took me two years to build it almost
exactly<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:52.480> get<00:00:52.660> it<00:00:52.780> flying<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.470> I've<00:00:53.950> been

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
exactly to get it flying and I've been

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.490 
exactly to get it flying and I've been
tinkering<00:00:54.460> with<00:00:54.580> it<00:00:54.760> for<00:00:55.059> another<00:00:55.239> year<00:00:55.660> just

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500
