Windows H for this tutorial I've got
here<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.870> code<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.440> had<00:00:13.620> from<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.980> last

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
here the code we had from the last

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.369 
here the code we had from the last
tutorial<00:00:14.460> pretty<00:00:15.089> much<00:00:15.299> except<00:00:15.870> for<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.109> few

tutorial pretty much except for a few
things<00:00:16.850> I<00:00:17.850> changed<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.510> title<00:00:18.539> that's<00:00:19.020> all

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and it's sickly that I also changed from

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.730 
and it's sickly that I also changed from
the<00:00:22.680> default<00:00:22.949> project<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.519> changed<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the default project I changed this the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.279 
the default project I changed this the
type<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> window<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:26.939> now<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.869> can't<00:00:28.140> be

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
type of window so it's now it can't be

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.140 
type of window so it's now it can't be
resized<00:00:28.650> but<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.340> minimized<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
resized but it can be minimized and I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.569 
resized but it can be minimized and I
also<00:00:30.269> change<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.750> dimensions<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.710> well

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579

also change the dimensions of it as well
in<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.540> last<00:00:33.719> tutorial<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.350> had<00:00:34.620> our<00:00:35.840> we<00:00:36.840> had<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
in the last tutorial we had our we had a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.020 
in the last tutorial we had our we had a
some<00:00:37.680> text<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.250> window<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.520> said<00:00:38.820> hello

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
world so if we just build and run I'll

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.160 
world so if we just build and run I'll
show<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.610> what<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.820> looks<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.180> there<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.989> go

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
anyway let's get to creating a button if

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360

you recall from the last tutorial I
talked<00:00:53.940> about<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.360> function<00:00:54.840> right<00:00:55.110> here

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
talked about this function right here

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.549 
talked about this function right here
with<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:57.120> gets<00:00:57.360> called<00:00:57.690> by<00:00:58.230> The<00:00:58.289> Dispatch

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
with it gets called by The Dispatch

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.340 
with it gets called by The Dispatch
message<00:00:59.340> function<00:00:59.879> while<00:01:00.750> your<00:01:00.930> program<00:01:01.050> is

this is where we're going to add our

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.649 
this is where we're going to add our
button<00:01:34.729> this<00:01:35.729> will<00:01:35.970> make<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
button this will make it so that the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.399 
button this will make it so that the
button<00:01:36.900> shows<00:01:37.079> up<00:01:37.290> after<00:01:38.780> right<00:01:39.780> after<00:01:40.140> this

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
button shows up after right after this

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.080 
button shows up after right after this
the<00:01:41.159> parent<00:01:41.549> window<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:42.060> rendered<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> let's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the parent window is rendered so let's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.330 
the parent window is rendered so let's
first<00:01:45.720> let's<00:01:46.229> create<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> handle<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
first let's create a handle to the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:56.709 
first let's create a handle to the
button<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:47.729> here<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.390> case<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:54.570> then

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.880 

what<00:01:57.719> we're<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.710> we're

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
what we're going to do here is we're

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.280 
what we're going to do here is we're
just<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.219> say<00:01:59.399> button<00:02:00.110> which<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
just going to say button which is a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.210 
just going to say button which is a
handle<00:02:01.770> equals<00:02:02.219> create<00:02:03.469> window

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
handle equals create window

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.450 
handle equals create window
and<00:02:06.460> then<00:02:07.450> for<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.080> parameters<00:02:08.560> here<00:02:08.890> you'll

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
and then for the parameters here you'll

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.490 
and then for the parameters here you'll
notice<00:02:09.670> in<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:10.119> one<00:02:10.180> which<00:02:10.510> was<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.720> text<00:02:11.290> that

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
notice in this one which was a text that

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.370 
notice in this one which was a text that
couldn't<00:02:12.100> be<00:02:12.190> edited<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.930> first<00:02:14.170> parameter

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
couldn't be edited the first parameter

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.660 
couldn't be edited the first parameter
was<00:02:14.800> static<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.490> quotes<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:17.400> because<00:02:18.400> it's<00:02:18.550> a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
was static in quotes so because it's a

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.220 
was static in quotes so because it's a
button<00:02:18.910> all<00:02:19.210> you're<00:02:19.690> going<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.840> do<00:02:19.990> is<00:02:20.080> right

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
button all you're going to do is right

button all you're going to do is right
button<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.680> quotes

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.370 

now<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.270> next<00:02:25.510> parameter<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:26.080> what<00:02:26.290> you

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
now the next parameter is what you

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.560 
now the next parameter is what you
actually<00:02:26.530> want<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.920> button<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.250> say<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.390> in

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
actually want the button to say so in

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.530 
actually want the button to say so in
our<00:02:28.690> case<00:02:28.990> let's<00:02:29.560> make<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.920> button<00:02:30.190> say<00:02:30.540> this

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
our case let's make the button say this

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:39.180 
our case let's make the button say this
is<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.530> button<00:02:36.870> okay<00:02:37.870> now<00:02:38.620> we're<00:02:38.980> going<00:02:39.100> to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
is that button okay now we're going to

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.940 
is that button okay now we're going to
give<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:40.350> attributes<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.560> we<00:02:41.710> talked

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
give it the attributes that we talked

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.310 
give it the attributes that we talked
about<00:02:42.130> here<00:02:43.120> before<00:02:43.480> whatever<00:02:43.690> ones<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.170> want

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
about here before whatever ones you want

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.720 
about here before whatever ones you want
to<00:02:44.410> give<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.010> first<00:02:45.160> one<00:02:45.430> we're<00:02:45.580> always

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
to give it so the first one we're always

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.900 
to give it so the first one we're always
going<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.090> supply<00:02:46.360> as<00:02:46.450> WS<00:02:47.020> visible<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.910> then

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
going to supply as WS visible and then

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.640 
going to supply as WS visible and then
we're<00:02:49.060> going<00:02:49.210> to<00:02:49.270> use<00:02:49.570> this<00:02:50.110> vertical<00:02:50.620> line

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
we're going to use this vertical line

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.640 
we're going to use this vertical line
here<00:02:50.830> only<00:02:51.400> one<00:02:51.690> then<00:02:52.690> WS<00:02:53.230> child<00:02:55.410> we're<00:02:56.410> saying

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
here only one then WS child we're saying

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.710 
here only one then WS child we're saying
here<00:02:57.070> we're<00:02:57.400> saying<00:02:57.610> that<00:02:57.730> it's<00:02:57.970> child<00:02:58.390> to

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
here we're saying that it's child to

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.600 
here we're saying that it's child to
this<00:02:58.870> window<00:02:59.290> H<00:02:59.530> wind<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.990> then<00:03:02.430> let's<00:03:03.430> also

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
this window H wind and then let's also

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.240 
this window H wind and then let's also
give<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.060> border<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:04.660> WS<00:03:05.200> border<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:08.290> so

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
give it a border so WS border and so

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.010 
give it a border so WS border and so
we're<00:03:09.760> done<00:03:09.880> with<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:10.239> argument<00:03:10.510> let's<00:03:10.840> put

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
we're done with that argument let's put

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.229 
we're done with that argument let's put
a<00:03:11.050> comma<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:11.739> now<00:03:11.800> we<00:03:12.459> got<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:12.940> put<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
a comma and now we got to put the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.050 
a comma and now we got to put the
dimensions<00:03:13.810> that<00:03:14.110> we<00:03:14.260> want<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.560> button<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:14.860> be

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
dimensions that we want the button to be

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.140 
dimensions that we want the button to be
so<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.239> first<00:03:16.480> two<00:03:17.140> or<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:18.640> next<00:03:18.880> two

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
so the first two or the next two

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.199 
so the first two or the next two
parameters<00:03:19.720> are<00:03:19.900> integers<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.830> they<00:03:21.790> are<00:03:21.970> how

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
parameters are integers and they are how

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.190 
parameters are integers and they are how
many<00:03:22.390> pixels<00:03:22.660> from<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.290> top<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:25.120> top<00:03:25.330> left<00:03:26.050> of

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
many pixels from the top the top left of

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.840 
many pixels from the top the top left of
your<00:03:26.260> window<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:26.800> want<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.100> button<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.370> be<00:03:27.550> so

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
your window you want the button to be so

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.229 
your window you want the button to be so
since<00:03:28.090> we<00:03:28.239> made<00:03:28.420> this<00:03:28.890> text<00:03:29.890> 20<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:30.760> 20<00:03:31.060> from

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
since we made this text 20 and 20 from

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.140 
since we made this text 20 and 20 from
the<00:03:31.300> top<00:03:31.570> here<00:03:31.810> at<00:03:32.170> 20<00:03:32.800> pixels<00:03:32.980> down<00:03:33.340> 20<00:03:33.970> pixels

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
the top here at 20 pixels down 20 pixels

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.930 
the top here at 20 pixels down 20 pixels
in<00:03:34.680> we<00:03:35.680> let's<00:03:36.550> make<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.940> button<00:03:38.820> we'll<00:03:39.820> make

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
in we let's make the button we'll make

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.240 
in we let's make the button we'll make
it

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
it

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.690 
it
20<00:03:42.250> from<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:43.830> we'll<00:03:44.830> make<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.130> 20<00:03:45.489> from<00:03:45.640> the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
20 from the we'll make it 20 from the

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.509 
20 from the we'll make it 20 from the
left<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.360> we'll<00:03:46.570> make<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:46.750> say<00:03:47.650> 50<00:03:48.280> down<00:03:48.459> to

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
left and we'll make it say 50 down to

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.509 
left and we'll make it say 50 down to
make<00:03:48.850> sure<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:49.090> falls<00:03:49.209> below<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:50.489> below<00:03:51.489> the

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
make sure it falls below the below the

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.479 
make sure it falls below the below the
text<00:03:52.269> that<00:03:52.330> we<00:03:52.480> already<00:03:52.630> have<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.200> now<00:03:53.620> the

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
text that we already have and now the

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.310 
text that we already have and now the
next<00:03:54.760> parameter<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.330> how<00:03:55.540> wide<00:03:55.810> we<00:03:55.989> want<00:03:56.200> the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
next parameter is how wide we want the

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.910 
next parameter is how wide we want the
button<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.620> be<00:03:56.739> so<00:03:57.610> for<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:58.600> let's<00:03:58.959> let's

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
button to be so for that let's let's

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.130 
button to be so for that let's let's
just<00:03:59.980> say<00:04:00.310> 100<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.239> find<00:04:01.480> this<00:04:01.630> has<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.840> lot<00:04:02.080> of

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
just say 100 I find this has a lot of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.330 
just say 100 I find this has a lot of
guess<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.250> check<00:04:03.310> in<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:04.019> but<00:04:05.019> because<00:04:05.950> if

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
guess and check in it but because if

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.220 
guess and check in it but because if
it's<00:04:06.640> not<00:04:06.820> big<00:04:07.030> enough<00:04:07.060> then<00:04:07.510> not<00:04:07.900> all<00:04:08.050> this

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
it's not big enough then not all this

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.259 
it's not big enough then not all this
will<00:04:08.470> show<00:04:08.680> actually<00:04:09.250> let's<00:04:09.430> make<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.640> 200

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
will show actually let's make it 200

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.580 
will show actually let's make it 200
just<00:04:10.840> in<00:04:10.989> case<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.519> then<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:14.080> next<00:04:14.410> parameter

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
just in case and then the next parameter

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.440 
just in case and then the next parameter
is<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:15.010> height<00:04:15.190> so<00:04:15.490> let's<00:04:15.670> say<00:04:15.850> 20<00:04:16.180> again

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
is the height so let's say 20 again

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.570 
is the height so let's say 20 again
because<00:04:17.020> 20<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.440> usually<00:04:17.950> how<00:04:18.100> tall<00:04:18.340> the

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
because 20 is usually how tall the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.930 
because 20 is usually how tall the
default<00:04:19.120> text<00:04:19.479> is

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
default text is

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.440 
default text is
and<00:04:20.200> the<00:04:21.200> next<00:04:21.440> parameter<00:04:21.650> is<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.970> handle<00:04:23.300> to

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
and the next parameter is the handle to

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.120 
and the next parameter is the handle to
the<00:04:23.570> parent<00:04:23.930> window<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:24.470> for<00:04:24.740> this<00:04:24.860> parameter

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
the parent window so for this parameter

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.950 
the parent window so for this parameter
we're<00:04:25.490> just<00:04:25.670> going<00:04:25.820> to<00:04:25.850> put<00:04:26.030> H<00:04:26.270> wind<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:29.090> then

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
we're just going to put H wind and then

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.890 
we're just going to put H wind and then
for<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:31.010> last<00:04:31.460> flow<00:04:31.790> for<00:04:32.240> now<00:04:32.360> we'll<00:04:32.540> just<00:04:32.570> put

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
for the last flow for now we'll just put

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.220 
for the last flow for now we'll just put
no<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:37.430> believe<00:04:38.090> it's<00:04:38.240> this<00:04:38.480> one<00:04:38.720> here

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
no and I believe it's this one here

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.080 
no and I believe it's this one here
yeah<00:04:39.620> I'm<00:04:39.710> pretty<00:04:39.920> sure<00:04:40.070> it's<00:04:40.220> this<00:04:40.310> one<00:04:40.490> I'll

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
yeah I'm pretty sure it's this one I'll

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.740 
yeah I'm pretty sure it's this one I'll
show<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:41.420> in<00:04:41.690> my<00:04:42.110> next<00:04:42.170> tutorial<00:04:42.910> how<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:43.940> make

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
show you in my next tutorial how to make

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.530 
show you in my next tutorial how to make
a<00:04:44.780> button<00:04:45.490> how<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.550> make<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.880> button<00:04:47.150> perform

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
a button how to make the button perform

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.720 
a button how to make the button perform
an<00:04:47.660> action<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.320> it'll<00:04:48.920> have<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.220> do<00:04:49.370> with<00:04:49.520> this

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
an action and it'll have to do with this

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.420 
an action and it'll have to do with this
parameter<00:04:49.970> right<00:04:50.450> here<00:04:50.800> anyway<00:04:51.800> for<00:04:52.340> now

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
parameter right here anyway for now

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.450 
parameter right here anyway for now
let's<00:04:52.670> just<00:04:52.730> compile<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:53.480> run<00:04:57.460> hopefully

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
let's just compile and run hopefully

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.560 
let's just compile and run hopefully
there's<00:04:58.940> no<00:04:59.090> errors<00:05:00.400> okay<00:05:01.400> there<00:05:01.760> we<00:05:02.150> go<00:05:02.300> and

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
there's no errors okay there we go and

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.980 
there's no errors okay there we go and
here's<00:05:03.440> our<00:05:03.680> button<00:05:04.070> as<00:05:04.250> you<00:05:05.090> can<00:05:05.270> see<00:05:05.630> you<00:05:05.780> can

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
here's our button as you can see you can

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.460 
here's our button as you can see you can
click<00:05:06.230> on<00:05:06.440> it<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:07.540> do<00:05:08.540> all<00:05:08.690> that<00:05:08.900> but<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:09.290> won't

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
click on it and do all that but it won't

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.200 
click on it and do all that but it won't
actually<00:05:09.620> perform<00:05:10.190> any<00:05:10.340> action<00:05:10.760> yet<00:05:10.910> because

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
actually perform any action yet because

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.760 
actually perform any action yet because
we<00:05:11.330> haven't<00:05:11.480> given<00:05:11.780> it<00:05:11.930> an<00:05:12.110> action<00:05:12.470> to<00:05:12.620> perform

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
we haven't given it an action to perform

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.910 
we haven't given it an action to perform
and<00:05:13.690> there's<00:05:14.690> also<00:05:14.900> this<00:05:15.260> text<00:05:15.710> right<00:05:15.770> here

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
and there's also this text right here

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.850 
and there's also this text right here
which<00:05:16.780> doesn't<00:05:17.780> have<00:05:18.080> any<00:05:18.290> action<00:05:18.740> either

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
which doesn't have any action either

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.890 
which doesn't have any action either
although<00:05:19.280> I<00:05:19.310> believe<00:05:19.700> you<00:05:19.850> can<00:05:20.030> even<00:05:20.600> assign

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
although I believe you can even assign

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.040 
although I believe you can even assign
an<00:05:21.110> action<00:05:21.290> to<00:05:21.680> that<00:05:22.540> not<00:05:23.540> entirely<00:05:23.840> sure

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
an action to that not entirely sure

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.980
