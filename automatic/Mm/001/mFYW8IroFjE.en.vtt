trap set up you'll be a-okay we're going
to<00:00:13.889> use<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.160> same<00:00:14.549> stuff<00:00:14.910> with<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.660> inclusion

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
to use the same stuff with the inclusion

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.769 
to use the same stuff with the inclusion
again<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.770> Paladin<00:00:17.400> who<00:00:17.550> just<00:00:18.449> becomes

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
again of the Paladin who just becomes

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.500 
again of the Paladin who just becomes
increasingly<00:00:19.199> useful<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.850> levels<00:00:21.390> go<00:00:21.539> on

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
increasingly useful as the levels go on

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.870 
increasingly useful as the levels go on
firstly<00:00:24.510> block<00:00:25.109> off<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.500> stair<00:00:25.740> was<00:00:25.920> with<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
firstly block off the stair was with the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.960 
firstly block off the stair was with the
brimstone<00:00:27.590> now<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.650> might<00:00:28.890> wonder<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.849> know

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
brimstone now you might wonder you know

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.460 
brimstone now you might wonder you know
a<00:00:30.000> vest<00:00:30.269> man<00:00:30.420> why<00:00:30.630> don't<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.199> block<00:00:31.410> it

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
a vest man why don't you just block it

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.220 
a vest man why don't you just block it
off<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> barrier<00:00:32.630> interestingly<00:00:33.630> enough

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
off with a barrier interestingly enough

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.950 
off with a barrier interestingly enough
on<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.710> level<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.940> AI<00:00:36.149> pathways<00:00:36.930> are

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
on this level the AI pathways are

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.869 
on this level the AI pathways are
dedicated<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.730> way<00:00:38.910> they<00:00:39.120> are<00:00:39.329> so

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
dedicated to going the way they are so

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.209 
dedicated to going the way they are so
if<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.059> barricade<00:00:42.540> off<00:00:42.719> either<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.070> those

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
if you barricade off either one of those

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.220 
if you barricade off either one of those
staircases<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.090> orcs<00:00:45.420> will<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.840> attack<00:00:46.200> it

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
staircases the orcs will just attack it

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.270 
staircases the orcs will just attack it
and<00:00:46.649> go<00:00:46.860> through<00:00:47.190> instead<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.570> around

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
and go through instead of going around

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.770 
and go through instead of going around
on<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.610> first<00:00:50.820> couple<00:00:51.030> way<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.510> won't

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
on the first couple way so you won't

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
on the first couple way so you won't
have<00:00:51.870> an<00:00:52.020> issue<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.559> door<00:00:52.800> will<00:00:53.010> release<00:00:53.370> cool

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
have an issue one door will release cool

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.619 
have an issue one door will release cool
balls<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.090> other<00:00:54.180> will<00:00:54.449> release<00:00:54.920> orcs<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.629> it

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
balls the other will release orcs so it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.119 
balls the other will release orcs so it
starts<00:00:57.899> out<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.350> right<00:00:58.530> door<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> be

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
starts out the right door going to be

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.060 
starts out the right door going to be
kobold<00:00:59.520> then<00:00:59.760> left<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.469> would<00:01:01.469> suggest<00:01:01.620> putting

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
kobold then left I would suggest putting

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.680 
kobold then left I would suggest putting
the<00:01:02.340> Lightning<00:01:02.730> where<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> cobalt's<00:01:03.510> come

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the Lightning where the cobalt's come

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.060 
the Lightning where the cobalt's come
out<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.019> way<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.500> guarantee<00:01:04.860> you're

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
out that way you can guarantee you're

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.330 
out that way you can guarantee you're
getting<00:01:05.339> most<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:05.909> all<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.479> cobalt's

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
getting most if not all the cobalt's

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.060 
getting most if not all the cobalt's
also<00:01:08.340> make<00:01:08.790> sure<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:10.350> upgrade<00:01:10.830> for

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
also make sure you have the upgrade for

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980 
also make sure you have the upgrade for
the<00:01:11.130> rift<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.180> rift<00:01:12.450> has<00:01:12.630> its<00:01:12.869> own

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the rift so that the rift has its own

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.750 
the rift so that the rift has its own
protective<00:01:13.409> lightning<00:01:13.920> as<00:01:14.040> well<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.580> will

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
protective lightning as well that will

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.429 
protective lightning as well that will
help<00:01:14.909> ensure<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.450> even<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.990> couple<00:01:16.170> cool

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
help ensure that even if a couple cool

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.399 
help ensure that even if a couple cool
bulbs<00:01:16.740> gets<00:01:16.920> through<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:18.299> will<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:19.110> able<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
bulbs gets through you will be able to

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.980 
bulbs gets through you will be able to
handle<00:01:20.130> them<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:21.840> I'm

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
handle them now you can see here I'm

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.890 
handle them now you can see here I'm
putting<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.189> line<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> brimstone<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.360> this

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
putting in a line of brimstone and this

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
putting in a line of brimstone and this
is<00:01:25.049> obviously<00:01:25.200> very<00:01:25.560> costly<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.700> going

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
is obviously very costly but it's going

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.569 
is obviously very costly but it's going
to<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.090> amazingly<00:01:27.900> useful<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:29.220> at<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
to be amazingly useful it's at that

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.620 
to be amazingly useful it's at that
perfect<00:01:29.820> location<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.369> also<00:01:33.090> put<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.479> some

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
perfect location and I also put up some

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.030 
perfect location and I also put up some
arrow<00:01:33.810> walls<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.350> see<00:01:34.500> during<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:35.009> of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
arrow walls you can see during one of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.090 
arrow walls you can see during one of
the<00:01:35.220> waves<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.900> point<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:37.560> gun<00:01:37.979> is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the waves and at this point your gun is

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.850 
the waves and at this point your gun is
you're<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:39.000> fairly<00:01:39.570> safe<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.290> your

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
you're going to be fairly safe now your

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.310 
you're going to be fairly safe now your
brimstone<00:01:41.490> will<00:01:42.180> take<00:01:42.450> care<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.810> almost<00:01:42.990> all

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
brimstone will take care of almost all

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.590 
brimstone will take care of almost all
the<00:01:43.500> orcs<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.549> only<00:01:44.970> thing<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the orcs now the only thing you have to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.690 
the orcs now the only thing you have to
be<00:01:45.780> cautious<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.590> null<00:01:46.979> hunters<00:01:47.399> are<00:01:47.549> going

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
be cautious of is null hunters are going

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.719 
be cautious of is null hunters are going
to<00:01:47.759> start<00:01:48.000> spawning<00:01:48.240> rather<00:01:49.140> frequently<00:01:49.799> so

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
to start spawning rather frequently so

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.630 
to start spawning rather frequently so
keep<00:01:51.030> an<00:01:51.180> eye<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.299> them<00:01:51.659> also<00:01:52.130> ogres<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.369> course

keep an eye on them also ogres of course

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.359 
keep an eye on them also ogres of course
will<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.630> stopped<00:01:54.930> by<00:01:55.079> brimstone<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.219> if

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
will not be stopped by brimstone so if

with the auto ballistas they will they

with the auto ballistas they will they
will<00:02:22.290> pretty<00:02:22.620> well<00:02:22.800> just<00:02:22.830> completely<00:02:23.610> drop

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
will pretty well just completely drop

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.730 
will pretty well just completely drop
one<00:02:24.210> person<00:02:25.640> at<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.940> end<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.510> seven<00:02:27.840> now

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
one person at the end of a of seven now

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.960 
one person at the end of a of seven now
you<00:02:28.800> can<00:02:29.010> see<00:02:29.130> I'm<00:02:29.190> going<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> put<00:02:29.490> up<00:02:29.580> archers

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
you can see I'm going to put up archers

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.090 
you can see I'm going to put up archers
but<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.210> actually<00:02:30.360> changed<00:02:30.900> my<00:02:31.020> mind<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.560> put

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
but I actually changed my mind I put

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.850 
but I actually changed my mind I put
them<00:02:32.250> up<00:02:32.400> here<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.930> reason<00:02:34.230> for<00:02:34.410> this<00:02:34.560> is

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
them up here and the reason for this is

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.000 
them up here and the reason for this is
that<00:02:34.890> way<00:02:35.340> they<00:02:35.670> have<00:02:35.700> more<00:02:36.360> time<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:37.260> shoot<00:02:37.680> at

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
that way they have more time to shoot at

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.450 
that way they have more time to shoot at
whatever<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.670> coming<00:02:38.910> at<00:02:39.150> them<00:02:39.830> if<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:41.010> put<00:02:41.310> them

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
whatever is coming at them if I put them

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.060 
whatever is coming at them if I put them
down<00:02:41.730> further<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:43.140> problem<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.770> they'll

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
down further the problem is they'll

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.770 
down further the problem is they'll
still<00:02:44.460> still<00:02:44.820> shoot<00:02:45.060> at<00:02:45.180> targets<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.720> are

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
still still shoot at targets that are

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.170 
still still shoot at targets that are
already<00:02:46.050> going<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.470> die<00:02:46.590> anyways<00:02:47.070> by<00:02:47.940> putting

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
already going to die anyways by putting

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.880 
already going to die anyways by putting
them<00:02:48.360> up<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:48.810> they're<00:02:49.050> only<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.650> shoot

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
them up here they're only going to shoot

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.960 
them up here they're only going to shoot
at<00:02:50.070> what's<00:02:50.610> gotten<00:02:51.060> through<00:02:51.360> which<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:53.130> find

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
at what's gotten through which I I find

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.120 
at what's gotten through which I I find
is<00:02:54.180> just<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.540> better<00:02:54.720> idea<00:02:54.900> plus<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.940> can<00:02:57.150> also

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
is just a better idea plus you can also

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.240 
is just a better idea plus you can also
get<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.160> little<00:02:59.550> more<00:02:59.730> margin<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.570> safety<00:03:01.250> by

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
get a little more margin of safety by

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.940 
get a little more margin of safety by
putting<00:03:03.000> them<00:03:03.150> up<00:03:03.300> there<00:03:03.650> because<00:03:04.650> you'll

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
putting them up there because you'll

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.800 
putting them up there because you'll
have<00:03:05.130> more<00:03:05.340> time<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.850> react<00:03:06.240> if<00:03:06.480> they<00:03:06.540> get

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
have more time to react if they get

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.230 
have more time to react if they get
attacked<00:03:07.140> if<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:08.370> put<00:03:08.580> them<00:03:08.730> down<00:03:08.940> further

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
attacked if you put them down further

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.760 
attacked if you put them down further
they're<00:03:09.540> going<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.720> get<00:03:09.840> attacked<00:03:10.170> more<00:03:10.440> often

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
they're going to get attacked more often

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.100 
they're going to get attacked more often
by<00:03:10.950> no<00:03:11.010> hunters<00:03:11.580> by<00:03:11.850> ogres<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.540> they<00:03:12.900> may<00:03:13.080> end

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
by no hunters by ogres and they may end

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.610 
by no hunters by ogres and they may end
up<00:03:13.380> just<00:03:13.560> being<00:03:13.650> dead<00:03:14.190> most<00:03:14.460> of<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.700> time<00:03:15.620> now

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
up just being dead most of the time now

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.680

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
practice to get used to doing that jump
