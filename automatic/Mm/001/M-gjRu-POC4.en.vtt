so hi there
this<00:00:03.840> is<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.910> small<00:00:06.350> walkthrough<00:00:07.350> -<00:00:07.589> playing

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
this is a small walkthrough - playing

Black<00:00:08.639> Swan<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:10.070> acoustic<00:00:11.070> version<00:00:11.099> by<00:00:12.030> Tom

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.570 
Black Swan the acoustic version by Tom
New<00:00:12.360> York<00:00:12.920> the<00:00:13.920> one<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.280> he<00:00:15.440> played<00:00:16.440> in

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
New York the one that he played in

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.779 
New York the one that he played in
latitude<00:00:18.080> so<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.500> basic<00:00:19.800> tuning<00:00:20.189> for<00:00:20.580> this

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
latitude so the basic tuning for this

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.099 
latitude so the basic tuning for this
song<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> drop<00:00:21.630> D<00:00:21.949> so<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:22.980> tuned<00:00:23.279> down<00:00:23.519> your

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
song is a drop D so you tuned down your

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:31.130 
song is a drop D so you tuned down your
top<00:00:25.109> e<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.590> 6<00:00:25.800> e<00:00:25.980> string<00:00:26.460> 2<00:00:26.820> T<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.929> rest

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
top e the 6 e string 2 T and the rest

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.420 
top e the 6 e string 2 T and the rest
remains<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.040> same<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:33.899> entire<00:00:34.800> song<00:00:35.130> is

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
remains the same so the entire song is

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.250 
remains the same so the entire song is
just<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.149> repeat<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.809> couple<00:00:37.170> of

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
just a repeat of a couple of

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.810 
just a repeat of a couple of
progressions<00:00:39.260> so<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.559> first<00:00:41.210> you<00:00:42.210> start<00:00:42.570> with

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
progressions so the first you start with

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:59.960 
progressions so the first you start with
the<00:00:44.820> shape<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:48.469> 7<00:00:50.030> X<00:00:51.590> 0<00:00:52.910> 5<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:55.260> pick

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.200 

the<00:01:00.510> sixth<00:01:00.870> string<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:02.370> fourth<00:01:02.579> string<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the sixth string the fourth string and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.250 
the sixth string the fourth string and
the<00:01:03.270> third<00:01:03.450> string<00:01:05.420> that's<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.660> first<00:01:07.020> part

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the third string that's the first part

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.040 
the third string that's the first part
and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.100> move<00:01:08.430> through<00:01:09.360> down<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
and then you move through down to the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:31.649 
and then you move through down to the
third<00:01:10.290> string<00:01:10.590> now<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:12.030> play<00:01:12.530> 5<00:01:13.850> X<00:01:15.260> 0<00:01:16.260> &amp;<00:01:18.140> 4

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:44.830 

then<00:01:32.659> you're<00:01:32.810> doing<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:37.549> the<00:01:40.270> 10th<00:01:41.270> fret<00:01:43.840> the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
then you're doing to the 10th fret the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:56.940 
then you're doing to the 10th fret the
same<00:01:45.049> positions<00:01:45.560> or<00:01:46.179> 10x<00:01:47.409> 0<00:01:48.939> 9

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:11.030 

0x0<00:01:58.480> ten

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:18.690 

so<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.100> just<00:02:15.540> change<00:02:16.540> around<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:18.040> sixth

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
so you just change around the sixth

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.510 
so you just change around the sixth
string<00:02:19.000> first<00:02:19.960> on<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.740> ten<00:02:20.920> string<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.370> then

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
string first on the ten string and then

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.870 
string first on the ten string and then
playing

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.880 

and<00:02:29.420> there<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.050> small<00:02:30.260> fill<00:02:32.680> during<00:02:33.680> the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
and there is a small fill during the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:44.440 
and there is a small fill during the
second<00:02:34.460> time<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.760> leave<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:43.240> so<00:02:44.240> that's

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
second time you leave this so that's

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.340 
second time you leave this so that's
picking<00:02:45.080> from<00:02:47.050> ten<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:49.640> eight<00:02:50.210> on<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:51.200> B

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
picking from ten to eight on the B

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:01.650 
picking from ten to eight on the B
string

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.840 

so<00:03:02.080> that's<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.440> that's<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.770> entire<00:03:03.160> song<00:03:03.520> I'll

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
so that's it that's the entire song I'll

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.430 
so that's it that's the entire song I'll
play<00:03:04.270> this<00:03:04.510> riff<00:03:04.750> once<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:07.410> practice<00:03:08.410> a

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
play this riff once and practice a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.910 
play this riff once and practice a
little<00:03:08.650> more<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.280> we've<00:03:09.490> got<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:10.920> acoustic

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
little more and we've got the acoustic

00:03:11.920 --> 00:04:02.710 
little more and we've got the acoustic

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.390
