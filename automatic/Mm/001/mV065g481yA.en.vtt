[DIALING PHONE]

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.920
SNUFFALUFFAGUS (ON
PHONE): Hello.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.730
We're not here right now.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.320
Please leave a message
after the beep.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.306
BIG BIRD: Oh, rats, it's
an answering machine.

00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:14.886
[BEEP]

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:15.530
BIG BIRD: Hi, Snuffy?

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.100
It's me, your old
pal, Big Bird.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.640
I sure wish I could talk to
you in person, but I--

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.290
I guess I'll have to leave
you a little message.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.115
I sure do miss you, Snuffy.

00:00:24.115 --> 00:00:26.032
I wish Christmas would end.

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:28.545
See, I've gotten lots
of presents, but not

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:29.875
the one I want most.

00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:35.890
(SINGING) I don't want
anything that

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.455
you pull on a string.

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:41.590
All I want for Christmas
is you.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.620
So jacks and a ball wouldn't
please me at all.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.060
All I want for Christmas
is you.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.230
I don't need some crayons
or an automobile.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.515
Just a shaggy person who
can feel what I feel.

00:00:56.515 --> 00:01:01.430
A necktie is neat, and shoes
are a treat, but they can't

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.680
make me smile when I'm blue.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.560
Don't get me picture book
to color and trace.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.900
Don't buy me a rocket ship
that goes into space.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.680
All I need's a buddy with
a smile on his face.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.290
All I want for Christmas
is you.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.200
(SPEAKING) Uh, you can't see
it, Snuffy, but I'm doing a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.116
little dance, 'cause I'm happy
I'm talking to you.

00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:31.585
And I never danced on the
telephone before.

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:33.547
Now dancing in a
little circle.

00:01:33.547 --> 00:01:37.290
Now I'm doing a little
soft-shoe.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.200
(SINGING) A necktie is neat,
and shoes are a treat, but

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.870
they can't make me smile
when I'm blue.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.810
I don't need a hula hoop,
a top, or a ball.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.275
Don't get me a cuckoo clock
to hang on the wall.

00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:56.256
All I want is Snuffy, who's
my best friend of all.

00:01:56.256 --> 00:01:59.986
All I want for Christmas
is you.

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:04.454
All I want for Christmas
is you.

00:02:04.454 --> 00:02:10.329
All I want for Christmas
is you.
