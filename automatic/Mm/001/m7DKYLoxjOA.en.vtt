00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.420 
pull the paint out to the tip this is
usually<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.020> matter<00:01:35.320> of<00:01:35.470> patience<00:01:36.159> you<00:01:36.190> just

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
usually a matter of patience you just

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.310 
usually a matter of patience you just
got<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.730> keep<00:01:36.909> doing<00:01:37.330> that<00:01:37.420> repetitive<00:01:37.960> motion

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
got to keep doing that repetitive motion

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.880 
got to keep doing that repetitive motion
until<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.130> paint<00:01:39.400> comes<00:01:39.820> on<00:01:40.210> down<00:01:40.690> so<00:01:41.260> this<00:01:41.830> is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
until the paint comes on down so this is

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.710 
until the paint comes on down so this is
why<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:42.159> started<00:01:42.700> all<00:01:42.940> of<00:01:43.060> them<00:01:43.210> before<00:01:43.540> I<00:01:43.600> did

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
why I started all of them before I did

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.180 
why I started all of them before I did
the<00:01:43.780> video<00:01:43.870> cuz<00:01:44.170> can<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.470> imagine<00:01:44.650> if<00:01:44.950> I<00:01:45.040> had

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
the video cuz can you imagine if I had

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.800 
the video cuz can you imagine if I had
to<00:01:45.280> show<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:45.520> ten<00:01:45.940> of<00:01:46.090> these<00:01:46.240> that<00:01:46.540> would<00:01:46.630> be<00:01:46.780> a

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
to show you ten of these that would be a

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.899 
to show you ten of these that would be a
little<00:01:47.110> bit<00:01:47.409> endless<00:01:47.830> so<00:01:48.280> here<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.520> go<00:01:48.640> I<00:01:48.670> can

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
little bit endless so here you go I can

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.520 
little bit endless so here you go I can

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
face and see exactly where I want to

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.559 
face and see exactly where I want to
place<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.990> circle<00:02:17.470> I'm<00:02:18.040> going<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.250> go<00:02:18.370> ahead

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
place the circle I'm going to go ahead

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.370 
place the circle I'm going to go ahead
trace<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.780> circle

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
trace a circle

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.250 
trace a circle
and<00:02:20.620> then<00:02:21.370> it's<00:02:21.580> just<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.880> matter<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:22.260> finding

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
and then it's just a matter of finding

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.530 
and then it's just a matter of finding
the<00:02:23.590> areas<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.460> face<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.940> are<00:02:24.970> important

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
the areas of the face that are important

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.930 
the areas of the face that are important
so<00:02:25.900> I'm<00:02:26.470> going<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.710> go<00:02:26.830> ahead<00:02:26.980> hit<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.580> nose

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
so I'm going to go ahead hit that nose

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.380 
so I'm going to go ahead hit that nose
area<00:02:28.570> define<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.830> into<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.310> brow<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:31.270> don't

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
area define it into the brow you don't

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.450 
area define it into the brow you don't
have<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.570> be<00:02:31.660> too<00:02:31.960> careful<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.130> know<00:02:33.250> if

actually<00:03:38.980> did<00:03:39.430> two<00:03:39.760> steps<00:03:40.210> in<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:40.720> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
actually did two steps in that so the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.140 
actually did two steps in that so the
first<00:03:41.050> step<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:41.440> I<00:03:41.620> took<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.130> smaller<00:03:42.670> size<00:03:43.120> of

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
first step is I took the smaller size of

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.560 
first step is I took the smaller size of
the<00:03:43.630> pen<00:03:44.380> touch<00:03:44.680> color<00:03:45.100> pen<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:46.210> just<00:03:46.420> did

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
the pen touch color pen and I just did

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.270 
the pen touch color pen and I just did
the<00:03:46.690> outline<00:03:46.870> real<00:03:47.590> close<00:03:47.860> and<00:03:47.890> easy<00:03:48.100> and

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
the outline real close and easy and

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.560 
the outline real close and easy and
that's<00:03:48.340> because<00:03:48.610> I<00:03:48.700> feel<00:03:48.940> like<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.210> have<00:03:49.360> better

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.350 
that's because I feel like I have better
control<00:03:49.840> over<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:51.160> smaller<00:03:51.880> ship<00:03:52.090> because<00:03:52.270> I

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
control over the smaller ship because I

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.240 
control over the smaller ship because I
am<00:03:52.480> very<00:03:52.690> messy<00:03:53.140> you<00:03:53.500> may<00:03:53.650> be<00:03:53.710> a<00:03:53.800> person<00:03:53.950> who

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250
