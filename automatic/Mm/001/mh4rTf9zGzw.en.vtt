00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
 I welcome subscribers and all who 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.770
 for the first time on my channel today June 1 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.320
 it's been a week since we 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.950
 planted tomatoes in the greenhouse it's time to 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.460
 tie no garters I will 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.090
 use jute rope like this 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.539
 she looks her you can buy in any 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.310
 the hardware store is undesirable for 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.400
 garters use just such 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.149
 kapron thread because by the end 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.010
 of summer it breaks into small pieces 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.230
 so that it was convenient to tie tomatoes 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.239
 attached to a metal frame 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.239
 steel wire greenhouses 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:52.450
 in this place i made a hole and i 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:57.650
 secured and here is 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:01.030
 horizontal pieces of iron and here it is 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.030
 that's just me 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:11.860
 its at the end of the greenhouse it is fixed 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:16.740
 similarly this series 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:19.840
 I pulled for tall tomatoes 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:25.690
 also pulled another row of wire 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:29.460
 but for undersized bushes like you 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:34.960
 see here these pieces of iron go obliquely 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.320
 so I pass the wire through these 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.320
 pieces of iron 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.030
 let me show you how 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.740
 tie up with an example of one bush 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.690
 first you need to make a bundle 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.200
 the eight that is here we are not 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.080
 peretyagivaem so that the stem could freely 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.899
 thicken and then do another such 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:06.009
 the same eyelet and tighten after that 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.190
 so we tie the rope 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.190
 around the bush and fasten it 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.190
 at the top 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.260
 this bush is formed into one stem a 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.500
 if the bush and are formed in two or more 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.280
 stalk like for example this shrub variety 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.230
 White filling 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.090
 then we tie each of the shoots 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.510
 after the tomatoes are tied up to you 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.600
 it will be more convenient to take care of them 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.380
 weeding watering pasynkovanie 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.519
 about how to care for tomatoes in
