down here at the combine but it can be a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.949 
down here at the combine but it can be a

these<00:03:54.230> players<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.859> I<00:03:55.130> think<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.549> for<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.000> lot

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
these players and I think that for a lot

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.030 
these players and I think that for a lot
of<00:03:56.269> players<00:03:56.570> at<00:03:56.989> times<00:03:57.350> can<00:03:57.560> be<00:03:57.709> overwhelming

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
of players at times can be overwhelming

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.789 
of players at times can be overwhelming
but<00:03:58.579> if<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.299> understand<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.049> you<00:04:00.260> understand

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
but if you understand it you understand

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.250 
but if you understand it you understand
the<00:04:00.890> process<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.819> can<00:04:02.000> be<00:04:02.150> obviously<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:03.079> can

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
the process it can be obviously you can

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.030 
the process it can be obviously you can
go<00:04:03.410> through<00:04:03.680> it<00:04:03.709> undaunted<00:04:04.430> as<00:04:04.700> well
