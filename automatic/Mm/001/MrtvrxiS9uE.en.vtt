pictures of this guitar or haven't heard
this<00:00:15.150> guitar<00:00:15.509> being<00:00:15.719> played<00:00:16.049> but<00:00:16.859> I'm<00:00:17.279> told

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
this guitar being played but I'm told

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.279 
this guitar being played but I'm told
this<00:00:17.999> is<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:19.039> Gibson<00:00:20.039> prototype<00:00:20.759> guitar<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.599> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
this is a Gibson prototype guitar of a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.630 
this is a Gibson prototype guitar of a
60s<00:00:23.210> hummingbird<00:00:24.210> artist<00:00:24.869> now<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:26.460> doesn't

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
60s hummingbird artist now that doesn't

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.790 
60s hummingbird artist now that doesn't
make<00:00:26.819> any<00:00:26.999> sense<00:00:27.179> because<00:00:27.659> in<00:00:27.929> the<00:00:28.019> 60s<00:00:28.529> there

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
make any sense because in the 60s there

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.299 
make any sense because in the 60s there
wasn't<00:00:29.249> a<00:00:29.399> hummingbird<00:00:29.970> artist<00:00:30.449> but<00:00:31.309> maybe

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
wasn't a hummingbird artist but maybe

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.310 
wasn't a hummingbird artist but maybe
that's<00:00:32.519> why<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.969> prototype<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.719> what

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that's why it's a prototype so what

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.770 
that's why it's a prototype so what
we're<00:00:34.410> gonna<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.980> cut<00:00:35.969> open<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.300> box<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
we're gonna do is cut open the box and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.110 
we're gonna do is cut open the box and
take<00:00:37.199> tar<00:00:37.679> out<00:00:37.859> and<00:00:38.100> take<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> look<00:00:38.879> at<00:00:38.969> what's

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
take tar out and take a look at what's

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:51.560

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
all right now the guitar is out of the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:03:13.180 
all right now the guitar is out of the
case<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:25.069> as<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.430> can<00:02:25.549> see<00:02:25.609> it<00:02:25.939> says

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.860 

so<00:03:14.190> here<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.460> is<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.390> don't<00:03:15.660> know<00:03:15.720> if<00:03:15.810> you

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
can see the label on the inside but it

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.720 
can see the label on the inside but it
says<00:03:19.830> I<00:03:20.220> guess<00:03:20.520> not

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730

60s<00:03:23.900> hummingbird<00:03:25.970> historic<00:03:26.970> collection<00:03:27.740> and

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
60s hummingbird historic collection and

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.700 
60s hummingbird historic collection and
I<00:03:29.250> think<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.640> shape<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.330> is<00:03:30.360> actually<00:03:30.960> the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
I think the shape of it is actually the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.550 
I think the shape of it is actually the
artist<00:03:32.330> version<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.570> hummingbird<00:03:33.960> and

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
artist version of the hummingbird and

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.670 
artist version of the hummingbird and
there's<00:03:34.860> no<00:03:35.040> hummingbird<00:03:35.790> on<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.030> pickguard

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
there's no hummingbird on the pickguard

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.910 
there's no hummingbird on the pickguard
but<00:03:37.680> he's<00:03:38.310> gonna<00:03:38.430> see<00:03:38.640> there<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.920> historic

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
but he's gonna see there is a historic

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.460 
but he's gonna see there is a historic
stamp<00:03:41.190> on<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:44.060> on<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.150> back<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.660> neck

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.950 

within<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.560> case<00:03:50.420> apparently<00:03:51.420> there's<00:03:51.810> some

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
within the case apparently there's some

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:04.250 
within the case apparently there's some
sort<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:59.450> paperwork<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:01.530> comes<00:04:01.740> with<00:04:03.260> all

collection prototype and we will let it

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.780 
collection prototype and we will let it
sit<00:04:16.020> for<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.260> bit<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.560> then<00:04:16.650> hear<00:04:17.489> how<00:04:17.670> it
