00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.880
 hello, we sit today at eagle 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.500
 with toner hello then world today 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.120
 tell you about the prices you give me 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.300
 always asked for rental prices and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.520
 Let's probably start with Arlene water and tell 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.039
 growth somehow prices and how that far from 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.510
 seas and close to the sea like under that at all 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.599
 completely immersed of equal to 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.050
 kaydarskaya valley that is it is not far 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.750
 to the valley 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.769
 that is from his what cup is here 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.070
 several postage 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.160
 exchange for the fact that the largest is 27 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.610
 kilometers wanted autofield and about there 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.040
 about 50 yalta 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.559
 between Yalta and Sevastopol to the nearest 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.010
 the beach is instead where we sit on 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.489
 about six kilometers to get to the nearest 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.340
 the beach 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.609
 it's just there a little further there 15 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:03.059
 kilometers on the firmware here so let's say 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.339
 dependency again conditions rerun but 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.140
 realistically so it's like 3 times 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.540
 2 times cheaper than 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.540
 coast in this if you have 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.080
 Yes, so I chose here guys came as 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.420
 once this series in the cafe as a collision 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.939
 wadlina from the guys on a motorcycle arrived 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.649
 I thought 6 kilometers here and a bicycle 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.180
 probably if there are principles given can be 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.799
 the beach is probably on his figure just 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.799
 back then from there you're fine 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.830
 give up on 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.780
 so nice case 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.510
 good up 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.010
 natural food to the tower 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.290
 By the way, too, prices where it turns out that 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.770
 cheaper than warmed up the most important he 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.500
 in the morning 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.060
 nice to sit still eyes like you 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.060
 a strand there has never been hot and stuffy 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.390
 so at prices it turns out this is from 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.470
 300 rubles per day per person or per 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.190
 because people can 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:13.300
 new pull football here is the number 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.790
 come in like a shower and bathroom and not 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.240
 that Oleg little corridor you are claws 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.310
 on the street 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.950
 that's how she is basically like a studio 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.660
 apartment as abyss kitchen you can cook 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.670
 buy some products somewhere to 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.680
 lying on a shelf that bogolyub not listen 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.320
 wants but fine i think 300 rubles 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.750
 day it is generally rest in the Crimea data 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.710
 under the micro sim already that dog 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.500
 by the way we remember you in Moscow 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.190
 cooked she say how but this is not true 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.860
 convenient to cook but already veloso we say 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.750
 we wouldn't be bad 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.120
 to cook the prince of course I eat now 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.350

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.630
 this tournament is tricky and still the carcass 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.060
 one more plus road 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.040

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.460
 press on a beach 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.630
 the river is very cool there is a threshold unreal 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.010

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.090

 so in this respect, that is of course 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.830
 gave us does not seem to win definitely 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.370
 plus clay Sevastopol is always possible 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.300

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.090
 big city hang out disco 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.600
 store large markets but definitely 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.580
 worth a mustache or spacious city vessels 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.260
 convenient to play so which one 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.860
