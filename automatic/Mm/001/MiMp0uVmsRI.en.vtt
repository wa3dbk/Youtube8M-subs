00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.249 

there's<00:00:05.700> been<00:00:05.940> certainly<00:00:06.509> some<00:00:06.750> changes

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
there's been certainly some changes

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.860 
there's been certainly some changes
since<00:00:07.680> what<00:00:07.919> was<00:00:08.069> revealed<00:00:08.250> at<00:00:08.550> blizzcon<00:00:09.000> I

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
since what was revealed at blizzcon I

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.350 
since what was revealed at blizzcon I
guess<00:00:10.500> for<00:00:10.650> example<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.250> replicant<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:12.179> no

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
guess for example the replicant is no

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.799 
guess for example the replicant is no
longer<00:00:12.599> there<00:00:13.219> speaking<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.820> you

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
longer there speaking just to that you

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.720 
longer there speaking just to that you
know<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.020> seemed<00:00:16.260> too<00:00:16.379> good<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.619> be<00:00:16.830> true<00:00:16.859> when

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
know it seemed too good to be true when

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.130 
know it seemed too good to be true when
you<00:00:17.850> when<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.029> first<00:00:18.270> saw<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.840> was<00:00:18.960> that

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
you when you first saw it it was that

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.480 
you when you first saw it it was that
just<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> case<00:00:19.680> through<00:00:19.949> your<00:00:20.100> testing<00:00:20.430> you

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
just the case through your testing you

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.429 
just the case through your testing you
realize<00:00:20.760> they're<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.060> far<00:00:21.330> too<00:00:21.359> strong<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
realize they're just far too strong the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.200 
realize they're just far too strong the
biggest<00:00:22.680> problem<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.550> replicant<00:00:24.029> was

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
biggest problem with the replicant was

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.150 
biggest problem with the replicant was
we<00:00:25.080> actually<00:00:25.170> got<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.590> lot<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.769> negative

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
we actually got a lot of negative

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.939 
we actually got a lot of negative
feedback<00:00:26.330> after<00:00:27.330> blizzcon<00:00:27.750> both<00:00:28.470> internally

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
feedback after blizzcon both internally

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.669 
feedback after blizzcon both internally
and externally<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.210> was<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> big

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
and externally so that was a big

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.290 
and externally so that was a big
contributing<00:00:31.679> factor<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.250> another<00:00:32.910> factor

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
contributing factor but another factor

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.250 
contributing factor but another factor
was<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:35.360> unit<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.510> actually<00:00:36.780> reducing

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
was that unit was actually reducing

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260 
was that unit was actually reducing
choice<00:00:37.500> not<00:00:37.800> increasing<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.210> example

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
choice not increasing it so for example

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.299 
choice not increasing it so for example
if<00:00:39.989> I'm<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> Terran<00:00:40.530> player<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.980> up<00:00:41.070> against

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
if I'm a Terran player going up against

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.190 
if I'm a Terran player going up against
the<00:00:41.370> Protoss<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.030> want<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.629> don't<00:00:42.899> want<00:00:43.110> that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the Protoss I want I don't want that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500 
the Protoss I want I don't want that
Protoss<00:00:43.649> player<00:00:43.890> takes<00:00:44.129> each<00:00:44.340> tanks<00:00:44.640> asp<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.450> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
Protoss player takes each tanks asp so I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.850 
Protoss player takes each tanks asp so I
don't<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> build<00:00:45.989> siege<00:00:46.170> tanks<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.739> it's

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
don't want to build siege tanks so it's

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.319 
don't want to build siege tanks so it's
actually<00:00:46.950> reducing<00:00:47.550> choice<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.239> was

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
actually reducing choice so that was

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.080 
actually reducing choice so that was
also<00:00:48.660> another<00:00:48.870> big<00:00:49.649> reason<00:00:50.370> why<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:51.059> decided

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
also another big reason why we decided

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.689 
also another big reason why we decided
to<00:00:51.510> remove<00:00:51.800> i'm<00:00:52.800> sure<00:00:53.039> you've<00:00:53.280> gotten<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
to remove i'm sure you've gotten this a

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.750 
to remove i'm sure you've gotten this a
lot<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.410> this<00:00:55.410> isn't<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.829> much<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.980> gripe<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
lot and this isn't so much a gripe on to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.220 
lot and this isn't so much a gripe on to
the<00:00:56.969> current<00:00:57.270> state<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:57.780> i'm<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.020> wondering

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the current state but i'm just wondering

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.500 
the current state but i'm just wondering
your<00:00:58.649> thoughts<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> move<00:01:00.059> our<00:01:00.300> mean

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
your thoughts on the a move our mean

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
your thoughts on the a move our mean
look<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> Protoss<00:01:01.379> ball<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.890> death<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
look at the Protoss ball of death and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.789 
look at the Protoss ball of death and
with<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.110> give<00:01:04.260> kind<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.650> any

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
with if you can give kind of any

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.560 
with if you can give kind of any
specific<00:01:05.070> examples<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.909> steps<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.299> guys<00:01:06.420> are

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
specific examples of steps you guys are

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.289 
specific examples of steps you guys are
trying<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.900> take<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.409> move<00:01:07.770> away<00:01:07.950> from<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.760> big

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
trying to take to move away from the big

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.020 
trying to take to move away from the big
baseball<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.110> death<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:11.100> hardest<00:01:11.610> one<00:01:11.790> we're

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
baseball of death and hardest one we're

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.390 
baseball of death and hardest one we're
trying<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.450> make<00:01:12.689> each<00:01:13.470> other<00:01:13.680> races<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> little

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
trying to make each other races a little

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.280 
trying to make each other races a little
more<00:01:14.490> diverse<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.570> they<00:01:15.689> are<00:01:15.750> capable<00:01:15.900> of

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
more diverse in what they are capable of

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.080 
more diverse in what they are capable of
doing<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.159> example<00:01:17.280> right<00:01:17.580> now<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:18.000> you

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
doing so for example right now as you

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.600 
doing so for example right now as you
said<00:01:18.330> Protoss<00:01:19.170> players<00:01:19.710> generally<00:01:20.070> speaking

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
said Protoss players generally speaking

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.760 
said Protoss players generally speaking
like<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.240> defend<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.750> until<00:01:22.110> they<00:01:22.229> gather<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
like to defend up until they gather the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.310 
like to defend up until they gather the
perfect<00:01:23.159> force<00:01:23.400> they'd<00:01:24.000> only<00:01:24.119> fail<00:01:25.080> even

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
perfect force they'd only fail even

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.350 
perfect force they'd only fail even
leave<00:01:25.830> their<00:01:26.040> base<00:01:26.280> they<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.880> defend<00:01:27.180> their

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
leave their base they just defend their

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.399 
leave their base they just defend their
and<00:01:27.650> once<00:01:28.650> they're<00:01:28.799> ready<00:01:28.979> they<00:01:29.189> push<00:01:29.400> out<00:01:29.549> for

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
and once they're ready they push out for

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.590 
and once they're ready they push out for
one<00:01:30.499> final<00:01:30.710> push<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.759> that's<00:01:32.090> why<00:01:32.240> we've<00:01:32.450> added

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
one final push so that's why we've added

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.989 
one final push so that's why we've added
units<00:01:33.439> such<00:01:33.560> as<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.979> Oracle<00:01:34.399> or<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:34.640> tempest

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
units such as the Oracle or the tempest

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:36.849 
units such as the Oracle or the tempest
that<00:01:35.329> are<00:01:35.420> good<00:01:35.539> at<00:01:35.630> harassing<00:01:36.079> in<00:01:36.289> any<00:01:36.409> basis

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
that are good at harassing in any basis

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.429 
that are good at harassing in any basis
that<00:01:37.069> are<00:01:37.189> good<00:01:37.520> at<00:01:37.640> picking<00:01:37.850> at<00:01:38.149> any<00:01:39.049> army

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
that are good at picking at any army

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.859 
that are good at picking at any army
stuff<00:01:39.710> like<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.729> we're<00:01:41.119> hoping<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.659> see<00:01:41.840> a

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
stuff like that so we're hoping to see a

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.559 
stuff like that so we're hoping to see a
more<00:01:42.229> variety<00:01:43.189> in<00:01:43.219> terms<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:43.819> being<00:01:44.149> able<00:01:44.299> to

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
more variety in terms of being able to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.309 
more variety in terms of being able to
do<00:01:44.750> not<00:01:45.319> only<00:01:45.679> what<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.039> can<00:01:46.189> do<00:01:46.280> now<00:01:46.429> but<00:01:46.759> also

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
drops in order to be successful so we're

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.080 
drops in order to be successful so we're
kind<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.039> feeling<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.459> I<00:02:04.489> think<00:02:04.759> they<00:02:04.879> are

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
kind of feeling that I think they are

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.999 
kind of feeling that I think they are
like<00:02:05.299> lacking<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:05.840> option<00:02:06.379> of<00:02:06.560> just<00:02:06.739> sitting

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
like lacking that option of just sitting

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.490 
like lacking that option of just sitting
back<00:02:07.159> gathering<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.090> powerful<00:02:08.539> army<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.200> that's

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
back gathering a powerful army so that's

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.589 
back gathering a powerful army so that's
why<00:02:09.619> we<00:02:09.649> decided<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.519> include<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:11.060> three<00:02:11.299> new

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
why we decided to include the three new

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.410 
why we decided to include the three new
mechanical<00:02:12.590> units<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.819> war<00:02:14.030> big

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
mechanical units so that the war big

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.390 
mechanical units so that the war big

big overarching principles you're trying

big overarching principles you're trying

design<00:02:54.260> aspect<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.769> it<00:02:54.889> we're<00:02:55.609> actually<00:02:55.730> going

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
design aspect of it we're actually going

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.420 
design aspect of it we're actually going
with<00:02:56.329> a<00:02:56.359> different<00:02:56.720> approach<00:02:56.959> so<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:58.160> means<00:02:58.310> a

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
with a different approach so it means a

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.490 
with a different approach so it means a
little<00:02:58.609> wings<00:02:59.269> of<00:02:59.419> liberty<00:02:59.750> we<00:02:59.989> didn't<00:03:00.290> have

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
little wings of liberty we didn't have

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.289 
little wings of liberty we didn't have
players<00:03:00.769> playing<00:03:01.099> the<00:03:01.220> game<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:01.549> much<00:03:01.700> like<00:03:02.150> we

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
players playing the game so much like we

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.110 
players playing the game so much like we
do<00:03:02.419> now<00:03:02.569> so<00:03:03.319> we're<00:03:03.709> actually<00:03:03.889> we<00:03:04.669> incur<00:03:04.940> the

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
do now so we're actually we incur the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.130 
problems that are any wings of liberty
and<00:03:08.950> trying<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.400> address<00:03:09.850> them<00:03:10.090> between<00:03:10.480> bring

and trying to address them between bring

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.130 
and trying to address them between bring
in<00:03:11.260> new<00:03:11.410> units<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.880> specifically<00:03:13.570> counter

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
in new units and specifically counter

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.330 
in new units and specifically counter
those<00:03:14.550> problems<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.860> ballot<00:03:18.160> side

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
those problems and the ballot side

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.240 
those problems and the ballot side
actually<00:03:18.550> we<00:03:19.530> learned<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.620> lot<00:03:20.710> of<00:03:20.830> lessons<00:03:21.010> I

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
actually we learned a lot of lessons I

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.850 
actually we learned a lot of lessons I
think<00:03:21.280> throughout<00:03:21.970> throughout<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:23.200> past<00:03:23.440> and

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
think throughout throughout the past and

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.790 
think throughout throughout the past and
I<00:03:24.280> think<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.060> biggest<00:03:25.209> thing<00:03:25.480> is<00:03:25.840> it's<00:03:26.650> not

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
I think the biggest thing is it's not

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.949 
I think the biggest thing is it's not
just<00:03:26.860> about<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.730> changes<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.120> we<00:03:28.390> make<00:03:28.540> but

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
just about the changes that we make but

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.320 
just about the changes that we make but
it's<00:03:29.110> also<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:30.430> balance<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:30.970> game<00:03:31.150> is

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
it's also the balance of the game is

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.510 
it's also the balance of the game is
dependent<00:03:31.780> on<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.100> skill<00:03:33.100> level<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.459> the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
dependent on the skill level of the

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.640 
dependent on the skill level of the
players<00:03:33.820> as<00:03:34.090> well<00:03:34.120> as<00:03:34.420> how<00:03:34.630> innovative<00:03:35.050> their

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
players as well as how innovative their

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.440 
players as well as how innovative their
new<00:03:35.860> strategies<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.430> get<00:03:36.550> me<00:03:36.730> when<00:03:37.180> we<00:03:37.300> make

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
new strategies to get me when we make

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.650 
new strategies to get me when we make
changes<00:03:37.630> so<00:03:38.500> what<00:03:39.340> we've<00:03:39.459> learned<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:40.060> is<00:03:40.390> that

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
changes so what we've learned it is that

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.040 
changes so what we've learned it is that
whenever<00:03:41.020> we<00:03:41.200> take<00:03:41.709> big<00:03:42.010> steps<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:43.630> results

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
whenever we take big steps the results

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.940 
whenever we take big steps the results
are<00:03:44.170> way<00:03:44.470> too<00:03:44.530> crazy<00:03:44.890> so<00:03:45.280> we<00:03:45.400> try<00:03:45.550> to<00:03:45.580> go<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:47.739> try

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
are way too crazy so we try to go we try

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.229 
are way too crazy so we try to go we try
to<00:03:47.980> move<00:03:48.250> in<00:03:48.430> smaller<00:03:48.700> steps<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:51.150> just<00:03:52.150> in

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
to move in smaller steps and just in

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.490 
to move in smaller steps and just in
general<00:03:52.590> having<00:03:53.590> tried<00:03:54.489> a<00:03:55.080> large<00:03:56.080> number<00:03:56.470> of

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
general having tried a large number of

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.410 
general having tried a large number of
malice<00:03:56.950> changes<00:03:57.370> in<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.580> live<00:03:57.700> game<00:03:57.730> as<00:03:58.209> well

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
malice changes in the live game as well

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.530 
malice changes in the live game as well
as<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.840> beta<00:03:59.080> in<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.560> past<00:03:59.800> I<00:04:00.459> think<00:04:01.060> were

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
as the beta in the past I think were

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.870 
as the beta in the past I think were
kind<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.320> why<00:04:02.470> like<00:04:02.650> going<00:04:02.830> to<00:04:03.100> handle<00:04:03.700> issues

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
kind of why like going to handle issues

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.949 
kind of why like going to handle issues
that<00:04:04.270> arise<00:04:04.630> due<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.140> dude<00:04:05.320> it's<00:04:06.420> yes<00:04:07.420> and

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
that arise due to the dude it's yes and

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.420 
that arise due to the dude it's yes and
obviously<00:04:08.380> a<00:04:08.530> lot<00:04:08.680> of<00:04:08.800> this<00:04:08.890> testing<00:04:09.310> will

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
obviously a lot of this testing will

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.039 
obviously a lot of this testing will
happen<00:04:09.760> probably<00:04:09.970> beta<00:04:10.450> you've<00:04:10.690> got<00:04:10.870> you<00:04:10.989> how

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
happen probably beta you've got you how

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.920 
happen probably beta you've got you how
to<00:04:11.110> get<00:04:11.290> balance<00:04:11.680> for<00:04:11.920> release<00:04:12.780> that's<00:04:13.780> a

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
to get balance for release that's a

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.380 
to get balance for release that's a
little<00:04:14.049> bit<00:04:14.290> good<00:04:14.440> any<00:04:14.799> current<00:04:15.700> testing<00:04:16.150> on<00:04:16.359> a

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
little bit good any current testing on a

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.780 
little bit good any current testing on a
professional<00:04:16.690> level<00:04:17.109> or<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:17.769> all<00:04:17.890> internal

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
professional level or is it all internal

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.610 
professional level or is it all internal
at<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:19.000> moment<00:04:19.330> no<00:04:19.479> it's<00:04:19.989> all<00:04:20.140> internal<00:04:20.440> like

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
at the moment no it's all internal like

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.909 
at the moment no it's all internal like
a<00:04:20.650> moment<00:04:21.010> actually<00:04:21.700> MLG<00:04:22.419> is<00:04:22.479> the<00:04:23.410> first<00:04:23.620> times

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
a moment actually MLG is the first times

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.640 
a moment actually MLG is the first times
that<00:04:24.160> people<00:04:24.970> have<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.300> glimpse<00:04:25.540> at<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.810> beta

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
that people have a glimpse at the beta

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.480 
that people have a glimpse at the beta
preview<00:04:26.979> build<00:04:27.210> this<00:04:28.210> will<00:04:29.169> probably<00:04:29.500> be<00:04:29.890> very

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
preview build this will probably be very

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.980 
preview build this will probably be very
similar<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.419> what<00:04:31.690> we<00:04:31.780> have<00:04:31.900> in<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.110> beta

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
similar to what we have in the beta

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.610 
similar to what we have in the beta
and<00:04:34.060> maybe<00:04:35.060> closer<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:35.690> beta<00:04:35.870> or<00:04:36.140> if<00:04:36.440> not

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
and maybe closer to the beta or if not

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.920 
and maybe closer to the beta or if not
within<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.190> beta<00:04:37.430> will<00:04:37.850> get<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.180> pros<00:04:38.660> to

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
within the beta will get the pros to

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.410 
within the beta will get the pros to
look<00:04:39.050> at<00:04:39.200> it<00:04:39.290> in

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
look at it in

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.300 
look at it in
yeah<00:04:41.420> and<00:04:41.690> speaking<00:04:42.590> of<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.740> professional

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
yeah and speaking of the professional

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.100 
yeah and speaking of the professional
professional<00:04:44.210> level<00:04:44.480> we're<00:04:44.630> here<00:04:44.780> at<00:04:44.870> MLG

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
professional level we're here at MLG

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.540 
professional level we're here at MLG
right<00:04:45.470> now<00:04:47.260> implementing<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.650> new<00:04:48.680> units<00:04:49.280> is

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
right now implementing the new units is

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.630 
right now implementing the new units is
obviously<00:04:49.970> going<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.270> be<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.420> major<00:04:50.690> shift<00:04:51.230> in

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
obviously going to be a major shift in

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.280 
obviously going to be a major shift in
strategic<00:04:52.640> play<00:04:52.880> things<00:04:53.600> employers<00:04:53.810> need<00:04:54.170> to

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
strategic play things employers need to

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.380 
strategic play things employers need to
do<00:04:54.470> how<00:04:55.280> is<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:55.550> being<00:04:55.730> handled<00:04:56.180> a

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
do how is that being handled a

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.940 
do how is that being handled a
professional<00:04:56.960> tournaments<00:04:57.410> such<00:04:57.530> as<00:04:57.740> this

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
professional tournaments such as this

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.040 
professional tournaments such as this
are<00:04:58.250> we<00:04:58.940> already<00:04:59.240> expecting<00:04:59.660> people<00:04:59.900> just

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
are we already expecting people just

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.210 
are we already expecting people just
pick<00:05:00.200> it<00:05:00.230> up<00:05:00.410> gung-ho<00:05:00.620> or<00:05:00.980> we're<00:05:01.070> going<00:05:01.160> to

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
pick it up gung-ho or we're going to

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.530 
pick it up gung-ho or we're going to
stick<00:05:01.430> with<00:05:01.460> wings<00:05:01.730> Liberty<00:05:02.120> for<00:05:02.330> a<00:05:02.360> while

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
stick with wings Liberty for a while

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.390 
stick with wings Liberty for a while
until<00:05:02.840> it's<00:05:03.200> I<00:05:03.440> guess<00:05:03.860> that's<00:05:04.010> really<00:05:04.220> up<00:05:04.310> to

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
until it's I guess that's really up to

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.120 
until it's I guess that's really up to
the<00:05:04.490> tournament's<00:05:04.880> I<00:05:05.320> guess<00:05:06.320> what<00:05:06.770> we're

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
the tournament's I guess what we're

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.890 
the tournament's I guess what we're
trying<00:05:07.490> to<00:05:07.610> do<00:05:07.820> is<00:05:08.090> we're<00:05:08.390> trying<00:05:08.540> to<00:05:08.750> do<00:05:08.870> our

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
trying to do is we're trying to do our

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.470 
trying to do is we're trying to do our
best<00:05:09.140> job<00:05:09.290> possible<00:05:09.740> so<00:05:10.190> that<00:05:10.360> during<00:05:11.360> the

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
best job possible so that during the

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.080 
best job possible so that during the
beta<00:05:11.600> you<00:05:12.260> can<00:05:12.440> have<00:05:12.890> heart<00:05:13.610> of<00:05:13.670> the<00:05:13.730> swarm<00:05:13.880> as

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
beta you can have heart of the swarm as

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.120 
beta you can have heart of the swarm as
closely<00:05:14.330> balanced<00:05:14.840> as<00:05:15.530> possible<00:05:16.030> so<00:05:18.130> the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
closely balanced as possible so the

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.800 
closely balanced as possible so the
tournament<00:05:19.550> organizers<00:05:20.000> that<00:05:20.240> do<00:05:20.420> want<00:05:20.690> to

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
tournament organizers that do want to

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.440 
tournament organizers that do want to
use<00:05:20.900> heart<00:05:21.080> of<00:05:21.140> this<00:05:21.200> warm<00:05:21.820> have<00:05:22.820> good<00:05:23.270> success

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
use heart of this warm have good success

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.470 
use heart of this warm have good success
as<00:05:23.720> well<00:05:23.900> but<00:05:24.350> I<00:05:24.650> guess<00:05:25.610> that's<00:05:25.940> really<00:05:26.420> a

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
as well but I guess that's really a
