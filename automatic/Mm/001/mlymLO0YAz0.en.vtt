00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello guys I'm gabi and in this episode 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.490
 of surviving as a rookie we will see that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.110
 It is good to provide energy to your team 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.900
 but really what you have to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.090
 analyze is what is the best method for 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.430
 do it as a doctor who has the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.349
 ability to regenerate energy you have 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.650
 two options for when you're in the 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.840
 battlefield one of being very mobile and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.119
 aggressive or be slightly passive and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.170
 support the partners to advance 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.399
 little by little the aggressive one arrives at a place 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.160
 put your tool to recover 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.050
 energy establishes a base of fire and it 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.059
 remove or keep moving when you see 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.329
 that his position has been compromised 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.129
 the passive arrives puts its tool 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.260
 supports the team and is aware of 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.780
 the casualties and the energy of all their 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.609
 companions so which of the two 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.530
 tools works better 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.140
 let's see what advantages and what disadvantages 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.140
 has the first aid bag and the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.089
 first aid kit you wonder why the laugh 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.720
 of the small first aid bag 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.700
 both will generate 100% of life 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.530
 bag or lara in blocks of 10 up 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.820
 reach 100 and the kit in 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.220
 individual values 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.740
 reach 100 and in general it will take what 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.860
 same in regenerating all the energy just 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.020
 around 8.5 seconds if you have 10 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.390
 remaining life points but the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.190
 The difference is in how the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.320
 first aid kit has a range of 4 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.970
 meters means that all 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.830
 soldiers that are within that radius 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.830
 they will be cured without any problem 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.410
 although the soldiers are receiving 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.370
 direct fire the kit will continue 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.370
 working 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.550
 the bag only benefits a 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.680
 soldier and he has to be in a radius 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.090
 2 meters to pick up the bag and 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.090
 it starts to take effect 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.650
 but the bag without activator if the soldier 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.960
 that is being cured get some kind 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.500
 Of damage 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.500
 i 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.870
 here comes the first big difference the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.609
 power kit to be static and 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.730
 sitting in one place until you 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.560
 you completely recover the bag, not the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.780
 bag is still effect although you 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.000
 you are moving what gives you opportunity 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.780
 to keep raising or keep looking 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.120
 a better position to counterattack 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.400
 good provided they do not hurt you 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.189
 if the effect is not interrupted 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.780
 if it has that disadvantage but it is shortened 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.480
 easily when you see that you can 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.939
 unfold a bag every three seconds and 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.920
 the first-aid kit every eight seconds this 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.420
 changes with the improvement of the medical field 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.250
 because you will have twice your 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.260
 tools available for use 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.069
 so this time could be 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.069
 Irrelevant 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.890
 now the medicine cabinet when you put it down 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.110
 at a maximum distance of 4 meters 6 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.570
 meters and throws it jumping 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.200
 the bag falls at a distance of 10 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.680
 meters 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.629
 or 12 meters and jump 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.280
 if you take into account that the streets of 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.290
 bars live in 10 meters 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.180
 this tells you that you could easily 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.159
 help the friend who is crossing the 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.959
 street without exposing themselves so much and can 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.810
 remain mobile when you use the 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.120
 bag compared to the clear medicine cabinet 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.889
 if you are paranoid of energy you can 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.219
 put a bag and a kit in the 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.750
 ground and heal in four seconds 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:18.870
 Very fast is good but I think it is 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.880
 impractical good we have analyzed the 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.490
 positive and negative points of both 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.250
 things now with that we can do the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.740
 following recommendations at first 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.289
 observe your style of play and how you 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.840
 you perform on the battlefield if 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.210
 you have to cover yourself and do a little 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.550
 reserved or rather you take your time 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.889
 to attack the enemy and you like to heal 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.139
 to a large number of colleagues 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.630
 Take the first aid kit will always be your best 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.750
 option for its radius of action and quantity 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.090
 massive crowd that you can help if by 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.130
 the opposite is more like a wolf 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.380
 lonely and you move in few numbers 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.110
 with your patrol, maybe the best is 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.800
 that you use the bag because that's the way 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.720
 will remain 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.970
 and you can use this tool 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.949
 in a very fast way and you'll be 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.590
 concentrated in that small group of 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.060
 people that matter to you so here 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.129
 are those recommendations 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.319
 It really depends on your style and 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.479
 how do you manage to do it but before 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.699
 the whole decision makes an analysis of your 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.190
 role on the battlefield remember 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.430
 that bag much use if you 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.770
 have given it without any effort I hope 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.509
 that this guide has liked guys already 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.940
 They know that any twin uneasiness 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.280
 as a comment and we have social networks 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.509
 facebook and twitter I'm gabi and I 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.509
 dismissal with a big kiss
