percent<00:01:20.470> at<00:01:20.890> this<00:01:21.040> point<00:01:22.230> so<00:01:23.230> as<00:01:23.410> you<00:01:23.440> can<00:01:23.770> see

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
percent at this point so as you can see

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.750 
percent at this point so as you can see
things<00:01:25.420> haven't<00:01:25.960> changed<00:01:26.050> a<00:01:26.590> great<00:01:26.620> deal<00:01:27.130> it's

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
fifty gigabytes so we're going to look

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.040 
fifty gigabytes so we're going to look
at<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.910> as<00:02:25.030> an<00:02:25.150> option<00:02:25.300> before<00:02:25.600> we<00:02:25.870> launched

at that as an option before we launched

at that as an option before we launched

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
it here in the US right now 160

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.450 
it here in the US right now 160
gigabytes<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:29.560> it's<00:02:29.680> possible<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.160> we<00:02:30.310> could

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
gigabytes so it's possible that we could

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.070 
gigabytes so it's possible that we could
see<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:30.730> with<00:02:30.910> maybe<00:02:31.210> two<00:02:31.420> gigs<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.750> ram<00:02:31.900> or

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
see this with maybe two gigs of ram or

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.220 
see this with maybe two gigs of ram or
250<00:02:32.410> gig<00:02:32.560> hard<00:02:32.740> drive<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:33.690> it's<00:02:34.690> still<00:02:34.990> up<00:02:35.140> in

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
250 gig hard drive I it's still up in

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.080 
250 gig hard drive I it's still up in
the<00:02:35.290> air<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.530> can't<00:02:35.890> confirm<00:02:36.070> anything<00:02:36.340> at<00:02:36.910> this

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
the air I can't confirm anything at this

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.190 
the air I can't confirm anything at this
point<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.690> probably<00:02:37.840> wouldn't<00:02:38.080> be<00:02:38.140> the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
point and it probably wouldn't be the

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.450 
point and it probably wouldn't be the
same<00:02:38.350> price<00:02:38.500> point<00:02:38.770> if<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.100> has<00:02:39.220> happened

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
same price point if so it has happened

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.960 
same price point if so it has happened
that's<00:02:39.850> correct<00:02:40.210> 399<00:02:40.840> will<00:02:41.170> go<00:02:41.320> up<00:02:41.530> at<00:02:41.680> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
that's correct 399 will go up at the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.240 
that's correct 399 will go up at the
next<00:02:42.970> go<00:02:43.090> up
