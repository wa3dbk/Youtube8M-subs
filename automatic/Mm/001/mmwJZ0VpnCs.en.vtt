00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.200
 well, nothing, this is a video very, very 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.729
 fast because I've been doing this 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.190
 We have been with these people you see by 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.400
 here mono cookie for with málaga under 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.400
 go 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.890
 sanz de gua is that I did not see it well with 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.150
 the stone then we were here not 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.240
 We knew what to do and we said so 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.970
 we go to the spawn parkour not so 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.680
 now let's see a little how it happens 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.420
 this parkour because I see that it is 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.300
 You are very quiet if you are 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.879
 seeing this, I'm basically going to 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.760
 show you a bit how to pass this to you 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.699
 I'm going to pass it to you as you can see 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.230
 I'm in survival vale so I'm going to 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.090
 pass it to me and you will see that really 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.250
 use any kind of trick or anything 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.470
 to spend it all is basically just that 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.379
 is jumping over there discomfort we go down another 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.879
 time and I explain it from the beginning 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.409
 this ladder is operated serves to raise 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.809
 quick ok you can also go there 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.239
 a desire that there is so here you have to 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.440
 jump from this edge to here here 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.210
 and I suppose that everyone arrives later 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.729
 here you have to do as a jump 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.350
 spinning like this and going up the stairs if 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.180
 It costs you if you leave Egypt pressed 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.880
 while you are in the air you catch 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.979
 the stairs and so you do not fall down 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.240
 then here in this area this area you have 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.759
 to see that here we have the stairs 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.610
 then highs and tours at the same time beige and 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.020
 osaka you go to these and upload the same here 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.689
 you see we have other stairs here 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.159
 because the same we turn and we jump and already 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.789
 we're practically at the end here is 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.640
 very easy 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.090
 another jump turn and here it will go 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 jumping websites 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.790
 a little bit of the street is worth it 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.250
 well this is already happening this is the server 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.920
 this one that leads with a bit of lip 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.640
 As you know, there have been no donations 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.960
 and then we have as little bit 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.460
 performance on this server but good 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.869
 let's try to continue to see if 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.330
 now it did not happen anymore we jumped 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.390
 next staircase next next 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.460
 next and we are already up now 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.530
 we have already arrived here we can continue 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.450
 for the wall and if you stay around here 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.540
 You can also climb this area 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.989
 from here here you go up here 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.640
 stairs and here comes here the difficult 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:12.680
 for me this is the most complicated part 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.720
 maybe from parkour because you have to 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.000
 run to get there but if you are 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.230
 touching on the wall because it leaves you 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.820
 sprint therefore we have to 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.310
 point a bit far 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.890
 sprint there are skips and tours you see and so 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.540
 up is a bit technical worth only 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.840
 he has to learn to do a little 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.260
 this and that's how it works and we're already 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.540
 up we go up is more here we can 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.700
 normal jump a jump with spin now 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.720
 will go here when we leave in which 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.570
 quiet 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.440
 it already 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.440
 up the eps 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.660
 good this this works has worked 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.290
 fantastically as you see, it works 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.530
 everything very well does not finish going well 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.450
 now yes now if we add here and a 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.250
 corner jump and that night I jump 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.400
 corner we jump and we arrived here 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.320
 up where is jon and nicolás and here 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.990
 we have the posters so good and 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.850
 You know if I ever arrive up here 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.140
 you send a capture of you by 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.090
 example like that something on top of the tower 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.880
 you send me a skype capture 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.920
 example and that 's it and here he sends me 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.300
 capture and I will put you in the section 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.010
 of this one of the posters so I hope 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.540
 has liked this video do not know if 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.400
 will go up before or after the special 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.990
 2000 subs but good this has been everything and 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.990
 see you in the next goodbye
