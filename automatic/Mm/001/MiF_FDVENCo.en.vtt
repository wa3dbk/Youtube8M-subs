00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.230
 hello very good virtual guardians 6 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.150
 of universities has dotcom and in 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.720
 this video we are going to talk about bungee 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.820
 weekly dates of this week in addition to 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.310
 some news that we are having 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.980
 of the game of the next expansion of 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.890
 destination we are seems in a marathon of 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.259
 news so let's go to 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.480
 take this opportunity to expand a 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.910
 little content since in this week 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.309
 the weekly has been short 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.410
 gates without more of the option we started with 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.570
 the show 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.280
 as I mentioned they are not few 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.260
 developments that have emerged during this 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.900
 week on the expansion the king of the 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.489
 possessed however bungee states that 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.640
 there are still many things to show 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.430
 apparently they will be shown with 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.080
 retransmissions by tweets but now 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.750
 we have some of the new ones 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.580
 details one of the most news 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.309
 expected is the confirmation that 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.110
 We can keep our level level 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.270
 of light will not be suppressed but rather 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.160
 It will change its functionality which now 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.930
 is to determine the value of our 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.240
 guard regardless of the level 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.060
 some of the missions require certain 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.830
 light level to be completed 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.630
 thus ensure the need for 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.369
 good equipment independently 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.100
 of the level that we have the minimum level 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.750
 to play the expansion will be 26 and 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.910
 all those who do not meet that 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.280
 requirement may use the enhancer that 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.920
 comes with every copy of the expansion of 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.720
 recommends using it to discover new 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.180
 classes in case we already meet 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.770
 the requirements apparently we will arrange 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.950
 of a new game modality in the 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.229
 battleship called the court of orix this 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.070
 it's a public activity , something that 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.900
 it makes you think that it is 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.510
 will perform in the scan mode of 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.580
 battleship in this the players will 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.770
 face together against final bosses 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.380
 as they will remember in the old 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.910
 Bungee news summary distributed the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.920

 now he has distributed 50 blacksmith headquarters to 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.580
 those works that have considered 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.580
 deserving 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.040
