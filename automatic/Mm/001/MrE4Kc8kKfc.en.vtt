air<00:00:48.719> cleaner<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> fact<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.770> is

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
air cleaner I think is the fact this is

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.979 
air cleaner I think is the fact this is
a<00:00:49.980> forward-facing<00:00:50.700> air<00:00:51.120> cleaner<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.930> this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
a forward-facing air cleaner so and this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.150 
a forward-facing air cleaner so and this
is<00:00:52.140> mounted<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> bike<00:00:52.770> instead<00:00:53.070> of

is mounted to the bike instead of

banging<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.050> knee<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.440> actually

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
banging you in the knee it actually

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.650 
banging you in the knee it actually
makes<00:00:55.980> an<00:00:56.100> abrupt<00:00:56.399> 90<00:00:56.699> degree<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.090> faces<00:00:57.539> the

front<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> motorcycle<00:00:58.440> gives<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.280> super

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
front of the motorcycle gives a super

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.180

racy super aggressive look one of the
other<00:01:02.309> things<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.699> think<00:01:02.730> that's<00:01:03.059> really

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
other things I think that's really

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.410 
other things I think that's really
really<00:01:04.199> unique<00:01:04.350> about<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.180> actually

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
really unique about this is is actually

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.670 
really unique about this is is actually
very<00:01:06.689> subtle<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.080> kind<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.290> hard<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.470> tell

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
very subtle it's kind of hard to tell

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.649 
very subtle it's kind of hard to tell
you<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> front<00:01:08.939> plate<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.420> held

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
you can see here the front plate is held

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
you can see here the front plate is held
on<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.380> what<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.560> might<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:10.830> notice<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.700> that

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
on but what you might not notice is that

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.550 
on but what you might not notice is that
these<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:12.030> actually<00:01:12.299> spokes<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.290> thing<00:01:13.470> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
these are actually spokes this thing is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200 
these are actually spokes this thing is
actually<00:01:13.650> laced<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> wheel<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.119> I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
actually laced just like a wheel is I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.310 
actually laced just like a wheel is I
think<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.630> interesting<00:01:15.720> I've<00:01:16.110> never

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
think it's really interesting I've never
