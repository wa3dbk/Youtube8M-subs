00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 very good all the people I will bring the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.750
 review of an app of the app 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.910
 elector it's worth it's called fink and that 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.880
 basically it will allow us to know 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.429
 who is on our connected router 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.830
 ok to see how I explain it is going to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.720
 allow to see all the ip addresses 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.670
 which has our router connected to the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.080
 instant is how you will see here 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.840
 this application is completely 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.730
 free of apple and is used to 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.830
 iphone 5 weighs very little worth and is 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.990
 quite quite useful and I think the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.690
 Development according to Spanish and good 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.250
 but I'm here a couple of screenshots 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.520
 but well I have it installed let's go 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.520
 open it 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.960
 here I have my wifi network is worth with you 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.120
 all the systems that I have 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.100
 connected as in the first 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.290
 the first one is the router this is my 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.440
 iphone these are two printers that 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.019
 we have the ipad at home and it gives good play 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.969
 to see you each one will tell you the ip 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.269
 that is connected can talk too 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.640
 instantly disconnect what the 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.350
 changes will be seen instantaneously 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.729
 Instantly in the application it's worth 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.729
 and here go the ipad wifi right now 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.160
 and I'm going to see it connect 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.620
 and let's see ipad 3 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.500
 now we see my ipad is already connected to 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.060
 to the router and I'm going to use my internet 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.010
 iPad and I'll see if the application is 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.630
 able to analyze me if it is to be 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.630
 consuming data from this terminal 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.120
 it's a pretty useful application if 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.060
 you suspect that someone is 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.430
 has managed to break your wifi password 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.490
 will you be able to know if 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.020
 they have hacked it if whoever has 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.870
 connected you can see until 3 there are 3 of 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.240
 your device and good of you that 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.040
 here my ipad was me if it does not put there 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.600
 signs or iPhone which means I 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.760
 I just went on an appointment and reloaded the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.340
 data is worth now I'm going to disconnect the 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.320
 wifi and good is a pretty application 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.240
 quite useful but this one here all 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.390
 the data you have can make a 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.970
 account to have more access is but I 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.459
 I do not need it, I know it's enough for me 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.440
 time and good basically here I have 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.500
 you will also tell him 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.520
 they will be able to enter inside their terminal 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.370
 let's say and change the name of your 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.440
 It is a connected device too 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.270
 can here put notes so that 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.770
 quite interesting enough if you get 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.000
 to this icon you can select the type 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:45.010
 of let's see type d 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.030
 device that is connecting to 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.440
 through the router I have to 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.430
 select my iphone 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.350
 and well basically that's all 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.660
 I believe that the rule can go down 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.960
 here it is not very difficult that we say of 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.840
 use is pretty cool simple free 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.150
 and well I hope you like it and I 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.950
 I think I 'm leaving the video here and 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.240
 well basically that's all I hope that 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.070
