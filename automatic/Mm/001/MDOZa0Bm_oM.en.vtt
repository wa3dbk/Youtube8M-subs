00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the other I think it's just like what

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.510 
the other I think it's just like what
you<00:02:03.810> said<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> kind<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.290> has<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.590> waxy<00:02:05.130> it's

you said it kind of has like a waxy it's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.210 
you said it kind of has like a waxy it's
a<00:02:05.640> little<00:02:05.880> bit

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
a little bit

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.590 
a little bit
it's<00:02:06.520> because<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.240> little<00:02:07.420> bit<00:02:07.510> more

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
it's because it's a little bit more

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.910 
it's because it's a little bit more
drawing<00:02:07.870> like<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.170> said<00:02:08.380> it<00:02:08.470> doesn't<00:02:08.560> bleed
