 Hi! 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.440
 I am Veronika and I would like to show you a revolutionary innovation in remote control cars. 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.080
 This is I-Drive. 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.640
 An intelligent car that you control only by moving your hand. 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.780
 And with the help of this little control wristband, you place it on your wrist. 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.900
 The car reacts very sensitively to the movement of your hand and you hand determine the speed and direction of the car. 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.120
 Controlling this car is unconventional, and after a few minutes of training you will find it very simple. 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.940
 Even small children can handle it. 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.780
 The manufacturer's recommended age for using this car is 6 years. 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.480
 You will need to purchase 5 AA batteries and a remote control then 2 micro pencils. 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 Putting the car into operation is very simple. 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.740
 Switch the switch to the "On" position on the bottom of the car. 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.740
 Put your bracelet on your hand and attach it with Velcro. 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:23.800
 Then just press the button on the top of the controller, the red indicator will light up and wait a few seconds for the car to connect. 

00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:26.034
 And then the right ride can start. 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.900
 You move the car by moving your hand. 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.020
 Tilt your hand down to drive the car forward. 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.540
 By tilting her hand up, the car goes back. 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.940
 You then tilt the palm from side to side to make the turn. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.420
 If you want the car to stand straight, you will also have a hand in the plane. 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.300
 The I-Drive is a new generation of remote-controlled cars. You no longer need to hold any large remote control in your hands. 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.260
 This car is 25 cm big, it runs at 2,4GHz and in our e-shop you can find it in three colors ... 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.260
 ... blue, yellow and red. 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.640
 I hope you like this little boy and you will be delighted with his use. 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.740
 Thanks a lot and I'll look forward to the next video again, hello.
