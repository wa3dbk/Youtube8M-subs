00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.200 
starting off it's three riffs the whole
song<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:43.079> literally<00:01:43.500> three<00:01:43.890> riffs<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210

third<00:01:45.509> riff<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.439> an<00:01:46.619> extension<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
first riff yeah it's I think the song is

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.999 
first riff yeah it's I think the song is
a<00:01:53.299> kind<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.390> them<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.960> probably<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.770> meant

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
a kind of them is probably kind of meant

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.179 
a kind of them is probably kind of meant
as<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.219> filler<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.360> album<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.530> don't

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
as a filler on the album but I don't

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.800 
as a filler on the album but I don't
think<00:01:59.460> any<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> other<00:01:59.939> songs<00:02:00.329> sounded

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
think any of the other songs sounded

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.760 
think any of the other songs sounded
like<00:02:00.990> good<00:02:01.469> titles<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:03.840> could<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.170> wrong<00:02:04.350> it's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
like good titles it could be wrong it's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.709 
like good titles it could be wrong it's
just<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.130> guess<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.969> turned<00:02:06.210> out<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.479> be<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
just a guess but it turned out to be the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.040 
just a guess but it turned out to be the
title<00:02:06.930> song<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.560> album

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
title song of the album

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.120 
title song of the album
nothing<00:02:08.290> else<00:02:08.440> probably<00:02:08.620> sounded<00:02:08.950> good

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
nothing else probably sounded good

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.100 
nothing else probably sounded good
because<00:02:09.430> there's<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.300> think<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:10.870> my<00:02:10.990> opinion

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
because there's I think in my opinion

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.900 
because there's I think in my opinion
there's<00:02:11.530> much<00:02:11.680> better<00:02:11.860> songs<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.550> album

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
there's much better songs on the album

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
there's much better songs on the album
than<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:14.230> it's<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.400> easy<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.480> think<00:02:16.690> it

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
than this but it's so easy I think it

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.530 
than this but it's so easy I think it
was<00:02:17.050> meant<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.290> store<00:02:17.590> but<00:02:17.830> whatever<00:02:18.310> okay<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
was meant to store but whatever okay the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.970 
was meant to store but whatever okay the
main<00:02:19.810> riff<00:02:20.320> is<00:02:20.590> just<00:02:21.550> an<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:22.030> chord<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.720> C<00:02:23.620> chord

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
main riff is just an a chord a C chord

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.620 
main riff is just an a chord a C chord
and<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.880> D<00:02:25.060> chord<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:27.300> see<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:30.600> now<00:02:31.600> I

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
and a D chord that is a see the now I

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.160 
and a D chord that is a see the now I
think<00:02:31.840> Angus<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.890> Malcolm<00:02:33.130> play<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.150> C<00:02:34.570> chord

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
think Angus and Malcolm play the C chord

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.120 
think Angus and Malcolm play the C chord
as<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.440> barre<00:02:36.010> chord<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:40.800> like<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.980> use

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
as a barre chord like this I like to use

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.360 
as a barre chord like this I like to use
the<00:02:42.400> power<00:02:42.760> chord<00:02:43.320> because<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:44.500> sustains<00:02:45.070> a

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
the power chord because this sustains a

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.640 
the power chord because this sustains a
little<00:02:45.640> bit<00:02:45.820> better<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:47.170> sounds<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.500> little

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
little bit better and it sounds a little

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.340 
little bit better and it sounds a little
bit<00:02:47.860> chunkier<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:49.450> reason<00:02:49.990> I<00:02:50.110> like<00:02:50.320> to

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
bit chunkier and the reason I like to

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.610 
bit chunkier and the reason I like to
use<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.700> my<00:02:51.760> case<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.570> special<00:02:53.410> case

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
use that in my case is a special case

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.610 
use that in my case is a special case
because<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:54.310> think<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:55.060> tubes<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:55.810> my<00:02:55.840> amp<00:02:56.290> over

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
because I think the tubes in my amp over

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.720 
because I think the tubes in my amp over
here<00:02:56.830> are<00:02:56.920> dying<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:59.530> sound<00:02:59.830> is<00:03:00.070> kind<00:03:00.640> of

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
here are dying and the sound is kind of

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.630 
here are dying and the sound is kind of
been<00:03:00.940> thinning<00:03:01.510> out<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:03.040> I've<00:03:03.280> just<00:03:03.310> been

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
been thinning out and so I've just been

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.060 
been thinning out and so I've just been
too<00:03:04.360> easy<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.930> replace<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.410> tube<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:05.890> just

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
too easy to replace the tube so I just

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
too easy to replace the tube so I just
use<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.550> open<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:08.050> power<00:03:08.560> cord<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.090> beefing

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
use the open the power cord to beefing

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.720 
use the open the power cord to beefing
up<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.330> sound<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.630> little<00:03:10.660> bit<00:03:10.870> okay<00:03:11.740> so<00:03:11.950> it's

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
up the sound a little bit okay so it's

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.290 
up the sound a little bit okay so it's
just<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.730> in<00:03:16.360> between<00:03:17.040> those<00:03:18.040> cords<00:03:18.580> is<00:03:18.790> a

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
just and in between those cords is a

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.449 
just and in between those cords is a
little<00:03:20.070> riff<00:03:22.739> you're<00:03:23.739> going<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:23.950> use<00:03:24.040> all<00:03:24.250> your

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
little riff you're going to use all your

over<00:04:29.030> and<00:04:29.330> over<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.990> is<00:04:30.050> a<00:04:30.650> D<00:04:31.220> chord<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.930> then<00:04:33.680> a

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
over and over it is a D chord and then a

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.450 
over and over it is a D chord and then a
C<00:04:34.250> chord<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:34.880> it's<00:04:35.389> going<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:35.930> be<00:04:36.080> a<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:36.979> call<00:04:37.400> it

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
C chord and it's going to be a I call it

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.250

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
a half a C chord because it's sort of

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.980 
a half a C chord because it's sort of
cheating<00:04:39.590> is<00:04:39.710> not<00:04:39.889> a<00:04:39.919> power<00:04:40.280> chord<00:04:40.729> C<00:04:40.940> -<00:04:41.389> what

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
cheating is not a power chord C - what

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.379 
cheating is not a power chord C - what
they<00:04:42.080> do<00:04:42.260> is<00:04:42.500> they<00:04:43.460> reach<00:04:43.729> up<00:04:44.000> with<00:04:44.240> their

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
they do is they reach up with their

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.620 
they do is they reach up with their
middle<00:04:44.690> finger<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.290> hit<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.190> a<00:04:46.820> string<00:04:47.389> on

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
middle finger and hit the a string on

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.580 
middle finger and hit the a string on
the<00:04:48.460> third<00:04:49.460> fret<00:04:49.570> make<00:04:50.570> a<00:04:50.600> cheap<00:04:51.139> see<00:04:51.350> out<00:04:51.560> of

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
the third fret make a cheap see out of

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.100 
the third fret make a cheap see out of
that<00:04:51.800> step<00:04:52.250> playing<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.639> whole<00:04:53.110> chord

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
that step playing the whole chord

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.300 
that step playing the whole chord
because<00:04:54.229> it'd<00:04:54.470> be<00:04:54.500> kind<00:04:54.830> of<00:04:54.860> difficult<00:04:55.250> to

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
because it'd be kind of difficult to

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.060 
because it'd be kind of difficult to
switch<00:04:55.520> from<00:04:55.699> D<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:55.970> C<00:04:56.120> than<00:04:56.479> easy<00:04:56.930> okay<00:04:57.560> so

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
switch from D to C than easy okay so

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:05.260 
switch from D to C than easy okay so
it's<00:04:58.250> just<00:05:00.070> over<00:05:01.070> and<00:05:01.310> over

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.890 

okay<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:06.710> that<00:05:07.069> leads<00:05:07.280> to<00:05:07.400> you<00:05:08.270> get<00:05:08.449> the

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
okay and that leads to you get the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.249 
okay and that leads to you get the
chorus<00:05:09.349> the<00:05:10.009> chorus<00:05:10.039> is<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.759> main<00:05:11.000> riff<00:05:11.449> with

Angus Young and I'm really not much of a

Angus Young and I'm really not much of a
soloist<00:06:59.980> at<00:07:00.160> all<00:07:00.340> I<00:07:00.370> mean<00:07:00.550> I<00:07:00.760> can<00:07:00.940> solo<00:07:01.420> but<00:07:02.140> not

very well

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.030 
very well
quite<00:07:03.640> frankly<00:07:03.850> I've<00:07:04.750> always<00:07:05.050> been<00:07:05.200> more<00:07:05.680> kind

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.040 
quite frankly I've always been more kind

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.710 
quite frankly I've always been more kind
of<00:07:06.220> a<00:07:06.280> rhythm<00:07:06.550> guy<00:07:06.850> but<00:07:07.060> I<00:07:07.090> think<00:07:07.330> it's<00:07:07.480> more

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 
of a rhythm guy but I think it's more

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.830 
of a rhythm guy but I think it's more
out<00:07:07.900> of<00:07:07.930> laziness<00:07:08.560> on<00:07:08.980> my<00:07:09.190> part<00:07:09.580> so<00:07:10.770> ya<00:07:12.330> know<00:07:13.330> no
