I<00:00:20.820> think<00:00:21.119> them<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.689> guess<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.170> could<00:00:22.289> say<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
I think them I guess you could say a

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.980 
I think them I guess you could say a
coolest<00:00:23.699> thing<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.240> game<00:00:24.449> play<00:00:24.689> or

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
coolest thing about this game play or

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.019

the reason why I think it's so good is

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.000 
the reason why I think it's so good is
just<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> fact<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.289> only<00:00:28.439> lethal<00:00:28.680> kill

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
just the fact that the only lethal kill

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.790 
just the fact that the only lethal kill

your life which is just crazy because
that's<00:01:53.520> been<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.180> seems<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.780> three

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
that's been like it seems like three

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.690 
that's been like it seems like three
quarters<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.560> year<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:56.070> drowning<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
quarters of the year just drowning and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.039 
quarters of the year just drowning and
snow<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.360> that's<00:01:57.780> not<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.320> case<00:01:58.350> actually<00:01:58.950> I

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
snow but that's not the case actually I

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.209 
snow but that's not the case actually I
know<00:02:01.049> winter<00:02:01.350> always<00:02:01.560> seems<00:02:01.770> longer<00:02:02.009> than

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
know winter always seems longer than

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.530 
know winter always seems longer than
summer<00:02:02.460> for<00:02:02.670> me<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.790> don't<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.090> why<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.329> is

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
summer for me I don't know why that is

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.350 
summer for me I don't know why that is
it<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:03.990> feels<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.619> way<00:02:04.770> sometimes<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.640> I

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
it just feels that way sometimes but I

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.020 
it just feels that way sometimes but I
thought<00:02:07.350> hey<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> snow<00:02:07.979> day<00:02:08.009> what<00:02:08.700> better

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
thought hey it's a snow day what better

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.300 
thought hey it's a snow day what better
to<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:09.479> then

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
to do then

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.490 
to do then
make<00:02:10.640> commentary<00:02:11.330> because<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:12.260> know<00:02:12.349> it's

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
make commentary because you know it's

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.720 
make commentary because you know it's
not<00:02:12.620> really<00:02:12.830> much<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.010> do<00:02:13.280> around<00:02:13.430> here

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
not really much to do around here

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.850 
not really much to do around here
especially<00:02:14.209> when<00:02:14.540> it's<00:02:14.690> bad<00:02:15.319> weather<00:02:15.590> like

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
especially when it's bad weather like

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.610 
especially when it's bad weather like
this<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.670> yeah<00:02:17.480> um<00:02:19.150> right<00:02:20.150> here<00:02:20.390> guys<00:02:20.569> I'd<00:02:21.319> have

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
this so yeah um right here guys I'd have

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.589 
this so yeah um right here guys I'd have
to<00:02:21.770> say<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.430> was<00:02:22.670> one<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.209> easiest

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
to say that this was one of the easiest

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.400 
to say that this was one of the easiest
100-plus<00:02:24.349> as<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.739> ever<00:02:24.860> got<00:02:25.160> ah<00:02:25.370> yeah<00:02:26.360> though<00:02:26.810> my

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
100-plus as I ever got ah yeah though my

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.839 
100-plus as I ever got ah yeah though my
streaks<00:02:27.739> just<00:02:27.950> kind<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.190> flowed<00:02:28.640> together

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
streaks just kind of flowed together

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.290 
streaks just kind of flowed together
really<00:02:29.360> well<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:31.580> know<00:02:31.670> something<00:02:31.940> with

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
really well and you know something with

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.870 
really well and you know something with
the<00:02:32.480> visa<00:02:32.959> EMP<00:02:33.620> set<00:02:33.920> up<00:02:34.069> no<00:02:34.310> matter<00:02:34.400> what<00:02:34.580> the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
the visa EMP set up no matter what the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.940 
the visa EMP set up no matter what the
third<00:02:35.090> streak<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.870> really<00:02:36.410> really

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
third streak is is really really

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.800 
third streak is is really really
powerful<00:02:37.160> especially<00:02:38.150> if<00:02:38.420> it's<00:02:38.569> something

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
powerful especially if it's something

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.470 
powerful especially if it's something
that's<00:02:39.170> anything<00:02:39.590> higher<00:02:40.099> than<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.489> visa<00:02:40.880> EMP

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
that's anything higher than the visa EMP

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.410 
that's anything higher than the visa EMP
because<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.950> assists<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:44.030> get<00:02:44.269> from

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
because the assists that you get from

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.780 
because the assists that you get from
those<00:02:44.900> two<00:02:44.930> things<00:02:45.350> come<00:02:45.739> well<00:02:46.430> combined

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
those two things come well combined

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.910 
those two things come well combined
together<00:02:46.989> because<00:02:47.989> then<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.290> know<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.560> visa

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
together because then you know the visa

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.890 
together because then you know the visa
shows<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.430> where<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.730> whole<00:02:50.180> enemy<00:02:50.299> team<00:02:50.480> is

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
shows you where the whole enemy team is

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.470 
shows you where the whole enemy team is
and<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:52.580> know<00:02:52.610> you're<00:02:52.910> going<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.150> get<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:53.299> lot

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
and you know you're going to get a lot

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.520 
and you know you're going to get a lot
of<00:02:53.510> assists<00:02:53.930> from<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.260> because<00:02:54.410> your

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
of assists from that because your

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.539 
of assists from that because your
teammates<00:02:54.860> gonna<00:02:55.040> be<00:02:55.130> getting<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.400> lot<00:02:55.519> of

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
teammates gonna be getting a lot of

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.660 
teammates gonna be getting a lot of
kills<00:02:55.849> and<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.720> EMP<00:02:57.349> which<00:02:57.920> will<00:02:58.160> you<00:02:58.549> know

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
kills and the EMP which will you know

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.309 
kills and the EMP which will you know
just<00:02:58.849> be<00:02:59.000> doubling<00:02:59.390> your<00:02:59.540> assist<00:02:59.840> points<00:03:00.170> and

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
just be doubling your assist points and

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.110 
just be doubling your assist points and
not<00:03:00.410> only<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.680> but<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.130> distorts<00:03:01.610> your<00:03:01.670> enemy

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
not only that but it distorts your enemy

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.410 
not only that but it distorts your enemy
so<00:03:02.709> with<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.830> V<00:03:04.010> set<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.610> EMP<00:03:05.060> going<00:03:05.330> up

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
so with the V set and the EMP going up

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.030 
so with the V set and the EMP going up
at<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.599> same<00:03:05.660> time<00:03:06.019> there's<00:03:06.410> really<00:03:06.620> not<00:03:06.830> much

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
at the same time there's really not much

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.339 
at the same time there's really not much
of<00:03:07.099> a<00:03:07.280> chance<00:03:07.519> for<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.910> enemy<00:03:08.180> team<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:08.840> it

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
of a chance for the enemy team so it

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.050 
of a chance for the enemy team so it
really<00:03:09.680> is<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:09.890> great<00:03:10.069> Street<00:03:10.519> combo<00:03:10.910> if<00:03:10.970> you

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
really is a great Street combo if you

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.370 
really is a great Street combo if you
guys<00:03:11.180> haven't<00:03:11.390> tried<00:03:11.690> it<00:03:11.720> it's<00:03:11.989> kind<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.230> a

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
guys haven't tried it it's kind of a

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.740 
guys haven't tried it it's kind of a
hard<00:03:12.709> streak<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.250> pin<00:03:13.459> together<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.420> once<00:03:14.630> you

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
hard streak to pin together but once you

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.390 
hard streak to pin together but once you
do<00:03:14.959> get<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.350> can<00:03:15.590> go<00:03:15.739> through<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.100> quite

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
do get it you can go through it quite

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.430 
do get it you can go through it quite
often<00:03:16.640> it's<00:03:17.090> really<00:03:17.359> not<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.540> hard<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.170> loop

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
often it's really not that hard to loop

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.280 
often it's really not that hard to loop
to<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.650> next<00:03:18.950> V<00:03:19.100> set<00:03:19.690> depending<00:03:20.690> on<00:03:21.049> what<00:03:21.170> your

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
to the next V set depending on what your
