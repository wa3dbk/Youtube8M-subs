star wars old republic is not a very
demanding<00:00:31.870> game<00:00:32.379> I<00:00:33.250> mean<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:34.030> looks<00:00:34.149> nice<00:00:34.450> and

there<00:00:35.410> are<00:00:35.530> actually<00:00:36.100> driver<00:00:36.490> problems<00:00:37.120> with

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
there are actually driver problems with

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.290 
there are actually driver problems with
it<00:00:37.570> so<00:00:38.440> it<00:00:38.800> has<00:00:38.860> been<00:00:39.190> optimized<00:00:39.640> as<00:00:39.790> well<00:00:39.970> and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
it so it has been optimized as well and

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.569 
it so it has been optimized as well and

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
the radeon HD 7970 fizz intosh it so we

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.670 
the radeon HD 7970 fizz intosh it so we
are<00:00:45.640> getting<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.940> steady<00:00:46.150> 60fps<00:00:46.810> we<00:00:47.410> do<00:00:47.530> not

SATA connection which really makes want
are<00:01:02.260> very<00:01:02.469> enjoyable<00:01:02.829> because<00:01:03.280> conversations

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
are very enjoyable because conversations

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.270 
are very enjoyable because conversations
start<00:01:04.600> almost<00:01:04.930> instantly<00:01:05.409> there's<00:01:05.829> almost<00:01:05.979> no

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.039 
delay which when I'm playing on my
laptop<00:01:08.620> for<00:01:09.340> instance<00:01:09.760> really<00:01:10.479> sucks<00:01:10.810> because

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
laptop for instance really sucks because

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.840 
laptop for instance really sucks because
that<00:01:11.320> I<00:01:11.500> might<00:01:11.860> actually<00:01:12.070> have<00:01:12.400> like<00:01:12.610> a<00:01:12.640> 30

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
that I might actually have like a 30

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.940 
that I might actually have like a 30
second<00:01:13.299> delay<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:14.229> when<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.470> think<00:01:14.710> about<00:01:14.770> it

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
second delay and when you think about it

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.410 
second delay and when you think about it
when<00:01:15.159> you<00:01:15.220> talk<00:01:15.490> with<00:01:15.670> somebody<00:01:15.850> you're<00:01:16.360> not

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
when you talk with somebody you're not

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.969 
when you talk with somebody you're not
going<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.900> just<00:01:17.049> stand<00:01:17.260> there<00:01:17.380> next<00:01:17.650> to<00:01:17.830> them

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
going to just stand there next to them

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.920 
going to just stand there next to them
for<00:01:18.130> 30<00:01:18.280> seconds<00:01:18.729> looking<00:01:18.940> awkwardly<00:01:19.600> and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
for 30 seconds looking awkwardly and

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.219 
for 30 seconds looking awkwardly and
then<00:01:20.170> talking<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.740> them<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.720> also

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
then talking to them this is also

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.260 
then talking to them this is also
Tatooine<00:01:23.740> as<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.040> can<00:01:24.159> see<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:24.549> Tatooine

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
Tatooine as you can see and Tatooine

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.370 
Tatooine as you can see and Tatooine
actually<00:01:26.080> takes<00:01:26.260> a<00:01:26.350> while<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.650> load<00:01:26.830> so<00:01:28.380> well

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
actually takes a while to load so well

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.080 
actually takes a while to load so well
it<00:01:29.710> takes<00:01:29.979> a<00:01:30.070> while<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.430> load<00:01:30.580> on<00:01:30.790> a<00:01:30.820> normal

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
it takes a while to load on a normal

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.289 
it takes a while to load on a normal
hard<00:01:31.390> drive<00:01:31.570> on<00:01:31.750> an<00:01:31.869> SSD<00:01:32.290> it's<00:01:32.409> really<00:01:32.650> nice<00:01:33.299> so

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
hard drive on an SSD it's really nice so

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.310 
hard drive on an SSD it's really nice so
anyways<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:36.670> can<00:01:36.790> see<00:01:37.000> we're<00:01:37.299> right<00:01:38.170> now

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
anyways as you can see we're right now

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.280 
anyways as you can see we're right now
we're<00:01:38.500> getting<00:01:38.740> about<00:01:38.799> 30<00:01:39.159> FPS<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:40.110> also<00:01:41.110> we

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
we're getting about 30 FPS and also we

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.429 
we're getting about 30 FPS and also we
are<00:01:41.320> using<00:01:41.439> fraps<00:01:42.010> I'm<00:01:42.820> using<00:01:43.180> fraps<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:44.110> that

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
are using fraps I'm using fraps so that

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.670 
are using fraps I'm using fraps so that
does<00:01:44.680> reduce<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.790> FPS<00:01:46.299> by<00:01:46.540> some<00:01:47.170> times<00:01:47.350> almost

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
does reduce the FPS by some times almost

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.149 
does reduce the FPS by some times almost
up<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.159> half<00:01:48.520> fifty<00:01:49.360> percent<00:01:49.920> right<00:01:50.920> now<00:01:51.009> we're

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
up to half fifty percent right now we're

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.990 
up to half fifty percent right now we're
back<00:01:51.250> up<00:01:51.430> to<00:01:51.549> 60<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.890> let's<00:01:54.280> see<00:01:54.460> how<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.670> goes

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
back up to 60 so let's see how it goes

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.390 
back up to 60 so let's see how it goes
here<00:01:56.340> by<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.400> way<00:01:57.549> this<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:57.880> my<00:01:58.229> Imperial

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
here by the way this is my Imperial

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.180 
here by the way this is my Imperial
smuggler<00:02:00.479> so

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.520 

as<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:06.150> can<00:02:06.240> see<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:06.690> really<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.350> nice

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
as you can see it's really really nice

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.810 
as you can see it's really really nice
and<00:02:08.600> actually<00:02:09.600> there<00:02:09.990> is<00:02:10.790> wow<00:02:13.400> there<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.580> some

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
and actually there is wow there is some

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.970 
and actually there is wow there is some
texture<00:02:15.720> tearing<00:02:16.110> going<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.830> is

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
texture tearing going on that is

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.800 
texture tearing going on that is
probably<00:02:17.370> not<00:02:17.550> due<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.120> heat<00:02:18.330> or<00:02:18.360> anything

that<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.110> probably<00:02:19.440> just<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.770> bad<00:02:19.980> driver<00:02:20.310> like

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
that is probably just a bad driver like

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.390 
that is probably just a bad driver like

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
Jarvis might not be up to date so we're

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.410 
Jarvis might not be up to date so we're
still<00:02:28.410> getting<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.680> full<00:02:28.890> 60<00:02:29.190> FPS<00:02:29.730> here<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:32.420> so

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
still getting a full 60 FPS here and so

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.820 
still getting a full 60 FPS here and so
we're<00:02:33.570> still<00:02:33.720> getting<00:02:33.810> 58<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.710> is
