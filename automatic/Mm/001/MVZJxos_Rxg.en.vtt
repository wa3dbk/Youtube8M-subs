00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.319
 Iran is not a country in the west 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.630
 for example, a lot of affection is experienced 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.130

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.529
 went for a walk when they came back 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.510
 Police cars had the streets 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.610
 locked and the science museum 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.059
 was evacuated because of a terror threat 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.399
 were 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.770
 This reaction was triggered by the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.899
 Iran is great writing on the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.219
 camper daniel hawkins made one 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.610
 Jaunt with the owner of the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.610

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.840
 a visit to the anti-terror-police the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.250
 is the last thing Christian expected 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.500
 when he saw the camper in front of the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.670
 it was left standing 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.680
 searched by officials 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.180
 the family is scared yesterday 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.830
 At night our children slept with us 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.030
 bed because they were afraid that something 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.990
 similar happened in the night 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.060
 Christian is sure that 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.990
 Slogan on the vehicle is Iran 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.330
 great made him a target 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.890
 Iran is all right, something is right 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.570
 not with the way we live this country 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.900
 perceive or kind of like 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.159
 information is disseminated 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.020
 this is the camper that on the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.030
 roads knowledgeable such tumult 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.310
 The Iran has been great 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.380
 is on the side and everywhere on the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.270
 vehicle it is the home of the family of 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.560
 christians and audrey here they live with 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.360
 your two children in the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.210
 they were part of the science museum 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.009
 an educational program to 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.689
 find out what the public is 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.540
 about the presence of the camper 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.920
 thinks we go to the street what comes 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.600
 them in the sense if they have this 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.869
 Mobile home with Iran is great 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.430
 that someone tries the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.360
 negative views on iran 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.100
 compensate 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.579
 to encourage people about it 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.869
 to think that there are also positive 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.990
 do you want to stand here what comes to you 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.190
 immediately in the sense 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.170
 obviously the negative thing in 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.599
 the media 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.160
 the nuclear program, I think that's it 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.690
 what most people think about when 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.340
 you think of iran iran likes that 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.970
 that's not the first thing that's mine 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.280
 incident 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.290
 Iran is great that is really 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.030
 a blatant statement if one such 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.060
 camper sees then you wonder 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.530
 what is going on here 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.840
 while your own family travel 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.730
 Continue your mobile home one 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.040
 promote positive public perception 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.819
 will and no further police 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.819
 aggressions
