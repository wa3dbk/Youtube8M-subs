00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
real or anything like that but I can't

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.040 
real or anything like that but I can't
really<00:03:29.430> see<00:03:29.580> how<00:03:29.700> that's<00:03:29.730> that's<00:03:30.720> something

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
really see how that's that's something

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.170 
really see how that's that's something
good<00:03:31.230> because<00:03:31.410> if<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.280> plan<00:03:32.520> on<00:03:32.550> console<00:03:33.000> for

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
good because if you plan on console for

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.420 
good because if you plan on console for
example<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.720> might<00:03:34.200> be<00:03:34.380> easier<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.680> just<00:03:35.100> look

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
example it might be easier to just look

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.550

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.330 
view of the game itself it's it's a
really<00:05:10.990> good<00:05:11.230> idea<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:11.650> better<00:05:11.800> understand<00:05:12.160> a

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
really good idea to better understand a

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.670 
really good idea to better understand a
lot<00:05:12.730> of<00:05:12.790> other<00:05:13.030> smaller<00:05:13.450> features<00:05:13.750> that<00:05:14.260> that

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
lot of other smaller features that that

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.680 
lot of other smaller features that that
is<00:05:14.800> like<00:05:15.010> simply<00:05:15.550> not<00:05:15.850> cool<00:05:16.090> enough<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.419> like

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
is like simply not cool enough to like

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.409 
is like simply not cool enough to like
go<00:05:16.870> into<00:05:17.260> that<00:05:17.500> kind<00:05:17.740> of<00:05:17.800> stuff<00:05:17.970> but<00:05:18.970> when<00:05:19.300> it

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
go into that kind of stuff but when it

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.240 
go into that kind of stuff but when it
comes<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:20.050> the<00:05:20.530> other<00:05:20.620> things<00:05:20.950> they've<00:05:21.130> been

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
comes to the other things they've been

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.430 
comes to the other things they've been
changing<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.880> stacks<00:05:22.180> and<00:05:22.540> also<00:05:23.200> the

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
changing the stacks and also the

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.990 
changing the stacks and also the
achievements<00:05:24.160> you're<00:05:24.310> gonna<00:05:24.460> be<00:05:24.610> able<00:05:24.700> to<00:05:24.880> do

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
and I think that's kind of a little bit

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.530 
and I think that's kind of a little bit
of<00:05:27.220> a<00:05:27.280> double-edged<00:05:27.669> sword<00:05:27.700> hello<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.360> guy
