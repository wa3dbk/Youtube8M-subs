 the reaction gave humanity not only 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.880
 democracy philosophy but also a whole range of dishes 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.620
 which we habitually consider their I 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.299
 many times forced squash but not 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.949
 suspected that they did the same 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.170
 the ancient Greeks only did they 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.090
 will be different than we are with you today and 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.260
 see you will need 1 kilogram 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.869
 young squash 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.820
 300 grams minced beef half a cup 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.890
 rice 1 onion 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.990
 small bunch of parsley one cup

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.780
 pepper 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.860
 and for egg and lemon sauce to me 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.320
 need a cup 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.540
 broth from cooking zucchini 2 eggs and 2 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.370
 lemon first you need to take zucchini and 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.530
 make in them completely which we 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.940
 actually we will put the stuffing cut off 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.140
 squash from the side of the stem 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.559
 then carefully cut out the flesh with a spoon 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.899
 need to be very careful not to 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.579
 cut the walls of the zucchini soft not herself 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.739
 throw it away we need for that 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.690
 to add it to the filling you can 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.280
 pull the pulp out of the zucchini any 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.739
 convenient for you and most importantly 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.750
 leave the walls of the zucchini no less in 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.760
 half a centimeter now zucchini need 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.590
 salt on all sides and will do 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.380
 to begin 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.570
 I will grind one cup of zucchini flesh and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.289
 add it to the bowl for the filling here 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.229
 sending 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:27.170
 minced meat and further onions and half a cup 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.829
 chop parsley 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.369
 add salt and pepper now mince 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.240
 need to mix thoroughly with your hands 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.590
 now I will stuff zucchini but 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.599
 fill them with minced meat is not very necessary 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.399
 because while cooking rice 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.039
 the barrels may swell slightly but 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.479
 slap I laid you almost in the pan 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.270
 tight now 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.299
 here pour that cup of olive oil or 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.429
 vegetable oils rest dolyu 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.619
 water ordinary to cover it 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.929
 courgettes so that courgettes do not float on 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.090
 blood in the plate and so he sees the need 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.280
 put on comfortable cook for 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.739
 40 minutes before stuffed zucchini 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.940
 usually made with melted cheese and with 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:10.860
 cream sauce 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.900
 and today we will show with such a sauce see 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:20.609
 these butterflies are greeks need to take two eggs and 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:23.370
 cut it and survived from them the juice is better 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:26.069
 do it through the strainer so that the bones do not 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.030
 fell into the juice so you can add 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.739
 some salt 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.900
 after your zucchini get ready 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.900
 need to take a cup of broth which they 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.670
 getting ready to beat this layer you need 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.670
 cook for several minutes without bringing to 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.590
 boil until the old man thickens 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.299
 Well, I have the sauce now I will show 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.019
 how do you need to serve these zucchini 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.910
 in Greek 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.489
 I put zucchini on a plate and put it 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.139
 hot lemon-egg sauce and 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.819
 sprinkled with red sweet pepper 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.300
 as you see immortals about cooking 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.890
 Greece is all there 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.600
 Kitchen acquires a very specific 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.080
 meaning many traditional russian dishes 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.150
 kitchens 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.370
 other ancient greek courts and when 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.620
 get acquainted with their origin 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.370
 habitual food is obtained by foot and in 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.370
 it's all salt
