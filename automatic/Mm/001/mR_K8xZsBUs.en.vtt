00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.860
 do not know 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.330
 Hey, everyone, beauty, everything good. 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.279
 so today we'll give you a tip 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.199
 For you, very good and filming. 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.930
 a tip for me on the youtube channel that 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.840
 I follow and pass a studio on the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.810
 SÃ£o Paulo and advertising and the next tip 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.390
 I watched a lot of videos out there and I see 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.250
 that a major problem is lighting the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.260
 lighting a video so essential 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.390
 as of all other things 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.370
 in the video he watched that he 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.790
 time is as homely as the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.790
 people will teach you how they are 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.790
 they 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 how I am in the professional they used 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.379
 professional things that are not always 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.530
 so real to us, huh? 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.840
 so this is a very easy tip 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.609
 undo everyone who thinks if he goes 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.890
 be able to do what I go 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.229
 teach you that you will enjoy 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.390
 I put a lamp here and did 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.030
 The Question of Burning a Tile Wall 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.950
 so you can see a glimmer of light to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.470
 my right has a window is 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.299
 entering sunshine and this time three 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.420
 hours in the prime time 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.479
 Because the light, she 's very good. 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.310
 decidico record video and I used will 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.290
 show you I used a light bulb in 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.590
 The field is always in the lamp you go 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.030
 see later I'll show you 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.799
 half of my face is being lit 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.150
 by the light of the sun and half of mine is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.030
 being lit by the light in the field is 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.159
 It's always the following is just because I used it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.640
 an incandescent light and it is not that light 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.040
 branquinha booming because so 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.380
 our brain works very differently 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.420
 a camera or camcorder the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.130
 our brain he can put together when 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.950
 we would put a light on 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.770
 fluorescent light along with the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.509
 our brains and understanding would leave the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.030
 Beautiful things but the time that you 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.070
 to shoot or film it at 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.860
 filming photography was not going to go so well 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.180
 made because the incandescent light 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.329
 flourishing they work in frequency 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.329
 different 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.240
 the synth is the closest to the sun 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.370
 they are very close then the camera 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.250
 photographic camcorder will understand this 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.950
 and will leave one side of our 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.750
 face of the object with very 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.270
 similar if you use a light 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.740
 fluorescent this will not happen 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.010
 then there I will give you the 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.990
 Following is not cool, you get a 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.340
 luminaire for example to replace 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.850
 those equipment on behalf of 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.580
 photographers and direct to you 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:46.080
 the light because something very aggressive 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.080
 So what did I do to you ? Will I? 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.150
 Good what is and what the idea that I had 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.220
 It was the following I'll call you 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.090
 to see the difference if I had not 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.650
 this light 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.290
 you can see that the reflex 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.570
 deleted half of my face is dark 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.180
 half is lit by sunlight 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.580
 This is very bad in any situation. 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.860
 as much as you do not realize and think 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.470
 so the image was good 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.269
 but in the photograph in the filming a thing 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.410
 that we should learn is that we always 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.000
 can improve 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.500
 Do you think that a photo size but 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.910
 there is always something you can do 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.459
 who is going to make that photo that 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.230
 filming better and that's for sure something 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.220
 what does your shooting leave your photograph? 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.049
 best 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.430
 I realize now I will not be dark the 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.470
 subject is for you to see 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.600
 Looks like this my left side of the 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.269
 face is already more like the 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.700
 right by the little hymn the shadows and 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.100
 making the two colors stay 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.950
 look alright, so I'll show you 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.989
 You, how I improvise this if you 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.780
 connect the light directly with your face 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.970
 will get somewhat aggressive and maybe 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.230
 lighter than the other side it 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.519
 it will not look cool 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.220
 I'll show you what it is. 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.739
 interesting to do good is interesting to 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.780
 people to make the light 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.299
 do not come on the spot just a very light 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.640
 directed how I did it a lot 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.120
 Simple I picked preachers a bag 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.370
 Plastic plastic bag is cut means 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.430
 for the side use of it because it gives 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.280
 to use the bag as well just kept coming 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.440
 any less 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.290
 the last one did not dominate all then 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.040
 did the test well and got much bigger 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.660
 Well I put employers here too. 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.220
 because as I'm using a 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.680
 incandescent lamp 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.870
 It would not be interesting, I was lamp. 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.310
 with bags why the lamp 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.960
 incandescent you know she 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.360
 heat could melt the plastic 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.230
 so I did put employers to 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.870
 distance a little wise right 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.780
 I added the very simple plastic bag 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.880
 and easy that anyone can do and 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.880
 trapped the players own bags 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:05:01.220
 It took me two minutes to get a 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.440
 nice filming here I'll turn to 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.740
 me 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.090
 Ready, look here, my face is fine. 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.820
 illuminated 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.419
 I'm seeing now ready'll show 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.850
 You would be like if you had not 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.290
 diverging if she had highly 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.919
 directed to my taste 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.460
 showing you to realize that the light 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.950
 targeted becomes a little more aggressive 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.950
 so in my face there is not so much shade 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.990
 but it gets something very targeted and 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.300
 I think she's leaving the afro she's going 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.479
 diverge and will get a little bigger 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.970
 here is no bag, I'll put the bag to 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.669
 You see the difference, I'm thinking that 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:47.500
 here is something a little more aggressive and I 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:51.500
 placing the frog diverting this light 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.780
 spreading she noticed something 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.030
 softer does not look like it has a light 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.130
 lighting up if you had not seen 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.729
 reflection behind me you would not even know 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.289
 that even this light illuminating 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.060
 so if you have a couple say that 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.830
 I'm recording here with tile behind 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.050
 for you to see the flex car but you 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.060
 Your background has a nice background and 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.770
 photography is going to be very good with something 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.729
 so practical and simple that is what 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.260
 people did 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.690
 Also another tip I can give to 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.479
 you are the next to this tip of the 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.550
 energy people 2 it is interesting that 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.880
 our moon is directed to a little 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.560
 from top to bottom not exactly the 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.270
 our side 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.300
 in front of inter is it holy that she come 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.240
 more or less than a 45 degree angle and 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.130
 she is a little inclined to 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.530
 realize that I've picked up some books 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.500
 I put the lamp and left a little 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.180
 from top to bottom to brighten up 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.669
 the shadows do not become invisible to the 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.590
 filming and another tip I give but she 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.570
 It is more practical for the picture to 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.790
 filming is no longer practical because it is a 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.270
 little more complicated you do alone 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:59.930
 the next other way we people 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.520
 spread the light is as follows: 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.500
 luminaire joe 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.900
 we think that the lamp is without anything 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.330
 Turning to me is an advantage. 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.810
 that we got a lot to hit photos and 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:14.450
 Objects are not people's will then 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:17.419
 how do I do I turn to light 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:20.960
 the other side not totally and with the 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:21.950
 sheet of a4 common paper I do was like 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.900
 a mirror 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.090
 here you will not realize so much because 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.190
 This needs to be a little closer. 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.530
 her because the light is far less 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.450
 so look I put it on my face that 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:35.270
 closer you will see that you are also 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.860
 illuminating this is something very good only 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.780
 It's complicated for you to shoot 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.910
 because it's important that it's interesting 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.820
 who has another person holding a paper 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:46.160
 for you ok but I realize that it works 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.630
 likewise makes our face a 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.490
 slightly more homogeneous 

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.160
 Ok folks, I hope you guys have 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:55.130

 beauty was personal
