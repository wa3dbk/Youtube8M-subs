and<00:01:05.909> blue<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:07.320> primary<00:01:07.770> reason<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.159> this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and blue the primary reason for this

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.219 
and blue the primary reason for this
organization<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.570> keep<00:01:09.720> yellow<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
organization is to keep yellow and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.750 
organization is to keep yellow and
orange<00:01:10.380> away<00:01:10.740> from<00:01:10.950> each<00:01:11.070> other<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> domes

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
orange away from each other on the domes

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.520 
orange away from each other on the domes
because<00:01:12.210> they<00:01:12.360> are<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.659> close<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:13.260> another

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
because they are so close to one another

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.710 
because they are so close to one another
on<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.710> color<00:01:13.950> spectrum<00:01:14.299> this<00:01:15.299> especially

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
on the color spectrum this especially

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.670 
on the color spectrum this especially
helps<00:01:16.200> out<00:01:16.290> our<00:01:16.409> friends<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:16.950> low<00:01:17.280> vision

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the colors organized in a way we believe

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.630 
the colors organized in a way we believe
makes<00:01:27.869> sense<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.740> biggest<00:01:29.040> cross-section
