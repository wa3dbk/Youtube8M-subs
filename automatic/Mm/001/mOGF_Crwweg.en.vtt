coach<00:00:09.059> I've<00:00:10.059> used<00:00:10.330> this<00:00:10.540> method<00:00:10.900> for<00:00:11.320> starting

quite<00:00:13.240> successfully<00:00:14.049> for<00:00:14.259> the<00:00:14.290> last<00:00:14.620> few

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
quite successfully for the last few

quite successfully for the last few
years<00:00:15.490> I<00:00:15.790> use<00:00:16.630> a<00:00:16.660> commercial<00:00:17.470> seed<00:00:17.800> tray

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.190

although<00:00:18.670> you<00:00:18.730> can<00:00:19.150> use<00:00:19.320> egg<00:00:20.320> cartons<00:00:21.240> yogurt

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240

cups<00:00:22.600> I<00:00:22.930> like<00:00:23.650> these<00:00:23.860> because<00:00:24.100> they<00:00:24.370> produce<00:00:24.670> a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
cups I like these because they produce a

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.720 
cups I like these because they produce a
nice<00:00:25.330> sized<00:00:25.690> plug<00:00:26.260> and<00:00:26.740> they're<00:00:27.520> very

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
nice sized plug and they're very

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.029

down to give us a little dent to put our

cover them rule of thumb is about two to

three times the diameter of the seed for

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.030 
three times the diameter of the seed for

the depth of the cover but each seed

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.690 
the depth of the cover but each seed
packet<00:01:24.580> will<00:01:24.760> tell<00:01:25.060> you<00:01:26.130> exactly<00:01:27.130> how<00:01:27.430> deep

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
packet will tell you exactly how deep

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.460 
packet will tell you exactly how deep
they'd<00:01:27.940> like<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.180> be<00:01:28.450> covered<00:01:28.690> up<00:01:28.990> too<00:01:29.230> deep

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
they'd like to be covered up too deep

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.500 
they'd like to be covered up too deep
and<00:01:29.710> their<00:01:29.860> seeds<00:01:30.370> may<00:01:30.610> not<00:01:30.790> have<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.240> energy

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
and their seeds may not have the energy

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.700 
and their seeds may not have the energy
to<00:01:33.210> put<00:01:34.210> their<00:01:34.390> leaves<00:01:34.600> up<00:01:34.840> above<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.320> ground

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.720 

so<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:40.170> cover<00:01:41.170> with<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.470> light<00:01:41.770> dusting<00:01:42.070> of<00:01:42.550> this

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
so we cover with a light dusting of this

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.100 
so we cover with a light dusting of this
media<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.810> then<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.890> idea<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:46.180> smooth

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
media and then the idea is to smooth

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.400 
media and then the idea is to smooth
this<00:01:47.350> all<00:01:47.650> off<00:01:47.950> without<00:01:48.850> knocking<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:50.020> seeds

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
this all off without knocking the seeds

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.380 
this all off without knocking the seeds
loose<00:01:52.590> then<00:01:53.590> once<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.370> media<00:01:54.760> has<00:01:55.120> been

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
loose then once the media has been

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.470 
loose then once the media has been
smooth<00:01:55.900> off<00:01:56.260> a<00:01:56.290> little<00:01:56.650> bit<00:01:56.980> we<00:01:57.190> can<00:01:57.460> pull<00:01:58.300> out

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
smooth off a little bit we can pull out

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.550 
smooth off a little bit we can pull out
our<00:01:58.800> other<00:02:00.270> trays<00:02:01.270> again<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.990> tamp<00:02:02.290> this

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
our other trays again and tamp this

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.070 
our other trays again and tamp this
material<00:02:03.340> down<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:03.970> doesn't<00:02:04.060> blow<00:02:04.420> the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
material down so it doesn't blow the

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.110 
material down so it doesn't blow the
seeds<00:02:05.380> fo<00:02:05.890> we're<00:02:06.100> taking<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.760> be<00:02:06.910> watered

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.449 

now<00:02:11.200> one<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.470> things<00:02:12.709> about<00:02:13.069> watering

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
now one of the things about watering

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.580 
now one of the things about watering
here<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.209> that<00:02:14.420> if<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:14.599> water<00:02:14.959> from<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.379> top

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
here is that if you water from the top

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.070 
here is that if you water from the top
you're<00:02:15.920> liable<00:02:16.129> to<00:02:16.370> look<00:02:16.580> completely

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
you're liable to look completely

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.080 
you're liable to look completely
saturated<00:02:18.080> well<00:02:18.440> there's<00:02:18.920> still<00:02:19.069> bone-dry<00:02:19.790> at

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
saturated well there's still bone-dry at

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.080 
saturated well there's still bone-dry at
the<00:02:20.269> bottom<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:23.200> we're<00:02:24.200> labeling<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.090> plants

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
the bottom so we're labeling the plants

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.910 
the bottom so we're labeling the plants
here<00:02:26.269> so<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.660> we<00:02:26.810> can<00:02:27.019> tell<00:02:27.260> what<00:02:27.470> they<00:02:27.680> are

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
here so that we can tell what they are

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.710 
here so that we can tell what they are
and<00:02:28.250> as<00:02:28.430> soon<00:02:28.640> as<00:02:28.819> this<00:02:28.970> then<00:02:29.209> we're<00:02:29.420> going<00:02:29.660> to

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
and as soon as this then we're going to

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.660 
and as soon as this then we're going to
go<00:02:29.900> water<00:02:30.170> them<00:02:30.730> now<00:02:31.730> what<00:02:31.940> we<00:02:32.120> do<00:02:32.360> here<00:02:32.840> these

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
go water them now what we do here these

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
go water them now what we do here these
pots<00:02:34.670> all<00:02:35.000> have<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.690> hole<00:02:36.200> in<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.650> bottom<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.690> I

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
pots all have a hole in the bottom and I
