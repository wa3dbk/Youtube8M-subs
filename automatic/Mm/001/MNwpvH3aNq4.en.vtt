there it is I hope you caught it I hope
you<00:02:28.010> understand<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.580> reference<00:02:28.790> now<00:02:29.209> but<00:02:29.989> now

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
you understand the reference now but now

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.930 
you understand the reference now but now
I'm<00:02:30.320> thinking<00:02:30.380> if<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.100> ever<00:02:31.310> make<00:02:31.760> another

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
I'm thinking if I ever make another

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.000 
I'm thinking if I ever make another
video<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.600> reference<00:02:33.320> is<00:02:33.530> something<00:02:33.860> in<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
video that reference is something in the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.190 
video that reference is something in the
past<00:02:34.280> should<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.090> just<00:02:35.300> include<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.930> clip

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
past should I just include the clip

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.259 
past should I just include the clip
within<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:37.040> video<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.790> don't<00:02:38.000> have<00:02:38.120> to

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
within the video so you don't have to

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.199 
within the video so you don't have to
watch<00:02:38.450> another<00:02:38.900> video<00:02:39.519> explaining<00:02:40.519> the

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
watch another video explaining the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.789 
watch another video explaining the
reference<00:02:41.720> like<00:02:42.019> you're<00:02:42.170> doing<00:02:42.320> right<00:02:42.470> now

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
reference like you're doing right now

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.720 
reference like you're doing right now
for<00:02:43.340> example<00:02:43.430> if<00:02:44.150> i<00:02:44.540> said<00:02:44.840> something<00:02:44.870> like<00:02:45.230> oh

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
for example if i said something like oh

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.930 
for example if i said something like oh
my<00:02:46.730> shoulder<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.630> still<00:02:47.780> hurting<00:02:48.350> i<00:02:49.250> would

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
my shoulder is still hurting i would

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.620 
my shoulder is still hurting i would
then<00:02:50.180> show<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.810> reference<00:02:51.370> yeah<00:02:52.370> it's<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.390> lot

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
then show the reference yeah it's a lot

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.720 
then show the reference yeah it's a lot
easier<00:02:53.660> for<00:02:54.170> everyone<00:02:54.620> no<00:02:55.130> wait<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.580> will

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
easier for everyone no wait that will

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.060 
easier for everyone no wait that will
work<00:02:55.940> because<00:02:56.390> what<00:02:56.930> if<00:02:57.200> i<00:02:57.500> said<00:02:57.830> something

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070
