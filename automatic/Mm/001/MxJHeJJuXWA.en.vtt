00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:15.389
 and hello to all 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.510
 it's all that time we end up 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.130
 today for a video that goes that 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.570
 is rather funny I think we will open 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.859
 g happens if you remember there is a 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.890
 little time I had received boosters 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.670
 ex forgotten legends English thinking 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.619
 have made a good deal 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.990
 and actually these boosters and and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.060
 boosters fake so we see it 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.320
 directly if we negotiate we know a 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.410
 little we see directly from these seals 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.840
 in a very very strange way that the 9 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.180
 additional that has a map normally 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.550
 and already a little bit higher at last that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.480
 it 's shit but we finally feel 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.950
 it feels like I think I 've done a 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.180
 good deal who bought the least 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.140
 of two euros piece so it was a 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.340
 good deal it was especially for you 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.960
 to make avc but we exchange and a 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.840
 little bit at worst worse we go to a 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.850
 little bit and finally it was not 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.620
 all good deals good a lot 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.700
 wanted to know if I was out 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.810
 does vga receive little message it's in 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.309
 as long as I'm told then you did 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.630
 how when and booster defect booster 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.700
 left scammed it's a shame 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.120
 thing I sent a message to the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.490
 nobody 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.780
 she finally said oh yes in less 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.040
 two weeks not two weeks 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.980
 go after a pale and a 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 week telling me that there 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.670
 knew nothing about Pokemon 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.260
 because I had anyway loaded 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.370
 telling him that I could be alerted right away 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.140
 released that it was to confront them 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.910
 counterfeit that it could suppress his 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.530
 account without accounts still had not 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.580
 misjudging that his flaws 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.010
 tasters and that it was out of the question 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.240
 that I kept this and that I wanted a 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.680
 refund it without returning any 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.610
 boosters because or while they 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.720
 pay the shipping costs both 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.790
 questions I pay 30 euros of fees 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.870
 port to send her in italy and the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.520
 nobody told me she knew 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.090
 nothing pokemon she will find that 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.890
 in a cellar old cartons 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.469
 speak to speak English so that was 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.000
 easier to communicate so I have 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.619
 hard to believe she found her 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.289
 source in old boxes but good 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.399
 medium rockets and she told me 'there is 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.740
 no problem you can keep them 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.920
 I fully refund you m to 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.899
 repay in the full minute 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.240
 I recovered my 70 80 euros know more 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.709
 how much had I apologized and here 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.379
 it's recovering everything I was able to keep 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.280
 authors so that's I can not say that 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.340
 it's a great deal because I 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.829
 have nothing to do with that I have 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.940
 recovered my wishes so here I 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.860
 enjoy I'm going to make you a little 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.700

 four I have never sent four already 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.010
 I gave them by giving the exchanges 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.379
 there was an exchange between the enemies in 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.790
 more in we serve we are interested 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.340
 I still have full if I give 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.959

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.780
 but here I am so I 'm going to open four 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.920
 today and we're going to laugh in it 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.200
 are cards that do not even match 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.910
 not people to forget themselves 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.739
 I could see three rare I think 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.230
 maybe even ultras 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.030
 I do not know so that's going to be a 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.849
 a little video made cardboard will present 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.400
 fake cards or the franc 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.450
 without me seeing it opens by hand I 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.690
 know younger had opened a for 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:15.069
 check see after that can be nice 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.609
 for what the illustrations hope for and 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.959
 even the illustrations are ugly by 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.220
 against I hope it's not a map 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.230
 every time else we will not open the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.639
 four because I had opened a 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.709
 I had been too pious already if you pass 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.090
 by that I know you're good too 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.280
 more if you want a fake card 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.169
 other opuses that it does not exist in 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.400
 solo like that I kill you tell me I'll tell you 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.139
 send it when I send it 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.880
 free 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:42.160
 here is see behind is already upside down 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.519
 the color is ugly on the map and cdu 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.859
 it's shit so only one kid a 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.090
 rate gates worse go to a reliquat of his 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:53.269
 series 9 the nine 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.500
 alairac cnra spilled hinges joking at 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:04.519
 his bio I cross red yes roundabout 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:13.519
 fear machault and I 'm the niece and 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:14.629
 brabham I know more it's more 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.729
 by that could create a real one 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.109
 Here I will if it's the second 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:23.450
 same thing I did not want others I 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.350
 prefer to offer them like that then 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.940
 it's not the same thing every time 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.870
 here I just did not have a chance 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:33.979
 I had twice the ca 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.760
 what she is beautiful this one whaou to 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.810
 the magnificent ones 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.669
 it's one of the most beautiful cards that 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.870
 I have never seen for now I know 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.889
 not even if it belongs to Syria 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.210
 do not recognize the logo at the bottom 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.530
 possible it is possible because all 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.610
 the cards are the same series it's 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.830
 possible that it sounded true kart legend 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.620
 is forgotten and monk are so 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.639
 so ugly hippie break but that I 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.840
 will never give wise men and 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.930
 pretty flowers exchange rates 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.479
 low medica still normal position 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:05.599
 morphed in the sun - it's good I'm reviewing 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:09.500
 the English names these vipers when he 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:13.160
 is called him terral and audio that's it 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.099
 must continue here is it you do 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.270
 not have a guy like me and if you 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.289
 do not miss 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.870
 we must not allow ourselves to be 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.039
 counterfeiting it's forbidden and you 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.470
 see there the cards are upside down with 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.960
 at the level of some rights way it's 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.889
 forbidden so past these assets and I 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.710
 do not read the knowledge and I laughed well 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.500

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.690
 pleasure to the nettle link yes it has changed 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.450

00:06:10.609 --> 00:06:12.469
 had asked me to send a small 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:12.829
 little to see what we could have 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:14.059
 in 

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:15.589
 some told me we could have 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:17.529
 full of ultra and all but apparently 

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:21.139
 very poor even ultra vouvoyait 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.609
 down to him I'm always past that chipe 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.559

00:06:22.609 --> 00:06:29.209

 group x but here in raynaud horns 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:38.689
 loupiots shock match at all in n 15 in 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:39.769
 more and pretty flowers to which it lives 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:40.609
 not even the whole series I think 

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:42.379
 it's all of us did not have all the 

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:44.119
 series so that's okay listening and I hope 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:46.249
 this little opening made you laugh 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:47.989
 did you do you anyway 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:49.189
 discover some cards I had to put 

00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:52.849
 the little solo story of laughing a 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:55.729
 I did not want to sell them 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.899
 not too much to exchange them in large quantities 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:58.849
 because I did not want that to happen 

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:59.869
 found on ebay precisely that those who 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:03.039
 are going to resell them on ebay or 

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:06.019
 what I really wanted it to be 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.829
 that disappears what then after for 

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:07.129
 those who told me he wanted them 

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:08.989
 keep 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:10.779
 just for the illustrations that 

00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:12.739
 I was going to send your problem but 

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:14.989
 that's what we can have in this genre 

00:07:12.739 --> 00:07:16.819
 of shit booster it really does 

00:07:14.989 --> 00:07:18.889
 finally it's really annoying to receive 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:19.969
 that's just a little bit of a bit 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:22.669
 disgusted because I was looking forward to them 

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:24.769
 open to smr see I will not go to 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:25.699
 cncd must booster it is for nothing 

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:26.869
 what we can have dance that will have 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:29.259
 a little video to show some 

00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:30.949
 fake boosters you do not have 

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.449
 check well do not like me 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:34.009
 will see that it's true 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:37.219
 booster williams to carthage even quirky 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:40.489
 it's amazing if these cards you 

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:41.599
 interest you either you pay 

00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:43.789
 postage I send you all this 

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:44.689
 not bother at all or we do a 

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:47.230
 exchange and I wanted to put in 

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:49.330
 when as a gift no problem 

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.610
 they go to the trash bin roughly 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.050
 that's it so here I hope this 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.070
 video anyway you rush me it's me 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.750
 pleasure to show them when 

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.730
 same and we find ourselves very quickly to 

00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:00.540
 an upcoming video by then take yourself 

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.540
