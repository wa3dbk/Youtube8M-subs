00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.780
 We are somewhere in the neighborhood of 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.060
 tacubaya one of the zones 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.400
 most interesting architectural 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.830
 Mexico City is the home of study 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.450
 luis barragán that opens its doors to 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.910
 public with guided tours and 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.520
 temporary exhibitions what will be the 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.740
 magic of this house famous for its 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.099
 conception of light and the management of its 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.500
 colors between lost towns and neighborhoods 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.079
 who refuse to disappear in the city 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.810
 of mexico there are rare testimonies of 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.390
 visionary architecture the house luis 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.000
 Barragán is an ideal meeting point 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.519
 to know the neighborhood of Tacubaya but 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.519
 this house is like a separate universe 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.080
 it was in 2004 when the house is proclaimed 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.750
 in equity and all this is due to the 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.520
 type of architecture that is us 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.660
 showing is giving us away since it is 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.559
 something like very Mexican its colors 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.380
 Estevez picking up these reminiscences 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.600
 not of the Mexican haciendas of the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.619
 17th century this type of architecture 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.410
 vernacular then all this is going to 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.660
 project globally and is what 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.490
 will do as a unique space in addition 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.649
 that you will handle one type of 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.700
 emotional architecture of who feels the 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:29.210
 spaces more than everything 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.729
 when it was built in 1948 in the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.920
 numbers 12 and 14 of the general street 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.289
 Francisco Ramirez was one of the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.200
 most advanced real estate examples 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.679
 of your time and maybe this has not 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.470
 changed he comes here in 47 the 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.929
 begins to build and dies in this 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.719
 house in 88 then it will not be your 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.729
 house and it's going to be your study in the 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.460
 interior of the house everything is intact 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.149
 just as it was when the habit Luis 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.369
 barragán this is the space where to me 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.170
 I have seen more people than at 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.299
 moment that enters and sees this contrast 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.520
 with the rose starts to cry 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.619
 this room will be illuminated by 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.780
 that window as you see we are not going to 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.000
 have no focus on the ceiling everything is 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.769
 natural lighting and this is for 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.730
 achieve this reflection of colors and 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.140
 light in this place is the most 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.360
 emblematic of the house true 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.160
 exactly what is then of the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.890
 second part of the library and the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.220
 most famous element of all of the entire 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.260
 house is going to be your staircase in cantiliver 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.270
 good what cantiliver means in this 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.600
 case will be embedded to the wall and will 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.020
 it seems that the ladder floats 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.630
 call it like stairs and finally it's 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.600
 an element that is also used in 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.220
 the on the haciendas but it is not that they are 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.650
 scalars that will take you nowhere 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.480
 but they are like meeting points where 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.730
 They are like bleachers, not sometimes 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.530
 feel children or people tell 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.110
 the story is placed on plants 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.940
 then this is seen by Barragán in his 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.880
 houses like an autobiography all that 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.550
 he saw everything he perceived and this 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.000
 pose I was going to like architecture so 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.000
 call him 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.760
 with the reflection of this light and in this 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.160
 case that is reflecting on this 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.230
 golden archangel and in combination with the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.960
 wood will give us this feeling a 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.590
 little as something very mystical like 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.590
 religious 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.590
 barragán always talked about that the 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.440
 gardens should look like houses and 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.360
 houses should look like gardens in this 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.580
 case as we're going to notice we do not have 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.980
 here a frame in the fence window 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.770
 embedded the wall and this to achieve a 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.360
 greater connection to the garden as if 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.760
 this crystal did not exist as if 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.440
 will float and the wall that we have in the 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.020
 part of the outside will help us do that 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.700
 there is visual continuity that invites us to 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.700
 go more towards this garden 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.310
 the garden is thick almost jungle luis 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.860
 Barragán decided to allow the free 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.540
 growth of vegetation and with a 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.510
 design that seems to come from the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.030
 convent gardens also thought about what 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.459
 pleasant and reassuring that resulted 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.530
 observe this garden from the comfort 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.530
 of the room and one of the dining rooms 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.360
 and we're also going to find this side on 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.250
 pritzker award from barragán he is the 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.889
 second in history to win he wins 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.490
 in 1980 and is the only Mexican who has 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.860
 accomplished 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.610
 the pritzker is the equivalent of the nobel 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.610
 of architecture 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.940
 usually us what we have 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.660
 to visit the house are guided tours 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.820
 that are every hour and more that all this does not 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.560
 illuminate knowing the people what 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.979
 was the architecture of Barragán Tsar with 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.979
 the visits
