guess I'm guessing that that was
supposed<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.970> be<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.270> voices<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.900> dead

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
supposed to be the voices of dead

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.760 
supposed to be the voices of dead
children<00:02:28.550> or<00:02:29.550> something<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.150> and

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
children or something like that and

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.380 
children or something like that and
toward<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.800> end<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.370> clip<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.970> kind<00:02:33.330> of

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
toward the end of that clip it kind of

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.270 
toward the end of that clip it kind of
sound<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.780> me<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:33.930> something<00:02:34.440> was<00:02:34.770> fiddling

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
sound to me like something was fiddling

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.980 
sound to me like something was fiddling
with<00:02:35.430> locks<00:02:35.730> or<00:02:36.030> fiddling<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.660> chains

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
with locks or fiddling with the chains

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.650 
with locks or fiddling with the chains
from<00:02:37.680> inside<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.370> Crypt<00:02:38.880> maybe<00:02:39.210> trying<00:02:39.570> to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
from inside the Crypt maybe trying to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.660 
from inside the Crypt maybe trying to
break<00:02:39.900> out<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.350> maybe<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.280> was<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.430> ghost

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
break out of there maybe it was a ghost

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.660 
break out of there maybe it was a ghost
kind<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.570> sounded<00:02:42.810> like<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.380> me<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:44.130> yeah

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
kind of sounded like that to me so yeah

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.060 
kind of sounded like that to me so yeah

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
think we've really seen any audio Easter

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.410 
think we've really seen any audio Easter
eggs<00:02:49.050> before<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.680> here's<00:02:50.430> another<00:02:50.490> Easter

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
eggs before and here's another Easter

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.350 
eggs before and here's another Easter
egg<00:02:51.540> sort<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.050> kind<00:02:52.770> of<00:02:52.860> reminds<00:02:53.430> me<00:02:53.490> of<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
egg sort of kind of reminds me of the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.260 
egg sort of kind of reminds me of the
fish<00:02:54.780> in<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.290> map<00:02:55.440> estate<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.190> modern<00:02:57.150> warfare

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
fish in the map estate in modern warfare

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.620 
fish in the map estate in modern warfare
2<00:02:58.520> basically<00:02:59.520> I<00:02:59.700> guess<00:02:59.760> that's<00:03:00.150> supposed<00:03:00.510> to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
2 basically I guess that's supposed to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.160 
2 basically I guess that's supposed to
be<00:03:00.660> wine<00:03:00.990> bottles<00:03:01.500> or<00:03:01.680> something<00:03:02.070> or<00:03:03.170> wine
