both of these products will bail and
show<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.559> how<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> use<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> Millers<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
show you how to use the Millers just the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.820 
show you how to use the Millers just the
basics<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.299> there's<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.600> tutorial<00:01:07.020> that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
shows you how to bail stuff all right so

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.800 
shows you how to bail stuff all right so
let's<00:01:10.979> turn<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.460> see<00:01:12.390> if<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.570> starts

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
let's turn it on see if it starts

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.570 
let's turn it on see if it starts
picking<00:01:12.960> stuff<00:01:13.260> up<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.770> apparently<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.369> did

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
picking stuff up and apparently it did

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.160 
picking stuff up and apparently it did
right<00:01:14.760> off<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> bat<00:01:15.240> so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.070 

we<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:20.009> bail<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.700> stuff<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.630> that's

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
we can bail this stuff that's that's

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.190 
we can bail this stuff that's that's
good<00:01:22.700> all<00:01:23.700> right<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.119> I've<00:01:24.420> set<00:01:24.689> us<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> speed

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
good all right so I've set us to speed

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.310 
good all right so I've set us to speed
to<00:01:25.439> which<00:01:25.799> might<00:01:26.070> be<00:01:26.100> nuts<00:01:26.670> good<00:01:27.140> all<00:01:28.140> right

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
to which might be nuts good all right

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.530 
to which might be nuts good all right

I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna turn off
the<00:02:19.370> Baylor<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.780> we're<00:02:21.110> going<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.260> go<00:02:21.380> over<00:02:21.410> to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
the Baylor and we're going to go over to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.470 
the Baylor and we're going to go over to
the<00:02:21.770> other<00:02:21.890> side<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.580> see<00:02:22.880> if<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.000> grass

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
the other side and see if that grass

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.860 
the other side and see if that grass
just<00:02:23.780> picks<00:02:24.110> up<00:02:24.320> or<00:02:24.620> if<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.070> won't<00:02:25.280> do<00:02:25.430> anything

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
just picks up or if it won't do anything

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.830 

it's<00:03:53.420> not<00:03:53.570> even<00:03:53.720> let<00:03:54.050> me<00:03:54.200> sail<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:56.390> get<00:03:56.600> rid<00:03:56.810> of

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
see none of the buttons 10 download so

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.689 
see none of the buttons 10 download so
maybe<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:09.569> can't<00:04:10.549> unload<00:04:11.549> this<00:04:11.849> vehicle

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.379 

now<00:04:16.699> i'm<00:04:17.090> guessing<00:04:17.449> you<00:04:17.540> can't<00:04:17.720> unload<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:18.229> so

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
now i'm guessing you can't unload it so

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.010 
now i'm guessing you can't unload it so
that<00:04:20.389> tells<00:04:20.660> me<00:04:20.870> that<00:04:22.600> what<00:04:23.600> do<00:04:23.660> you<00:04:23.690> do<00:04:23.870> if

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
that tells me that what do you do if

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.350 
that tells me that what do you do if
you've<00:04:24.229> been<00:04:24.620> bailing<00:04:24.889> grass<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.880> then<00:04:26.210> you

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
you've been bailing grass and then you

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.100 
you've been bailing grass and then you
decide<00:04:26.690> you<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:27.410> do<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.340> other<00:04:28.460> stuff<00:04:29.110> anyhow

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
decide you to do the other stuff anyhow

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.159 
decide you to do the other stuff anyhow
so<00:04:31.070> yeah<00:04:31.280> I'm<00:04:31.460> guessing<00:04:31.910> I'm<00:04:32.120> going<00:04:32.479> to<00:04:32.660> hear

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169
