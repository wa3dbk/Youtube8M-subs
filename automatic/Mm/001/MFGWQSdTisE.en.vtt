playing if you set yourself up correctly
now<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.699> will<00:00:17.850> avoid<00:00:18.119> avoid<00:00:18.600> tons<00:00:19.020> of

headaches and bad habits down the line

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.529 
headaches and bad habits down the line
and<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.710> will<00:00:22.949> apply<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.189> every<00:00:23.850> genre

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
and this will apply to every genre

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.900 
and this will apply to every genre
pretty<00:00:25.080> much<00:00:25.320> universally<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.279> makes<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.609> big

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
pretty much universally it makes a big

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.670 
pretty much universally it makes a big
difference<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.630> learning<00:00:27.779> process<00:00:28.380> and

difference in your learning process and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.589 
difference in your learning process and
in<00:00:28.859> my<00:00:28.980> opinion<00:00:29.340> if<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.820> get<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.090> right<00:00:30.300> early

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
in my opinion if you get it right early

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.330 
in my opinion if you get it right early
on<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.170> accelerates<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:31.890> learning<00:00:32.130> process

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
on it accelerates your learning process

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.920 
on it accelerates your learning process
that<00:00:32.759> way<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.120> get<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> fun<00:00:33.660> stuff

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that way you can get to the fun stuff

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.709 
that way you can get to the fun stuff
later<00:00:34.700> although<00:00:35.700> having<00:00:36.000> said<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.270> what

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
later although having said that what

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.360 
later although having said that what
you're<00:00:36.809> gonna<00:00:36.899> find<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.680> lot<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you're gonna find is that a lot of the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.690 
you're gonna find is that a lot of the
classic<00:00:38.879> guitar<00:00:39.090> players<00:00:39.950> didn't<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.160> what

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
classic guitar players didn't have what

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.130 
classic guitar players didn't have what
is<00:00:41.820> considered<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.300> traditionally<00:00:42.930> good

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
is considered to be traditionally good

is considered to be traditionally good
technique<00:00:43.760> Jimi<00:00:44.760> Hendrix<00:00:45.180> had<00:00:45.920> very<00:00:46.920> strange

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
technique Jimi Hendrix had very strange

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.130 
technique Jimi Hendrix had very strange
unique<00:00:47.910> technique<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.660> wouldn't

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
unique technique and that wouldn't

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.840 
unique technique and that wouldn't
necessarily<00:00:49.200> apply<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> everyone<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.760> what

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
necessarily apply to everyone so what

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.430 
necessarily apply to everyone so what
we're<00:00:50.940> gonna<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.300> talk<00:00:51.510> about<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
we're gonna do is talk about the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.939 
we're gonna do is talk about the
classical<00:00:53.070> technique<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.840> has<00:00:55.140> never

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
classical technique and it has never

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.920 
classical technique and it has never
failed<00:00:56.250> me<00:00:56.520> or<00:00:56.789> any<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.180> my<00:00:57.300> students<00:00:57.719> I'm<00:00:57.899> a

people<00:02:20.880> feel<00:02:21.480> like<00:02:21.720> when<00:02:21.990> they're<00:02:22.080> playing

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
people feel like when they're playing

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.290 
people feel like when they're playing
and<00:02:22.590> they<00:02:22.680> get<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.070> third<00:02:23.310> string<00:02:23.580> they

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
and they get to the third string they

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.970 
and they get to the third string they
should<00:02:24.570> start<00:02:24.840> creeping<00:02:25.080> their<00:02:25.410> thumb<00:02:25.650> around

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
should start creeping their thumb around

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.980 
should start creeping their thumb around
and<00:02:26.250> twisting<00:02:26.640> their<00:02:26.820> wrists<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.720> what

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
and twisting their wrists and what

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.140 
and twisting their wrists and what
happens<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.370> pulls<00:02:29.640> our<00:02:29.910> back

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
happens is it is it pulls our back

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.210 
happens is it is it pulls our back
knuckles<00:02:30.690> away<00:02:30.900> from<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.530> guitar<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.100> this

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
knuckles away from the guitar and this

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.620 
knuckles away from the guitar and this
is<00:02:32.370> bad<00:02:32.550> news

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
is bad news

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.960 
is bad news
so<00:02:34.230> we<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.680> correct<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.280> by<00:02:35.490> always<00:02:35.730> keeping

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
so we can correct that by always keeping

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.080 
so we can correct that by always keeping
our<00:02:36.420> wrists<00:02:36.780> slightly<00:02:37.650> bent<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.610> doesn't<00:02:38.880> you

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
our wrists slightly bent it doesn't you

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.670 
our wrists slightly bent it doesn't you
don't<00:02:39.209> have<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.390> really<00:02:39.810> contort<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.560> a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
don't have to really contort it just a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.990 
don't have to really contort it just a
slight<00:02:40.980> wrist<00:02:41.280> Bend<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.640> make<00:02:41.820> sure<00:02:41.970> our

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
slight wrist Bend to make sure our

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000 
slight wrist Bend to make sure our
punching<00:02:42.510> knuckles<00:02:42.870> are<00:02:43.080> about<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.770> same

punching knuckles are about the same
height<00:02:44.280> as<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.490> fretboard<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.660> reason<00:02:45.930> we<00:02:46.050> do

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
height as the fretboard the reason we do

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.980 
height as the fretboard the reason we do
this<00:02:46.380> is<00:02:46.620> because<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.480> feel<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:48.510> playing

fingertip notice the whole hand is just

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.449 
fingertip notice the whole hand is just
gonna<00:04:02.670> like<00:04:02.910> shift<00:04:03.299> back<00:04:03.709> it<00:04:04.709> makes<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.070> pretty

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
gonna like shift back it makes it pretty

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.370 
gonna like shift back it makes it pretty
difficult<00:04:05.549> to<00:04:06.060> stretch<00:04:06.330> so<00:04:06.600> if<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.110> first

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
difficult to stretch so if that first

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.289

finger is nice and straight across the
fretboard<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.959> then<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.980> just<00:04:11.160> kind<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.459> drop

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
those I'll have like half-inch gaps in

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.539 
those I'll have like half-inch gaps in
between<00:04:15.930> each<00:04:16.140> finger<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.709> I'm<00:04:17.070> able<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.310> play

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
to reach like two five or six really

to reach like two five or six really
stretch<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.610> out<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:32.180> then<00:04:32.330> just<00:04:32.480> slide<00:04:32.900> your

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.529 

but<00:05:14.139> for<00:05:15.139> now<00:05:15.880> around<00:05:16.880> the<00:05:17.060> early<00:05:17.180> learning

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
but for now around the early learning

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.839 
but for now around the early learning
stages<00:05:18.080> I<00:05:18.229> would<00:05:18.949> just<00:05:19.130> say<00:05:19.310> get<00:05:19.610> acclimated

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
stages I would just say get acclimated

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.990 
stages I would just say get acclimated
to<00:05:20.300> playing<00:05:20.690> like<00:05:20.960> this<00:05:21.169> and<00:05:21.470> then<00:05:22.430> slowly<00:05:22.729> but

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
to playing like this and then slowly but

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.960 
to playing like this and then slowly but
surely<00:05:23.110> learn<00:05:24.110> when<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:25.039> can<00:05:25.250> bend<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.729> rules

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
surely learn when you can bend the rules

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.839 
surely learn when you can bend the rules
or<00:05:26.300> where<00:05:26.509> you<00:05:26.630> can<00:05:26.780> break<00:05:27.020> them<00:05:27.340> but<00:05:28.340> this

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
or where you can break them but this

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.129 
or where you can break them but this
this<00:05:29.090> is<00:05:29.240> going<00:05:29.389> to<00:05:29.539> put<00:05:29.690> you<00:05:29.750> in<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:29.930> best

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
this is going to put you in the best

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.070 
this is going to put you in the best
position<00:05:30.620> to<00:05:30.650> play<00:05:30.949> and<00:05:31.220> have<00:05:32.090> a<00:05:32.120> good<00:05:32.389> healthy
