00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:32.840
 what's up they're good with you there's no 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:36.410
 tricks scripts claim them from the eaten and 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.580
 well let's start with the first the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.000
 first we are not going to fall slowly from 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.000
 some site 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.470
 practice on the edge of a map go 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.860
 placing the to become that now 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.860
 add 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:08.630
 the first are difficult and good 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:11.090
 the practical insertion is placed and we're going 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.190
 watching little by little in case you fall 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.360
 although nothing happens because the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.780
 investment, nothing will happen to you 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.780
 and good 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.080
 we place the destination points 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.350
 a little 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.490
 and important when you see that you fall 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.490
 you have to shoot 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.090
 the team 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.640
 when you are going to fall as happens here 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.120
 slowly 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.360
 let's see it from other perspectives 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:59.729
 so that directly stays like this I do not know 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.729
 if I want to write I write heat 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.259
 slowly the character and good here is 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.840
 well or trick today the eclipse with great 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.060

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.240
