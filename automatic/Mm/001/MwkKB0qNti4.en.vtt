00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
people like Chris move and stuff like

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.609 
people like Chris move and stuff like
that<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.110> say<00:01:22.350> would

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
that so that they would say would

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.120 
that so that they would say would
actually<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.520> game<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> think

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
actually be in the game and so I think

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.950 
actually be in the game and so I think
that<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.060> good<00:01:27.390> decision<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
that you know the good decision that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.569 
that you know the good decision that
they<00:01:28.080> make<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.460> should

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
they make in what they think should

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.850 
they make in what they think should
happen<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.900> takes<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.439> pretty<00:01:31.619> big

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
happen I think that takes a pretty big

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460 
happen I think that takes a pretty big
effect<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.420> how<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> game<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.900> made<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
effect in a how the game is made in a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.530 
effect in a how the game is made in a
tell<00:01:35.130> me<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.280> I'm<00:01:35.400> wrong<00:01:35.520> about<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.240> that

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
tell me if I'm wrong about that but that

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.149 
tell me if I'm wrong about that but that
seemed<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.960> case<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.500> time<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
seemed to be the case all the time and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.770 
seemed to be the case all the time and
so<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:38.909> obviously<00:01:39.000> they're<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.630> going
