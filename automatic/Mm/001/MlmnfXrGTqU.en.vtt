now<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.160> next<00:03:14.370> bit<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.640> going<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:14.880> seem<00:03:15.030> a

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
now this next bit is going to seem a

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.450 
now this next bit is going to seem a
little<00:03:15.360> bit<00:03:15.600> crazy<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:16.590> I've<00:03:16.770> really<00:03:17.220> been

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
little bit crazy but I've really been

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.160 
little bit crazy but I've really been
looking<00:03:17.520> at<00:03:18.000> her<00:03:18.150> look<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.630> video<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.110> I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
looking at her look in the video and I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.660 
looking at her look in the video and I
think<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.770> this<00:03:19.830> is<00:03:19.890> what<00:03:20.190> she's<00:03:20.370> done<00:03:20.520> you

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
think that this is what she's done you

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.580 
think that this is what she's done you
can<00:03:20.790> kind<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.090> see<00:03:21.270> in<00:03:21.450> some<00:03:21.690> lights<00:03:21.900> obviously

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
can kind of see in some lights obviously

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.020 
can kind of see in some lights obviously
the<00:03:22.680> videos<00:03:22.980> quite<00:03:23.250> grungy<00:03:23.670> as<00:03:23.790> all<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
the videos quite grungy as all the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.630 
the videos quite grungy as all the
pretty<00:03:24.180> reckless<00:03:24.390> ones<00:03:24.780> are<00:03:25.050> but<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.770> I<00:03:26.190> think

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
pretty reckless ones are but and I think

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.820 
pretty reckless ones are but and I think
this<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.820> kind<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.270> what's<00:03:27.510> going<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.620> take

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
this is kind of what's going on to take

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.440 
this is kind of what's going on to take
a<00:03:28.860> bit<00:03:29.130> more<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.430> same<00:03:29.760> charcoal<00:03:30.420> II

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.690 
because it's just kind of how I tend to
do<00:04:36.170> things<00:04:36.350> I'm<00:04:36.890> just<00:04:36.950> going<00:04:37.100> to<00:04:37.160> add<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.520> bit<00:04:37.670> of

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.070 
do things I'm just going to add a bit of
foundation<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:38.300> always<00:04:38.540> tend<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:38.870> be<00:04:38.930> my

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
foundation I always tend to be my

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.600 
foundation I always tend to be my
foundation<00:04:39.560> after<00:04:39.740> my<00:04:39.980> eyes<00:04:40.160> because<00:04:40.430> i

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
foundation after my eyes because i

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.980

and it's just so much easier for me to
do<00:04:44.510> foundation<00:04:44.930> afterwards<00:04:45.350> rather<00:04:45.830> than

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
do foundation afterwards rather than

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.860
