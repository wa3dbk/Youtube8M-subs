00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
we're taking a look at how to solve some

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.320 
we're taking a look at how to solve some
of<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.130> Riddler's<00:00:05.520> puzzles

seem simple but they're a little more

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.050 
seem simple but they're a little more
complicated<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.550> one<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.910> have<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
complicated for this one you have a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.590 
objective for this one you have to dive
bomb<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.550> get<00:01:20.700> through<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.880> opening<00:01:21.000> quickly

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
bomb to get through the opening quickly

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.750 
bomb to get through the opening quickly
once<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.380> smash<00:01:22.740> through<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.160> opening<00:01:23.550> will

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
once you smash through the opening will

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.219 
once you smash through the opening will
be<00:01:23.880> secured<00:01:24.240> again<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.690> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:24.990> bat

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
be secured again so you can just bat

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.850 
be secured again so you can just bat
claw<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.650> way<00:01:25.710> out

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860
