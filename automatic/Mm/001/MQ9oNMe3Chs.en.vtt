I want that middle buns I know you do

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.330 
I want that middle buns I know you do
mm-hmm<00:00:49.309> then<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.430> create<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.730> 2d<00:00:51.090> sketch<00:00:51.360> on

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
mm-hmm then you create a 2d sketch on

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.850 
mm-hmm then you create a 2d sketch on
that<00:00:53.340> top<00:00:53.670> side<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.320> new<00:00:55.440> cylinder<00:00:56.840> okay

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
that top side of the new cylinder okay

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.170 
that top side of the new cylinder okay
2d<00:00:58.860> sketch<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> top<00:00:59.730> side<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
2d sketch on the top side of the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.600 
2d sketch on the top side of the
cylinder<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.559> create<00:01:01.890> another<00:01:02.100> circle

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
cylinder and you create another circle

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.560 
cylinder and you create another circle
in<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.600> very<00:01:03.870> center<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:05.509> its<00:01:06.509> diameter<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
in the very center and its diameter is

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.510 
in the very center and its diameter is
0.4<00:01:12.500> alright<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.920> you're<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.130> on

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
0.4 alright see where you're going on

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.060 
0.4 alright see where you're going on
this<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.119> finish<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.540> sketch<00:01:15.920> then<00:01:16.920> you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
this then you finish the sketch then you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.240 
this then you finish the sketch then you
extrude<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:18.420> circle<00:01:18.990> plus<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.979> middle

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
extrude that circle plus the middle

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.100 
extrude that circle plus the middle
circle<00:01:20.399> that<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.880> automatically<00:01:21.390> defaults<00:01:21.960> as

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
circle that it automatically defaults as

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.100 
circle that it automatically defaults as
not<00:01:22.320> being<00:01:22.530> part<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> other<00:01:23.130> circle<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
not being part of the other circle and

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.260 
not being part of the other circle and
you<00:01:25.110> extrude<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.220> point<00:01:26.610> six<00:01:26.850> five<00:01:26.910> minutes

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
you extrude it so point six five minutes

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.719 
you extrude it so point six five minutes
okay<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.050> shoot<00:01:28.289> it<00:01:29.509> point<00:01:30.509> 10<00:01:31.729> soup

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
okay so then you shoot it point 10 soup

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.600 
okay so then you shoot it point 10 soup
shoot<00:01:33.360> point<00:01:36.440> 15.15<00:01:37.440> so<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.160> extrude<00:01:38.429> that

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
shoot point 15.15 so you extrude that

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.180 
shoot point 15.15 so you extrude that
circle<00:01:39.000> point<00:01:39.780> 15<00:01:42.649> everybody<00:01:43.649> following<00:01:44.009> me

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
circle point 15 everybody following me

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.010 
circle point 15 everybody following me
no<00:01:44.759> maybe<00:01:45.660> ya<00:01:46.820> know<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.880> extrude<00:01:48.330> this<00:01:48.630> circle

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
no maybe ya know you extrude this circle

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.160 
no maybe ya know you extrude this circle
point<00:01:49.229> 10<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:51.150> bottom<00:01:51.479> circle<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:52.110> point<00:01:53.009> 05

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.580 

I<00:01:58.549> think<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.640> lost<00:01:59.790> them<00:02:00.060> let<00:02:01.020> them<00:02:01.049> catch<00:02:01.409> up

carepoint 650 is your your that doesn't
look<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> right<00:02:23.580> dimension<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.060> yours

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
look like the right dimension on yours

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.730 
look like the right dimension on yours
not<00:02:24.600> really<00:02:24.930> sure<00:02:25.350> on<00:02:25.470> point<00:02:25.740> this<00:02:25.950> point<00:02:26.700> 05
