a real corset per se it was my burlesque

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.250 
a real corset per se it was my burlesque
of<00:00:17.400> corset<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.880> did<00:00:18.090> find<00:00:18.270> out<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:19.020> have

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
of corset that I did find out to have

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.429 
of corset that I did find out to have
plastic<00:00:20.250> bones<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.939> no<00:00:21.720> waist<00:00:21.960> tape<00:00:22.230> or

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.330 
plastic bones and no waist tape or
anything<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:22.920> was<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> disappointment

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
anything so that was a disappointment

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.390 
anything so that was a disappointment
but<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.269> one<00:00:24.449> cost<00:00:24.720> me<00:00:25.050> almost<00:00:25.710> $100

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
but that one cost me almost $100

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.279 
but that one cost me almost $100
after-tax<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.359> must<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.660> been<00:00:27.779> close<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
after-tax so it must have been close to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.250 
after-tax so it must have been close to
about<00:00:28.439> $85<00:00:29.400> before<00:00:29.789> tax<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.720> had<00:00:30.960> purchased

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
about $85 before tax and I had purchased

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.880 
about $85 before tax and I had purchased
that<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.980> local<00:00:32.730> store<00:00:33.170> my<00:00:34.170> first<00:00:34.350> real

ended up causing me some problems that
was<00:01:34.259> my<00:01:34.680> fault<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.130> his<00:01:35.490> because<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.119> ordered<00:01:36.869> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
was my fault not his because I ordered a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.740 
was my fault not his because I ordered a
couple<00:01:37.680> sizes<00:01:38.490> smaller<00:01:39.119> than<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.540> probably

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
couple sizes smaller than I probably

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.109 
couple sizes smaller than I probably
should<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.369> considering<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.610> experience

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
should have considering my experience

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.719 
should have considering my experience
level<00:01:42.360> at<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> time<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.250> but<00:01:44.250> yeah

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
level at the time I but yeah

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.149 
level at the time I but yeah
so<00:01:44.880> that's<00:01:45.210> how<00:01:45.420> much<00:01:45.659> my<00:01:45.840> first<00:01:46.229> few<00:01:46.619> corsets

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
so that's how much my first few corsets

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.280 
so that's how much my first few corsets
had<00:01:47.340> cost<00:01:47.670> depending<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.630> situation<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
had cost depending on the situation and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.840 
had cost depending on the situation and
depending<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.009> consider<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.399> corset

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
depending on what you consider a corset

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.929 
depending on what you consider a corset
and<00:01:51.560> that<00:01:52.560> that's<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.189> day<00:01:53.280> 15<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.820> I'll

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
and that that's all for day 15 so I'll

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.680
