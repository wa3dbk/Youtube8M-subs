00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.880 
of cool we also have this the cow one
but<00:02:19.630> I'll<00:02:19.960> get<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.290> in<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.620> minute

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
but I'll get to that in a minute

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
so first of all the big one spawns two

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.960 
so first of all the big one spawns two
bakes<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.770> should<00:02:23.920> have<00:02:24.010> spawned<00:02:24.310> one<00:02:24.520> Pig<00:02:24.790> but

head<00:04:08.769> sure<00:04:09.070> if<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.209> was<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.600> mention<00:04:10.870> but<00:04:10.989> this

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
head sure if it was to mention but this

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.390 
head sure if it was to mention but this
is<00:04:11.410> pretty<00:04:11.590> much<00:04:11.680> how<00:04:11.860> you<00:04:11.890> make<00:04:12.100> it<00:04:12.220> so<00:04:12.310> the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
is pretty much how you make it so the

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.370 
is pretty much how you make it so the
power<00:04:12.549> stone<00:04:12.760> is<00:04:12.790> used<00:04:13.060> for<00:04:13.750> different<00:04:14.260> stuff

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
power stone is used for different stuff

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.660 
power stone is used for different stuff
as<00:04:14.560> well<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:14.799> pretty<00:04:15.160> much<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.400> normal

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
as well so pretty much the normal

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.030 
as well so pretty much the normal
recipes<00:04:16.269> but<00:04:16.450> with<00:04:16.660> power<00:04:16.870> stones<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.410> these

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
recipes but with power stones and these

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.130 
recipes but with power stones and these
items<00:04:18.400> are<00:04:18.669> stronger<00:04:19.180> than<00:04:19.359> diamond<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:20.080> you

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
items are stronger than diamond and you

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.380 
items are stronger than diamond and you
also<00:04:20.229> have<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.530> multi-tool<00:04:21.120> multi-tool<00:04:22.120> not

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
and it's even stronger than diamond but

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.460 
and it's even stronger than diamond but
there<00:04:42.400> is<00:04:42.610> an<00:04:42.850> even<00:04:43.120> stronger<00:04:43.479> sword<00:04:44.080> and

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470

there is an even stronger sword and
that's<00:04:45.479> that's<00:04:46.479> not<00:04:46.990> in<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.260> form<00:04:47.500> but<00:04:48.100> I

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
that's that's not in the form but I

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.570 
that's that's not in the form but I
figured<00:04:49.120> it<00:04:49.240> out<00:04:49.410> this<00:04:50.410> is<00:04:50.860> how<00:04:51.130> to<00:04:51.190> make<00:04:51.550> it

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
figured it out this is how to make it

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.930 
figured it out this is how to make it
you<00:04:52.479> need<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.660> power<00:04:53.350> crystal<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.370> to<00:04:54.639> power

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
you need a power crystal and to power

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.830 
you need a power crystal and to power
stone<00:04:55.270> to<00:04:55.419> make<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.720> Power<00:04:56.229> Sword<00:04:56.919> plus<00:04:57.840> year

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
stone to make the Power Sword plus year

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.700 
stone to make the Power Sword plus year
bitch<00:05:00.120> take<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.360> back<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.900> just<00:05:02.080> want<00:05:02.260> to<00:05:02.440> see<00:05:02.620> if

I demonstrated all the stones and I did
which<00:05:05.860> is<00:05:06.070> excellent<00:05:06.780> now<00:05:07.780> how<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:07.960> make<00:05:08.260> the

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
which is excellent now how to make the

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.830 
which is excellent now how to make the
power<00:05:08.590> crystal<00:05:09.250> well<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.639> need<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:09.910> smelt

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
power crystal well you need to smelt

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.680 
power crystal well you need to smelt
a<00:05:11.100> power<00:05:12.100> crystal<00:05:12.669> yeah<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.150> you<00:05:13.270> get<00:05:13.419> a<00:05:13.450> pair

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
a power crystal yeah and you get a pair

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.600 
a power crystal yeah and you get a pair
of<00:05:13.750> crystal<00:05:14.200> well<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.770> smelt<00:05:15.070> a<00:05:15.130> blue<00:05:15.310> one<00:05:15.490> and

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
of crystal well you smelt a blue one and

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.580 
of crystal well you smelt a blue one and
you<00:05:15.700> get<00:05:16.020> pink<00:05:17.820> big-ish<00:05:18.820> one<00:05:19.330> and<00:05:20.229> you<00:05:20.410> make

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
you get pink big-ish one and you make

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.710 
you get pink big-ish one and you make
the<00:05:20.919> power<00:05:21.130> crystal<00:05:21.639> with<00:05:21.789> four<00:05:22.060> diamonds<00:05:22.510> so

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
the power crystal with four diamonds so

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.800 
the power crystal with four diamonds so
does<00:05:23.020> that<00:05:23.320> and<00:05:23.590> it's<00:05:24.160> even<00:05:24.940> stronger<00:05:25.389> than<00:05:25.539> a

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
does that and it's even stronger than a

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.510 
does that and it's even stronger than a
diamond<00:05:26.080> so<00:05:26.380> let<00:05:26.500> me<00:05:26.590> demonstrate<00:05:26.710> it<00:05:27.010> here<00:05:27.310> on

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
diamond so let me demonstrate it here on

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.659 
diamond so let me demonstrate it here on
for<00:05:27.970> example<00:05:28.060> a<00:05:28.389> creeper<00:05:29.430> because<00:05:30.430> you<00:05:30.550> know
