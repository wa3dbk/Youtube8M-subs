00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
built and if you think about it in a few

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.670 
built and if you think about it in a few
years<00:03:01.790> say<00:03:02.359> if<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.659> kind<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.319> thing<00:03:03.500> goes

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
years say if that kind of thing goes

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.449 
years say if that kind of thing goes
mainstream<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:05.349> some<00:03:06.349> company<00:03:06.590> decides<00:03:07.129> to

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.710 
shit different toilet and I can't really
see<00:03:51.079> it<00:03:51.169> changing<00:03:51.650> all<00:03:51.799> that<00:03:51.859> much<00:03:52.280> because

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
see it changing all that much because

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.849 
see it changing all that much because
but<00:03:53.720> they<00:03:53.810> release<00:03:54.139> a<00:03:54.169> new<00:03:54.290> game<00:03:54.560> every<00:03:54.739> year

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
but they release a new game every year

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.110 
but they release a new game every year
and<00:03:55.129> it<00:03:55.220> really<00:03:55.370> doesn't<00:03:55.579> change<00:03:55.849> that<00:03:56.060> much

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
and it really doesn't change that much

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.210 
and it really doesn't change that much
so<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:56.780> can't<00:03:57.019> see<00:03:57.169> a<00:03:57.199> changing<00:03:57.590> look<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:58.040> much

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
so I can't see a changing look that much

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.970 
so I can't see a changing look that much
in<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.459> future<00:03:58.819> but<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.750> can<00:04:00.139> see<00:04:00.379> a<00:04:00.410> new<00:04:00.769> game

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
in the future but I can see a new game

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.729 
in the future but I can see a new game
evolving<00:04:01.549> into<00:04:02.060> something<00:04:02.090> like<00:04:02.540> that<00:04:02.810> where

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
evolving into something like that where

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.430 
evolving into something like that where
you<00:04:04.639> control<00:04:04.879> your<00:04:05.329> character<00:04:05.840> or<00:04:05.989> like<00:04:06.139> one

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
you control your character or like one

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.210 
you control your character or like one
hundred<00:04:06.709> percent<00:04:06.739> and<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:08.889> can<00:04:09.889> just<00:04:10.040> see<00:04:10.190> it

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
hundred percent and I can just see it

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.539 
hundred percent and I can just see it
evolving<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.269> know<00:04:11.419> gaming<00:04:12.169> is<00:04:12.530> at<00:04:13.340> that

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
evolving you know gaming is at that

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.009 
evolving you know gaming is at that
point<00:04:13.609> where<00:04:14.120> there<00:04:14.989> are<00:04:15.109> so<00:04:15.290> many<00:04:15.379> ideas<00:04:15.620> and

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
point where there are so many ideas and

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.020 
point where there are so many ideas and
things<00:04:18.019> that<00:04:18.229> are<00:04:18.349> able<00:04:18.530> to<00:04:18.799> be<00:04:18.949> made<00:04:19.699> right

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
things that are able to be made right

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.930 
things that are able to be made right
now<00:04:20.680> with<00:04:21.680> like<00:04:21.889> Kinect<00:04:22.310> sensors<00:04:22.729> and

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
now with like Kinect sensors and

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.939 
now with like Kinect sensors and
everything<00:04:23.330> that<00:04:23.840> it's<00:04:24.050> just<00:04:24.260> like<00:04:24.470> at<00:04:24.710> the

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
everything that it's just like at the

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.029 
everything that it's just like at the
next<00:04:25.280> stage<00:04:25.520> where<00:04:26.470> someone<00:04:27.470> comes<00:04:27.680> out<00:04:27.860> with

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
next stage where someone comes out with

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.330 
next stage where someone comes out with
one<00:04:28.340> more<00:04:28.580> thing<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.470> all<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.740> pieces<00:04:30.950> just

one more thing and all the pieces just
kind<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.610> go<00:04:31.729> together<00:04:31.880> like<00:04:32.090> a<00:04:32.270> puzzle<00:04:32.360> and

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
kind of go together like a puzzle and
