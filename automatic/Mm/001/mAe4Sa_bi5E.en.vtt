attraction<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> big<00:00:54.270> package<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:54.899> then

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
attraction it's a big package but then

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.229 
attraction it's a big package but then
this<00:00:55.170> water<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.649> very<00:00:55.680> dark-colored<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
this water is very dark-colored so the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.180 
this water is very dark-colored so the
spinner<00:00:57.449> baits<00:00:57.750> attracting<00:00:58.289> them<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
spinner baits attracting them and the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.700 
spinner baits attracting them and the
fact<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.699> thing<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.230> in<00:01:01.230> essence<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
fact that this thing is in essence the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.590 
fact that this thing is in essence the
swim<00:01:02.010> bait<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.550> also<00:01:02.730> swimming<00:01:03.270> adds<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
swim bait so it's also swimming adds a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.760 
swim bait so it's also swimming adds a
little<00:01:03.719> bit<00:01:04.519> more<00:01:05.519> intense<00:01:05.850> vibration<00:01:06.770> work

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
little bit more intense vibration work

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.770 
little bit more intense vibration work
death<00:01:08.040> time<00:01:08.280> anyway<00:01:08.640> we'll<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.420> happens

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
death time anyway we'll see what happens

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.539 
death time anyway we'll see what happens
as<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:09.960> keep<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.439> moving<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.580> down<00:01:11.850> here<00:01:13.549> of

probably<00:02:22.630> about<00:02:22.810> two<00:02:23.170> feet<00:02:23.380> that's<00:02:23.620> about<00:02:23.890> it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
probably about two feet that's about it

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.720 
probably about two feet that's about it

do is you want to experiment though with
the<00:02:33.970> trailers<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.660> seems<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.020> be

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
the trailers but that seems to be

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.040 
the trailers but that seems to be
working<00:02:35.440> right<00:02:35.560> now<00:02:35.910> there<00:02:36.910> oh<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.600> got<00:02:37.930> him

they're<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.580> wild<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:44.410> feels<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:44.830> good

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
they're just wild and it feels so good

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.800 
they're just wild and it feels so good
when<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.400> spinner<00:02:45.730> bait<00:02:45.940> thumping<00:02:46.360> just

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
when that spinner bait thumping just

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:55.850 
when that spinner bait thumping just
stops

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.710 

isn't<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:56.890> pretty<00:02:57.430> well<00:02:58.120> spinnerbaits<00:02:58.569> are

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
isn't that pretty well spinnerbaits are

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.199 
isn't that pretty well spinnerbaits are
beautiful<00:02:59.110> in<00:02:59.230> themselves<00:03:00.030> beautifully<00:03:01.030> made

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
and not big but not bad

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.550 
and not big but not bad
they<00:03:05.080> sure<00:03:05.260> are<00:03:05.290> aggressive<00:03:07.349> pretty<00:03:08.349> fish

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560

beautiful<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:13.090> know<00:03:13.180> one<00:03:14.019> common<00:03:14.410> question

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
beautiful you know one common question

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.860 
beautiful you know one common question
would<00:03:14.920> have<00:03:14.950> been<00:03:15.040> color<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.730> typically<00:03:16.660> I

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
would have been color and typically I

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.110 
would have been color and typically I
did<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.769> exact<00:03:18.099> opposite<00:03:18.610> today<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.940> what<00:03:19.090> I

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
did the exact opposite today of what I

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.430 
did the exact opposite today of what I
would<00:03:19.360> have<00:03:19.480> done<00:03:19.629> in<00:03:19.750> this<00:03:19.840> darker<00:03:20.230> water

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
would have done in this darker water

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.990 
would have done in this darker water
color<00:03:20.709> I<00:03:20.799> would<00:03:20.950> have<00:03:21.099> gone<00:03:21.220> with<00:03:21.340> gold<00:03:21.670> blades

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
color I would have gone with gold blades

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.150 
color I would have gone with gold blades
or<00:03:22.390> even<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.989> cop<00:03:23.200> or<00:03:23.379> maybe<00:03:23.650> some<00:03:23.890> kind<00:03:24.040> of

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
or even a cop or maybe some kind of

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.130 
or even a cop or maybe some kind of
combination<00:03:24.489> blade<00:03:24.909> but<00:03:25.659> the<00:03:25.780> white<00:03:25.959> and

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
combination blade but the white and

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.080 
combination blade but the white and
silver<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:26.739> certainly<00:03:27.159> working<00:03:27.370> great<00:03:27.819> right

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
silver is certainly working great right

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.759 
silver is certainly working great right
now<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.690> that's<00:03:29.049> just<00:03:29.260> part<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.709> the

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
now and that's just part of the

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.039 
now and that's just part of the
experiment<00:03:30.370> too<00:03:30.549> so<00:03:30.849> always<00:03:31.480> with<00:03:31.900> the

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
experiment too so always with the

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.809 
experiment too so always with the
fishing<00:03:32.410> it's<00:03:32.590> always<00:03:32.890> depth<00:03:33.129> control<00:03:33.370> first

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
fishing it's always depth control first

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.640 
fishing it's always depth control first
speed<00:03:34.599> control<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.230> then<00:03:35.319> how<00:03:35.470> you're

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
speed control and then how you're

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.069 
speed control and then how you're
working<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:36.129> bait<00:03:36.340> second<00:03:36.849> and<00:03:37.000> third<00:03:37.599> in<00:03:37.930> my

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
working the bait second and third in my

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.660 
working the bait second and third in my
estimation<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:38.890> that's<00:03:39.040> why<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.220> think<00:03:39.549> these

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
estimation and that's why I think these

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.220 
estimation and that's why I think these
swim<00:03:39.910> baits<00:03:40.120> are<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:40.390> important<00:03:40.840> in<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:40.959> lot<00:03:41.109> of

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
swim baits are so important in a lot of

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.470 
swim baits are so important in a lot of
situations<00:03:41.849> vibration<00:03:42.849> is<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.150> thing<00:03:43.329> that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
situations vibration is the thing that

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.509 
situations vibration is the thing that
really<00:03:43.629> seals<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.170> deal<00:03:44.200> before<00:03:44.560> color<00:03:45.040> or

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
really seals the deal before color or

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.089 
really seals the deal before color or
before<00:03:46.000> anything<00:03:46.390> else<00:03:46.680> having<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.829> do<00:03:47.950> with

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
before anything else having to do with

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.640 
before anything else having to do with
what<00:03:48.250> fishermen<00:03:48.760> typically<00:03:49.150> worry<00:03:49.359> about<00:03:49.690> so

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
what fishermen typically worry about so

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.470 
what fishermen typically worry about so
they're<00:03:50.829> seeing<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.370> flash<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:52.000> feeling<00:03:52.329> the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
they're seeing the flash and feeling the

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.780 
they're seeing the flash and feeling the
the<00:03:53.049> vibration<00:03:53.590> from<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.769> spinner<00:03:54.129> bait<00:03:54.370> but

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
the vibration from the spinner bait but

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.400 
the vibration from the spinner bait but
they're<00:03:54.940> also<00:03:55.090> feeling<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.660> vibration<00:03:56.230> from

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
they're also feeling the vibration from

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.740 
they're also feeling the vibration from
this<00:03:56.650> what<00:03:57.579> I<00:03:57.609> would<00:03:57.819> call<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.060> hybrid<00:03:58.299> swim

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
this what I would call a hybrid swim

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.509 
this what I would call a hybrid swim
bait<00:03:58.959> right<00:03:59.170> here<00:03:59.230> so<00:04:00.069> it's<00:04:00.220> not<00:04:00.340> only

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
bait right here so it's not only

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.370 
bait right here so it's not only
swimming<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.120> bottom<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.569> this<00:04:01.690> thing<00:04:01.930> but

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
swimming the bottom of this thing but

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.900 
swimming the bottom of this thing but
the<00:04:02.530> tail<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:02.859> something<00:04:03.160> back<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.489> forth<00:04:03.730> and

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
the tail is something back and forth and

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.690 
the tail is something back and forth and
