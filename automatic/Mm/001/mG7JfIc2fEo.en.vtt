three<00:05:46.750> I<00:05:46.990> think

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
three I think

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.780 
three I think
yep<00:05:47.950> three<00:05:48.340> okay<00:05:49.560> no<00:05:50.560> -<00:05:50.760> okay<00:05:51.760> -<00:05:53.610> what<00:05:54.610> do<00:05:54.670> you

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
yep three okay no - okay - what do you

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.670 
yep three okay no - okay - what do you
get<00:05:55.770> how<00:05:56.770> many<00:05:57.010> auxiliary<00:05:57.820> cable<00:05:58.330> see<00:05:59.050> a<00:05:59.230> mini

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
get how many auxiliary cable see a mini

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.630 
get how many auxiliary cable see a mini
auxilary<00:06:00.550> camera<00:06:02.220> I'll<00:06:03.220> be<00:06:03.430> demonstrating

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
auxilary camera I'll be demonstrating

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.200 
auxilary camera I'll be demonstrating
what<00:06:04.150> is<00:06:04.240> this<00:06:04.420> for<00:06:04.630> later<00:06:04.780> and<00:06:06.000> you<00:06:07.000> get

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
what is this for later and you get

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.600 
what is this for later and you get
another<00:06:07.450> cable<00:06:07.780> I<00:06:08.080> guess<00:06:08.560> this<00:06:08.980> one<00:06:09.220> is<00:06:09.370> for

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
another cable I guess this one is for

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.290 
another cable I guess this one is for
charging<00:06:10.000> as<00:06:10.180> you<00:06:10.360> can<00:06:10.540> see<00:06:10.690> look<00:06:10.870> right<00:06:11.050> look

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
charging as you can see look right look

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:22.920 
charging as you can see look right look
look<00:06:13.300> at<00:06:13.480> it<00:06:13.600> closely<00:06:15.750> see<00:06:19.170> thank<00:06:20.170> you<00:06:20.290> okay<00:06:21.930> so

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
look at it closely see thank you okay so

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.440 
look at it closely see thank you okay so
there's<00:06:23.260> only<00:06:23.410> one<00:06:23.530> port<00:06:24.040> and<00:06:24.370> at<00:06:25.000> the<00:06:25.120> bottom

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
there's only one port and at the bottom

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.620 
there's only one port and at the bottom
right<00:06:25.600> here<00:06:25.780> is<00:06:26.740> the<00:06:27.610> on<00:06:27.790> and<00:06:27.820> off<00:06:28.060> switch<00:06:28.270> and

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
right here is the on and off switch and

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.080 
right here is the on and off switch and
here's<00:06:28.960> the<00:06:29.430> port<00:06:30.430> three-and-a-half

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
here's the port three-and-a-half

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.450 
here's the port three-and-a-half
millimeter<00:06:31.510> so<00:06:32.410> I<00:06:32.440> guess<00:06:32.680> this<00:06:32.920> is<00:06:33.130> where<00:06:33.310> you

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
millimeter so I guess this is where you

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.350 
millimeter so I guess this is where you
will<00:06:33.610> connect<00:06:34.060> it<00:06:34.240> to<00:06:34.420> look<00:06:35.760> that's<00:06:36.760> that's

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
will connect it to look that's that's

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.850 
will connect it to look that's that's
pretty<00:06:37.630> cool<00:06:37.900> ever<00:06:38.200> seen<00:06:38.410> something<00:06:38.740> like

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
pretty cool ever seen something like

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.480 
pretty cool ever seen something like
that<00:06:40.260> and<00:06:41.260> here's<00:06:41.560> where<00:06:41.770> you'll<00:06:41.890> connect<00:06:42.250> to

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
that and here's where you'll connect to

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.950 
that and here's where you'll connect to
your<00:06:42.580> device<00:06:45.000> then<00:06:46.000> this<00:06:46.240> side<00:06:46.450> will<00:06:46.660> be<00:06:46.810> for
