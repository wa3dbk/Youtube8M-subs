going from Mac I'd say to go with a
Paint<00:00:34.290> Pot<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.850> my<00:00:35.850> first<00:00:36.149> one<00:00:36.450> was

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
Paint Pot and my first one was

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.209 
Paint Pot and my first one was
rubenesque<00:00:38.899> which<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.290> pale<00:00:40.530> pink<00:00:40.649> e-gold

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
rubenesque which is a pale pink e-gold

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.280 
rubenesque which is a pale pink e-gold
and<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.000> works<00:00:42.149> really<00:00:42.270> well<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.750> very<00:00:42.930> pale

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and it works really well it's very pale

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.220 
and it works really well it's very pale
um<00:00:43.850> it<00:00:44.850> works<00:00:45.030> under<00:00:45.329> pretty<00:00:45.690> much<00:00:45.870> every

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
um it works under pretty much every

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.470 
um it works under pretty much every
color<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:47.550> only<00:00:47.850> thing<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.210> would<00:00:48.329> probably

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
color the only thing I would probably

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.540

pro pans i think they're they're 11 now
11-50<00:03:22.920> they<00:03:23.100> were<00:03:23.160> 1050<00:03:23.760> before<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:25.019> still

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
11-50 they were 1050 before that's still

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.099 
11-50 they were 1050 before that's still
like<00:03:25.790> $42<00:03:26.790> just<00:03:27.120> for<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.420> colors<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.959> then<00:03:28.049> I

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
like $42 just for the colors and then I

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.979 
like $42 just for the colors and then I
think<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:29.430> quad<00:03:29.730> pallets<00:03:30.239> are<00:03:30.420> four<00:03:30.660> or<00:03:30.810> five

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
think the quad pallets are four or five

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.220 
think the quad pallets are four or five
dollars<00:03:31.440> each<00:03:31.799> so<00:03:31.829> you're<00:03:32.750> still<00:03:33.750> saving<00:03:33.930> like

ten<00:03:34.470> dollars<00:03:34.890> there<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.340> then<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:35.910> think<00:03:36.180> I

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
ten dollars there and then I think I

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.150 
ten dollars there and then I think I
