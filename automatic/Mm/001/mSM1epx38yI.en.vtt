how<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.170> make<00:00:04.920> your<00:00:05.069> Fallout<00:00:05.609> New<00:00:05.670> Vegas<00:00:05.819> run

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
how to make your Fallout New Vegas run

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.789 
how to make your Fallout New Vegas run
faster<00:00:06.750> so<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.020> can<00:00:07.170> run<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.440> at<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.620> higher

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
faster so you can run it at a higher

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.629 
faster so you can run it at a higher
setting<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:09.590> reduce<00:00:10.590> lag<00:00:10.889> if<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.219> need<00:00:11.429> to

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
setting and reduce lag if you need to

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.419 
setting and reduce lag if you need to
now<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.570> recommend<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.440> have<00:00:13.590> more<00:00:14.190> than

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
now I recommend that you have more than

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.460 
now I recommend that you have more than
4<00:00:14.730> gigabytes<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.330> RAM<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.599> do<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:15.990> because

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
4 gigabytes of RAM to do this because

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.029 
4 gigabytes of RAM to do this because
this<00:00:17.330> causes<00:00:18.330> Fallout<00:00:19.020> New<00:00:19.050> Vegas<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.619> run<00:00:19.830> at

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
this causes Fallout New Vegas to run at

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.599 
this causes Fallout New Vegas to run at
a<00:00:20.359> 4<00:00:21.359> gigabyte<00:00:21.510> level<00:00:22.160> when<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.310> default

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
a 4 gigabyte level when the default

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.939 
a 4 gigabyte level when the default
level<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.029> 2<00:00:24.240> gigabytes<00:00:24.720> which<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.260> my

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
level is 2 gigabytes which is in my

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.769 
level is 2 gigabytes which is in my
opinion<00:00:25.980> not<00:00:26.519> even<00:00:26.760> enough<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.090> run<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.570> game

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
opinion not even enough to run that game

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.259 
opinion not even enough to run that game
there's<00:00:28.710> also<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.039> Skyrim<00:00:29.580> version<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.150> this
