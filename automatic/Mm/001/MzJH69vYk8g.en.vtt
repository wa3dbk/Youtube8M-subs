of<00:00:25.260> an<00:00:25.380> explanation<00:00:25.769> as<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.400> why<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.090> my

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
of an explanation as to why in my

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.589 
of an explanation as to why in my
opinion<00:00:27.330> again<00:00:28.369> these<00:00:29.369> are<00:00:29.429> superior<00:00:30.179> to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
opinion again these are superior to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.170 
opinion again these are superior to
other<00:00:31.080> back<00:00:31.590> exercises<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.850> without<00:00:33.059> further

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
other back exercises so without further

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.479 
other back exercises so without further
ado<00:00:33.890> check<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.690> alright<00:00:36.690> guys<00:00:37.070> first<00:00:38.070> up

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
ado check it out alright guys first up

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.880 
ado check it out alright guys first up
and<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.180> probably<00:00:39.540> already<00:00:40.079> guessed<00:00:40.590> this

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and you probably already guessed this

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.040 
and you probably already guessed this
but<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.390> deadlift<00:00:42.960> now<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:44.160> lot<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.640> people

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
but the deadlift now a lot of people

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.160 
but the deadlift now a lot of people
think<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.559> deadlift<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.809> lower<00:00:48.809> body

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
think that the deadlift is a lower body

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
think that the deadlift is a lower body
movement<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:50.100> actually<00:00:50.309> put<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.910> in

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
movement and they actually put it in

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.209 
movement and they actually put it in
their<00:00:51.210> lower<00:00:51.480> body<00:00:51.629> days<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:53.039> is

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
their lower body days which is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.900 
their lower body days which is
completely<00:00:53.820> fine<00:00:54.329> however<00:00:55.550> this<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.850> a

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
completely fine however this is a

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.580 
completely fine however this is a
powerful<00:00:57.510> movement<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.770> overall<00:00:59.399> back<00:00:59.910> mass

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
powerful movement for overall back mass

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.219 
powerful movement for overall back mass
because<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.890> your<00:01:02.160> ability<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.480> load<00:01:03.719> now

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
because of your ability to load now

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.710 
because of your ability to load now
although<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.710> don't<00:01:04.920> perform<00:01:05.189> any<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
although you don't perform any of the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.130 
although you don't perform any of the
backs<00:01:06.990> major<00:01:07.560> functions<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:09.119> any<00:01:09.299> significant

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
backs major functions to any significant

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.580 
backs major functions to any significant
degree<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.860> movement<00:01:12.020> because<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
degree with this movement because the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.060 
degree with this movement because the
load<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.400> heavy<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.470> isometric<00:01:16.470> tension

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
load is so heavy the isometric tension

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.870 
load is so heavy the isometric tension
is<00:01:17.280> actually<00:01:18.030> significant<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.729> you've

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
is actually significant so if you've

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.690 
is actually significant so if you've
ever<00:01:21.150> dead<00:01:21.540> lifted<00:01:22.020> three<00:01:22.710> four<00:01:23.189> or<00:01:23.460> five

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
ever dead lifted three four or five

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.840 
ever dead lifted three four or five
hundred<00:01:24.119> pounds<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.830> then<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.280> woke<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
hundred pounds and then you woke up the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.840 
hundred pounds and then you woke up the
next<00:01:27.000> morning<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.650> that<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.100> back<00:01:29.430> was

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
next morning you know that the back was

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.080 
next morning you know that the back was
actually<00:01:30.540> trained<00:01:30.960> pretty<00:01:31.470> heavily<00:01:32.090> during

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
actually trained pretty heavily during

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.649 
actually trained pretty heavily during
the<00:01:33.750> deadlift<00:01:34.350> now<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.400> first<00:01:35.790> while<00:01:36.540> you're

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the deadlift now at first while you're

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.870 
the deadlift now at first while you're
going<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.170> may<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:37.890> seem<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> way<00:01:38.640> but

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
going like may not seem that way but

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.730 
going like may not seem that way but
once<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.390> start<00:01:39.689> getting<00:01:39.750> stronger<00:01:40.409> at<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
once you start getting stronger at the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.310 
once you start getting stronger at the
deadlift<00:01:41.310> you're<00:01:41.490> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.909> realize<00:01:42.320> how

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
deadlift you're going to realize how

robe<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.430> like<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:28.420> because<00:02:28.709> you're<00:02:29.709> pulling

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
robe I like this because you're pulling

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.390 
robe I like this because you're pulling
the<00:02:30.430> bar<00:02:30.700> from<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.269> completely<00:02:31.959> dead<00:02:32.380> stop<00:02:32.800> so

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
the bar from a completely dead stop so

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.940 
the bar from a completely dead stop so
you're<00:02:33.550> completely<00:02:34.380> eliminating<00:02:35.380> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
you're completely eliminating the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.759 
you're completely eliminating the
elastic<00:02:36.580> tension<00:02:37.150> or<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.660> stretch<00:02:37.959> reflex<00:02:38.530> so

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
elastic tension or the stretch reflex so

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.070 
elastic tension or the stretch reflex so
although<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.459> may<00:02:39.760> not<00:02:39.940> be<00:02:40.180> able<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.570> pull<00:02:40.840> as

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
although you may not be able to pull as

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.640 
although you may not be able to pull as
much<00:02:41.590> as<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.370> would<00:02:42.580> with<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:43.030> regular<00:02:43.650> bent

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
much as you would with a regular bent

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.870 
much as you would with a regular bent
row<00:02:46.019> it's<00:02:47.019> going<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.500> be<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:48.040> little<00:02:48.370> bit<00:02:48.610> more

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
row it's going to be a little bit more

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.420 
row it's going to be a little bit more
effective<00:02:49.540> in<00:02:49.750> terms<00:02:50.019> of<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:51.040> know<00:02:51.100> not

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
effective in terms of you know not

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.540

having again that elastic tension or

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.059 
having again that elastic tension or
that<00:02:54.730> momentum<00:02:55.330> it's<00:02:55.540> causing<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.530> you

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
that momentum it's causing you to you

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.580 
that momentum it's causing you to you
know<00:02:57.100> keep<00:02:57.430> strict<00:02:57.910> form<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.510> really<00:02:59.320> just
