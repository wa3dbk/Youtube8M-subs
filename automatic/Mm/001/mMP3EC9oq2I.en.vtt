Bunny holding an easter egg so first up
what<00:00:15.920> we<00:00:16.070> do<00:00:16.219> is<00:00:16.550> we<00:00:16.909> draw<00:00:17.210> a<00:00:17.710> circle<00:00:22.569> just<00:00:23.569> like

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
what we do is we draw a circle just like

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.489 
what we do is we draw a circle just like
that<00:00:23.869> that's<00:00:24.710> for<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.400> bunny's<00:00:25.730> head

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:26.499 
that that's for the bunny's head

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:37.910 
that that's for the bunny's head
next<00:00:27.499> up<00:00:27.619> which<00:00:27.769> war<00:00:28.039> I<00:00:28.369> never<00:00:29.269> rounded<00:00:31.029> oval

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.940 

do<00:00:38.880> we<00:00:38.970> want<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.149> position<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.720> eggs<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.320> draw

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
do we want to position the eggs we draw

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.799 
do we want to position the eggs we draw
a<00:00:42.920> little<00:00:43.920> circle<00:00:44.220> via<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.300> then<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:45.600> draw<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
a little circle via and then we draw a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.790 
a little circle via and then we draw a
bigger<00:00:46.050> circle<00:00:47.090> just<00:00:48.090> overlapping<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
bigger circle just overlapping that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.520 
bigger circle just overlapping that
little<00:00:50.100> circle<00:00:50.449> we<00:00:51.449> join<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> two<00:00:52.050> circles

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
little circle we join the two circles

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.619 
little circle we join the two circles
together<00:00:53.809> with<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.839> rounded<00:00:55.290> line<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:57.480> that

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
together with a rounded line and that

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.930 
together with a rounded line and that
forms<00:00:57.989> our<00:00:58.170> egg<00:00:58.410> shape

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.140 

next<00:01:04.720> we<00:01:04.809> want<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:04.989> have<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.520> bunnies<00:01:06.520> arms

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
next we want to have the bunnies arms

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
next we want to have the bunnies arms
coming<00:01:07.780> in<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.140> hold<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.740> eggs<00:01:09.070> so<00:01:09.430> which<00:01:10.210> were

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
coming in to hold the eggs so which were

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.290 
coming in to hold the eggs so which were
kind<00:01:12.040> of<00:01:12.100> like<00:01:12.250> sideways<00:01:12.970> teardrops

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
kind of like sideways teardrops

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.890 
kind of like sideways teardrops
and<00:01:16.300> therefore<00:01:16.840> one<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:18.130> yards<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.690> then

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
and therefore one of the yards and then

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.010 
and therefore one of the yards and then
another<00:01:20.230> one<00:01:20.590> coming<00:01:21.130> in<00:01:21.190> from<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.490> side<00:01:21.700> here

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
another one coming in from the side here

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.240 
another one coming in from the side here
again<00:01:23.020> almost<00:01:23.800> like<00:01:24.160> a<00:01:24.190> sideways<00:01:26.250> teardrop

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
again almost like a sideways teardrop

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.580 
again almost like a sideways teardrop
shape<00:01:27.690> for<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.780> other<00:01:28.990> arm<00:01:31.200> at<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.350> little

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
shape for the other arm at the little

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.420 
shape for the other arm at the little
leagues<00:01:33.010> so<00:01:33.220> we<00:01:33.310> have<00:01:33.460> one<00:01:33.640> big<00:01:34.080> coming<00:01:35.080> out

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
leagues so we have one big coming out

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.170 
leagues so we have one big coming out
like<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:37.030> then<00:01:37.090> another<00:01:37.240> leg<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:40.030> like

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
like that and then another leg just like

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.310 
like that and then another leg just like
that<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.890> we<00:01:41.979> want<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.310> round<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.960> take<00:01:44.170> the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
that and we want to round just take the

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.030 
that and we want to round just take the
line<00:01:44.500> up<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:46.050> into<00:01:47.050> a<00:01:47.080> rounded<00:01:47.560> shape<00:01:47.619> just

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
line up and into a rounded shape just

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.490 
line up and into a rounded shape just
for<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.400> little<00:01:49.830> feet<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:52.200> again<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.350> the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
for the little feet and again on the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:02.599 
for the little feet and again on the
side<00:01:54.930> step<00:01:55.930> to<00:01:57.000> match<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.590> other<00:01:59.740> league

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.980 

and<00:02:03.609> we'll<00:02:03.759> give<00:02:03.909> them<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.119> little<00:02:04.299> tail<00:02:04.659> just

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
and we'll give them a little tail just

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.450 
and we'll give them a little tail just
poking<00:02:05.229> out<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.679> side<00:02:05.920> there<00:02:06.189> so<00:02:06.369> we<00:02:06.429> just

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
poking out the side there so we just

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.550 
poking out the side there so we just
draw<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:07.979> half<00:02:08.979> circle<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.729> add<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.360> few<00:02:10.840> wavy

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.690 

butts<00:02:14.560> in<00:02:14.800> there<00:02:15.010> just<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.370> add<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.519> bit<00:02:15.580> of

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
butts in there just to add a bit of

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.170 
butts in there just to add a bit of
fluff<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.510> tail<00:02:17.640> I'll<00:02:18.640> go<00:02:18.760> back<00:02:18.879> to<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
fluff to the tail I'll go back to the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.949 
fluff to the tail I'll go back to the
head<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:20.200> now<00:02:20.230> we<00:02:20.379> draw<00:02:22.230> some<00:02:23.310> elongated<00:02:24.959> oval

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
head so now we draw some elongated oval

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.330 
head so now we draw some elongated oval
oval<00:02:26.860> shapes<00:02:27.190> just<00:02:28.410> coming<00:02:29.410> out<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.650> side<00:02:29.950> the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
oval shapes just coming out the side the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.780 
oval shapes just coming out the side the
end<00:02:33.989> put<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.290> little<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.010> bet<00:02:36.220> by

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
end put a little in it you bet by

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.809 
end put a little in it you bet by
drawing<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.150> smaller<00:02:38.069> oval<00:02:39.069> in<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.280> center

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.400 

then<00:02:42.819> what<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.000> do<00:02:43.120> is<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:43.599> just<00:02:43.630> go<00:02:43.959> through<00:02:43.989> and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
then what I do is I just go through and

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.539 
then what I do is I just go through and
put<00:02:44.590> another<00:02:44.709> oval<00:02:45.329> shape<00:02:46.329> in<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:47.549> circle

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
put another oval shape in the circle

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.920 
put another oval shape in the circle
just<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.790> figure<00:02:49.120> out<00:02:49.239> where<00:02:49.540> I'm<00:02:49.750> going<00:02:49.840> to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
just to figure out where I'm going to

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.550 
just to figure out where I'm going to
place<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.750> eyes<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.379> mouth<00:02:54.190> fix<00:02:54.519> your<00:02:54.700> tray

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
place the eyes and mouth fix your tray

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.780 
place the eyes and mouth fix your tray
so<00:02:56.560> do<00:02:56.769> that<00:02:56.829> so<00:02:57.370> then<00:02:57.549> just<00:02:58.299> work<00:02:58.599> out<00:02:58.840> I<00:02:59.790> want

the eyes yes I just draw two ovals with
the<00:03:04.780> little<00:03:05.489> circle<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:07.859> for<00:03:08.859> the<00:03:08.950> reflection

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
the little circle in for the reflection

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.050 
the little circle in for the reflection
and<00:03:10.329> just<00:03:10.569> cover<00:03:10.750> color<00:03:11.350> in<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.760> rest<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.910> the

and just cover color in the rest of the

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.009 
and just cover color in the rest of the
oval<00:03:14.040> which<00:03:15.040> will<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.340> little<00:03:15.579> nose<00:03:16.019> which

back to the ear because well we'll add

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.120 
back to the ear because well we'll add
some<00:03:43.209> texture<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:43.930> some<00:03:44.079> pet<00:03:44.290> name<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.829> so

some texture and some pet name to it so
just<00:03:45.340> draw<00:03:46.030> some<00:03:46.239> lines<00:03:46.480> across<00:03:48.419> some<00:03:49.419> rounded

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
just draw some lines across some rounded

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.909 
just draw some lines across some rounded
lines<00:03:49.989> across<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:51.310> edge<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:53.380> then<00:03:53.560> for<00:03:53.829> the

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
lines across the edge and then for the

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.580 
lines across the edge and then for the
top<00:03:54.130> bit<00:03:54.400> I'll<00:03:54.609> add<00:03:54.790> some<00:03:55.349> polka<00:03:56.349> dots

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
top bit I'll add some polka dots

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.870 
top bit I'll add some polka dots
in<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.950> seeking<00:03:59.280> bit<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.640> add<00:03:59.849> some

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
in the seeking bit and add some

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.960 
in the seeking bit and add some
triangles<00:04:00.630> by<00:04:01.500> doing<00:04:01.770> up-and-down<00:04:02.220> diagonal

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
triangles by doing up-and-down diagonal

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.500 
triangles by doing up-and-down diagonal
lines<00:04:03.709> then<00:04:04.709> again<00:04:04.950> some<00:04:05.220> spots<00:04:05.580> some<00:04:06.300> polka

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
lines then again some spots some polka

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.559 
lines then again some spots some polka
dots<00:04:06.750> here<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.910> then<00:04:09.330> we'll<00:04:09.420> add<00:04:09.540> some

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
dots here and then we'll add some

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:20.000 
dots here and then we'll add some
stripes<00:04:12.080> to<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.110> bottom<00:04:18.500> next<00:04:19.500> up<00:04:19.620> what<00:04:19.739> we<00:04:19.859> do

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
stripes to the bottom next up what we do

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.770 
stripes to the bottom next up what we do
is<00:04:20.130> just<00:04:20.310> grab<00:04:20.519> our<00:04:20.730> black<00:04:20.970> pian<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.419> just<00:04:21.570> and

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
is just grab our black pian and just and

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.550 
is just grab our black pian and just and
chem<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.079> pencil<00:04:22.440> lines<00:04:22.620> that<00:04:22.860> we've<00:04:22.980> done<00:04:24.560> do

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
chem the pencil lines that we've done do

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:57.530 
chem the pencil lines that we've done do
that<00:04:25.740> by<00:04:25.889> doing<00:04:26.100> this

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.390 

so<00:04:58.110> they<00:04:58.230> want<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.440> do<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.740> just<00:04:58.890> go<00:04:59.070> back<00:04:59.250> in

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
so they want to do is just go back in

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.940 
so they want to do is just go back in
and<00:04:59.550> thicken<00:04:59.760> up<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.060> line<00:05:00.540> of<00:05:00.960> main<00:05:01.380> parts<00:05:01.830> of

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
and thicken up the line of main parts of

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.590 
and thicken up the line of main parts of
the<00:05:02.130> illustration<00:05:02.880> just<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.210> make<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:03.480> look

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
the illustration just to make it look

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:34.850 
the illustration just to make it look
even<00:05:03.780> more<00:05:03.930> cartoony

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.230 

so<00:05:35.860> we<00:05:35.920> just<00:05:36.040> wait<00:05:36.160> for<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.400> ink<00:05:36.550> to<00:05:36.580> dry<00:05:39.240> then

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
so we just wait for the ink to dry then

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.790 
so we just wait for the ink to dry then
we<00:05:40.300> just<00:05:40.450> grab<00:05:40.630> our<00:05:40.900> razor<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:41.380> go<00:05:41.500> through

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
we just grab our razor and go through

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:58.629 
we just grab our razor and go through
and<00:05:41.920> rub<00:05:42.040> out<00:05:42.190> all<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.490> pencil<00:05:42.850> lines

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.099 

so<00:05:59.639> there<00:05:59.819> you<00:05:59.849> have<00:05:59.939> it<00:06:00.119> a<00:06:00.389> cartoon<00:06:00.599> Easter
