00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
Love of course and I suppose myself but

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.580 
Love of course and I suppose myself but
I<00:01:14.400> could<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.780> think<00:01:15.869> partly<00:01:16.439> because

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
I could but it's I think partly because

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.660 
I could but it's I think partly because
it<00:01:16.979> takes<00:01:17.400> an<00:01:17.580> enormous<00:01:17.909> amount<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.479> energy

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
it takes an enormous amount of energy

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.950 
it takes an enormous amount of energy
because<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.970> mean<00:01:21.150> especially<00:01:21.540> when<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> band

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
because I mean especially when the band

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.020 
because I mean especially when the band
the<00:01:22.140> full-on<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:23.189> they<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> bit<00:01:23.610> exciting

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the full-on and they get a bit exciting

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.640 
the full-on and they get a bit exciting
the<00:01:24.119> backline<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.780> know<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:27.960> mean<00:01:28.409> so

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the backline you know you can I mean so

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.929 
the backline you know you can I mean so
it's<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.950> matter<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> learning<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.729> pace

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
it's a matter of learning to pace

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.649 
it's a matter of learning to pace
yourself<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.320> learning<00:01:31.860> when<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:33.360> quiet

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
yourself and learning when to be quiet

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.679 
yourself and learning when to be quiet
so<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.170> you're<00:01:34.409> resting<00:01:34.740> your<00:01:34.890> voice<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.689> it
