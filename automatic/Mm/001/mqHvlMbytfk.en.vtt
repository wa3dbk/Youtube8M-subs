00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:29.550
 and 1 2 3 and 4 5 and 6 and 1 2 3 and 4 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:34.980
 5 and 6 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 1 2 3 and 4 5 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:39.539

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.460
 the gentleman very simply the gentleman has 1 2 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:45.510
 3 and 4 5 and 6 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.410
 that's just the one 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.350
 Basic step for the lady the whole 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.199
 starts the similar we have 1 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.909
 2 3 and 4 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.449
 until then it is also like a reason 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:04.050
 but the four turns on those four 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.650
 lady now makes 180 degrees to the left 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.649
 the 5 and 6 on the side so we 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:17.970
 side by side end up again for the 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:22.770
 lady we have 1 2 3 and 4 180 degrees 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.409
 turn left five and six, then 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.640
 no more difficult one 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.960
 can do it all with a small one 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.329
 dance variations 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.799
 by ending before for the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:38.399
 shake men's shows as follows 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:41.090
 out we have 1 2 3 and 4 and turn 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:46.740
 now easily degrees to about 90 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:51.149
 then turn five and six to the side and 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.920
 for the lady the steps we have one 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.710
 two three and four and can now here 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.570
 instead of 180 degrees again a 90 degrees 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.350
 Turn also left 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.810
 the 5 and 6 on the side that would be the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:13.100
 variation that one in front of each other with the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:21.110
 figure ends and one two three and four 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:25.070
 6 and 1 2 3 and 4 5 and 6 the figure before 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.390
 wales, we show the following order 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.250
 You see what I do in my hand 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.970
 we have the basic step ahead 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.010
 have step back here place change 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.340
 At the moment I want the ladies that 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.320
 follow the way cause I press in 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.270
 my right hand the lady on mine 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.120
 left side that is I give here 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.370
 a push with and move with it 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.770
 on my left side is so relative 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.220
 easy to run together again 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.880
 hang 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.430

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.450
 press the lady on my side 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.450
 the change leads to the side
