00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
mist and stuff and you probably don't

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.260 
mist and stuff and you probably don't
manage<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.799> see<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> pitch<00:01:35.189> really<00:01:35.369> until<00:01:35.790> so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
manage to see the pitch really until so

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.399 
manage to see the pitch really until so
you<00:01:36.360> sort<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.540> drag<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.869> out<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.259> bit

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you sort of drag that out a little bit

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.319 
you sort of drag that out a little bit
so<00:01:37.979> where<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.579> see<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> pitch<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.180> maybe

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
so where you see the pitch and so maybe

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.249 
so where you see the pitch and so maybe
a<00:01:39.420> few<00:01:39.479> yards<00:01:39.930> back<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:41.000> mean<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.259> it's

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
a few yards back but I mean it's it's

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.359 
a few yards back but I mean it's it's
better<00:01:43.439> when<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> roof<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.890> shut<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.280> me

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
better when the roof is shut for me

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.770 
better when the roof is shut for me
personally<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:45.030> prefer<00:01:45.060> when<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> roof<00:01:45.659> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
personally I prefer when the roof is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.649 
personally I prefer when the roof is
shut<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:47.610> know<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:48.030> very<00:01:48.090> strange<00:01:48.509> when
