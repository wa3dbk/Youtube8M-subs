another<00:00:01.280> useful<00:00:01.550> tool<00:00:01.970> that<00:00:02.360> is<00:00:02.540> used<00:00:02.840> for

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:03.350 
another useful tool that is used for

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.549 
another useful tool that is used for
frost<00:00:03.649> protection<00:00:03.800> is<00:00:04.640> the<00:00:05.600> wind<00:00:05.809> machine<00:00:06.229> and

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:06.559 
frost protection is the wind machine and

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:08.379 
frost protection is the wind machine and
there<00:00:06.680> are<00:00:06.769> various<00:00:07.160> styles<00:00:07.430> of<00:00:07.789> wind<00:00:07.999> machine

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
there are various styles of wind machine

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.549 
there are various styles of wind machine
from<00:00:09.219> engines<00:00:10.219> on<00:00:10.400> top<00:00:10.730> or<00:00:11.000> yo<00:00:11.150> T's<00:00:11.599> to<00:00:12.200> ground

from engines on top or yo T's to ground
power<00:00:12.889> units<00:00:13.459> most<00:00:14.299> of<00:00:14.480> them<00:00:14.690> are<00:00:14.780> now<00:00:14.990> being

power units most of them are now being

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.460 
power units most of them are now being
powered<00:00:17.090> by<00:00:17.240> propane<00:00:17.510> and<00:00:19.780> gasoline<00:00:20.780> units

powered by propane and gasoline units

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.660 
powered by propane and gasoline units
are<00:00:21.650> becoming<00:00:22.040> a<00:00:22.190> little<00:00:22.370> bit<00:00:22.460> obsolete

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
are becoming a little bit obsolete

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.030 
are becoming a little bit obsolete
because<00:00:23.360> they<00:00:23.510> can<00:00:23.720> be<00:00:23.810> converted<00:00:24.200> to<00:00:24.410> propane

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
because they can be converted to propane

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.510 
because they can be converted to propane
to<00:00:25.280> burn<00:00:25.460> much<00:00:26.030> cleaner<00:00:26.420> and<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:28.070> propane

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
to burn much cleaner and the propane

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.750 
to burn much cleaner and the propane
does<00:00:28.760> not<00:00:28.940> go<00:00:29.180> bad<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:29.840> generally<00:00:30.610> propane<00:00:31.610> is

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
does not go bad and generally propane is

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.210 
does not go bad and generally propane is
not<00:00:31.910> being<00:00:32.119> stolen<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:33.140> put<00:00:33.440> into<00:00:33.680> vehicles

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
not being stolen and put into vehicles

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.060 
not being stolen and put into vehicles
that's<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.730> main<00:00:34.970> concern<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:36.410> when<00:00:36.890> the

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
that's the main concern and when the

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.850 
that's the main concern and when the
it's<00:00:37.670> very<00:00:37.910> cold<00:00:38.240> out<00:00:38.480> again<00:00:38.870> at<00:00:38.990> 34<00:00:39.470> or<00:00:39.590> 35

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.790 
it's very cold out again at 34 or 35
degrees<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:41.750> motors<00:00:42.170> will<00:00:42.290> start<00:00:42.590> much

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
degrees the motors will start much

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.040 
degrees the motors will start much
easier<00:00:43.310> on<00:00:43.579> a<00:00:43.610> propane<00:00:44.240> system<00:00:44.600> than<00:00:44.930> they
