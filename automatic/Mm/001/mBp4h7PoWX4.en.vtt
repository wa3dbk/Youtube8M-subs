00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
in this case it's you know flexible and

stuff and it has this little Ridge on
the<00:03:36.720> end<00:03:36.980> that<00:03:37.980> if<00:03:38.129> we<00:03:38.280> take<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.579> just<00:03:38.760> right

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
the end that if we take it just right

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.770 
the end that if we take it just right
see<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.230> two<00:03:40.379> little<00:03:40.590> flaps<00:03:41.280> there<00:03:41.609> we<00:03:42.569> can<00:03:42.690> do

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
see the two little flaps there we can do

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.569 
see the two little flaps there we can do
this<00:03:42.930> yeah<00:03:43.169> there<00:03:43.560> we<00:03:43.650> go<00:03:43.680> just<00:03:43.829> pops<00:03:44.159> right<00:03:44.280> in

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
this yeah there we go just pops right in

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.699 
this yeah there we go just pops right in
closes<00:03:45.540> right<00:03:45.690> over<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.079> and<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.530> got

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
closes right over it and you got

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.890 
closes right over it and you got
yourself<00:03:46.949> a<00:03:47.280> cover<00:03:47.489> now<00:03:48.269> again<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.750> cool

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
yourself a cover now again the cool

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.899 
yourself a cover now again the cool
thing<00:03:49.079> about<00:03:49.109> that<00:03:49.379> is<00:03:49.440> just<00:03:49.889> like<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.459> ipad

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
thing about that is just like the ipad

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.640 
thing about that is just like the ipad
covers<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.449> past<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:52.109> can<00:03:52.260> flip<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.500> over

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
covers of the past you can flip it over

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.180 
covers of the past you can flip it over
but<00:03:53.549> this<00:03:54.209> end<00:03:54.479> is<00:03:54.690> magnetic<00:03:55.229> so<00:03:55.859> it'll<00:03:56.010> stick

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
but this end is magnetic so it'll stick

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.399 
but this end is magnetic so it'll stick
to<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.400> back<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:56.819> hold<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.090> in<00:03:57.180> place<00:03:57.409> pretty

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
to the back and hold it in place pretty

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.689 
to the back and hold it in place pretty
securely<00:03:58.829> I<00:03:58.949> mean<00:03:59.069> it's<00:03:59.190> not<00:03:59.280> extraordinarily

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
securely I mean it's not extraordinarily

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.640 
securely I mean it's not extraordinarily
secure<00:04:00.329> but<00:04:00.540> like<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.930> can<00:04:01.049> flop<00:04:01.260> off<00:04:01.440> like

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
secure but like you can flop off like

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.729 
secure but like you can flop off like
that<00:04:01.799> but<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.879> is<00:04:03.000> definitely<00:04:03.209> usable<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:04.049> set

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
that but it is definitely usable I set

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.649 
that but it is definitely usable I set
it<00:04:04.829> down<00:04:04.919> on<00:04:04.979> the<00:04:05.159> desk<00:04:05.310> like<00:04:05.549> that<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:05.970> it's

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
it down on the desk like that and it's

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.569 
it down on the desk like that and it's
it's<00:04:06.989> all<00:04:07.229> out<00:04:07.379> you<00:04:07.560> know<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.919> was<00:04:08.250> able<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.489> put

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
it's all out you know I was able to put

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:09.770 
it's all out you know I was able to put
quite<00:04:08.729> a<00:04:08.790> bit<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.000> pressure<00:04:09.150> on<00:04:09.359> that<00:04:09.449> before

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
quite a bit of pressure on that before

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.199 
quite a bit of pressure on that before
it<00:04:09.900> actually<00:04:09.989> fell<00:04:10.349> over<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.970> doing<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.060> on

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
it actually fell over and doing this on

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.339 
it actually fell over and doing this on
camera<00:04:12.449> you<00:04:12.659> know<00:04:12.750> getting<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.139> a<00:04:13.199> hundred

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
camera you know getting it a hundred

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.649 
camera you know getting it a hundred
percent<00:04:13.530> secure<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.250> not<00:04:14.909> as<00:04:15.060> easy<00:04:15.209> as<00:04:15.329> it<00:04:15.449> does

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
percent secure is not as easy as it does

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.420 
percent secure is not as easy as it does
look<00:04:15.900> but<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.470> can<00:04:16.590> put<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.799> in<00:04:16.919> this<00:04:17.039> position

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
look but you can put it in this position

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.460 
look but you can put it in this position
and<00:04:17.639> it<00:04:17.729> is<00:04:17.820> usable<00:04:18.060> like<00:04:18.449> that<00:04:18.659> you<00:04:19.229> can<00:04:19.380> even

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
and it is usable like that you can even

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.379 
and it is usable like that you can even
lay<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.709> down<00:04:19.829> like<00:04:20.010> this<00:04:20.219> and<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.760> is<00:04:20.909> still

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
lay it down like this and it is still

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.730 
lay it down like this and it is still
pretty<00:04:21.599> usable<00:04:21.870> like<00:04:22.169> this<00:04:22.380> i<00:04:22.529> mean<00:04:22.560> i'm

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
pretty usable like this i mean i'm

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.230 
pretty usable like this i mean i'm
putting<00:04:22.979> even<00:04:23.099> more<00:04:23.219> force<00:04:23.639> on<00:04:23.789> it<00:04:23.909> this<00:04:24.029> way

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
putting even more force on it this way

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.730 
putting even more force on it this way
and<00:04:24.450> it

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
and it

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.790 
and it
falling<00:04:25.280> over<00:04:25.580> so<00:04:26.449> definitely<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:27.319> nice<00:04:27.590> little

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
falling over so definitely a nice little

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.279 
falling over so definitely a nice little
way<00:04:27.979> to<00:04:28.009> to<00:04:28.729> use<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.120> shield<00:04:29.330> especially<00:04:30.199> when

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
way to to use the shield especially when

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.390 
way to to use the shield especially when
you<00:04:30.410> pair<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:30.620> up<00:04:30.740> with<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:31.009> controller

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
you pair it up with the controller

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.189 
you pair it up with the controller
because<00:04:31.699> now<00:04:32.000> you<00:04:32.599> just<00:04:32.750> move<00:04:32.930> this<00:04:33.050> away

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
because now you just move this away

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.230 
because now you just move this away
there<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:33.919> go<00:04:34.099> and<00:04:34.520> we<00:04:34.610> can<00:04:34.639> play<00:04:34.880> on<00:04:35.030> games

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
there you go and we can play on games

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.659 
there you go and we can play on games
all<00:04:35.569> day<00:04:35.630> long<00:04:35.930> from<00:04:36.860> however<00:04:37.220> far<00:04:37.370> away<00:04:37.550> we

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
all day long from however far away we

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.909 
all day long from however far away we
want<00:04:37.849> to<00:04:37.940> be<00:04:38.060> this<00:04:38.960> is<00:04:39.169> I<00:04:39.470> should<00:04:39.560> probably

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
want to be this is I should probably

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.230 
want to be this is I should probably
mention<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.400> controller<00:04:40.729> is<00:04:40.940> not<00:04:41.210> a

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
mention the controller is not a

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.659 
mention the controller is not a
Bluetooth<00:04:41.690> controller<00:04:42.110> it's<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:43.039> Wi-Fi

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
Bluetooth controller it's a Wi-Fi

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.240 
Bluetooth controller it's a Wi-Fi
controller<00:04:44.150> so<00:04:44.990> it's<00:04:45.139> using<00:04:45.410> Wi-Fi<00:04:45.560> direct<00:04:45.979> to

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
controller so it's using Wi-Fi direct to

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
happen to be you just pop these two

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.800 
happen to be you just pop these two
together<00:05:12.620> like<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.880> there<00:05:14.300> you<00:05:14.419> go<00:05:14.449> and

together like that and there you go and

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.089 
together like that and there you go and
actually<00:05:15.199> I<00:05:15.409> kind<00:05:15.650> of<00:05:15.680> like<00:05:15.800> the<00:05:15.889> way<00:05:15.979> that

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
actually I kind of like the way that

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.379 
actually I kind of like the way that
works<00:05:16.430> because<00:05:16.729> you<00:05:16.819> end<00:05:16.970> up<00:05:17.030> with<00:05:17.150> none<00:05:17.360> of

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
works because you end up with none of

too<00:05:43.430> much<00:05:43.580> longer<00:05:43.639> and<00:05:44.210> really<00:05:44.690> I<00:05:45.050> could<00:05:45.500> not

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
too much longer and really I could not

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
have been happier with it so far just

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.510 
have been happier with it so far just
because<00:05:47.449> it<00:05:47.960> is<00:05:48.080> a<00:05:48.110> very<00:05:48.440> solidly<00:05:49.009> built<00:05:49.250> piece

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
because it is a very solidly built piece

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.070 
because it is a very solidly built piece
of<00:05:49.669> hardware<00:05:49.940> I<00:05:50.210> know<00:05:50.389> I'm<00:05:50.659> not<00:05:50.719> supposed<00:05:50.900> to

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
of hardware I know I'm not supposed to

really<00:05:51.199> say<00:05:51.440> anything<00:05:51.469> because<00:05:51.919> I<00:05:52.130> just

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
really say anything because I just

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.230 
really say anything because I just
unboxed<00:05:53.630> it<00:05:53.750> but<00:05:54.469> so<00:05:55.039> far<00:05:55.250> my<00:05:55.639> impressions<00:05:56.090> are

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
unboxed it but so far my impressions are

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.089 
unboxed it but so far my impressions are
very<00:05:56.270> very<00:05:56.780> good<00:05:56.990> and<00:05:57.229> I'm<00:05:57.650> looking<00:05:57.919> forward
