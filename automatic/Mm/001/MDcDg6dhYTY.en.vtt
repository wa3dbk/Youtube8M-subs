and<00:02:01.960> silt<00:02:02.229> are<00:02:02.409> present<00:02:02.860> this<00:02:03.490> can<00:02:03.729> cause<00:02:03.909> the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
and silt are present this can cause the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.030 
and silt are present this can cause the
filter<00:02:04.360> bag<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:04.720> get<00:02:04.930> clogged<00:02:05.229> and<00:02:05.500> trap<00:02:05.830> air

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
filter bag to get clogged and trap air

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.469 
filter bag to get clogged and trap air
to<00:02:06.790> fix<00:02:07.030> this

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
to fix this

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.510 
to fix this
simply<00:02:08.110> remove<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.500> bag<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:09.100> clean<00:02:09.399> it

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
simply remove the bag and clean it

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.430 
simply remove the bag and clean it
thoroughly<00:02:09.670> with<00:02:10.060> mild<00:02:10.360> soap<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.929> remove<00:02:11.260> any

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
buildup another common cause for this is

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.800

now we'll show you how to fix problems

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.310 
now we'll show you how to fix problems
with<00:02:39.489> hose<00:02:39.700> tangling<00:02:40.209> if<00:02:40.720> your<00:02:40.959> hose<00:02:41.140> is

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
with hose tangling if your hose is

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.229 
with hose tangling if your hose is
continually<00:02:41.980> getting<00:02:42.160> tangled<00:02:42.489> first<00:02:43.000> check

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
continually getting tangled first check

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.690 
continually getting tangled first check
the<00:02:43.269> backup<00:02:43.630> valve<00:02:44.019> as<00:02:44.260> we<00:02:44.709> just<00:02:45.010> discussed<00:02:45.430> to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
the backup valve as we just discussed to

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.520 
the backup valve as we just discussed to
make<00:02:46.269> sure<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.630> is<00:02:46.720> turning<00:02:47.080> off<00:02:47.200> between

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
make sure it is turning off between

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.580 
make sure it is turning off between
cycles<00:02:48.100> then<00:02:48.760> slide<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.750> first<00:02:49.959> hose<00:02:50.290> float

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
cycles then slide the first hose float

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.920 
cycles then slide the first hose float
right<00:02:51.040> up<00:02:51.070> behind<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.610> backup<00:02:51.970> valve<00:02:52.180> this

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
right up behind the backup valve this

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.690 
right up behind the backup valve this
will<00:02:53.110> provide<00:02:53.380> better<00:02:53.709> vertical<00:02:54.250> lift<00:02:54.459> and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
will provide better vertical lift and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.340 
will provide better vertical lift and
prevent<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.450> cleaner<00:02:55.660> from<00:02:55.900> dragging

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
prevent the cleaner from dragging

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.070 
prevent the cleaner from dragging
through<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.769> hoses<00:02:57.239> next<00:02:58.239> check<00:02:58.720> your<00:02:58.900> hose

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080
