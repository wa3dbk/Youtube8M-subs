00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.729 
articulation that's one thing that
Mattel<00:00:54.899> has<00:00:55.020> been<00:00:55.110> doing<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.530> good<00:00:55.680> job

at<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.280> their<00:00:56.489> figures<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.649> articulation

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
at with their figures is a articulation

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.709 
at with their figures is a articulation
it's<00:00:59.309> pretty<00:00:59.579> much<00:00:59.699> for<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.180> most<00:01:00.390> part<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it's pretty much for the most part the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.860 
it's pretty much for the most part the
same<00:01:00.870> figure<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> previous<00:01:01.949> Joker<00:01:02.219> figure

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
same figure as the previous Joker figure

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.479 
same figure as the previous Joker figure
here<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.049> next<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.159> only<00:01:05.309> real

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
here it is next to it the only real

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.560 
here it is next to it the only real
difference<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:07.080> surf<00:01:07.290> shorts<00:01:08.090> but<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.360> far

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
difference is the surf shorts but as far

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.910 
difference is the surf shorts but as far
as<00:01:09.600> articulation<00:01:10.110> goes<00:01:10.229> he<00:01:10.439> does<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
as articulation goes he does have the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.179 
as articulation goes he does have the
hinged<00:01:11.310> ankles<00:01:11.820> hinge<00:01:12.720> knee<00:01:12.990> mid<00:01:13.740> thigh<00:01:13.950> cut

appreciate and then you could see how

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.810 
appreciate and then you could see how
well<00:01:18.240> hinge<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.720> legs<00:01:18.750> are<00:01:19.200> mid<00:01:19.830> like<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
well hinge the legs are mid like the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.080 
well hinge the legs are mid like the
waist<00:01:21.030> cut<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:22.140> little<00:01:22.380> mid<00:01:23.280> torso<00:01:23.580> Bend

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
the coat on in fact it's pretty stiff I

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.370 
the coat on in fact it's pretty stiff I
can't<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.630> him<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.840> bed<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.229> can

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
see the bend there a little bit

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.450

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
swiveling wrist and the swiveling head I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.880 
swiveling wrist and the swiveling head I
really<00:01:41.700> do<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.090> how<00:01:42.240> they've<00:01:42.420> handled<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
really do like how they've handled the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.520 
really do like how they've handled the
the<00:01:43.890> coat<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> buttons

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the coat on this one I like the buttons

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.889 
the coat on this one I like the buttons
I<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> way<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.280> drapes<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.939> sculpted

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
I like the way it drapes the sculpted

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.600 
I like the way it drapes the sculpted
pain<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.350> his<00:01:49.500> shirt<00:01:49.740> underneath<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.310> really

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
pain of his shirt underneath is really

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.420 
pain of his shirt underneath is really
well<00:01:50.729> done<00:01:50.909> too<00:01:51.500> but<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> shorts<00:01:52.860> look<00:01:53.040> cool<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
well done too but the shorts look cool I

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.530 
well done too but the shorts look cool I
think<00:01:53.640> they<00:01:53.700> did<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.880> good<00:01:53.970> job<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.180> these<00:01:54.420> as

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
think they did a good job with these as

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.090 
think they did a good job with these as
far<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.020> pattern<00:01:55.350> goes<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> paint

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
far as if the pattern goes in the paint

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.700 
far as if the pattern goes in the paint
I<00:01:56.219> think<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.579> reads<00:01:57.030> well<00:01:57.500> same<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
I think it reads well same with the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.399 
I think it reads well same with the

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
want to show you guys how he fits on the

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.759 
want to show you guys how he fits on the
board<00:02:56.480> because<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:56.930> theory<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.410> know<00:02:57.500> he<00:02:57.650> only

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
board because in theory you know he only

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.509 
board because in theory you know he only
need<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:57.980> take<00:02:58.160> him<00:02:58.280> on<00:02:59.049> with<00:03:00.049> one<00:03:00.440> foot<00:03:01.130> to

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
need to take him on with one foot to

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.000 
need to take him on with one foot to
make<00:03:01.670> him<00:03:01.790> kind<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.030> stabilized<00:03:02.540> but<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.260> think

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
make him kind of stabilized but I think

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.410 
make him kind of stabilized but I think
with<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.250> kind<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.459> articulation<00:03:04.940> he's<00:03:05.209> got

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
with the kind of articulation he's got

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.900 
with the kind of articulation he's got
in<00:03:05.630> his<00:03:05.840> feet<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.410> his<00:03:06.500> thighs<00:03:06.980> he<00:03:07.340> can<00:03:07.610> in

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
in his feet and his thighs he can in

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.870 
in his feet and his thighs he can in
fact<00:03:08.810> step<00:03:09.230> on<00:03:09.410> both<00:03:09.799> pegs<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:10.489> that's<00:03:10.640> kind<00:03:10.849> of

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
fact step on both pegs so that's kind of

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.210 
fact step on both pegs so that's kind of
cool<00:03:14.290> kind<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.349> put<00:03:15.470> his<00:03:15.590> arms<00:03:15.769> out<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.950> little
