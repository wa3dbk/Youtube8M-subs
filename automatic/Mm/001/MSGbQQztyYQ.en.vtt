00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.219
 hyaluronic acid is basically a 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.710
 ingredient of the skin is hyaluronic acid 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.759
 a sugar molecule in the first place that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.220
 can bind water 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.710
 that's great, but it's still good for me 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.869
 nothing at an injection 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.630
 to turn a hyaluronic acid into a finger 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.519
 a networking is necessary this 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.590
 long molecules need to be networked 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.050
 so they afterwards a so-called 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.360
 Capacity means that I can do it 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.950
 insert like a groove filler does that 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.829
 you can also cave in ours 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.230
 Preparations you do not try facial expressions 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.200
 or similar but only 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.809
 folds or bumps to fill up the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.079
 Product hyaluronic acid as a substance 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.940
 Will be in danger of the patients 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.690
 which it actually contains 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.640
 underrated 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.199
 because the marketing suggests 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.180
 hyaluronic acid is a natural one 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.890
 part of the skin and that's why 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.199
 from the film substance which we indizien 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.180
 no danger from that is not so 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.820
 you should pay close attention to it 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.920
 what quality hyaluronic acid has 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.510
 you get infected and you should 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.000
 his treatment also ask for it 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.920
 which hyaluronic acid it is as well 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.650
 Of course, it is so good now 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.659
 as no region of the, face more 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.240
 they can not treat in particular 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.220
 here also sensitive regions in the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.820
 Medium facial area and the lower eyelid 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.090
 region 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.280
 I see in my special consultation 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.930
 for bad cases very often 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.390
 especially in this area problems with 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.340
 hyaluronic acid because the patients believe 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.829
 that it is easy and that it is 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.049
 it does not really matter who chooses what, where 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.159
 that is not the case and before that splashes 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.920
 I can only warn 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.000
 in the hands of an experienced 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.310
 Plastic surgeons are doing well 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.170
 anatomically knows because he is also in 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.329
 this area is operated 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.420
 hyaluronic acid in the region im 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.710
 middle face region great but you have to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.390
 know the anatomy one can 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.210
 Patients really hurt properly and 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.310
 that's on 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.110
 That's why I want to do that 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.700
 my patients just about it 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.520
 inform that the use of 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.950
 hyaluronic acid is not a bagatelle and 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.230
 that the expertise is actually one 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.970
 Doctors require this to be used when 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.470
 someone with the question of a support 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.060
 Of course I have to get that 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.100
 First of all, I would like to think about it 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.860
 fold or fold is the fold 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.390
 mimic conditioned if the fold mimic 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.330
 conditionally I can with hyaluronic acid 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.310
 To achieve little great results there must 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.430
 I actually to botulinum toxin 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.110
 to grab 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.690
 I have the muscle so accordingly 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.130
 relax but if broken somewhere 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.250
 are here in the middle 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.750
 Face area or the famous 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.489
 Puppets folding or gasol areal 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.890
 then I can keep up with it 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.630
 hyaluronic acid work and accordingly 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.660
 fill the fold 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.090
 meanwhile there is for each region of the 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.690
 face or even the house or the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.340
 hands 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.340
 a special hyaluronic acid
