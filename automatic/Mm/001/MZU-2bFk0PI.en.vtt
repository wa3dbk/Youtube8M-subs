00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
it's going to sit exactly where it

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.279 
it's going to sit exactly where it
should<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.160> course<00:00:59.699> much<00:01:00.329> higher<00:01:00.690> end<00:01:01.020> now

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
should but of course much higher end now

with<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> FJ<00:01:38.189> builder<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.329> mentioned

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
with the FJ builder and as I mentioned

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.300 
with the FJ builder and as I mentioned
we<00:01:39.750> pulled<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.140> thing<00:01:40.200> apart<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.829> weren't

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
we pulled this thing apart and weren't

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.679 
we pulled this thing apart and weren't
mucking<00:01:41.729> around<00:01:41.850> when<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.270> stripped<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.630> down

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
mucking around when we stripped it down

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.899 
mucking around when we stripped it down
now<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.770> showed<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> wiring<00:01:44.610> harness

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
now we showed you the wiring harness

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.160 
now we showed you the wiring harness
going<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> vehicle<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.780> how<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> looked

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
going to the vehicle and how it looked

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.090 
going to the vehicle and how it looked
like<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.350> factory<00:01:46.770> harness

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
like a factory harness

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.530 
like a factory harness
that's<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.549> sitting<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:47.939> place<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.479> all

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that's all sitting in place and all

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.630 
that's all sitting in place and all
looks<00:01:48.720> very<00:01:48.990> good<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.860> particular<00:01:50.009> unit

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
looks very good now this particular unit

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
looks very good now this particular unit
is<00:01:50.729> actually<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.090> brains<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> operation

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
is actually the brains of the operation

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.679 
is actually the brains of the operation
now<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.159> where<00:01:53.340> all<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.670> smarts<00:01:54.090> are<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
now this is where all the smarts are and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.510 
now this is where all the smarts are and
you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.899> see<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.470> board<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.070> actually

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
you can see here this board is actually

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.359 
you can see here this board is actually
a<00:01:56.549> Leyden<00:01:57.060> packed<00:01:57.329> with<00:01:57.600> fuse<00:01:57.930> boxes<00:01:58.439> circuit

going<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.959> go<00:02:13.050> into<00:02:13.200> this

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
going to go into this

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.690 
going to go into this
corner<00:02:13.959> here<00:02:13.989> it's<00:02:14.769> going<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.069> look<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.310> it's

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
corner here it's going to look like it's

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.740 
corner here it's going to look like it's
meant<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:15.939> be<00:02:16.030> there<00:02:16.360> it's<00:02:16.480> going<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.659> look

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
meant to be there it's going to look

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.839 
meant to be there it's going to look
part<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.260> factory<00:02:17.620> system<00:02:17.799> and<00:02:18.250> it's

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
part of the factory system and it's

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.339
