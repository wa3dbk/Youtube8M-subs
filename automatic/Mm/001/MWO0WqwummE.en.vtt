overall<00:01:20.040> my<00:01:20.820> first<00:01:21.090> impression<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.020> was

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
overall my first impression of it was

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.530 
overall my first impression of it was
that<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.799> very<00:01:22.979> matte<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.729> noticed<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.270> semi

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that it's very matte I noticed this semi

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.289 
that it's very matte I noticed this semi
max<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.320> seems<00:01:25.530> very<00:01:25.890> much<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.520> me<00:01:26.670> because

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
max but it seems very much to me because

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.460 
max but it seems very much to me because
I've<00:01:27.840> used<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:29.329> Estee<00:01:30.329> Lauder<00:01:30.570> Double<00:01:31.140> Wear

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
I've used the Estee Lauder Double Wear

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.679 
I've used the Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.549> not<00:01:32.790> pretty<00:01:33.180> matte<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.570> me

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
foundation and not pretty matte to me

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.850 
foundation and not pretty matte to me
but<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.470> still<00:01:34.829> creamy<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:36.090> still<00:01:36.860> liquidy

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
but it's still creamy it's still liquidy

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.030 
but it's still creamy it's still liquidy
it<00:01:38.220> feels<00:01:38.490> almost<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.880> skin<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.380> very

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it feels almost like skin this is very

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.749 
it feels almost like skin this is very
drying<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.479> me<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.740> dry<00:01:44.040> skin

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
drying to me so if you have dry skin

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.490 
drying to me so if you have dry skin
I<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.360> using<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.899> product<00:01:46.170> I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
I know it's just using this product I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.320 
I know it's just using this product I
think<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.189> oily<00:01:47.700> skin<00:01:47.729> this

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
think if you have oily skin this

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.540 
think if you have oily skin this
be<00:01:48.480> something<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
be something that you like because the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.610 
be something that you like because the
oiliness<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.330> your<00:01:51.480> skin<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.050> then<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.380> matte

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
oiliness of your skin and then the matte

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.070 
oiliness of your skin and then the matte
finish<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.520> should<00:01:54.090> give<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.540> more<00:01:54.780> like

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
finish of this should give you more like

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.990 
finish of this should give you more like
a<00:01:55.110> combination<00:01:55.590> look<00:01:56.070> because<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.760> have

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
a combination look because I have

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.200 
a combination look because I have

sure<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:00.750> best<00:02:00.810> thing<00:02:01.620> for<00:02:01.680> me<00:02:02.010> although

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
sure it's the best thing for me although

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.820 
sure it's the best thing for me although
I<00:02:02.820> tell<00:02:03.660> you<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:03.960> at<00:02:04.080> first<00:02:04.230> I<00:02:04.410> didn't<00:02:04.650> really

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
I tell you so at first I didn't really

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.940 
I tell you so at first I didn't really
like<00:02:04.980> it<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.460> all<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.940> then<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.710> went<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.800> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
like it at all and then I went to the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.010 
like it at all and then I went to the
store<00:02:08.280> went<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.790> mall<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> came<00:02:09.270> home<00:02:09.480> and<00:02:09.930> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
store went to the mall I came home and I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.960 
store went to the mall I came home and I
was<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.350> this<00:02:11.130> looks<00:02:11.370> good

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
was like this looks good

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.440 
was like this looks good
so<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.780> did<00:02:13.530> eventually<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.670> because<00:02:15.060> it's

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
so I did eventually like it because it's

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.210 
so I did eventually like it because it's
a<00:02:15.600> little<00:02:15.780> bit<00:02:15.960> drying<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.740> be<00:02:16.830> completely

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
a little bit drying to be completely

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.500 
a little bit drying to be completely
honest<00:02:17.580> like<00:02:17.760> you're<00:02:17.910> gonna<00:02:18.030> have<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.360> use<00:02:18.480> a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
honest like you're gonna have to use a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.010 
honest like you're gonna have to use a
good<00:02:18.750> moisturizer<00:02:18.960> before<00:02:19.800> applying<00:02:20.100> this<00:02:21.020> my

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
good moisturizer before applying this my

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.780 
good moisturizer before applying this my
fear<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.890> throughout<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.550> day<00:02:23.730> can

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
fear is that throughout the day can

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.930 
fear is that throughout the day can
experience<00:02:24.450> some<00:02:24.690> flakiness<00:02:25.110> but<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.850> think<00:02:26.850> if

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
experience some flakiness but I think if

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.820 
experience some flakiness but I think if
you<00:02:27.060> use<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.240> really<00:02:27.630> good<00:02:27.780> moisturizer<00:02:28.380> it's

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
you use a really good moisturizer it's

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.250 
you use a really good moisturizer it's
going<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.640> eliminate<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.240> process<00:02:30.660> if<00:02:31.020> you

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
going to eliminate that process if you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.320 
going to eliminate that process if you
don't<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:32.520> might<00:02:32.640> run<00:02:32.820> into<00:02:32.970> some<00:02:33.060> issues

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
don't you might run into some issues

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.930 
don't you might run into some issues
because<00:02:33.810> it's<00:02:34.140> quite<00:02:34.410> matte<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:35.790> it's

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
because it's quite matte but it's

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.910 
because it's quite matte but it's
definitely<00:02:36.150> really<00:02:36.900> good<00:02:37.170> coverage<00:02:37.620> like

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
definitely really good coverage like

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.400 
definitely really good coverage like
it's<00:02:38.100> at<00:02:38.280> its<00:02:38.490> medium<00:02:38.910> I'm<00:02:39.600> which<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.140> true

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
it's at its medium I'm which is true

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.150 
it's at its medium I'm which is true
because<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.990> tiny<00:02:42.990> tiny<00:02:43.410> Scott<00:02:43.920> like

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
because I have a tiny tiny Scott like

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.620 
because I have a tiny tiny Scott like
amount<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.490> scarring<00:02:44.730> right<00:02:44.940> here<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.540> I

amount of scarring right here and I

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.870 
amount of scarring right here and I
noticed<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:46.020> didn't<00:02:46.230> cover<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.500> up<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.820> is

noticed it didn't cover that up so it is
pretty<00:02:48.270> medium<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.900> didn't<00:02:49.200> completely<00:02:49.470> cover

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
pretty medium it didn't completely cover

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.580

you have oily skin I don't think this is
something<00:03:56.609> if<00:03:56.879> you<00:03:56.970> want<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.209> use<00:03:57.420> just

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
something if you want to use just

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.869 
something if you want to use just
because<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.319> little<00:03:58.530> drying<00:03:58.890> when<00:03:59.730> you're
