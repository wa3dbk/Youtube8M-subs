I<00:02:48.500> got<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:50.239> BBK

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.860 

it's<00:02:55.290> uh<00:02:56.209> trying<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.269> think<00:02:57.450> here<00:02:57.599> trying<00:02:57.840> to

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
it's uh trying to think here trying to

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.020 
it's uh trying to think here trying to
think<00:02:58.080> it's<00:02:59.010> calibrate<00:02:59.400> for<00:02:59.430> 30<00:02:59.819> pound

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
think it's calibrate for 30 pound
