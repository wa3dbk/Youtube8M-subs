00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
really basic to me I mean pretty much

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.200 
really basic to me I mean pretty much
you<00:05:41.930> just<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.469> have<00:05:42.620> the<00:05:42.740> same<00:05:43.060> macro<00:05:44.060> and

you just you have the same macro and
fluid<00:05:44.900> intake<00:05:45.139> targets<00:05:45.589> you<00:05:45.680> just<00:05:45.860> have<00:05:46.039> a

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:46.069 
fluid intake targets you just have a

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:47.529 
fluid intake targets you just have a
smaller<00:05:46.370> window<00:05:46.610> to<00:05:46.699> get<00:05:46.819> them<00:05:46.940> and<00:05:47.330> you'll<00:05:47.389> be

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
smaller window to get them and you'll be

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.200 
smaller window to get them and you'll be
bad<00:05:47.979> yeah<00:05:48.979> I<00:05:49.009> know<00:05:49.129> but<00:05:49.669> the<00:05:49.759> thing<00:05:49.789> the

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210
