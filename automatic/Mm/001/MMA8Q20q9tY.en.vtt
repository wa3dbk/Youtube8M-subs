they've had their family implode
publicly<00:03:04.470> they've<00:03:04.650> lived<00:03:04.950> their<00:03:05.130> entire<00:03:05.280> life

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
publicly they've lived their entire life

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.600 
publicly they've lived their entire life
under<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.390> microscope<00:03:06.770> I<00:03:07.770> would<00:03:08.100> never<00:03:08.280> want

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
under a microscope I would never want

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.730 
under a microscope I would never want
that<00:03:08.700> for<00:03:09.000> my<00:03:09.120> children<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.660> for<00:03:10.080> them<00:03:10.590> to

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
that for my children and for them to

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.620 
that for my children and for them to
actually<00:03:10.920> make<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.790> choice<00:03:12.060> where<00:03:12.450> their

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
actually make that choice where their

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.500 
actually make that choice where their
children<00:03:12.800> shows<00:03:13.800> what<00:03:14.160> poor<00:03:14.490> parents<00:03:15.240> they

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
children shows what poor parents they

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.560 
children shows what poor parents they
are<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.810> mean<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.440> really<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.270> right<00:03:18.270> but<00:03:18.390> keep

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
are I mean that really is right but keep

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.090 
are I mean that really is right but keep
on<00:03:18.660> your<00:03:18.810> reel<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.290> my<00:03:19.440> point<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:19.860> this<00:03:19.950> is

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
on your reel to my point and this is

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.000 
on your reel to my point and this is
where<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.310> cannot<00:03:20.790> extricate<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:22.140> TV<00:03:22.560> cameras

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
where I cannot extricate the TV cameras

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.460 
where I cannot extricate the TV cameras
from<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.459> equation<00:03:23.880> they<00:03:24.510> got<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:24.959> used<00:03:25.260> to

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
from the equation they got so used to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.410 
from the equation they got so used to
those<00:03:25.590> cameras<00:03:26.010> being<00:03:26.220> around<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:27.000> cameras

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
those cameras being around the cameras

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.360 
those cameras being around the cameras
were<00:03:27.540> taking<00:03:27.930> away<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.650> fact<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:29.040> they<00:03:29.190> have

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
were taking away the fact that they have

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.490 
were taking away the fact that they have
acted<00:03:29.850> out<00:03:29.970> does<00:03:30.239> not<00:03:30.450> surprise<00:03:30.930> me<00:03:30.959> at<00:03:31.350> all<00:03:31.440> I

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
acted out does not surprise me at all I

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.900 
acted out does not surprise me at all I
guess<00:03:31.770> is<00:03:31.950> what<00:03:31.980> that's<00:03:32.370> what<00:03:32.520> I'm<00:03:32.640> saying

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
guess is what that's what I'm saying

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.250 
guess is what that's what I'm saying
here<00:03:33.120> that's<00:03:33.330> right<00:03:33.510> there's<00:03:33.870> it's<00:03:34.110> no

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
here that's right there's it's no

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.410 
here that's right there's it's no
surprise<00:03:34.620> at<00:03:34.920> all<00:03:35.040> because<00:03:35.489> again<00:03:35.970> they've

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
surprise at all because again they've

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.930 
surprise at all because again they've
led<00:03:36.720> their<00:03:36.959> life<00:03:37.200> publicly<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.700> and

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
led their life publicly and and and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.110 
led their life publicly and and and
they've<00:03:39.300> had<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:39.840> many<00:03:40.110> changes<00:03:41.120> publicly

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
they've had so many changes publicly

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.360 
they've had so many changes publicly
they<00:03:42.480> probably<00:03:42.780> taunted<00:03:43.470> by<00:03:43.500> other<00:03:43.800> children

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
they probably taunted by other children

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.520 
they probably taunted by other children
it<00:03:44.970> just<00:03:45.420> is<00:03:45.540> probably<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.080> worst<00:03:46.110> possible

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
it just is probably the worst possible

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.320 
it just is probably the worst possible
thing<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:46.980> could<00:03:47.489> have<00:03:47.580> happened<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.910> them<00:03:47.970> I

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
thing that could have happened to them I

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330 
thing that could have happened to them I
mean<00:03:48.900> when<00:03:49.320> is<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.530> lesson<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.890> be<00:03:50.010> learned<00:03:50.220> is

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
mean when is the lesson to be learned is

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.540 
mean when is the lesson to be learned is
the<00:03:50.430> question<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:50.820> keep<00:03:51.000> asking<00:03:51.180> well
