right this series is about sharpening

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.179 
right this series is about sharpening
and<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:06.480> sharp<00:00:06.810> edge<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.259> essential<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.890> get

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
and the sharp edge is essential to get

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.600 
and the sharp edge is essential to get
the<00:00:08.309> most<00:00:08.519> from<00:00:08.820> any<00:00:09.240> tool<00:00:10.010> when<00:00:11.010> you've<00:00:11.400> got<00:00:11.550> a

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
the most from any tool when you've got a

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.789 
the most from any tool when you've got a
sharp<00:00:12.030> edge<00:00:12.179> you've<00:00:12.420> got<00:00:12.599> far<00:00:12.900> more<00:00:12.929> control

sharp edge you've got far more control

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.840 
sharp edge you've got far more control
over<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.730> tool<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.800> it's<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.920> lot<00:00:17.039> easier<00:00:17.100> for

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
over the tool and it's a lot easier for

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.800 
over the tool and it's a lot easier for
you<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:22.529> edge<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.740> sharp<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:24.090> work<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.570> almost

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
you the edge is sharp the work is almost

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.849 
you the edge is sharp the work is almost
effortless<00:00:25.910> cool<00:00:26.910> does<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> work<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:27.869> you

there should be no visible light showing
on<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.160> edge<00:00:32.430> if<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:34.079> shimmer<00:00:34.770> of

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
on this edge if you can see a shimmer of

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.580 
on this edge if you can see a shimmer of
light<00:00:35.000> standing<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.270> edge<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.350> sign

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
light standing on the edge it's a sign

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.860 
light standing on the edge it's a sign
that<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.890> needs<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.340> reshot<00:00:38.820> good<00:00:39.120> what

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
that it needs to be reshot good what

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.940 
that it needs to be reshot good what
we're<00:00:40.050> trying<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.379> achieve<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.700> short<00:00:42.149> edge

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
we're trying to achieve is a short edge

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.010 
we're trying to achieve is a short edge
that<00:00:43.950> comes<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.399> such<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> point<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.480> light<00:00:45.989> is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
that comes to such a point that light is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.010 
that comes to such a point that light is
not<00:00:46.260> able<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:47.010> fall<00:00:47.250> upon<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:48.809> our

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
not able to fall upon it that's our

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.430 
not able to fall upon it that's our
definition<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.730> sharpness<00:00:51.050> now<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.199> need

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
definition of sharpness now I just need

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.660 
definition of sharpness now I just need
to<00:00:52.559> move<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.420> across<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> whole<00:00:54.870> stone<00:00:55.670> left

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
to move this across the whole stone left

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.770 
to move this across the whole stone left
to<00:00:56.879> right

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.660 

until<00:01:02.500> I<00:01:02.590> crying<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.129> whole<00:01:03.280> edge<00:01:04.110> back<00:01:05.670> so

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
until I crying the whole edge back so

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:15.510 
until I crying the whole edge back so
there's<00:01:06.850> no<00:01:07.030> hound<00:01:07.390> edge<00:01:08.350> left<00:01:08.740> at<00:01:08.920> all

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:25.130 

wench

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.990 

very<00:01:26.140> quickly<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:26.920> grinding<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.700> edge<00:01:27.820> away

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
very quickly is grinding the edge away

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.870 
very quickly is grinding the edge away
much<00:01:28.390> faster<00:01:28.900> than<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.170> tour<00:01:29.409> mate<00:01:29.619> would

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
much faster than the tour mate would

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.120 
much faster than the tour mate would
continue<00:01:30.880> for<00:01:31.119> another<00:01:31.900> 2<00:01:32.290> minutes<00:01:35.130> what

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
continue for another 2 minutes what

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.160 
continue for another 2 minutes what
we're<00:01:36.310> aiming<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.640> achieve<00:01:36.850> on<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.960> back<00:01:38.140> of

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
we're aiming to achieve on the back of

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.149 
we're aiming to achieve on the back of
the<00:01:38.380> blade<00:01:38.680> is<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.600> uniform<00:01:40.600> grayness<00:01:41.200> this

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
the blade is a uniform grayness this

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.370 
the blade is a uniform grayness this
will<00:01:42.369> tell<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:42.909> where<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.570> high<00:01:43.780> points<00:01:44.229> in

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
will tell you where the high points in

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.469 
will tell you where the high points in
the<00:01:44.500> back<00:01:44.680> your<00:01:44.860> blade<00:01:45.100> are<00:01:45.340> for<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.090> chisel

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
the back your blade are for a chisel

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.230 
the back your blade are for a chisel
what<00:01:46.630> we<00:01:46.750> do<00:01:46.930> is<00:01:47.200> place<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.190> chiseled<00:01:48.580> on<00:01:49.000> to

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
what we do is place the chiseled on to

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.800 
what we do is place the chiseled on to
the<00:01:49.360> stone<00:01:49.690> furthest<00:01:50.440> from<00:01:50.649> you<00:01:51.119> find<00:01:52.119> where

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
the stone furthest from you find where

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.190 
the stone furthest from you find where
were<00:01:53.320> 25<00:01:53.890> degree<00:01:54.310> grind<00:01:54.729> is<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.390> settle<00:01:56.020> that

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
were 25 degree grind is and settle that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.040 
were 25 degree grind is and settle that
bevel<00:01:56.619> on<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.160> stone<00:01:57.690> then<00:01:58.690> we<00:01:58.869> need<00:01:58.990> to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
bevel on to the stone then we need to

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.029 
bevel on to the stone then we need to
lift<00:01:59.530> by<00:02:00.310> back<00:02:00.490> five<00:02:00.850> degrees<00:02:01.740> five<00:02:02.740> degree

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
lift by back five degrees five degree

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.980 
lift by back five degrees five degree
there's<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.280> lot<00:02:03.550> less<00:02:03.880> than<00:02:03.910> you<00:02:04.179> think<00:02:04.630> so

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
there's a lot less than you think so

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.060 
there's a lot less than you think so
lift<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.560> as<00:02:05.740> little<00:02:06.580> as<00:02:06.670> you<00:02:06.729> can<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:09.009> I'm

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
lift it as little as you can and so I'm

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.370 
lift it as little as you can and so I'm
just<00:02:09.250> lifted<00:02:09.670> now<00:02:09.940> just<00:02:10.479> exaggerate<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.230> so

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
just lifted now just exaggerate that so

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.220 
just lifted now just exaggerate that so
you<00:02:11.440> can<00:02:11.590> see<00:02:11.769> what<00:02:11.890> I'm<00:02:11.980> doing<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:14.050> then<00:02:14.140> I'm

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
you can see what I'm doing and then I'm

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.690 
you can see what I'm doing and then I'm
going<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.440> lock<00:02:14.590> my<00:02:14.860> arms<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.340> position

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
going to lock my arms in that position

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.340 
going to lock my arms in that position
and<00:02:16.660> I'm<00:02:16.750> going<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.959> draw<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.290> Jizzle<00:02:17.860> back

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
and I'm going to draw the Jizzle back

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.199 
and I'm going to draw the Jizzle back
just<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.560> recap<00:02:21.160> on<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.430> week<00:02:21.670> what<00:02:21.880> I'd<00:02:21.970> like<00:02:22.150> to

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209
