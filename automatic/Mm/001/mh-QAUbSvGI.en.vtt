was a Theon kind of had its crutch
moments<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.070> had<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.369> ability<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.270> know

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
moments you had the ability to you know

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.730 
moments you had the ability to you know
regenerate<00:02:00.780> your<00:02:00.810> super<00:02:01.200> through<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.500> time

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and and everything like that so you had

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.209 
and and everything like that so you had
some<00:02:03.780> advantages<00:02:04.409> not<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.680> mention<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.070> have

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
some advantages not to mention you have

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.670 
some advantages not to mention you have
a<00:02:05.250> big<00:02:05.820> disadvantage<00:02:06.390> with<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.320> fact<00:02:07.590> that

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
a big disadvantage with the fact that

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.680 
a big disadvantage with the fact that
you<00:02:07.799> can't<00:02:07.979> regenerate<00:02:08.340> health<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.660> I

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
you can't regenerate health in this so I

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.999 
you can't regenerate health in this so I
would<00:02:09.959> recommend<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.410> guys<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> bring<00:02:10.890> along

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
would recommend you guys to bring along

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.589 
would recommend you guys to bring along
one<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.340> those<00:02:11.489> weapons<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.060> does<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.540> for

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
one of those weapons that does that for

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.309 
one of those weapons that does that for
you<00:02:12.989> and

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
you and

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.569 
you and
would<00:02:13.409> say<00:02:13.590> something<00:02:13.859> like<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.249> regime

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
would say something like the regime

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:15.949 
would say something like the regime
which<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.879> can<00:02:14.999> regenerate<00:02:15.239> health<00:02:15.540> by<00:02:15.749> you

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
which you can regenerate health by you

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.479 
which you can regenerate health by you
know<00:02:16.049> picking<00:02:16.260> off<00:02:16.439> a<00:02:16.469> couple<00:02:16.650> thralls<00:02:17.129> or

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
know picking off a couple thralls or

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.280 
know picking off a couple thralls or
think<00:02:17.909> the<00:02:17.999> Red<00:02:18.180> Death<00:02:18.359> has<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.599> similar<00:02:18.900> perk

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
think the Red Death has a similar perk

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.259 
think the Red Death has a similar perk
so<00:02:19.560> while<00:02:20.040> you're<00:02:20.249> waiting<00:02:20.639> on<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.879> next<00:02:21.090> wave

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
so while you're waiting on the next wave

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.940 
so while you're waiting on the next wave
or<00:02:21.599> for<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.870> sword<00:02:22.079> bear<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.439> come<00:02:22.590> out<00:02:22.739> it'd

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
or for the sword bear to come out it'd

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.289 
or for the sword bear to come out it'd
be<00:02:23.129> a<00:02:23.159> great<00:02:23.340> idea<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.760> alternate<00:02:24.239> between

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
be a great idea to alternate between

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.509 
be a great idea to alternate between
those<00:02:24.719> and<00:02:24.749> use<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.019> as<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.379> strategy<00:02:25.709> while

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
those and use that as a strategy while

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.030 
those and use that as a strategy while
fighting<00:02:26.819> him<00:02:27.150> because<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:28.349> child's<00:02:28.709> may<00:02:28.859> not

the Big Daddy right here it resembles

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.490 
the Big Daddy right here it resembles
kind<00:03:02.549> of<00:03:02.669> a<00:03:02.760> solar<00:03:03.060> damage<00:03:03.540> version<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.109> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
kind of a solar damage version of the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.830 
kind of a solar damage version of the
churros<00:03:05.310> regime<00:03:05.639> in<00:03:05.819> a<00:03:05.879> few<00:03:06.030> ways<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.750> see

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
churros regime in a few ways you can see

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.659 
churros regime in a few ways you can see
it's<00:03:06.959> solar<00:03:07.169> damage<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.739> has<00:03:07.769> hipfire<00:03:08.340> in<00:03:08.549> that

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
it's solar damage it has hipfire in that

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.699 
it's solar damage it has hipfire in that
first<00:03:08.909> tier<00:03:09.209> area<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.780> even<00:03:10.109> focus<00:03:10.500> fire

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
first tier area and even focus fire

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.649 
first tier area and even focus fire
which<00:03:10.949> is<00:03:11.099> what<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.579> churros<00:03:12.120> does<00:03:12.389> when<00:03:12.599> you

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
which is what the churros does when you

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.059 
which is what the churros does when you
aim<00:03:12.810> down<00:03:12.840> sight<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.439> actually<00:03:13.709> slow<00:03:13.829> rate<00:03:14.040> of

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
aim down sight it actually slow rate of

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.129 
aim down sight it actually slow rate of
fire<00:03:14.189> but<00:03:14.489> higher<00:03:14.669> damage<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.389> also<00:03:15.780> has<00:03:16.109> a

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
fire but higher damage it also has a

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.899 
fire but higher damage it also has a
couple<00:03:16.409> other<00:03:16.620> nice<00:03:16.919> advantages<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.669> it<00:03:17.699> it's

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
couple other nice advantages to it it's

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.369 
couple other nice advantages to it it's
got<00:03:18.030> perfect<00:03:18.449> balance<00:03:18.569> in<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:18.900> middle<00:03:19.169> tier

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
got perfect balance in that middle tier

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.599 
got perfect balance in that middle tier
area<00:03:19.709> which<00:03:19.859> is<00:03:19.949> going<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.099> be<00:03:20.159> great<00:03:20.370> for<00:03:20.549> the

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
area which is going to be great for the

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.490 
area which is going to be great for the
low<00:03:20.729> recoil<00:03:20.939> but<00:03:21.509> it<00:03:21.629> also<00:03:21.750> has<00:03:21.989> lish<00:03:22.229> main

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
low recoil but it also has lish main

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.080 
low recoil but it also has lish main
which<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:22.919> projectiles<00:03:23.489> have<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.699> chance<00:03:23.939> to

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
which is projectiles have a chance to

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.580 
which is projectiles have a chance to
disorient<00:03:24.569> hive<00:03:24.750> wizards<00:03:25.169> which<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.409> great

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
disorient hive wizards which is great

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.259 
disorient hive wizards which is great
because<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:25.919> is<00:03:26.009> a<00:03:26.040> solar<00:03:26.310> damage<00:03:26.639> so<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.090> drops

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
because it is a solar damage so it drops

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.399 
because it is a solar damage so it drops
their<00:03:27.540> shields<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:27.930> thing<00:03:28.049> is<00:03:28.139> going<00:03:28.229> to<00:03:28.290> be

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
their shields this thing is going to be

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.080 
their shields this thing is going to be
an<00:03:28.500> incredible<00:03:28.949> thing<00:03:29.189> and<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.669> lot<00:03:29.879> of<00:03:29.939> people

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
you can see it's got a couple unique

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.479 
you can see it's got a couple unique
things<00:03:40.109> it's<00:03:40.290> got<00:03:40.409> spray<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.919> play<00:03:41.040> available

things it's got spray and play available
which<00:03:41.609> is<00:03:41.759> increases<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.329> reload<00:03:42.629> speed<00:03:42.870> by

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
which is increases the reload speed by

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.409 
which is increases the reload speed by
fifty<00:03:43.139> percent<00:03:43.590> if<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.489> mag<00:03:44.699> is<00:03:44.879> empty<00:03:45.000> but<00:03:45.269> it

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
fifty percent if the mag is empty but it

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.629 
fifty percent if the mag is empty but it
also<00:03:45.540> has<00:03:45.780> target<00:03:46.290> mark<00:03:46.530> which<00:03:46.739> says<00:03:47.609> the

also has target mark which says the

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.670 
also has target mark which says the
enemy's<00:03:48.209> hit<00:03:48.569> by<00:03:48.720> this<00:03:48.780> weapon<00:03:49.229> are<00:03:49.319> briefly

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
highlighted I'm not sure exactly how

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.030 
highlighted I'm not sure exactly how
that's<00:03:51.689> gonna<00:03:51.840> work<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.290> it's<00:03:52.409> probably<00:03:52.620> for

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
that's gonna work but it's probably for

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.129 
that's gonna work but it's probably for
like<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.849> moments<00:03:54.269> inside<00:03:54.389> of<00:03:54.810> fighting

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
like the the moments inside of fighting

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.569 
like the the moments inside of fighting
the<00:03:55.229> thralls<00:03:55.530> in<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.799> first<00:03:56.009> portion<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.519> the

the thralls in that first portion of the
raid<00:03:56.729> it's<00:03:56.879> also<00:03:57.000> got<00:03:57.150> high-caliber<00:03:57.780> rounds

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
raid it's also got high-caliber rounds

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.999 
raid it's also got high-caliber rounds
which<00:03:58.109> is<00:03:58.199> going<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.349> make<00:03:58.409> it<00:03:58.530> great<00:03:58.799> for

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
its effective range so it's got some
