00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
this week and I go first I'll fraga as

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.320 
this week and I go first I'll fraga as
you<00:01:20.020> can<00:01:20.170> see<00:01:20.350> for<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.280> bandit<00:01:21.700> avoid<00:01:22.119> being

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
you can see for a bandit avoid being

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330 
you can see for a bandit avoid being
stabbed<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:22.869> stuff<00:01:23.110> will<00:01:23.470> not<00:01:23.650> be<00:01:23.860> a<00:01:23.890> frigid

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
stabbed and stuff will not be a frigid

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.810 
stabbed and stuff will not be a frigid
tail<00:01:24.579> which<00:01:25.509> just<00:01:25.869> shows<00:01:25.960> how<00:01:26.340> physical<00:01:27.340> bulky

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
tail which just shows how physical bulky

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.389 
tail which just shows how physical bulky
golf<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.329> will<00:01:28.509> it<00:01:28.630> works<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.710> predict<00:01:30.280> the

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
golf and will it works so predict the

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.039 
golf and will it works so predict the
switch<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:30.820> Wilfred<00:01:31.090> stone<00:01:31.359> edge<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:31.899> was

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
switch and Wilfred stone edge and it was

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.929 
switch and Wilfred stone edge and it was
a<00:01:32.079> good<00:01:32.259> play<00:01:32.500> my<00:01:32.770> part<00:01:33.039> still<00:01:33.579> doesn't<00:01:33.759> do

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
a good play my part still doesn't do

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.190 
a good play my part still doesn't do
crap<00:01:34.119> but<00:01:34.509> it's<00:01:34.689> still<00:01:34.869> better<00:01:35.079> than

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
crap but it's still better than

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.800 
crap but it's still better than
earthquake<00:01:35.799> which<00:01:36.100> he<00:01:36.369> by<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.850> way<00:01:36.999> is<00:01:37.390> immune

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
earthquake which he by the way is immune

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.760 
earthquake which he by the way is immune
to<00:01:37.840> and

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
to and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.410 
to and
yeah<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.810> predict<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.740> loveless<00:01:43.549> that's

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
yeah so I predict the loveless that's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.260 
yeah so I predict the loveless that's
why<00:01:44.689> I<00:01:44.990> switch<00:01:45.439> here<00:01:45.799> as<00:01:46.009> well<00:01:46.280> as<00:01:46.549> he<00:01:46.820> did<00:01:47.000> and

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
why I switch here as well as he did and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.029 
why I switch here as well as he did and
he<00:01:47.420> goes<00:01:47.570> through<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:48.020> can<00:01:48.200> touch<00:01:48.350> me<00:01:48.590> he<00:01:48.770> says

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
he goes through you can touch me he says

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.850 
he goes through you can touch me he says
spirit<00:01:49.520> room<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.420> that's<00:01:51.259> pretty<00:01:51.560> good

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
spirit room and that's pretty good

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.249 
spirit room and that's pretty good
because<00:01:52.310> now<00:01:52.340> I'm<00:01:52.700> like<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.090> know<00:01:53.119> what

because now I'm like you know what

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.889 
because now I'm like you know what
spiritual<00:01:54.259> can<00:01:54.789> can<00:01:55.789> impact<00:01:56.119> trick<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.840> I

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
spiritual can can impact trick and I

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.050 
spiritual can can impact trick and I
just<00:01:56.929> want<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.469> scout<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.219> just<00:01:58.819> want<00:01:59.000> to
