let's<00:00:05.460> try<00:00:05.670> another<00:00:05.940> knot<00:00:06.480> how<00:00:06.870> about<00:00:07.080> the

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
let's try another knot how about the

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.520 
let's try another knot how about the
bowline<00:00:07.710> here<00:00:08.400> we'll<00:00:08.610> use<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.790> stanchion<00:00:12.530> I'm

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
bowline here we'll use the stanchion I'm

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.499 
bowline here we'll use the stanchion I'm
going<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.769> pull<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.040> long<00:00:14.219> end<00:00:14.250> tight<00:00:14.940> I'm

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
going to pull the long end tight I'm

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.970 
going to pull the long end tight I'm
going<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.690> hold<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.109> there<00:00:16.170> while<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.680> make<00:00:16.949> a

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
going to hold it there while I make a

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.320 
going to hold it there while I make a
loop<00:00:17.539> by<00:00:18.539> pulling<00:00:18.960> part<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.380> back<00:00:19.650> and

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
loop by pulling part of it back and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.050 
loop by pulling part of it back and
under<00:00:22.070> then<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.430> take<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.789> short

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
under then I'm going to take the short

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.439 
under then I'm going to take the short
end<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.689> bring<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.590> through<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.949> loop<00:00:26.449> I'll

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
end and bring it through the loop I'll

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.380 
end and bring it through the loop I'll
have<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> two<00:00:27.960> sides<00:00:28.260> parallel<00:00:28.949> there<00:00:29.390> then

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
have the two sides parallel there then

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.659 
have the two sides parallel there then
I'll<00:00:30.539> wrap<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.050> short<00:00:31.410> end<00:00:31.619> behind<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.430> long

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
I'll wrap the short end behind the long

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.030 
I'll wrap the short end behind the long
end<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.270> bring<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.050> back<00:00:34.320> through<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> loop

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
end and bring it back through the loop

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:44.350 
end and bring it back through the loop
and<00:00:35.579> pull<00:00:35.960> it<00:00:36.960> tight<00:00:38.570> that's<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.750> ball<00:00:39.930> one

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.940 

would<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.690> try<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.930> sure<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.829> right

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
would you like to try it sure all right

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.720 
would you like to try it sure all right
let<00:00:47.219> me<00:00:47.250> untie<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:49.219> there<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.340> go

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
let me untie it there you go

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.850 
let me untie it there you go
Thanks<00:00:51.000> let<00:00:51.149> me<00:00:51.210> see<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.510> got<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.079> take

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
Thanks let me see if I got this I take

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.130 
Thanks let me see if I got this I take
the<00:00:52.920> long<00:00:53.160> end<00:00:53.399> push<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.449> forward<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.840> under

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the long end push it forward and under

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.619 
the long end push it forward and under
to<00:00:55.440> make<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> loop<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.270> take<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> short

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
to make a loop like this take the short

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.470 
to make a loop like this take the short
on<00:00:57.780> bring<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.620> up<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.879> under<00:01:00.320> down<00:01:01.579> around<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
on bring it up and under down around and

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.000 
on bring it up and under down around and
back<00:01:03.769> through<00:01:05.450> pull<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.479> tight<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.080> there's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
back through pull it tight and there's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.590 
back through pull it tight and there's
my<00:01:08.130> bowling<00:01:08.460> you've<00:01:08.939> got<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:10.760> sailors<00:01:11.760> use<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
my bowling you've got it sailors use a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.410 
my bowling you've got it sailors use a
bowline<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:14.040> they're<00:01:14.250> tying<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.820> jib<00:01:15.090> sheet

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
bowline when they're tying a jib sheet

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.870 
bowline when they're tying a jib sheet
to<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> jib<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.439> needs<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.979> withstand<00:01:17.520> several

to the jib it needs to withstand several

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.359 
to the jib it needs to withstand several
thousand<00:01:18.630> pounds<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.049> pressure<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:20.189> nice

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
thousand pounds of pressure the nice

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.980 
thousand pounds of pressure the nice
thing<00:01:20.640> about<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.060> even<00:01:21.360> though<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.810> do

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
thing about it is even though it can do

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.560 
thing about it is even though it can do
that<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.710> very<00:01:22.979> easy<00:01:23.159> time<00:01:23.460> too<00:01:23.640> high<00:01:23.790> simply

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
that it's very easy time too high simply

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.780 
that it's very easy time too high simply
by<00:01:24.720> loosening<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> back<00:01:25.500> loop<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.460> pulling

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
by loosening the back loop then pulling

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.200 
by loosening the back loop then pulling
us<00:01:26.939> through<00:01:30.979> another<00:01:31.979> use<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.520> bowline<00:01:33.000> is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
us through another use of a bowline is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.050 
us through another use of a bowline is
for<00:01:33.659> making<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.079> big<00:01:34.350> loop<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.159> line<00:01:35.430> for

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
for making a big loop in a line for

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.700 
for making a big loop in a line for
example<00:01:36.210> when<00:01:36.689> you're<00:01:36.840> coming<00:01:37.110> into<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.409> gas

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
example when you're coming into a gas

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.039 
example when you're coming into a gas
dock<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.400> need<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.790> throw<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.299> loop<00:01:39.479> over

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
dock and you need to throw the loop over

dock and you need to throw the loop over
a<00:01:40.079> piling<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> bowline<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.210> way<00:01:42.360> I

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
a piling can you do a bowline that way I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.870 
a piling can you do a bowline that way I
think<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.110> let<00:01:43.320> me<00:01:43.380> try<00:01:43.590> okay<00:01:43.860> well<00:01:44.549> first<00:01:44.759> I

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
think so let me try okay well first I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.359 
think so let me try okay well first I
need<00:01:45.030> some<00:01:45.149> more<00:01:45.270> line<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.600> make<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> loop

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
need some more line to make the loop

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.710 
need some more line to make the loop
that<00:01:47.369> should<00:01:47.549> do<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.180> I'm<00:01:48.240> gonna<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
that should do and I'm gonna take the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.830 
that should do and I'm gonna take the
long<00:01:48.869> end<00:01:49.110> push<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.979> forward<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.399> under<00:01:50.840> make

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
long end push it forward and under make

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.980 
long end push it forward and under make
a<00:01:51.869> loop<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.399> take<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> short<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.990> bring

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
a loop like this take the short on bring

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.630 
a loop like this take the short on bring
it<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.520> down<00:01:56.780> around<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.469> long<00:01:58.680> end<00:01:58.979> back<00:01:59.399> up

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
it up down around the long end back up

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.179 
it up down around the long end back up
and<00:01:59.880> through<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> loop<00:02:00.860> now<00:02:01.860> I'm<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.100> gonna

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
and through the loop now I'm just gonna

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.569 
and through the loop now I'm just gonna
pull<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.520> tight<00:02:02.810> that's<00:02:03.810> my<00:02:03.990> bowling<00:02:04.579> it's

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
pull it tight that's my bowling it's

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.350 
pull it tight that's my bowling it's
just<00:02:05.700> big<00:02:05.850> enough<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.780> looks<00:02:06.990> great
