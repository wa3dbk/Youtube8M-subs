00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.840 
got to do that so probably I'm going to
do<00:02:51.940> or<00:02:52.270> I<00:02:52.330> can<00:02:52.480> get<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.840> right<00:02:52.960> here

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
do or I can get to that right here

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.970 
do or I can get to that right here
actually<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.209> might<00:02:55.450> give<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:58.770> what<00:02:59.770> looks

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
actually I might give it to what looks

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.270 
actually I might give it to what looks
like<00:03:00.070> I<00:03:00.250> can<00:03:00.459> do<00:03:01.000> something<00:03:01.030> with<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.420> so<00:03:02.280> you

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
like I can do something with that so you

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.720 
like I can do something with that so you
find<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.640> socket<00:03:03.940> for<00:03:04.330> that<00:03:04.510> guy<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:04.780> then<00:03:05.080> all

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
find a socket for that guy and then all

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.630 
find a socket for that guy and then all
I'll<00:03:06.730> loosen<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:08.130> okay<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.310> just<00:03:09.340> whipped

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
I'll loosen that okay so I just whipped

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.480 
I'll loosen that okay so I just whipped
out<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.820> ten<00:03:10.450> millimeter<00:03:10.720> socket<00:03:10.930> wrench<00:03:11.620> you

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
out a ten millimeter socket wrench you

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.230 
out a ten millimeter socket wrench you
know<00:03:12.610> that<00:03:12.790> works<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.390> lot<00:03:13.570> smoother<00:03:14.140> and

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
know that works a lot smoother and

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.340 
know that works a lot smoother and
probably<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:16.300> only<00:03:16.570> smoother<00:03:16.900> than<00:03:17.020> that<00:03:17.110> so

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
probably the only smoother than that so

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.870 
probably the only smoother than that so
it's<00:03:17.500> all<00:03:17.620> good<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:17.860> go<00:03:18.930> yeah<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:21.610> just<00:03:21.700> going

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
it's all good to go yeah so just going

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.760 
it's all good to go yeah so just going
to<00:03:21.970> go<00:03:22.060> around<00:03:22.270> there<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.410> actually

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
to go around there so and actually

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.430 
to go around there so and actually
figure<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.130> out<00:03:24.390> I'm<00:03:25.390> pretty<00:03:25.840> sure<00:03:26.110> I<00:03:26.140> like<00:03:26.350> to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
figure it out I'm pretty sure I like to

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.500 
figure it out I'm pretty sure I like to
do<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.709> I'm<00:03:27.550> not<00:03:27.790> actually<00:03:27.940> sure<00:03:28.330> yet

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
do this I'm not actually sure yet

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.449 
do this I'm not actually sure yet
because<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:28.780> can't<00:03:28.989> really<00:03:29.110> tell<00:03:29.410> but<00:03:29.650> let's

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
because I can't really tell but let's

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:38.640 
because I can't really tell but let's
see<00:03:30.640> if<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.850> set<00:03:31.090> this<00:03:36.480> okay<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:37.900> put<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.320> like

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
see if I set this okay so put that like

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.180 
see if I set this okay so put that like
that

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
that

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.430 
that
what's<00:03:39.730> yeah<00:03:39.970> bye<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.660> think<00:03:41.170> I'm<00:03:41.290> going<00:03:41.380> to

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
what's yeah bye I think I'm going to

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.040 
what's yeah bye I think I'm going to
have<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.709> run<00:03:41.860> it<00:03:41.980> jacks<00:03:42.220> yet<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:43.540> let<00:03:43.750> me<00:03:43.840> get

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
have to run it jacks yet just let me get

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.540 
have to run it jacks yet just let me get
think<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.709> shafts<00:03:44.950> going<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.250> come<00:03:45.400> out

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
think of the shafts going to come out

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.310 
think of the shafts going to come out
here<00:03:45.970> I'm<00:03:46.420> gonna<00:03:46.570> have<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.720> go<00:03:46.810> down<00:03:47.050> a<00:03:47.080> little

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
here I'm gonna have to go down a little

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.199 
here I'm gonna have to go down a little
bit<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.620> then<00:03:47.830> over<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.489> down<00:03:48.640> right<00:03:48.790> here

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
bit and then over and down right here

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.430 
bit and then over and down right here
so<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.540> might<00:03:49.690> even<00:03:49.870> need<00:03:49.989> to<00:03:50.110> weld<00:03:50.290> another

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
so I might even need to weld another

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.940 
so I might even need to weld another
plate<00:03:50.950> on<00:03:50.980> here<00:03:51.489> for<00:03:51.730> extra<00:03:51.940> room<00:03:52.830> sit<00:03:53.830> the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
plate on here for extra room sit the

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.000 
plate on here for extra room sit the
engine<00:03:54.280> down<00:03:54.510> on<00:03:55.510> there<00:03:55.750> just<00:03:55.959> for<00:03:59.010> su

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
engine down on there just for su

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.320 
engine down on there just for su
depending<00:04:00.489> on<00:04:00.580> it<00:04:00.700> really<00:04:00.820> depends<00:04:01.239> on<00:04:01.269> the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
depending on it really depends on the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.280 
depending on it really depends on the
clutch<00:04:01.660> now<00:04:01.900> because<00:04:02.200> I<00:04:02.470> actually<00:04:03.040> have<00:04:04.290> quite

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
clutch now because I actually have quite

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.280 
clutch now because I actually have quite
a<00:04:05.410> bit<00:04:05.500> of<00:04:05.680> room<00:04:05.830> right<00:04:06.040> here<00:04:06.930> now<00:04:07.930> if<00:04:08.110> you

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
a bit of room right here now if you

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.640 
a bit of room right here now if you
right<00:04:08.920> look<00:04:09.340> right<00:04:09.580> here<00:04:09.930> if<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.080> clutch<00:04:11.350> goes

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
right look right here if the clutch goes

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.250 
right look right here if the clutch goes
right<00:04:12.160> there<00:04:12.489> I<00:04:12.519> mean<00:04:12.730> that's<00:04:12.910> I'm<00:04:13.810> good<00:04:14.110> to<00:04:14.200> go

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
right there I mean that's I'm good to go

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.140 
right there I mean that's I'm good to go
so<00:04:14.830> in<00:04:15.820> just<00:04:16.060> judging<00:04:16.359> my<00:04:16.630> DS<00:04:17.459> just<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.729> could

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
so in just judging my DS just I could

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.469 
so in just judging my DS just I could
even<00:04:19.419> mount<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:20.459> with<00:04:21.459> probably<00:04:22.270> one<00:04:22.450> of

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
even mount that with probably one of

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.700 
even mount that with probably one of
money

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
money

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.400 
money
cause<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.580> might<00:04:24.729> also<00:04:24.910> knows<00:04:25.210> but<00:04:25.449> just

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
cause you might also knows but just

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.960 
cause you might also knows but just
welding<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.830> nice<00:04:26.979> little<00:04:27.220> plan<00:04:27.490> on<00:04:27.639> there<00:04:27.789> be

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
welding a nice little plan on there be

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.719 
welding a nice little plan on there be
beautiful<00:04:28.440> but<00:04:29.440> I'm<00:04:29.680> hoping<00:04:30.039> it's<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.370> clutch

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
beautiful but I'm hoping it's a clutch

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.570 
beautiful but I'm hoping it's a clutch
like<00:04:30.940> my<00:04:31.120> minibike<00:04:31.560> where<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.710> clutch<00:04:33.009> faces

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
like my minibike where the clutch faces

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.900 
like my minibike where the clutch faces
out<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.600> that<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.740> chain<00:04:36.070> is<00:04:36.100> real<00:04:36.490> close<00:04:36.759> to

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
out and that the chain is real close to

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.510 
out and that the chain is real close to
the<00:04:37.030> engine<00:04:37.470> so<00:04:38.470> that<00:04:38.680> it<00:04:38.949> would<00:04:39.100> basically

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
the engine so that it would basically

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.510 
the engine so that it would basically
run<00:04:40.060> straight<00:04:40.509> down<00:04:40.570> there<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:42.160> actually<00:04:42.310> that

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
run straight down there so actually that

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.460 
run straight down there so actually that
saves<00:04:42.880> me<00:04:43.030> about<00:04:43.210> 40<00:04:43.600> bucks<00:04:43.750> because<00:04:44.050> I

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
saves me about 40 bucks because I

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.350 
saves me about 40 bucks because I
thought<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:45.400> was<00:04:45.550> going<00:04:45.639> to<00:04:45.699> need<00:04:45.850> a<00:04:45.910> jack<00:04:46.090> shaft

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
thought I was going to need a jack shaft

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.529 
thought I was going to need a jack shaft
so<00:04:46.660> it<00:04:47.020> looks<00:04:47.410> pretty<00:04:47.620> good<00:04:47.770> but<00:04:48.669> that<00:04:48.910> looks

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
so it looks pretty good but that looks

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.969 
so it looks pretty good but that looks
like<00:04:49.600> it<00:04:49.840> fits<00:04:50.080> on<00:04:50.229> there<00:04:50.320> pretty<00:04:50.530> nice<00:04:50.740> it

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
like it fits on there pretty nice it

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.120 
like it fits on there pretty nice it
looks<00:04:51.160> like<00:04:51.600> gonna<00:04:52.600> go<00:04:52.750> pretty<00:04:52.960> quick<00:04:53.289> big

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
looks like gonna go pretty quick big

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.510 
looks like gonna go pretty quick big
engine<00:04:54.720> probably<00:04:55.720> have<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:56.020> tone<00:04:56.199> it<00:04:56.229> down

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
engine probably have to tone it down

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.710 
engine probably have to tone it down
because<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.729> torque<00:04:58.060> put<00:04:59.340> so<00:05:00.599> that's<00:05:01.599> it

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
because the torque put so that's it

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.180 
because the torque put so that's it
right<00:05:01.840> there<00:05:01.900> so<00:05:02.259> now<00:05:02.289> I'm<00:05:02.500> going<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.849> probably

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
right there so now I'm going to probably

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.219 
right there so now I'm going to probably
put<00:05:06.190> some<00:05:06.669> oil<00:05:06.849> in<00:05:07.030> it<00:05:07.210> maybe<00:05:07.539> gas<00:05:07.780> it<00:05:07.960> up<00:05:08.050> and

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
put some oil in it maybe gas it up and

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.920 
put some oil in it maybe gas it up and
give<00:05:08.349> it<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.500> test

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
give it a test

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.469 
give it a test
all<00:05:10.930> right<00:05:11.349> so<00:05:11.830> I<00:05:12.690> got<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:13.840> engine<00:05:14.199> got<00:05:14.680> some

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
all right so I got the engine got some

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:22.469 
all right so I got the engine got some
10w30<00:05:16.860> Pennzoil<00:05:17.860> oil<00:05:18.130> and<00:05:19.050> now<00:05:20.160> then<00:05:21.160> right<00:05:21.479> so

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
10w30 Pennzoil oil and now then right so

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.159
