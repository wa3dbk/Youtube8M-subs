properties of each to see how they

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
properties of each to see how they
affect<00:01:05.760> your<00:01:06.090> text<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.320> one<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.560> we're

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
affect your text but the one that we're

affect your text but the one that we're
going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.950> focus<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> offset<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.420> the

raise<00:01:27.720> up<00:01:27.930> your<00:01:28.049> scale<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.560> about<00:01:28.590> 140<00:01:29.369> percent

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
raise up your scale to about 140 percent

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.819 
raise up your scale to about 140 percent
now<00:01:30.420> feel<00:01:30.630> free<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.170> crank<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
now feel free to really crank up the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.350 
now feel free to really crank up the
scale<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.369> want<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> exaggerate<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
scale if you want to exaggerate the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.980 
scale if you want to exaggerate the
scale<00:01:33.600> down<00:01:33.780> effect

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
scale down effect

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.020 
scale down effect
so<00:01:36.890> next<00:01:37.040> we're<00:01:37.190> going<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.430> head<00:01:37.549> over<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.790> our

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
so next we're going to head over to our

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.399 
so next we're going to head over to our
second<00:01:38.390> animator<00:01:38.720> so<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.080> we<00:01:39.170> can<00:01:39.320> adjust

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
second animator so that we can adjust

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.920 
second animator so that we can adjust
the<00:01:39.770> opacity<00:01:40.070> now<00:01:40.880> again<00:01:41.150> make<00:01:41.360> sure<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.659> open

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
the opacity now again make sure and open

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.420 
the opacity now again make sure and open
up<00:01:41.990> your<00:01:42.049> range<00:01:42.409> selector<00:01:42.860> options<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:43.369> that

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
up your range selector options so that

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.580 
up your range selector options so that
we<00:01:43.580> can<00:01:43.729> adjust<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.180> offset<00:01:44.420> now<00:01:45.229> for<00:01:45.470> the

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
we can adjust the offset now for the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.200 
we can adjust the offset now for the
offset<00:01:46.010> on<00:01:46.159> this<00:01:46.280> animator<00:01:46.670> we're<00:01:46.909> going<00:01:47.119> to

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
offset on this animator we're going to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.790 
offset on this animator we're going to
want<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.420> move<00:01:47.600> out<00:01:47.750> on<00:01:47.930> our<00:01:47.960> timeline<00:01:48.350> about<00:01:48.740> a

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
want to move out on our timeline about a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.440 
want to move out on our timeline about a
half<00:01:49.040> a<00:01:49.220> second<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.759> then<00:01:49.909> set<00:01:50.150> a<00:01:50.180> keyframe

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
half a second and then set a keyframe

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.230 
half a second and then set a keyframe
with<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.930> value<00:01:51.200> of<00:01:51.320> 0%<00:01:51.799> then<00:01:52.729> move<00:01:52.940> out<00:01:53.060> to

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
with the value of 0% then move out to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.999 
with the value of 0% then move out to
about<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.540> end<00:01:53.720> of<00:01:53.990> our<00:01:54.080> animation<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:54.860> then

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
about the end of our animation and then

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.340 
about the end of our animation and then
set<00:01:55.220> another<00:01:55.310> keyframe<00:01:55.790> for<00:01:56.300> value<00:01:56.690> of<00:01:56.780> 100

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
set another keyframe for value of 100

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.200 
set another keyframe for value of 100
lastly<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.399> want<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.580> take<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.909> opacity

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
lastly you want to take the opacity

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.410 
lastly you want to take the opacity
value<00:01:59.540> and<00:02:00.020> lower<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.380> all<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.560> way<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:00.830> 0%<00:02:01.460> now

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
value and lower it all the way to 0% now

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.210 
value and lower it all the way to 0% now
this<00:02:02.600> essentially<00:02:03.020> sets<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.619> opacity<00:02:03.920> to

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
this essentially sets the opacity to

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.859 
this essentially sets the opacity to
zero<00:02:04.640> for<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.149> letters<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.630> aren't

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
zero for the letters that aren't

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.050 
zero for the letters that aren't
included<00:02:06.409> by<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.590> offset<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.850> when<00:02:07.970> the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
included by the offset so when the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.999 
included by the offset so when the
offset<00:02:08.450> changes<00:02:08.899> then<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.289> letters<00:02:09.560> fade<00:02:09.800> in

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
offset changes then the letters fade in

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.680 
offset changes then the letters fade in
this<00:02:10.550> is<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.759> same<00:02:10.970> way<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.420> scale

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
this is the same way that the scale

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.810 
this is the same way that the scale
animator<00:02:12.110> works<00:02:12.380> as<00:02:12.590> well<00:02:12.800> now<00:02:13.430> keep<00:02:13.640> in<00:02:13.790> mind

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
animator works as well now keep in mind

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.550 
animator works as well now keep in mind
that<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.150> can<00:02:14.420> move<00:02:14.630> around<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.080> adjust<00:02:15.200> the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
that you can move around and adjust the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.500 
that you can move around and adjust the
timing<00:02:15.950> on<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.160> opacity<00:02:16.519> keyframe<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.209> that

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
timing on the opacity keyframe so that

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.150 
timing on the opacity keyframe so that
it<00:02:17.630> works<00:02:17.750> appropriately<00:02:18.500> with<00:02:18.680> your<00:02:18.860> scale

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
it works appropriately with your scale

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.720 
it works appropriately with your scale
timing

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
timing

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.940 
timing
now<00:02:20.300> also<00:02:20.660> feel<00:02:20.930> free<00:02:20.989> to<00:02:21.230> select<00:02:21.380> all<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.709> your

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
now also feel free to select all of your

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.370 
now also feel free to select all of your
keyframes<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:22.730> then<00:02:23.030> press<00:02:23.269> f9<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:24.110> apply

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
keyframes and then press f9 to apply

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.920 
keyframes and then press f9 to apply
easing<00:02:24.860> for<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:25.130> more<00:02:25.310> natural<00:02:25.340> animation<00:02:26.300> now

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
easing for a more natural animation now

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.479 
easing for a more natural animation now
the<00:02:26.989> real<00:02:27.200> benefit<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.739> making<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.130> effect

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
the real benefit of making this effect

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.009 
the real benefit of making this effect
in<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.730> way<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.239> that<00:02:29.300> if<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:29.720> wanted<00:02:29.959> to

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
in this way is that if you wanted to

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.080 
in this way is that if you wanted to
change<00:02:30.290> what<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.650> type<00:02:30.830> says<00:02:31.160> or<00:02:31.459> even<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
change what the type says or even the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.150 
change what the type says or even the
overall<00:02:32.510> scale<00:02:32.870> it's<00:02:33.410> as<00:02:33.530> simple<00:02:33.709> as<00:02:33.950> grabbing

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
overall scale it's as simple as grabbing

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.710 
overall scale it's as simple as grabbing
your<00:02:34.459> type<00:02:34.700> tool<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.120> then<00:02:35.330> making<00:02:35.510> the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
your type tool and then making the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.720 
your type tool and then making the
changes<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.560> effect<00:02:36.860> still<00:02:37.100> works<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.550> same

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
changes the effect still works the same

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.880 
changes the effect still works the same
way<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:38.959> about<00:02:39.140> wraps<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.530> up<00:02:39.620> for<00:02:39.680> this

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
way so that about wraps it up for this

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.910 
way so that about wraps it up for this
