00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
we got another one to give away we did

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.700 
we got another one to give away we did
they<00:01:32.189> are<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.700> Rebecca<00:01:33.090> Minkoff<00:01:33.630> Mac<00:01:34.409> backs

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
they are the Rebecca Minkoff Mac backs

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.039 
they are the Rebecca Minkoff Mac backs
it<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.100> not<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.460> mini<00:01:35.820> Mac<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:36.930> some

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
it is not the mini Mac because for some

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.690 
it is not the mini Mac because for some
reason<00:01:37.079> they<00:01:37.470> never<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:38.009> those<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.369> outlook

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
reason they never do those on outlook

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.850 
reason they never do those on outlook
right<00:01:39.030> probably<00:01:39.689> because<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.140> are<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.439> most

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
right probably because they are the most

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.670 
right probably because they are the most
most<00:01:41.340> popular<00:01:41.970> bags<00:01:42.270> by<00:01:43.110> recommend<00:01:43.530> coffee

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
most popular bags by recommend coffee

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.149 
most popular bags by recommend coffee
but<00:01:43.979> these<00:01:44.430> are<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.970> second<00:01:45.960> best

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
but these are the second best

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.139 
but these are the second best
essentially<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.700> because<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.000> could

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
essentially I like it because you could

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.690 
essentially I like it because you could
fit<00:01:48.270> more<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
fit more in it

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.510 
fit more in it
so<00:01:50.689> this<00:01:50.869> is<00:01:51.020> what<00:01:51.170> they<00:01:51.290> look<00:01:51.470> like<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.100> they

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
so this is what they look like and they

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.429 
so this is what they look like and they
are<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:52.759> chocolate<00:01:53.270> color<00:01:53.450> which<00:01:54.049> I<00:01:54.170> think's

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
are a chocolate color which I think's

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.020 
are a chocolate color which I think's
