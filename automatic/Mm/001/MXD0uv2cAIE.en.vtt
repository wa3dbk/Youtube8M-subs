00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 Yes 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.630
 and so hi to all and all 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.920
 friends his little china have announced 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.940
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.650
 new video 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.200
 in the summary of this video I will 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.590
 show a little pattern that I have 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.110
 realized this weekend that a pattern that 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.090
 which I do not know how 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.470
 serve these people the sahara to make a 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.550
 cinematic of a small town where a 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.650
 small quiet village 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.129
 or if I 'm going to use it to 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.960
 do the next the ten plus it takes 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.379
 see if it depends on how i get to have a 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.830
 do not sacred good inspiration on it but 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.150
 but you're going to see that sends buddies 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.040
 so that's pattern are the following 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.290
 it's a pattern in a style that I 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.570
 would call delphic and other 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.059
 fantastic so let's say it's u 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.650
 el sheikh fantastic the history of ba 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.070
 do not get wet too much 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.510
 and so yes I looked at some pictures 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.610
 on the internet and I noticed that the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.280
 style she did that at least I typed 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.340
 chic and architectural style I found 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.840
 small pictures of houses and all 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.480
 these little pictures of houses and ben he 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.380
 had a roof in the middle that lower than 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.930
 on the edge and overflowing a little I 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.820
 thought it was really nice that I 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.950
 said we will try to redo a 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.530
 little style or genre in minecraft 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.360
 but with two of you because I dared I 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.180
 wanted to put you in my head the 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.150
 single tik there are several roofs finally 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.310
 good brief at the level of the pattern is a 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.660
 pattern with stockings colors 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.180
 relatively natural 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.500
 we are not going to release too few colors 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.510
 eccentric 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.140
 apart from maybe this block that comes 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.480
 remind us of a little magical side to the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.590
 construction not a lot of 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.360
 depth but just that it takes hot 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.940
 that it fits well and no need for more 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.070
 that's because putting more than 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.100
 deep it would have completely eat 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.700
 the interior that I will not do 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.470
 unfortunately but put so here is a 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.459
 aspect a practical point of view one 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.110
 saw the roof the second you roof 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.200
 from above is placed at a certain 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.510
 distance from the roof in the south which in 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.010
 fact justified the fact that here there is a 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.700
 recess 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.250
 completely bizarre but that puts what 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:34.549
 in the end it goes relatively 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.860
 well and that's great so that's it with 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:40.010
 the giant tree that comes to you 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.530
 remember and by cube you have in a 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.430
 elven style I will teach you in 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.200
 next elite world tutorial 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.769
 started at giant trees all 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.440
 just for the biggest ap 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.849
 pleasure of all the names it's not 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.829
 complicated in itself you just have to 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.120
 put so here I hope this 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.950
 video will have pleased you do not hesitate to me 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.019
 leave comments on on these 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.030
 constructions what do you think you 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:11.060
 have your opinion on it and tell me if 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.700
 you prefer to see a milk of oil or 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.379
 cinematic but heard if I have not 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.120
 of inspiration to make a live id 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.609
 you doubt that it will be rather a 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.900
 cinematic beaumont here I hope that 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.489
 this video will no longer be 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.739
 morrow shon on facebook and twitter 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.329
 and so here and leave a 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.859
 comment go to more
