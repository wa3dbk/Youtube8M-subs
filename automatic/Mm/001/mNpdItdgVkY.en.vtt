 Beauty is the directors right there after 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.320
 change of director every problem that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.050
 TV delayed a change and they are 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.950
 deciding there it meets this week to 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.140
 decide how it will happen until the end 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.940
 The movie has already begun to be 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.449
 recorded on her long ago 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.149
 in atlanta and will have to be rearranged 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.989
 change something, of course, of course 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.960
 and the absence who died UOL 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.910
 unfortunately and they do not know until he 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.140
 I was driving but I was at the bank. 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.799
 to a friend coming from an event 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.320
 bountiful 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.869
 unfortunately there are people who do not even know 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.330
 What happened and will I drop my mouth? 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.950
 to say you're stoned to say 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.710
 I was so mean he 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.110
 I was right here I can not judge 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.979
 no one but he was in the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.380
 ride a bouncy show 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.610
 but this will all be outdone the movie 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.329
 will go out and take of the film be beautiful 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.799
 better than all right I will not say that 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.100
 It is better than all that it is not 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.890
 but because they are going to give a gas in 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.500
 A tribute to a deceased person, okay? 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.100
 the team hopes that at the end of the film 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.189
 now a tribute to him, right? 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.920
 his death because he does not deserve to format 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.820
 that has followed in movies since the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.829
 start 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.210
 beauty so the movie is going to be 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.670
 delayed a bit but it will not be 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.040
 canceled second hollywood oil 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.160
 reporter will not be canceled and yes 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.370
 extend a little more recordings but 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.040
 that goes out goes and no other movies 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.860
 happened as guardian 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.469
 it changed at the very end but it is not 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.739
 That's why the movie never left 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:23.959
 if a success is still today, right? 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:28.930
 so it's good folks to stay this infamy 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.930
 You got another arm and I went
