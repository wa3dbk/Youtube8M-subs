no cavalry my archers are better than

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.960 
no cavalry my archers are better than

my<00:03:27.580> infantry<00:03:28.200> now<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.230> mistake<00:03:29.769> that<00:03:29.799> he<00:03:30.040> does

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
my infantry now a mistake that he does

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.050 
my infantry now a mistake that he does
is<00:03:30.549> that<00:03:30.610> he<00:03:30.790> brings<00:03:31.150> his<00:03:31.330> care<00:03:31.660> frags<00:03:31.959> and

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
is that he brings his care frags and

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.240 
is that he brings his care frags and
companions<00:03:34.060> too<00:03:34.239> close<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.600> my<00:03:34.720> archers<00:03:35.250> he

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.360 
companions too close to my archers he
underestimated<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.120> range<00:03:37.930> because<00:03:38.650> i<00:03:38.680> had<00:03:39.069> a

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
underestimated the range because i had a

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.420 
underestimated the range because i had a
hill<00:03:39.910> advantage<00:03:40.420> who<00:03:40.900> noticed<00:03:41.260> that<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:42.250> now

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430
