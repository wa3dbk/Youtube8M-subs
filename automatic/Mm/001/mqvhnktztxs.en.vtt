00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.370
 what's up, youtube people, I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:10.660
 how to connect your playstation 4 controller 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.519
 to the playstation3 console is connected 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.879
 first thing we have to do is have 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.650
 three essential things clear its accuracy 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.410
 3 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.810
 your command of your command on 25 4 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.970
 and the clear cable if they have their 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.700
 console price 4 would also serve as 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.099
 the same command that now that I have is the 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.250
 precise in 3 and the playstation 4 that what 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.430
 I have in the room 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.520
 because I do not want to because they can not go two 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.950
 consoles here in my room because brands 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.870
 of space how to govern plus the room 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.870
 not reach more space but not 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.310
 here as we see already I put bayern filtres 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.560
 but what can I tell you that no 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.050
 will work wirelessly 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.280
 correctly the share button is that 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:05.690
 select button options be this that is 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.610
 here that this here so tactile is not going to 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.610
 work just like the home button 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.320
 it does not work you have to bet and take out 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.890
 the disk so that it's like it comes out 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.659
 everything works well that does not work either 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.430
 the hearing aids hearing aids not 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.680
 it works and has tried with some of 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.920
 sony same 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.530
 and everything else is strongly and we are going to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.299
 do the test let's put 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.299
 here as we see 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.850
 there is checking data 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.280
 there we are going to put you in multiplayer 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.850
 let's see 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.850
 x 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.950
 x 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.840
 she did not put on this charge 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:02.200
 we are going to put in fast game 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.439
 look for departure and looking for the house is 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.439
 hard 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.990
 I think it's hard for you to play with a job 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.540
 with one hand but I like this command 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.080
 now to play with this on playstation 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.870
 3 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.080
 4 what I also have to say that 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.730
 you need your trick adding spices in 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:33.709
 three to put the home button 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:36.230
 everything else is not the same almost what 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.370
 same 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.599
 4 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.599
 let's put it there 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.640
 we see it works with this point 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.100
 with this corro 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.700
 They killed me 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.180
 because it's very difficult to walk but we're going to 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.180
 see if I can 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.790
 if I can give 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.790
 well let's see if I can give one 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.940
 9 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.819
 there are some powers because I can not 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.569
 turn fed ai ai ai 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.569
 low 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.650
 I can not 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.660
 but good as you can to see 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.060
 that you can put the payment you will see 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.080
 how he puts you so they can see good there 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.460
 is so you can see 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.460
 let's see the example 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.340
 and the whole class that the camera does not have 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.340
 Market Stall 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.000
 as we see everything works correctly 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.419
 to this project 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.579
 let's do it again 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.430
 good 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.430
 test if it works correctly 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:53.659
 what does not work is the home button and 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:58.180
 all this I think the button does not work 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:05:00.460
 home of the headphones and the touchpad 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.590
 everything else works correctly and good 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.259
