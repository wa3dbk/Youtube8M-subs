00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.649 

this<00:00:57.219> morning<00:00:57.640> we<00:00:57.730> went<00:00:57.850> in<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.059> air<00:00:58.210> four

the<00:01:03.760> view<00:01:04.030> was<00:01:04.269> spectacular<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.830> really

because<00:01:07.750> balloons<00:01:08.170> navigate<00:01:08.619> purely<00:01:09.130> by<00:01:09.280> wind

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
because balloons navigate purely by wind

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.149 
because balloons navigate purely by wind
direction<00:01:09.850> so<00:01:10.539> he<00:01:11.110> rises<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:11.890> falls

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
direction so he rises and falls

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.130 
direction so he rises and falls
searching<00:01:13.090> for<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.450> different<00:01:13.960> wind

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
searching for the different wind

searching for the different wind
currents<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.590> take<00:01:14.799> them<00:01:14.979> into<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.280> direction

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
currents to take them into the direction

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.950 
currents to take them into the direction
they<00:01:15.759> want<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.000> go<00:01:17.700> we're<00:01:18.700> going<00:01:18.970> right<00:01:19.270> over<00:01:19.479> a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
they want to go we're going right over a

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.469 
they want to go we're going right over a
balloon<00:01:20.409> and<00:01:20.920> we've<00:01:21.100> got<00:01:21.460> some<00:01:21.820> entertainment
