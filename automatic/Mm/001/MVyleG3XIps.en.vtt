healthy storm out there and of course we

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.029 
healthy storm out there and of course we
got<00:02:07.210> our<00:02:07.330> tropical<00:02:07.600> depression<00:02:08.380> which<00:02:08.860> is

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
got our tropical depression which is

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.290 
got our tropical depression which is
pretty<00:02:09.190> much<00:02:09.310> weakening<00:02:09.880> tropical

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
the east of cific we don't have much to

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.500 
the east of cific we don't have much to
watch<00:03:05.950> here<00:03:06.310> we're<00:03:06.790> taking<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.150> very<00:03:07.299> close

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
watch here we're taking a very close

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.449 
watch here we're taking a very close
look<00:03:07.600> at<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.019> couple<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.530> possible<00:03:09.220> tropical

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
look at a couple of possible tropical

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.509 
look at a couple of possible tropical
waves<00:03:09.970> out<00:03:10.630> here<00:03:10.690> which<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.739> does<00:03:11.980> show<00:03:12.220> there

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
waves out here which it does show there

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.240 
waves out here which it does show there
is<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.730> ten<00:03:13.060> percent<00:03:13.209> chance<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:14.110> showers<00:03:15.100> and

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
is a ten percent chance that showers and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.289 
is a ten percent chance that showers and
thunderstorms<00:03:15.670> opportunities<00:03:16.150> will

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
thunderstorms opportunities will

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.050 
thunderstorms opportunities will
continue<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:17.410> increase<00:03:17.829> in<00:03:18.250> size<00:03:18.459> but<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.910> does

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
continue to increase in size but it does

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.210 
continue to increase in size but it does
