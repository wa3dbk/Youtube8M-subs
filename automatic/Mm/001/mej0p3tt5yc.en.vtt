you're going to take a quarter of an
inch<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.040> I<00:00:53.219> use<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.730> size<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.239> just

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
inch and I use this size it's just

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
inch and I use this size it's just
easier<00:00:54.840> than<00:00:55.020> trying<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> quarter<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.950> an

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
easier than trying to do a quarter of an

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.799 
easier than trying to do a quarter of an
inch<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> next<00:00:56.640> side<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.059> quarter<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.690> an

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
inch on the next side so quarter of an

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.750 
inch on the next side so quarter of an
inch<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.120> you're<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.540> bone<00:01:00.960> fold<00:01:01.760> down

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
inch and you're going to bone fold down

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.569 
inch and you're going to bone fold down
to<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.629> other<00:01:03.780> bone<00:01:04.289> folder<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
to the other bone folder going to that

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.580 
to the other bone folder going to that
halfway<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.200> side<00:01:07.259> you're

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
halfway and then on this side you're

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.490 
halfway and then on this side you're
going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.770> cut<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.850> line<00:01:09.060> okay<00:01:09.719> so<00:01:10.440> you

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
going to cut up to that line okay so you

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.460 
going to cut up to that line okay so you
cut<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.310> then<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> bone<00:01:12.060> folding<00:01:12.570> now<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
cut and then you bone folding now you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.630 
cut and then you bone folding now you
need<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> same<00:01:14.100> thing<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> other

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
need to do the same thing on the other

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.810 
need to do the same thing on the other
side<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.080> we've<00:01:16.260> cut<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.130> side<00:01:17.460> we

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
side so if we've cut on this side we

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
side so if we've cut on this side we
have<00:01:17.940> to<00:01:18.060> cut<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.659> here<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:20.520> then<00:01:21.500> we<00:01:22.500> bone

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
have to cut up here and then we bone

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.789 
have to cut up here and then we bone
fold<00:01:23.689> down<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
fold down here so what you have is to

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.679 
fold down here so what you have is to
cut<00:01:29.040> pieces<00:01:29.250> at<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.580> top<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.090> two<00:01:30.240> folded

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
cut pieces at the top and two folded

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.810 
cut pieces at the top and two folded
pieces<00:01:30.900> at<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.260> bottom<00:01:31.460> now<00:01:32.460> I'm<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.729> going

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
pieces at the bottom now I'm just going

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910 
pieces at the bottom now I'm just going
to<00:01:33.030> snip<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:33.540> I'll<00:01:33.630> show<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.710> kind

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920
