dying at a faster and faster rate and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.740 
dying at a faster and faster rate and
this<00:02:47.370> has<00:02:47.580> been<00:02:47.760> brought<00:02:47.970> up<00:02:48.150> once<00:02:48.390> before<00:02:48.570> I

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
this has been brought up once before I

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.440 
this has been brought up once before I
think<00:02:48.900> on<00:02:49.200> Episode<00:02:49.740> three<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.550> with<00:02:51.300> this

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
think on Episode three and with this

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.300 
think on Episode three and with this
episode<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.050> once<00:02:52.260> again<00:02:52.320> brought<00:02:52.680> up<00:02:52.950> that

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
episode it's once again brought up that

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.430 
episode it's once again brought up that
there's<00:02:53.670> other<00:02:53.880> sections<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:55.200> facility

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
there's other sections of this facility

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.030 
there's other sections of this facility
that<00:02:56.100> are<00:02:56.970> experiencing<00:02:57.840> major<00:02:58.470> issues

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that are experiencing major issues

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.770 
that are experiencing major issues
because<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.730> death<00:02:59.940> rate<00:03:00.210> of<00:03:00.390> human

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
because of the death rate of human

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.810 
because of the death rate of human
beings<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.950> feel<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.490> is<00:03:02.640> one<00:03:02.790> of

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
beings and I feel like this is one of

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.880 
beings and I feel like this is one of
the<00:03:02.970> main<00:03:03.180> issues<00:03:03.480> when<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.020> comes<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.590> death

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
the main issues when it comes to death

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.450 
the main issues when it comes to death
parade<00:03:05.250> because<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.660> actual<00:03:07.260> workload<00:03:08.160> on

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
parade because the actual workload on

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.460 
parade because the actual workload on
the<00:03:08.820> arbiters<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.660> other<00:03:09.870> people<00:03:10.350> are

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
the arbiters and other people are

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.320 
the arbiters and other people are
getting<00:03:10.710> more<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:10.920> more<00:03:11.310> ridiculous<00:03:11.850> as<00:03:12.120> time

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
getting more and more ridiculous as time

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.930 
getting more and more ridiculous as time
goes<00:03:12.630> on<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.770> really<00:03:14.160> just<00:03:14.340> goes<00:03:14.790> to

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
goes on and this really just goes to

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.610 
goes on and this really just goes to
show<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.270> different<00:03:15.630> perspective<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:16.320> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
show you a different perspective of the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.800 
show you a different perspective of the
series<00:03:17.010> because<00:03:17.670> they<00:03:18.090> stated<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.660> this

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
series because they stated in this

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.450 
series because they stated in this
episode<00:03:19.290> there's<00:03:19.470> about<00:03:19.680> two<00:03:19.860> people<00:03:20.100> dying

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
episode there's about two people dying

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.480 
episode there's about two people dying
per<00:03:20.730> second<00:03:21.380> 7,000<00:03:22.380> something<00:03:22.740> an<00:03:22.830> hour<00:03:23.070> and

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
per second 7,000 something an hour and

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.460 
per second 7,000 something an hour and
that's<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.820> ridiculous<00:03:24.570> amount<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.900> deaths<00:03:25.230> in

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
that's a ridiculous amount of deaths in

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.310 
that's a ridiculous amount of deaths in
just<00:03:25.530> an<00:03:25.860> hour<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.420> we<00:03:27.420> see<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.630> perspective<00:03:27.930> on

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
just an hour and we see a perspective on

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.630 
just an hour and we see a perspective on
one<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.530> these<00:03:28.650> fellow<00:03:28.890> workers<00:03:29.340> that

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
one of these fellow workers that

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.370 
one of these fellow workers that
actually<00:03:30.120> look<00:03:30.360> like<00:03:30.390> they're<00:03:30.630> in<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.870> factory

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
actually look like they're in a factory

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.420 
actually look like they're in a factory
like<00:03:31.530> they're<00:03:31.710> sorting<00:03:32.280> through

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
like they're sorting through

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.760 
like they're sorting through
crystallized<00:03:33.060> human<00:03:33.600> memories<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.320> wrapping

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
crystallized human memories and wrapping

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.440 
crystallized human memories and wrapping
a<00:03:34.860> sort<00:03:35.130> for<00:03:35.280> all<00:03:35.400> these<00:03:35.580> dead<00:03:35.760> people<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.390> you

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
a sort for all these dead people and you

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.790 
a sort for all these dead people and you
just<00:03:36.600> see<00:03:36.720> how<00:03:36.810> they<00:03:36.960> come<00:03:37.170> down<00:03:37.350> these<00:03:37.500> tubes

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
just see how they come down these tubes

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
just see how they come down these tubes
as<00:03:38.100> if<00:03:38.460> it<00:03:38.580> was<00:03:38.730> like<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.910> factory<00:03:39.570> so<00:03:40.670> what<00:03:41.670> we

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
as if it was like a factory so what we

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.290 
as if it was like a factory so what we
see<00:03:42.060> here<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.710> that<00:03:43.710> we<00:03:44.520> have<00:03:44.700> toward<00:03:45.030> Hakeem

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
see here is that we have toward Hakeem

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.900 
see here is that we have toward Hakeem
is<00:03:45.480> kind<00:03:45.720> of<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.930> an<00:03:46.050> experiment<00:03:46.620> like<00:03:47.430> right

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
is kind of like an experiment like right

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.090 
is kind of like an experiment like right
now<00:03:48.090> he's<00:03:48.450> been<00:03:48.630> given<00:03:48.900> human<00:03:49.050> emotions<00:03:49.800> as<00:03:49.950> we

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
now he's been given human emotions as we

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.520 
now he's been given human emotions as we
could<00:03:50.250> see<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:50.900> he's<00:03:51.900> actually<00:03:52.260> being

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
could see and he's actually being

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.320 
could see and he's actually being
experimented<00:03:53.070> on<00:03:53.160> as<00:03:53.370> an<00:03:53.490> experimental

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
experimented on as an experimental

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.320 
experimented on as an experimental
judgment<00:03:55.290> device<00:03:55.560> because<00:03:56.550> they<00:03:57.060> need<00:03:57.240> to

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
judgment device because they need to

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.180 
judgment device because they need to
find<00:03:57.540> new<00:03:57.750> forms<00:03:58.020> of<00:03:58.320> judgement<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:58.980> be<00:03:59.070> able

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
find new forms of judgement to be able

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.880 
find new forms of judgement to be able
to<00:03:59.430> speed<00:03:59.940> up<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.300> process<00:04:01.020> of<00:04:01.260> judging

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
to speed up the process of judging

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.880 
to speed up the process of judging
someone<00:04:02.490> else<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.630> is<00:04:03.750> clearly<00:04:04.410> what<00:04:04.740> is

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
someone else and that is clearly what is

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.140 
someone else and that is clearly what is
going<00:04:05.130> on<00:04:05.280> with<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.490> Keane<00:04:05.670> like<00:04:05.910> you<00:04:06.060> know

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
going on with the Keane like you know

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.420 
going on with the Keane like you know
Nona<00:04:06.480> she's<00:04:07.050> experimenting<00:04:07.560> with<00:04:07.830> arbiters

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
Nona she's experimenting with arbiters

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.790 
Nona she's experimenting with arbiters
it<00:04:08.670> clearly<00:04:09.210> experimented<00:04:10.080> with<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.590> kiemce

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
it clearly experimented with the kiemce

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.250 
it clearly experimented with the kiemce
to<00:04:11.370> be<00:04:11.490> able<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:11.760> discover<00:04:12.120> quicker<00:04:12.810> ways<00:04:13.050> to

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
to be able to discover quicker ways to

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.110 
to be able to discover quicker ways to
judge<00:04:13.530> also<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.310> know<00:04:14.460> better<00:04:14.670> forms<00:04:15.030> a

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
judge also you know better forms a

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.630 
judge also you know better forms a
judgement<00:04:15.660> stuff<00:04:15.900> like<00:04:16.170> that<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.710> so<00:04:17.280> the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
judgement stuff like that and so the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.640 
judgement stuff like that and so the
main<00:04:17.850> plot<00:04:18.480> you<00:04:18.750> can<00:04:18.900> get<00:04:19.080> from<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.380> series

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
main plot you can get from the series

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.410 
main plot you can get from the series
besides<00:04:19.980> two<00:04:20.130> kiemce<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.640> you<00:04:21.030> know<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.239> main

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
besides two kiemce and you know the main

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.180 
besides two kiemce and you know the main
female<00:04:21.660> character<00:04:22.290> you<00:04:22.740> have<00:04:22.919> it's<00:04:23.070> where

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
female character you have it's where

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.980 
female character you have it's where
people<00:04:23.610> are<00:04:23.700> dying<00:04:23.850> way<00:04:24.180> too<00:04:24.240> fast<00:04:24.690> and

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
people are dying way too fast and

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.940 
people are dying way too fast and
they're<00:04:25.169> trying<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.440> figure<00:04:25.650> out<00:04:25.680> ways<00:04:25.890> that

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
they're trying to figure out ways that

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.820 
they're trying to figure out ways that
they<00:04:26.460> can

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
they can

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.890 
they can
settle<00:04:27.220> all<00:04:27.460> these<00:04:27.909> deaths<00:04:28.120> in<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.419> timely

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
settle all these deaths in a timely

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.830 
settle all these deaths in a timely
manner<00:04:29.199> and<00:04:29.669> I<00:04:30.669> at<00:04:31.000> first<00:04:31.270> I<00:04:31.449> was<00:04:31.539> thinking

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
manner and I at first I was thinking

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.050 
manner and I at first I was thinking
like<00:04:31.990> this<00:04:32.199> in<00:04:32.439> this<00:04:32.650> episode<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.250> was<00:04:33.400> like<00:04:33.520> so

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
like this in this episode I was like so

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.999 
like this in this episode I was like so
they<00:04:34.419> all<00:04:34.689> arbiters<00:04:35.289> and<00:04:35.439> everybody<00:04:35.800> that

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
they all arbiters and everybody that

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.920 
they all arbiters and everybody that
works<00:04:36.189> in<00:04:36.370> this<00:04:36.580> tower<00:04:36.849> as<00:04:37.120> we<00:04:37.300> find<00:04:37.539> out<00:04:37.689> our

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
works in this tower as we find out our

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.939 
works in this tower as we find out our
guns<00:04:38.530> they<00:04:39.069> are<00:04:39.460> but<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.629> thing<00:04:40.840> was<00:04:41.139> like<00:04:41.680> why

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
guns they are but the thing was like why

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.670 
guns they are but the thing was like why
don't<00:04:42.250> they<00:04:42.490> make<00:04:42.699> more<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.180> mean<00:04:43.569> if<00:04:43.780> it's<00:04:44.259> kind

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
don't they make more I mean if it's kind

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.230 
don't they make more I mean if it's kind
of<00:04:44.770> turning<00:04:45.039> into<00:04:45.189> a<00:04:45.370> factory<00:04:45.819> which<00:04:46.060> it

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
of turning into a factory which it

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.850 
of turning into a factory which it
really<00:04:46.599> is<00:04:46.689> we<00:04:46.840> got<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.050> see<00:04:47.199> an<00:04:47.319> example<00:04:47.620> of

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
really is we got to see an example of

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.559 
really is we got to see an example of
that<00:04:47.979> why<00:04:48.789> don't<00:04:49.000> they<00:04:49.090> just<00:04:49.120> make<00:04:49.419> more

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
that why don't they just make more

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.540 
that why don't they just make more
dummies<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.379> think<00:04:50.919> that's<00:04:51.099> one<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.340> main

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
dummies I think that's one of the main

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.159 
dummies I think that's one of the main
issues<00:04:52.120> that<00:04:52.330> this<00:04:52.419> series<00:04:52.689> is<00:04:52.810> trying<00:04:52.960> to

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
issues that this series is trying to

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.950 
issues that this series is trying to
tackle<00:04:53.439> Nona<00:04:54.310> doesn't<00:04:55.120> like<00:04:55.449> that<00:04:55.719> she

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
tackle Nona doesn't like that she

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.360 
tackle Nona doesn't like that she
doesn't<00:04:56.139> like<00:04:56.379> how<00:04:56.620> everybody's<00:04:57.129> turning

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
doesn't like how everybody's turning

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.830 
doesn't like how everybody's turning
into<00:04:57.550> like<00:04:57.789> a<00:04:57.819> machine<00:04:58.270> just<00:04:58.300> you<00:04:58.750> know

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
into like a machine just you know

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.320 
into like a machine just you know
judging<00:04:59.440> people<00:05:00.039> moving<00:05:00.340> on<00:05:00.729> is<00:05:01.030> that<00:05:01.150> they're

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
judging people moving on is that they're

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.300 
judging people moving on is that they're
a<00:05:01.360> robot<00:05:01.870> and<00:05:02.169> that's<00:05:02.620> clearly<00:05:02.889> what<00:05:03.190> is

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
a robot and that's clearly what is

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.580 
a robot and that's clearly what is
plaguing<00:05:03.669> Nona's<00:05:04.330> mind<00:05:04.569> in<00:05:04.900> this<00:05:05.110> episode<00:05:05.500> and

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
plaguing Nona's mind in this episode and

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.320 
plaguing Nona's mind in this episode and
probably<00:05:05.919> this<00:05:06.039> series<00:05:06.430> because<00:05:06.909> she<00:05:07.030> doesn't

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
probably this series because she doesn't

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.029 
probably this series because she doesn't
like<00:05:07.479> the<00:05:07.629> way<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:07.930> judgments<00:05:08.409> are<00:05:08.500> set<00:05:08.800> up

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
like the way the judgments are set up

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.040 
like the way the judgments are set up
and<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.759> way<00:05:09.789> it's<00:05:10.090> been<00:05:10.270> handled<00:05:10.300> because

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
and the way it's been handled because

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.209 
and the way it's been handled because
it's<00:05:11.199> just<00:05:11.319> turning<00:05:11.530> into<00:05:11.680> a<00:05:11.830> freaking

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
it's just turning into a freaking

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:13.830 
it's just turning into a freaking
Factory<00:05:12.759> and<00:05:12.879> you<00:05:12.969> know<00:05:13.120> you're<00:05:13.479> looking<00:05:13.780> at

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
Factory and you know you're looking at

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.939 
Factory and you know you're looking at
everything<00:05:13.960> you're<00:05:14.289> not<00:05:14.379> really<00:05:14.680> giving<00:05:14.889> the

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
everything you're not really giving the

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.249 
everything you're not really giving the
proper<00:05:15.310> judgement<00:05:15.789> on<00:05:15.909> each<00:05:16.180> individual<00:05:17.080> and

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
proper judgement on each individual and

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.619 
proper judgement on each individual and
every<00:05:17.800> individual<00:05:18.340> should<00:05:18.400> probably<00:05:18.789> be<00:05:19.090> you

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:19.629 
every individual should probably be you

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:20.820 
every individual should probably be you
know<00:05:19.659> different<00:05:20.169> like<00:05:20.199> you<00:05:20.379> should<00:05:20.529> handle

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
know different like you should handle

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.140 
know different like you should handle
the<00:05:20.949> situation<00:05:21.430> with<00:05:21.520> each<00:05:21.669> individual

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
the situation with each individual

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.019 
the situation with each individual
person<00:05:22.509> differently<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:23.229> on<00:05:23.979> top<00:05:24.490> of<00:05:24.819> that

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:25.029 
person differently and on top of that

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:28.200 
person differently and on top of that
Nona<00:05:25.330> also<00:05:25.840> states<00:05:26.199> that<00:05:26.560> how<00:05:27.279> can<00:05:27.550> we<00:05:27.729> judge

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
Nona also states that how can we judge

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.450 
Nona also states that how can we judge
people<00:05:28.240> if<00:05:29.199> we<00:05:29.500> have<00:05:29.740> never<00:05:29.949> experienced

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
people if we have never experienced

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.610 
people if we have never experienced
death<00:05:30.699> ourselves<00:05:31.419> and<00:05:31.599> we<00:05:31.719> cannot<00:05:32.020> understand

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
death ourselves and we cannot understand

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.040 
death ourselves and we cannot understand
human<00:05:32.979> emotions<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:33.759> that<00:05:34.150> brings<00:05:34.449> up<00:05:34.629> a<00:05:34.750> very

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
human emotions and that brings up a very

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.730 
human emotions and that brings up a very
very<00:05:35.440> good<00:05:35.710> topic<00:05:36.129> I<00:05:36.520> mean<00:05:37.000> in<00:05:37.529> society<00:05:38.529> in

very good topic I mean in society in

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.369 
very good topic I mean in society in
real<00:05:38.979> life<00:05:39.310> you<00:05:40.029> can't<00:05:40.360> really<00:05:40.750> understand

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:41.379 
real life you can't really understand

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:43.980

yourself and that that's true that is
very<00:05:49.029> very<00:05:49.330> true<00:05:49.569> you<00:05:49.719> cannot<00:05:49.990> understand

and<00:05:52.960> that<00:05:53.710> can<00:05:53.889> be<00:05:54.009> said<00:05:54.339> to<00:05:54.370> what<00:05:54.729> Nona<00:05:55.060> stated

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
and that can be said to what Nona stated

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.680 
and that can be said to what Nona stated
in<00:05:55.719> this<00:05:55.839> episode<00:05:56.349> why<00:05:56.919> can<00:05:57.490> us<00:05:57.759> orbiters

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
in this episode why can us orbiters

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.240 
in this episode why can us orbiters
judge<00:05:59.080> people<00:05:59.560> but<00:05:59.889> we<00:06:00.039> have<00:06:00.129> never

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
judge people but we have never

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.589 
judge people but we have never
experienced<00:06:00.819> def<00:06:00.969> and<00:06:01.240> we<00:06:01.300> don't<00:06:01.479> know

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
experienced def and we don't know

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.769 
experienced def and we don't know
emotions<00:06:02.199> and<00:06:02.879> yeah<00:06:03.879> it<00:06:04.150> kind<00:06:04.449> of<00:06:04.509> seems<00:06:04.719> like

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:04.779 
emotions and yeah it kind of seems like

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:07.529 
emotions and yeah it kind of seems like
it's<00:06:04.960> an<00:06:05.020> unjust<00:06:05.589> judgment<00:06:06.159> since<00:06:06.430> they<00:06:06.940> can't

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
it's an unjust judgment since they can't

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.659 
it's an unjust judgment since they can't
understand<00:06:08.229> what<00:06:08.469> everybody<00:06:08.889> else<00:06:09.129> has<00:06:09.400> been

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
understand what everybody else has been

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.240 
understand what everybody else has been
through<00:06:09.839> so<00:06:10.839> it's<00:06:11.169> a<00:06:11.259> really<00:06:11.740> cool<00:06:11.979> episode

like that I like how this episode shoots

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.040 
like that I like how this episode shoots
a<00:06:24.789> little<00:06:25.000> bit<00:06:25.120> of<00:06:25.180> backstory<00:06:25.509> stuff<00:06:25.870> like

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050

a little bit of backstory stuff like
that<00:06:26.229> and<00:06:26.409> the<00:06:26.469> majority<00:06:26.770> of<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:26.889> episode<00:06:27.310> was

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
that and the majority of the episode was

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.640 
that and the majority of the episode was
flopping<00:06:28.029> back<00:06:28.060> and<00:06:28.449> forth<00:06:28.750> between<00:06:29.229> a

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
flopping back and forth between a

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.980 
flopping back and forth between a
flashback<00:06:30.370> with<00:06:30.550> Queen<00:06:30.789> and<00:06:31.210> you<00:06:31.659> know<00:06:31.690> the

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
flashback with Queen and you know the

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.659 
flashback with Queen and you know the
present-day<00:06:32.440> wood<00:06:32.770> Hakeem<00:06:33.069> and<00:06:33.279> showing<00:06:33.580> his

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:37.149 
the mannequins and stuff like that so

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:39.690 
the mannequins and stuff like that so
yeah<00:06:37.750> a<00:06:37.899> very<00:06:38.169> simplistic<00:06:38.979> episode

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
yeah a very simplistic episode

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.460 
yeah a very simplistic episode
some<00:06:39.940> deep<00:06:40.120> meaning<00:06:40.150> if<00:06:40.690> you<00:06:40.810> look<00:06:41.020> at<00:06:41.140> it<00:06:41.290> deep

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
some deep meaning if you look at it deep

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.830 
some deep meaning if you look at it deep
enough<00:06:41.770> but<00:06:42.010> that's<00:06:42.820> pretty<00:06:43.180> much<00:06:43.390> it<00:06:43.630> when<00:06:43.750> it

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
enough but that's pretty much it when it

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.050 
enough but that's pretty much it when it
comes<00:06:44.050> to<00:06:44.200> this<00:06:44.350> episode<00:06:44.740> of<00:06:45.040> Def<00:06:45.520> rates<00:06:45.880> so

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
comes to this episode of Def rates so

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.300 
comes to this episode of Def rates so
