know why they didn't have a lot of
opening<00:01:50.159> doors<00:01:50.310> whether<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.909> was<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> safety

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
opening doors whether it was a safety

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.090 
opening doors whether it was a safety
thing<00:01:51.899> or<00:01:52.229> whether<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.619> was<00:01:52.710> an<00:01:52.829> international

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
thing or whether it's just the way a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.230 
thing or whether it's just the way a
cost<00:01:55.439> goes<00:01:55.829> with<00:01:56.130> these<00:01:56.310> they<00:01:56.610> put<00:01:56.820> their<00:01:57.000> cost

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
cost goes with these they put their cost

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.289 
cost goes with these they put their cost
into<00:01:57.570> other<00:01:57.689> things<00:01:58.189> but<00:01:59.189> these<00:01:59.939> are<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> only

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
into other things but these are the only

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.789 
into other things but these are the only
three<00:02:00.750> castings<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:02.520> had<00:02:03.530> opening<00:02:04.530> doors

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
three castings that had opening doors

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.399 
three castings that had opening doors
now<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> little<00:02:05.610> bit<00:02:06.119> about<00:02:06.360> each<00:02:06.420> casting<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
now a little bit about each casting the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.469 
now a little bit about each casting the
the<00:02:07.710> 4x4<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.580> run<00:02:08.789> into<00:02:09.119> quite<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> bit

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the 4x4 is I run into quite a bit

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.410 
the 4x4 is I run into quite a bit
there's<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.989> lot<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.890> variations<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.910> these

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
there's a lot of variations of these

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.580 
there's a lot of variations of these
a<00:02:12.480> whole<00:02:12.840> lot<00:02:13.190> if<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.370> remember<00:02:14.849> right<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
a whole lot if I remember right and the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.190 
a whole lot if I remember right and the
ex<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.280> not<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.880> many<00:02:18.060> there<00:02:18.390> are<00:02:18.540> some<00:02:18.840> others

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
ex is not so many there are some others

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.300 
ex is not so many there are some others
besides<00:02:19.739> these<00:02:20.040> two<00:02:21.410> I'm<00:02:22.410> totally<00:02:22.890> guessing

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
besides these two I'm totally guessing

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.070 
besides these two I'm totally guessing
but<00:02:23.700> I'm<00:02:23.819> gonna<00:02:23.910> say<00:02:24.120> there's<00:02:24.300> less<00:02:24.510> than<00:02:24.540> ten

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
but I'm gonna say there's less than ten

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.680 
but I'm gonna say there's less than ten
casting<00:02:25.770> or<00:02:26.040> ten<00:02:26.370> variations<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.390> this

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
casting or ten variations on this

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.600 
casting or ten variations on this
casting<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:30.450> guy<00:02:30.770> which<00:02:31.770> if<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.100> remember

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
casting and this guy which if I remember

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.979 
casting and this guy which if I remember
this<00:02:32.730> car<00:02:33.060> correctly<00:02:33.540> was<00:02:33.780> not<00:02:33.959> a

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
this car correctly was not a

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.220 
this car correctly was not a
particularly<00:02:35.090> well-liked<00:02:36.090> car<00:02:36.569> when<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.020> came

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
particularly well-liked car when it came

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.390 
particularly well-liked car when it came
out<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.560> think<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.250> came<00:02:38.550> out<00:02:38.580> during<00:02:39.170> Fords

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
out I think this came out during Fords

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
some reason we just kind of keep hitting

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.550 
some reason we just kind of keep hitting
right<00:03:07.620> around<00:03:07.920> those<00:03:08.569> late<00:03:09.569> ninety<00:03:10.080> models

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
lines that were out into Hot Wheels so

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.319 
lines that were out into Hot Wheels so
for<00:03:30.750> instance<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.230> auto<00:03:31.440> hauler<00:03:31.829> series<00:03:32.430> was

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
for instance the auto hauler series was

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.460 
for instance the auto hauler series was
a<00:03:33.359> Corgi<00:03:33.930> series<00:03:34.410> when<00:03:35.100> Mattel<00:03:35.519> bought

hauler series over to Hot Wheels so it's

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.390 
hauler series over to Hot Wheels so it's
a<00:03:45.480> little<00:03:45.600> confusing<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.470> I'm<00:03:46.829> trying<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.220> put

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
a little confusing and I'm trying to put

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.240 
a little confusing and I'm trying to put
together<00:03:47.519> enough<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.329> these<00:03:48.510> Corgi<00:03:49.079> cars<00:03:49.350> to

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
together enough of these Corgi cars to

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.160 
together enough of these Corgi cars to
do<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.430> video<00:03:50.760> on<00:03:50.910> them<00:03:51.209> but<00:03:51.420> I'm<00:03:51.540> still<00:03:51.840> trying

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.020 
do a video on them but I'm still trying
to<00:03:52.230> figure<00:03:52.500> out<00:03:52.709> exactly<00:03:53.130> which<00:03:53.340> cars<00:03:53.730> they

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030

I've got a bunch of questions for you
but<00:04:01.650> yes<00:04:01.920> this<00:04:02.220> one<00:04:02.459> is<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.970> originally<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> Corgi

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
but yes this one is a originally a Corgi

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.670 
but yes this one is a originally a Corgi
casting<00:04:04.829> that<00:04:05.069> became<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.959> Hot<00:04:06.959> Wheels<00:04:07.260> casting

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
casting that became a Hot Wheels casting

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.199 
casting that became a Hot Wheels casting
and<00:04:07.769> it's<00:04:07.859> very<00:04:08.010> possible<00:04:08.609> that<00:04:08.670> there<00:04:09.030> are

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
and it's very possible that there are

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.910 
and it's very possible that there are
some<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:09.660> these<00:04:09.750> Ford<00:04:10.139> Sierra's<00:04:10.560> out<00:04:10.709> there

that have a Corgi base and that this

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.710 
that have a Corgi base and that this
particular<00:04:14.040> model<00:04:14.639> goes<00:04:15.060> back<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.359> little<00:04:15.569> bit

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
particular model goes back a little bit

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.170 
particular model goes back a little bit
further<00:04:16.079> on<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.380> Corgi<00:04:16.799> line<00:04:17.039> but<00:04:17.789> I<00:04:17.820> really

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
further on the Corgi line but I really

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.819 
further on the Corgi line but I really
don't<00:04:18.359> know<00:04:18.510> too<00:04:18.570> much<00:04:18.840> about<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.200> Corgi<00:04:19.590> cars

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
don't know too much about the Corgi cars

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.130 
don't know too much about the Corgi cars
you'll<00:04:20.669> also<00:04:20.849> notice<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.659> Hot<00:04:21.870> Wheel

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
you'll also notice that the Hot Wheel

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.750 
you'll also notice that the Hot Wheel
doors<00:04:22.530> when<00:04:23.370> they<00:04:23.400> open<00:04:24.380> open<00:04:25.380> very<00:04:25.740> close<00:04:26.310> to

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
doors when they open open very close to

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.980 
doors when they open open very close to
the<00:04:26.970> car<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.599> are<00:04:28.530> pretty<00:04:28.830> smooth<00:04:29.659> where<00:04:30.659> the

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
the car and are pretty smooth where the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.240 
the car and are pretty smooth where the
Corgi<00:04:31.590> car<00:04:31.890> doors<00:04:32.300> really<00:04:33.300> swing<00:04:34.140> out<00:04:34.349> it's

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
Corgi car doors really swing out it's

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.589 
Corgi car doors really swing out it's
gonna<00:04:35.370> be<00:04:35.460> hard<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.820> get<00:04:35.940> out<00:04:36.120> in<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.300> parking

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
gonna be hard to get out in the parking

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.360 
gonna be hard to get out in the parking
lot<00:04:36.750> with<00:04:36.930> those<00:04:37.050> doors<00:04:37.349> I<00:04:37.740> don't<00:04:38.190> think

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
lot with those doors I don't think

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.100 
lot with those doors I don't think
that's<00:04:38.580> how<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.789> Ford<00:04:39.210> Sierra<00:04:39.450> doors<00:04:39.810> work

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
that's how the Ford Sierra doors work

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.920 
that's how the Ford Sierra doors work
that's<00:04:40.409> just<00:04:40.680> how<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.599> mechanics<00:04:42.599> of<00:04:42.750> the

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
that's just how the mechanics of the

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.200 
that's just how the mechanics of the
Corgi<00:04:43.320> car<00:04:43.530> works<00:04:43.740> and<00:04:43.950> they<00:04:44.099> do<00:04:44.159> not<00:04:44.460> close

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
Corgi car works and they do not close

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.040 
Corgi car works and they do not close
quite<00:04:45.510> as<00:04:45.630> easily<00:04:45.810> so<00:04:46.880> yeah<00:04:47.880> pretty<00:04:48.240> neat<00:04:48.510> the

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
quite as easily so yeah pretty neat the
