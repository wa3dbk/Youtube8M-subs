their open shoulders and open hips so
far<00:01:24.789> if<00:01:25.060> they<00:01:25.509> followed<00:01:25.899> through<00:01:26.109> out<00:01:26.289> to<00:01:27.009> the

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
far if they followed through out to the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.249 
far if they followed through out to the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
deliver the ball on the channel so you

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.569 
deliver the ball on the channel so you
have<00:01:35.229> to<00:01:35.380> look<00:01:35.529> carefully<00:01:35.799> when<00:01:36.219> you<00:01:36.310> see<00:01:36.459> the
