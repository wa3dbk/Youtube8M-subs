again<00:04:47.889> you<00:04:48.009> could<00:04:48.159> run<00:04:48.340> at<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.550> drag<00:04:48.759> strip<00:04:48.849> if

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
again you could run at the drag strip if

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.850 
again you could run at the drag strip if
you<00:04:49.180> want<00:04:49.389> GM<00:04:49.930> says<00:04:50.139> it's<00:04:50.319> going<00:04:50.409> to<00:04:50.469> go<00:04:50.620> in<00:04:50.770> the

you want GM says it's going to go in the
low<00:04:50.979> 50s<00:04:51.430> we<00:04:51.819> believe<00:04:52.120> them<00:04:52.270> I<00:04:52.479> don't<00:04:53.080> think

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
low 50s we believe them I don't think

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.240 
low 50s we believe them I don't think
you're<00:04:53.379> going<00:04:53.469> to<00:04:53.530> get<00:04:53.650> a<00:04:53.680> whole<00:04:53.860> lot<00:04:54.009> more<00:04:54.189> out

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
you're going to get a whole lot more out

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.550 
you're going to get a whole lot more out
of<00:04:54.460> it<00:04:54.610> than<00:04:54.759> that<00:04:54.789> but<00:04:55.389> I<00:04:55.419> will<00:04:55.539> say<00:04:55.719> this<00:04:55.930> you

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
of it than that but I will say this you

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.020 
of it than that but I will say this you
can<00:04:56.710> make<00:04:56.800> a<00:04:56.860> ton<00:04:57.099> of<00:04:57.129> power<00:04:57.340> out<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.639> won't<00:04:57.909> be

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
can make a ton of power out it won't be

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.550 
can make a ton of power out it won't be
long<00:04:58.210> before<00:04:58.240> somebody<00:04:58.750> hot<00:04:59.050> rods<00:04:59.289> one<00:04:59.469> of

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
long before somebody hot rods one of

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.749 
long before somebody hot rods one of
these<00:04:59.650> and<00:04:59.830> gets<00:04:59.979> it<00:05:00.099> down<00:05:00.219> instead<00:05:00.610> of<00:05:00.669> the

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
these and gets it down instead of the

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.189 
these and gets it down instead of the
13s<00:05:01.300> route<00:05:01.479> 12

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
13s route 12

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.929 
13s route 12
so<00:05:04.110> my<00:05:05.110> final<00:05:05.560> opinion<00:05:05.949> on<00:05:06.189> the<00:05:06.310> car<00:05:06.490> is<00:05:06.729> that

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:06.939 
so my final opinion on the car is that

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.659 
so my final opinion on the car is that
it's<00:05:07.689> a<00:05:07.750> great<00:05:07.930> car<00:05:08.139> it's<00:05:08.530> fun<00:05:08.800> I<00:05:09.069> didn't<00:05:09.550> get

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
it's a great car it's fun I didn't get

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.209 
it's a great car it's fun I didn't get
tired<00:05:09.849> of<00:05:10.000> it<00:05:10.150> once<00:05:10.360> and<00:05:10.770> although<00:05:11.770> it's<00:05:12.009> not<00:05:12.159> a

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
tired of it once and although it's not a

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:14.339 
tired of it once and although it's not a
fire-breathing<00:05:13.030> muscle<00:05:13.449> car<00:05:13.659> it<00:05:14.289> is

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
fire-breathing muscle car it is

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.589 
fire-breathing muscle car it is
certainly<00:05:15.069> one<00:05:15.280> a<00:05:15.340> car<00:05:15.699> that's<00:05:15.879> interesting

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
certainly one a car that's interesting

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.110 
certainly one a car that's interesting
for<00:05:17.590> all<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.919> things<00:05:18.039> that<00:05:18.190> it<00:05:18.280> does<00:05:18.400> well<00:05:18.789> and

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
for all the things that it does well and

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.480 
for all the things that it does well and
I<00:05:19.900> believe<00:05:20.259> it's<00:05:20.440> I<00:05:20.620> would<00:05:20.919> definitely

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
I believe it's I would definitely

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.369 
I believe it's I would definitely
consider<00:05:21.610> this<00:05:21.819> thing<00:05:22.090> 100%<00:05:22.840> bangs<00:05:23.020> shift<00:05:23.289> to

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
consider this thing 100% bangs shift to
