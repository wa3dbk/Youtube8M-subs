00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
actual buster will be big enough to

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.460 
actual buster will be big enough to
destroy<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.260> on<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.619> ladder<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:08.270> like<00:02:09.229> that's

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
destroy it on the ladder so like that's

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.080 
destroy it on the ladder so like that's
something<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:09.920> do<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.369> that's<00:02:10.610> which<00:02:10.820> dice

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
something you do and that's which dice

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.630 
something you do and that's which dice
here<00:02:11.420> because<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:11.930> easier

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
here because it's easier

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.350 
here because it's easier
I<00:02:14.200> got<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.230> tutorial<00:02:15.709> on<00:02:16.250> how<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.459> do<00:02:16.670> isolation

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
passes way to do it but you're gonna

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.810 
passes way to do it but you're gonna
have<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.750> go<00:02:29.930> check<00:02:30.560> those<00:02:30.770> out<00:02:31.010> there<00:02:31.520> those

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
have to go check those out there those

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.479 
have to go check those out there those
are<00:02:32.000> separate<00:02:32.420> videos<00:02:32.840> I've<00:02:33.170> done<00:02:35.050> this<00:02:36.050> fight

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
are separate videos I've done this fight

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.470 
are separate videos I've done this fight
it's<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.640> little<00:02:37.910> little<00:02:38.890> asshole<00:02:40.180> type<00:02:41.180> of

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
it's a little little asshole type of

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.320 
it's a little little asshole type of
fight<00:02:41.720> but<00:02:42.340> you're<00:02:43.340> going<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.549> start<00:02:43.820> out<00:02:44.000> with

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
fight but you're going to start out with

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.870 
fight but you're going to start out with
the<00:02:44.600> blue<00:02:45.140> shot<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.820> then<00:02:47.709> try<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.739> keep<00:02:49.430> close

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
the blue shot and then try to keep close

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.570 
the blue shot and then try to keep close
while<00:02:50.870> firing<00:02:51.320> off<00:02:51.680> like<00:02:51.950> green<00:02:52.250> shots

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
while firing off like green shots

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.509 
while firing off like green shots
because<00:02:52.970> like<00:02:53.390> there<00:02:53.660> are<00:02:53.780> times<00:02:54.049> when<00:02:54.519> you

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
because like there are times when you

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.090 
because like there are times when you
can<00:02:55.700> fire<00:02:55.910> off<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.180> green<00:02:56.540> shot<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.860> won't

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
can fire off a green shot and it won't

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.840 
can fire off a green shot and it won't
do<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:59.600> damage<00:02:59.959> it<00:03:00.110> will<00:03:00.200> do<00:03:00.320> like<00:03:00.500> one<00:03:00.769> so<00:03:01.730> it's

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
do to damage it will do like one so it's

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.470 
do to damage it will do like one so it's
really<00:03:02.030> weird

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
really weird

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.050 
really weird
I<00:03:02.600> find<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:03.500> keeping<00:03:03.799> kind<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.370> close<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.880> him

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
I find that keeping kind of close to him

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.770 
I find that keeping kind of close to him
is<00:03:06.100> somewhat<00:03:07.100> consistent<00:03:07.580> with<00:03:08.180> doing<00:03:08.630> the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
is somewhat consistent with doing the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.130 
is somewhat consistent with doing the
two<00:03:08.959> damaged<00:03:09.320> shots<00:03:09.620> but<00:03:10.010> here<00:03:10.970> like<00:03:11.390> coming

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
two damaged shots but here like coming

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.880 
two damaged shots but here like coming
up<00:03:12.260> he<00:03:12.590> can<00:03:12.769> teleport<00:03:13.510> kind<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.600> where<00:03:14.890> you

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
up he can teleport kind of where you

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.550 
up he can teleport kind of where you
stand<00:03:16.340> like<00:03:16.790> for<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.780> certain<00:03:18.140> length<00:03:18.320> of<00:03:18.500> time

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
stand like for a certain length of time

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.550 
stand like for a certain length of time
so<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.160> here<00:03:19.489> again<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:20.480> notice<00:03:20.690> he<00:03:20.930> teleports

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
so I here again you notice he teleports

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.699 
so I here again you notice he teleports
white<00:03:21.820> right<00:03:22.820> tries<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.780> teleport<00:03:24.230> like<00:03:24.470> right

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
white right tries to teleport like right

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.310 
white right tries to teleport like right
up<00:03:24.890> on<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:25.310> there's<00:03:25.820> a<00:03:25.910> certain<00:03:26.329> there's<00:03:27.170> like

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
up on you there's a certain there's like

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.289 
up on you there's a certain there's like
a<00:03:27.350> certain<00:03:27.799> owner<00:03:27.980> interval<00:03:28.549> where<00:03:28.790> he<00:03:29.090> just

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
a certain owner interval where he just

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.380 
a certain owner interval where he just
starts<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.720> teleport<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.290> shit-ton<00:03:30.560> basically

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
starts to teleport a shit-ton basically

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.000 
starts to teleport a shit-ton basically
it's<00:03:32.390> usually<00:03:32.810> at<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.230> end<00:03:33.380> of<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.530> fight<00:03:33.739> but

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
to get the co-anchor heart the the

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.839 
to get the co-anchor heart the the
beginner<00:03:55.459> way<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:57.680> you're<00:03:57.830> just<00:03:57.920> going<00:03:58.129> to<00:03:58.220> lay

beginner way so you're just going to lay

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.150 
beginner way so you're just going to lay
your<00:03:58.879> eyes<00:03:59.060> here<00:03:59.709> you're<00:04:00.709> going<00:04:00.830> to<00:04:00.890> have

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
your eyes here you're going to have

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
you're going to have the chart ability

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.920 
you're going to have the chart ability
to<00:04:03.470> charge<00:04:03.739> here<00:04:04.129> because<00:04:04.660> this<00:04:05.660> is<00:04:05.900> the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
to charge here because this is the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.640 
to charge here because this is the
mammoth<00:04:06.560> before<00:04:07.040> Cahuenga<00:04:07.430> route<00:04:08.500> doing<00:04:09.500> it

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
mammoth before Cahuenga route doing it

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.890 
mammoth before Cahuenga route doing it
this<00:04:09.800> way<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:11.030> yeah<00:04:11.209> it's<00:04:11.420> not<00:04:11.510> really<00:04:11.870> a

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
this way so yeah it's not really a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.430 
this way so yeah it's not really a
precise<00:04:12.440> jump<00:04:12.769> at<00:04:12.920> all<00:04:13.010> it's<00:04:13.310> just<00:04:14.170> get<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.290> get

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
precise jump at all it's just get to get

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.300 
precise jump at all it's just get to get
out<00:04:15.560> there<00:04:15.830> and<00:04:16.070> do<00:04:16.700> that<00:04:16.910> so<00:04:17.239> oh<00:04:17.979> yeah<00:04:18.979> we'll
