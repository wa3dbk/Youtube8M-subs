00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
 we will learn to place the cell phone in 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:09.150
 test mode to be able to test the lcd 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.480
 the different colors can test the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.480
 Audio 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.310
 the cellular sensors what is the 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.520
 compass the accelerometer the sensor 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.520
 proximity 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.240
 before images 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.900
 and some other functions 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.900
 we go to the option to mark 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:42.870
 and we mark the asterisk number numeral 0 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.870
 asterisk numeral 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.390
 what can you try 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.390
 the lsd for the red color 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.740
 the green color 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.870
 the color blue 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.530
 in some phones they will appear 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.440
 the numbers 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.730
 we can try the receiver soon not 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.990
 it sounds very hard but the headset 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.990
 let's try the vibrator 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.920
 to test the change of colors of the 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.920
 three basic colors 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.680
 in this option we test the camera 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.070
 then we are going to test the sensor which is 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.980
 the sensor is here where a 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.480
 listen with just approaching the finger 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.480
 to turn and it will change color 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.270
 I do not even need to touch it 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.970
 in this option the touch is tested 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.290
 then we must mark everything to 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.909
 check that the tows is 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.909
 running across the screen 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.330
 and passed the test of all 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.770
 I want to send us to sleep 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.770
 he simply falls asleep 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.700
 and that we tested the speaker 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.590
 in this last one we tried the keys of the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.520
 lower part than when we touch them 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.520
 changes its color 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.070
 and in this way we can prove our 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.630
 Android phone after what 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.740
 we have new we buy it second or 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.450
 after he has suffered a blow 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.170
 so the link other videos that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.170
 talk about android
