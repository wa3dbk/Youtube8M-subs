00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.670
 Viebahn from before 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.670
 for it is 16 year old 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.620
 more unclear 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.089
 here is the biggest buyers Fed Cup in Japan is known for 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.119
 8 money is but also for 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.349
 definitely the genetic material is felt 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.349
 we hope for many spectators a young lady 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.589
 so he's also bizarre 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:26.119
 The init for this flow of money of the market may already create 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.599
 really should not be in the process, especially as the future lies in the process 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.209
 introduced available 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.040
 with the ladies 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.959
 about figure skating coach 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.129
 In any case, the jumps are absolutely excellent from the quality 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.190
 certainly with the help of costs up 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.140
 compare significantly better than the masters too she had a lot of time 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.199
 5 more threefold and school 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:53.540
 so the whalers ended up opening up backwards 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.539
 Reinhard Klimmt 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.279
 the team-em as North 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:00.339
 "Incredibly good" Santas table program a great presence Denic very much 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.959
 very much to those dogs when broadcasting van Staa, everything is there 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.219
 everything comes together and because the JU after the children they look at the 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:10.619
 triple toe-loop 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:14.549
 because some ladies trouble the so-called to jumpers first jump each and 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.079
 Handy God too, of course 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.079
 What I particularly like is the following 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.639
 Dell also the trade does not offer the jumps 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.229
 and Danny Gibbs continues with Juliette's 0-Sagittarius border but percent she builds 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.319
 a program on and the double axel that comes out of a pocket Voss 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:32.900
 Combinations in Dr 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.879
 The bookshop numbers the elements from different icons all over 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.139
 two minutes 50 that it also impressions that she has the courage 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.340
 Just to wait for Pander to make some elements then the Lutz 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.160
 Percent in the middle of the program are armpit at the end of the program that speaks 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.419
 for her safety is the one of her spoken axes from the Tina Bauer 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.900
 Moon around it really they have one percent off and way the Koreans in 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.180
 Here, too self-assured appearance with her 16 years first time 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.020
 World Championships with you almost think she is already an old hand with 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.300
 5 6 wm participations 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.069
 but no 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.689
 one is losing here 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:11.819
 one percent 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.819
 nameless strong 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.089
 in number one now some spectators have been bought 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:21.089
 Also consider John realistic 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:22.710
 everything should c 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.530
 for the ariane-6 the b 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.659
 we have rarely experienced so far 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.809
 on such a Nebo 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:33.689
 All this must certainly second place, but could also be quite room 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.779
 One thing must be said that was the presentation by Carolina Kostner 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.779
 Equal concerns 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:46.699
 H 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.629
 But besides that is the pure expectation also in the course of the world 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:53.629
 Madness that this is the fourth and the beast 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:58.199
 never before the plaintiff has the 1 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.139
 it burned that is so to speak 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.139
 That's 71 or 95 points 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:14.139
 74 5 5 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:15.849
 4 3 points more than low
