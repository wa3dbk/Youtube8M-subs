this<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.680> brake<00:03:49.950> arm<00:03:50.250> when<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.910> pushes

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
this is the brake arm when it pushes

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.470 
this is the brake arm when it pushes
this<00:03:51.390> way<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.900> will<00:03:52.050> break<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:53.100> will<00:03:53.310> push<00:03:54.000> this

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
this way it will break it will push this

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.740 
this way it will break it will push this
disc<00:03:55.380> pads<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.070> they<00:03:56.790> will<00:03:56.940> just<00:03:57.150> catch<00:03:57.510> the

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
disc pads and they will just catch the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.050 
disc pads and they will just catch the
disc<00:03:57.990> and<00:03:58.200> when<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.040> disc<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.370> not<00:03:59.400> moving<00:03:59.850> of

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
disc and when the disc is not moving of

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.520 
disc and when the disc is not moving of
course<00:04:00.090> your<00:04:00.480> transmission<00:04:00.959> is<00:04:01.020> not<00:04:01.230> moving

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
course your transmission is not moving

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.580 
course your transmission is not moving
and<00:04:01.709> your<00:04:02.040> car<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.340> breaking
