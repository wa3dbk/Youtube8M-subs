to be pretty simple tutorial quite quick
and<00:00:12.620> we're<00:00:13.620> going<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.860> be<00:00:14.009> model<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.790> a

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
and we're going to be model in a

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.560 
and we're going to be model in a
and<00:00:17.230> well<00:00:18.230> this<00:00:18.950> pretty<00:00:19.730> much<00:00:19.910> we're<00:00:20.330> going<00:00:20.450> to

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
and well this pretty much we're going to

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.280 
and well this pretty much we're going to
put<00:00:20.660> model<00:00:20.960> in<00:00:21.050> this<00:00:21.230> in<00:00:21.440> 3dsmax<00:00:22.270> 2008<00:00:23.290> it's

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
put model in this in 3dsmax 2008 it's

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.190 
put model in this in 3dsmax 2008 it's
not<00:00:24.590> going<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:24.890> be<00:00:25.520> hard<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.660> model<00:00:27.020> because

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
not going to be hard to model because

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.460 
not going to be hard to model because
it's<00:00:27.290> not<00:00:27.410> very<00:00:27.500> detailed<00:00:28.990> but<00:00:29.990> it<00:00:30.230> should

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
it's not very detailed but it should

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.340 
it's not very detailed but it should
give<00:00:30.619> you<00:00:30.740> a<00:00:30.800> basic<00:00:31.670> understanding<00:00:31.970> of<00:00:32.570> how

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
give you a basic understanding of how

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.790 
give you a basic understanding of how
the<00:00:33.379> tools<00:00:33.739> work<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:35.020> how<00:00:36.020> things<00:00:36.290> work<00:00:36.559> in

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
the tools work and how things work in

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.700 
the tools work and how things work in
3dsmax<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.660> let's<00:00:38.989> get<00:00:39.080> on<00:00:39.170> with<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.530> first

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
3dsmax so let's get on with the first

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.729 
3dsmax so let's get on with the first
thing<00:00:39.890> I'm<00:00:39.980> going<00:00:40.129> to<00:00:40.250> do<00:00:40.430> is<00:00:41.379> model<00:00:42.379> this<00:00:42.500> top

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
thing I'm going to do is model this top

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.410 
thing I'm going to do is model this top
part<00:00:42.980> it<00:00:43.850> would<00:00:43.940> just<00:00:44.059> be<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:45.100> basic<00:00:46.100> cube<00:00:46.460> we've

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
part it would just be a basic cube we've

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.090 
part it would just be a basic cube we've
shown<00:00:47.660> that<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.199> then<00:00:48.500> I'll<00:00:48.620> duplicate

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
shown that it is then I'll duplicate

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.320 
shown that it is then I'll duplicate
that<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:50.530> then<00:00:51.530> do<00:00:52.339> the<00:00:52.519> cylinders<00:00:53.030> the

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
that and and then do the cylinders the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.920 
that and and then do the cylinders the
legs<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.500> let's<00:00:54.650> get<00:00:54.739> on<00:00:54.800> with<00:00:54.860> it

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
legs so let's get on with it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.189 
legs so let's get on with it
absorb<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.110> clip<00:00:58.500> box<00:00:58.800> go<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.700> top<00:00:59.910> view<00:01:00.240> and

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.100 

just<00:01:04.199> draw<00:01:04.559> our<00:01:04.800> rough<00:01:05.100> shape<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.760> Weiss<00:01:06.110> you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
just draw our rough shape and Weiss you

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.360 
just draw our rough shape and Weiss you
could<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.560> fine<00:01:07.890> Oh

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.280 

I<00:01:10.480> forgot<00:01:11.480> chili<00:01:12.130> yeah

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.880 

I<00:01:15.380> choked<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.430> bit<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.940> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.340 

so<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.760> just

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.550 

put<00:01:24.950> that<00:01:25.130> down<00:01:25.460> I<00:01:25.729> should<00:01:25.939> be<00:01:26.090> fine

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.230 

until<00:01:29.399> you<00:01:29.579> went<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.780> minus<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:32.210> make<00:01:33.210> sure

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
until you went to minus so make sure

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.080 
until you went to minus so make sure
it's<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.750> positive<00:01:34.560> number<00:01:34.710> non<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.490> negative

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
it's a positive number non a negative

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.670 
it's a positive number non a negative
number<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:38.299> that<00:01:39.299> looks<00:01:39.659> fine<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.909> now

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.849 

and<00:01:45.920> I'm<00:01:46.460> actually<00:01:46.670> looks<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.540> bit<00:01:47.870> too<00:01:48.200> long<00:01:49.420> so

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:02:01.809 

yeah<00:01:54.859> well<00:01:55.579> all<00:01:56.329> right<00:01:57.399> say<00:01:58.399> a<00:02:00.310> little<00:02:01.310> bit<00:02:01.549> too

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
yeah well all right say a little bit too

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:07.130 
yeah well all right say a little bit too
long

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.059 

I'll<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.979> fine<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:08.700> convert<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.920> is

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
I'll be fine now convert it to and it is

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.380 
I'll be fine now convert it to and it is
opal<00:02:11.400> poly<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.920> then

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.280 

grab<00:02:18.390> these<00:02:18.630> edges<00:02:19.260> all<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> con<00:02:20.970> ons

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
grab these edges all of the con ons

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.770 
grab these edges all of the con ons
holding<00:02:22.290> ctrl<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:22.890> click<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.240> can<00:02:24.570> grab

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
holding ctrl and click so I can grab

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.120 
holding ctrl and click so I can grab
multiple<00:02:25.260> edges<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:27.480> then<00:02:28.230> I'll<00:02:28.410> just<00:02:28.500> zoom

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
multiple edges and then I'll just zoom

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.770 
multiple edges and then I'll just zoom
in<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.520> can<00:02:29.610> see<00:02:30.120> what<00:02:30.300> I'm<00:02:30.390> actually<00:02:30.540> doing

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
in so I can see what I'm actually doing

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.600 
in so I can see what I'm actually doing
and<00:02:31.430> now<00:02:32.430> shumba<00:02:35.090> I'll<00:02:36.090> do<00:02:36.360> about<00:02:36.690> five<00:02:37.610> with

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
and now shumba I'll do about five with

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.870 
and now shumba I'll do about five with
about<00:02:39.650> ten<00:02:40.650> segments<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.490> should<00:02:42.360> be<00:02:42.540> fine<00:02:42.870> now

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
about ten segments I should be fine now

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.200 
about ten segments I should be fine now
I'm<00:02:44.880> going<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.300> do<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:46.400> grab<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.580> polygon<00:02:47.970> tool

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
I'm going to do is grab the polygon tool

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.690 
I'm going to do is grab the polygon tool
select<00:02:48.960> everything<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:51.270> go<00:02:51.450> down<00:02:51.690> to

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
select everything and go down to

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.700 
select everything and go down to
smoothing<00:02:53.700> groups<00:02:53.730> or<00:02:54.420> clairol<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.320> they<00:02:55.560> do

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
smoothing groups or clairol and they do

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.570 
smoothing groups or clairol and they do
autos<00:02:56.190> move<00:02:56.490> in<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.810> now<00:02:57.960> it<00:02:58.020> gives<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.350> nice

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
autos move in so now it gives a nice

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.640 
autos move in so now it gives a nice
smooth<00:02:59.580> edge

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
smooth edge

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.479 
smooth edge
whereas<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.640> would<00:03:02.819> have<00:03:02.970> given<00:03:04.489> something

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
whereas it would have given something

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.410 
whereas it would have given something
like<00:03:05.790> that

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:22.500 

so<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.230> look<00:03:13.530> fine

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.970 

just<00:03:23.349> sent<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:23.799> up

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.460 

and<00:03:28.550> then<00:03:28.849> I<00:03:29.450> will<00:03:31.690> duplicate<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:33.200> underneath

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
and then I will duplicate it underneath

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.640 
and then I will duplicate it underneath
just<00:03:34.400> click<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:34.909> holding<00:03:35.299> shift<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.720> drag

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.530 

yeah<00:03:40.480> looks<00:03:41.480> about<00:03:41.599> right

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
yeah looks about right

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.929 
yeah looks about right
and<00:03:44.110> then<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.319> dropped<00:03:44.379> a<00:03:44.680> cylinder<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.280> go<00:03:45.879> to

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
and then I dropped a cylinder to go to

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.229 
and then I dropped a cylinder to go to
the<00:03:46.150> top<00:03:46.329> view<00:03:46.689> if<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.560> mouse<00:03:47.799> work<00:03:48.129> go<00:03:48.969> to<00:03:49.030> the

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
the top view if the mouse work go to the

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.140 
the top view if the mouse work go to the
top<00:03:49.420> view

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
top view

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.220 
top view
this<00:03:51.810> corner<00:03:52.439> and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.860 

check<00:03:56.040> out<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.250> cylinder

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.399 

the<00:04:01.470> radius<00:04:01.950> tool<00:04:02.190> bar<00:04:02.400> free<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:04.080> I<00:04:04.140> thought

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
the radius tool bar free and I thought

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.000 
the radius tool bar free and I thought
hi<00:04:04.680> out<00:04:04.860> in<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.099> moment<00:04:06.379> we<00:04:07.379> don't<00:04:07.620> need<00:04:07.830> any

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
hi out in a moment we don't need any

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.820 
hi out in a moment we don't need any
height<00:04:08.370> segments<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:10.049> we<00:04:10.440> don't<00:04:10.530> need<00:04:10.680> any

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
height segments and we don't need any

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:19.779 
height segments and we don't need any
cap<00:04:11.159> segments<00:04:11.849> 18<00:04:12.450> sides<00:04:12.780> will<00:04:12.959> be<00:04:13.080> fine

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:25.100 

just<00:04:20.789> pull<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:21.930> down<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:23.419> then<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.570> can<00:04:24.810> bump

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
just pull this down and then I can bump

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.899 
just pull this down and then I can bump
up<00:04:25.259> the<00:04:25.500> height<00:04:27.320> towards<00:04:28.320> how<00:04:28.590> about<00:04:28.800> 46

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:31.909 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:36.260 

and<00:04:32.909> that<00:04:33.119> looks<00:04:33.240> about<00:04:33.479> oh<00:04:34.039> no<00:04:35.039> the<00:04:35.699> bottom

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
and that looks about oh no the bottom

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.200 
and that looks about oh no the bottom
part<00:04:36.389> needs<00:04:36.689> to<00:04:36.839> be<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:36.990> longer

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.559 

I'll<00:04:42.870> be<00:04:43.199> all<00:04:43.289> right

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:52.579 

so<00:04:46.289> about<00:04:46.499> 60<00:04:47.099> am<00:04:47.429> a<00:04:49.189> 50-50<00:04:50.189> a<00:04:50.219> year<00:04:51.259> six<00:04:52.259> today

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:52.589 
so about 60 am a 50-50 a year six today

00:04:52.589 --> 00:05:04.990 
so about 60 am a 50-50 a year six today
Oh<00:04:53.659> nope<00:04:55.339> 59<00:04:58.399> 60

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.100 

61

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.900 

61<00:05:09.110> looks<00:05:09.319> fine

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
61 looks fine

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.120 
61 looks fine
and<00:05:11.450> I'm<00:05:11.630> going<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:12.020> see<00:05:12.260> if<00:05:12.290> it's<00:05:12.530> in<00:05:12.650> roughly

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
and I'm going to see if it's in roughly

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:20.480 
and I'm going to see if it's in roughly
the<00:05:13.250> right<00:05:13.370> place<00:05:14.200> say<00:05:15.200> about<00:05:15.440> the

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.510 

and<00:05:20.940> I<00:05:20.970> just<00:05:21.210> hold<00:05:21.509> shift<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.169> drag<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.370> the

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
and I just hold shift and drag it to the

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.800 
and I just hold shift and drag it to the
other<00:05:23.759> side

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
other side

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.879 
other side
and<00:05:26.350> then<00:05:26.530> I'll<00:05:26.980> control-click<00:05:27.820> thought

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
and then I'll control-click thought

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.390 
and then I'll control-click thought
hold<00:05:30.520> shift<00:05:30.699> and<00:05:31.409> track<00:05:32.409> that<00:05:32.830> to<00:05:33.069> the<00:05:33.219> other

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
hold shift and track that to the other

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.010 
hold shift and track that to the other
side

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:43.850 

that's<00:05:37.020> pretty<00:05:37.650> much<00:05:37.830> it

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.959 

breakfast

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.679 

yeah<00:05:52.059> that's<00:05:52.419> pretty<00:05:52.629> much<00:05:52.749> out<00:05:53.110> there<00:05:53.349> you<00:05:54.009> go
