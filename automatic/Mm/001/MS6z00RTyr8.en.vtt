00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 yes i should give me back your team 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.830
 welcome to another 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.130
 video on a channel today 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.290
 small clip from playoffs two yes me 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.299
 Games look at two since 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.400
 Tuesday afternoon, and that's what I play 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.609
 up to now in newtown position 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.650
 new mode with the mp 7 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.519
 and yes, I have taken the climb 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.010
 because I just liked it a lot 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.840
 yes what the drone to the coast and then 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.520
 somehow two different things where any 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.590
 like badaboom does not know how the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.600
 I just do not think so 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.760
 the names but I was soon the same 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.219
 see what they do and how to play 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.040
 just a little bit over about 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.559
 black ops times so my first games 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.800
 what she has to like and what more 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.219
 less well because it was all play 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.559
 check out a round ff or something like that 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.500
 no one else has on the map where that 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.219
 So ship is 30 to 10 gone out 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.409
 with the skate but I played there and 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.900
 was really funny the spot 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.900
 points were just two of me the best 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.689
 so it is also the map in ffh but 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.040
 made diverse even if I myself 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.810
 kids pc four I do not know how 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.530
 I managed that, but I was 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.570
 was very cool 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.540
 and then I have a bit of playing 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.009
 the map and trader her know her yes 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.950
 already the village is is imagined 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.650
 just really cool, but still 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.979
 I like the map of black ops 1 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.579
 at least the design is better 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.740
 me better 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.210
 So yes it is not badly 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.470
 adds but I like it better 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.299
 we can write a comment what 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.159
 Europe is if you already on the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.049
 should also have game over right 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.270
 This is just a separate playlist 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.710
 is that if you play youtube 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.490
 You can choose pictures right 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.710
 made and so far is doing great 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.020
 Whimsy is to play a bit 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.939
 rather the pc is that the connection 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.979
 Not exactly the best one there is 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.930
 lobbyist is running 1 a there are some 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.360
 Are you allowed to pay three cash or even the company 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.430
 connection but it just is what i am 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.450
 I think it's a pity 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.099
 I mean I expected it differently 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.569
 the game entry outside that can 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.170
 not perfect, that's why I want 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.280
 not even happy about it but 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.590
 especially expected then you can too 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.239
 In any case I live that way, too 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.140
 I 'm looking forward to the days 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.090
 Now a few comments is 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.189
 rauszuhauen overview if tips and 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.879
 Tricks fast level the stars and 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.409
 no idea 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.120
 it would be a mistake if ever 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.379
 I will also be happy to have a newtown 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.430
 make a guide but that takes a while 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.319
 a little bit because I'm such a first 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.230
 bit networks must befriend and yes 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.230
 I would say until next time 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.230
 Hello
