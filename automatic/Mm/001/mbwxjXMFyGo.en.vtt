 Hello friends, you are back on the channel 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.210
 plan cider dot ru and we are with you again 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.210
 speak from centuries for ios 7 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.890
 and today we talk about very cool 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.759
 useful tracks which is called flip 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.550
 control center 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.529
 he is absolutely free and you know 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.900
 when i first saw the control center 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.990
 presented along with ios 7 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.520
 i fell damn it's so cool now in 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.830
 In general, all the basic settings for 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.780
 hand but the most important thing to me 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.030
 I wanted to and I am sure many of ours 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.860
 the viewers are turning it off and on 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.930
 cellular data or 3g 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.970
 they were not just in my 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.360
 a look is completely wrong tweak 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.850
 flick control center helps us make 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.040
 control center so that it as he 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.690
 should have been proper or 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.120
 I think the developer is already talking about 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.010
 many of his name is ryan petrich man 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.960
 which distinguished itself large enough 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.859
 number of very high quality shifts 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.719
 for different versions of ios and today we 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:12.840
 We look at his next creation 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:16.439
 actually the most important thing that we see 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.009
 this is what now these are the current light 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.780
 on top of 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.420
 top of the control center can 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.759
 scroll back and forth, however, and the same 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.159
 The same goes for the quick launch bar. 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.140
 applications below everything is fine too 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.659
 flipped through and moreover all 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.369
 fine tuned in settings 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.840
 you can drag 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:40.270
 let's say 3g up 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.679
 it down and do the same thing with 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.710
 bottom shelf as it is called here 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.109
 we will help tab asset asset st a in 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.030
 principle here let's say 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:54.020
 the functionality of these the glove it 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.700
 repeats and admit if we top 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.399
 parts added 3g 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.009
 add a switch to the bottom shelf 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.569
 3g absolutely no no yes indeed 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.579
 I do not think that many of us will 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.560
 use very often them on the bottom 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.720
 shelf the most important thing is all weekend 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.079
 top repeat tweak absolutely 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.610
 free it is very convenient i personally i 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.380
 I use it every day and many times 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.829
 because for example in our office 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.930
 appleinsider.ru 3g is not very caught 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:23.329
 good and so the phone is constantly 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.459
 is in network search mode and 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.650
 discharges very quickly now I 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.690
 I come just turned off 3g and absolutely 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.790
 I have no problems with this 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.769
 tell me what do you think do you use 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.239
 you and tweaks what use necessarily 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.799
 put your thumbs up of course 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.450
 subscribe for new videos i 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.910
 surely there will be a handful and fact 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.910
 centuries and tell you about them bye bye
