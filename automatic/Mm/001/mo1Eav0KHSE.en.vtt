that's nice about the moto one versus
the<00:00:32.130> model<00:00:32.399> 2<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.960> much<00:00:34.500> much

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the model 2 is that it is much much

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.880 
the model 2 is that it is much much
smaller<00:00:35.899> comparatively<00:00:36.899> here's<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> model<00:00:37.710> 1

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890

smaller comparatively here's the model 1
it<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.610> sits<00:00:38.820> under<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.750> can

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
it just sits under it like that so I can

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.440 
it just sits under it like that so I can
fit<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.500> Super<00:00:40.739> Nintendo<00:00:40.829> next<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.520> when

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
fit in a Super Nintendo next to it when

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.150 
fit in a Super Nintendo next to it when
in<00:00:42.540> comparison<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> model<00:00:43.649> 2<00:00:43.860> which

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
in comparison you have the model 2 which

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.970 
in comparison you have the model 2 which
just<00:00:44.520> dwarfs<00:00:45.480> which<00:00:45.899> does<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.469> doesn't<00:00:46.739> dwarf

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
just dwarfs which does it doesn't dwarf

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.290 
just dwarfs which does it doesn't dwarf
it<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.190> actually<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.520> looks<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.760> look<00:00:47.969> huge

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it it actually it looks just look huge

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
next to all of it so it's not as much of

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.160 
next to all of it so it's not as much of
a<00:00:50.579> space<00:00:50.820> hog<00:00:51.120> despite<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.870> being<00:00:52.079> a

i've<00:03:09.840> tried<00:03:09.959> on<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.349> just<00:03:10.620> kind<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.400> know

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
i've tried on it just kind of you know

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:21.820 
i've tried on it just kind of you know
does<00:03:11.670> its<00:03:11.849> thing<00:03:11.939> and<00:03:12.359> you<00:03:13.049> play<00:03:13.230> your<00:03:13.379> games

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.660 

there's<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.890> demonstration<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.610> works<00:03:23.790> I

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.350 

can't<00:03:29.670> believe<00:03:29.879> it<00:03:30.000> works

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
can't believe it works

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.089 
can't believe it works
I<00:03:30.450> really<00:03:30.720> can't<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.409> usually<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.950> find

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
I really can't you usually you find

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.160 
I really can't you usually you find
these<00:03:32.280> broken<00:03:35.269> but<00:03:36.269> this<00:03:36.450> one<00:03:36.659> this<00:03:36.959> one

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
these broken but this one this one

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:50.780 
these broken but this one this one
actually<00:03:37.470> works<00:03:49.129> I'm<00:03:50.129> not<00:03:50.310> gonna<00:03:50.459> play<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.700> game

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
actually works I'm not gonna play a game

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.069 
actually works I'm not gonna play a game
because<00:03:51.299> it's<00:03:51.480> hard<00:03:51.659> to<00:03:51.690> do<00:03:51.780> with<00:03:51.870> one<00:03:51.930> hand

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
because it's hard to do with one hand

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.470 
because it's hard to do with one hand
but<00:03:52.879> eject<00:03:54.890> or<00:03:55.890> just<00:03:56.040> reset<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.459> console<00:03:56.819> yeah

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
but eject or just reset the console yeah

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.000 
but eject or just reset the console yeah
resetting<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.049> console<00:03:58.379> ejects<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.799> disk

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
resetting the console ejects the disk

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.170 
resetting the console ejects the disk
and<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.250> can<00:03:59.370> just<00:03:59.489> push<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.730> back<00:03:59.849> in<00:04:00.120> with

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
and you can just push it back in with

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.900 
and you can just push it back in with
your<00:04:00.299> finger<00:04:00.569> as<00:04:00.690> well<00:04:02.239> my<00:04:03.239> game<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> link<00:04:04.910> there

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
your finger as well my game a link there

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.940 
your finger as well my game a link there
you<00:04:06.000> go<00:04:06.150> that's<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.540> Sega<00:04:06.780> Genesis<00:04:07.319> or<00:04:07.620> Sega

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950

you go that's the Sega Genesis or Sega
CD<00:04:08.280> model<00:04:08.700> one<00:04:08.849> and<00:04:09.269> it's<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.900> same

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
CD model one and it's the same

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.990 
CD model one and it's the same
connectors<00:04:10.530> on<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.709> back<00:04:10.799> as<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.190> model<00:04:11.549> 2

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
connectors on the back as a model 2

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.809 
connectors on the back as a model 2
so<00:04:12.390> just<00:04:12.690> like<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.650> also<00:04:13.890> get<00:04:14.310> just<00:04:14.700> like

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
so just like that you also get just like

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.180 
so just like that you also get just like
the<00:04:14.910> model<00:04:15.180> 2<00:04:15.359> you<00:04:16.229> get<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.440> mixing<00:04:16.769> port<00:04:17.039> you

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
the model 2 you get the mixing port you

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.400 
the model 2 you get the mixing port you
get<00:04:17.340> RCA<00:04:18.000> out<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.479> you<00:04:18.660> get<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:20.900> power<00:04:21.900> in<00:04:22.199> and

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
get RCA out and you get the power in and

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.320 
get RCA out and you get the power in and
it<00:04:22.860> takes<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.160> same<00:04:23.340> power<00:04:23.639> adapter<00:04:24.090> as<00:04:24.210> the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
it takes the same power adapter as the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.820 
it takes the same power adapter as the
model<00:04:24.600> two<00:04:24.750> one<00:04:24.930> does<00:04:25.139> as<00:04:25.289> well<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:25.800> don't

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
model two one does as well so you don't

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.580 
model two one does as well so you don't
have<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.130> worry<00:04:26.310> about<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:27.419> know<00:04:27.570> mixing<00:04:28.289> up
