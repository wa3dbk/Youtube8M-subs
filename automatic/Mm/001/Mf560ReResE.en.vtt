what's<00:00:01.020> up<00:00:01.230> guys<00:00:01.410> it's<00:00:01.650> me<00:00:01.740> Jeremy<00:00:01.970> when<00:00:02.970> I

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy when I

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.579 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy when I
spectated<00:00:03.540> home<00:00:03.720> my<00:00:03.899> games<00:00:04.110> during<00:00:04.470> my

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
spectated home my games during my

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.619 
spectated home my games during my
coaching<00:00:04.830> streams<00:00:05.370> one<00:00:05.730> thing<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.029> noticed<00:00:06.450> was

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
coaching streams one thing I noticed was

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.179 
coaching streams one thing I noticed was
that<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.810> lot<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.109> players<00:00:07.470> tend<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.010> play

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
that a lot of players tend to play

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.150 
that a lot of players tend to play
extremely<00:00:09.090> passive<00:00:09.360> at<00:00:10.139> levels<00:00:10.559> one<00:00:10.769> two<00:00:10.800> and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
extremely passive at levels one two and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.280 
extremely passive at levels one two and
three<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:12.210> don't<00:00:12.269> think<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.929> that's

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
three and I don't think that that's

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.620 
three and I don't think that that's
always<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.070> best<00:00:14.219> approach<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.420> often

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
always the best approach and it often

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.140 
always the best approach and it often
passes<00:00:16.199> up<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.500> really<00:00:16.770> big<00:00:17.100> opportunity<00:00:17.310> that

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
passes up a really big opportunity that

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150 
passes up a really big opportunity that
you<00:00:18.270> could<00:00:18.449> take<00:00:18.570> advantage<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:19.260> let's<00:00:19.980> get

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
you could take advantage of let's get

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.109 
you could take advantage of let's get
started<00:00:21.949> now<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.220> important<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.670> understand

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
started now it's important to understand

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.609 
started now it's important to understand
that<00:00:24.210> when<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.449> say<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.810> should<00:00:24.900> fight<00:00:25.260> early

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
that when I say you should fight early

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.550 
that when I say you should fight early
I'm<00:00:25.859> talking<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.550> super<00:00:27.359> early<00:00:27.510> levels<00:00:28.230> one

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
I'm talking like super early levels one

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.910 
I'm talking like super early levels one
two<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.010> three<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:30.539> don't<00:00:30.689> mean<00:00:31.349> go<00:00:31.380> balls

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
two and three and I don't mean go balls

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.100 
two and three and I don't mean go balls
to<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.309> wall<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.759> your<00:00:32.880> aggression<00:00:33.480> push

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
to the wall with your aggression push

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.630 
to the wall with your aggression push
hard<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.559> go<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> early<00:00:35.190> level<00:00:35.430> to

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
hard and go for the early level to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
hard and go for the early level to
manage<00:00:36.149> your<00:00:36.270> creep<00:00:36.540> wave<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.020> make<00:00:37.260> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
manage your creep wave and make a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.860 
manage your creep wave and make a
calculated<00:00:38.070> play<00:00:38.520> there's<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.239> lot<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.690> good

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
calculated play there's a lot of good

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.720 
calculated play there's a lot of good
reasons<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> set<00:00:40.680> up<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> fight

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
reasons to set up and go for a fight

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.819 
reasons to set up and go for a fight
early<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> game<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:43.050> want<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.320> walk<00:00:43.620> into

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
early in the game you want to walk into

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.520 
early in the game you want to walk into
the<00:00:44.040> lane<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.520> think<00:00:44.940> from<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.750> first<00:00:46.050> creep

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
the lane and think from the first creep

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.470 
the lane and think from the first creep
I'm<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> try<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.640> fight<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:47.940> guy<00:00:48.180> at

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
I'm going to try to fight this guy at

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.420 
I'm going to try to fight this guy at
level<00:00:48.780> two<00:00:48.960> or<00:00:48.989> three<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.590> then<00:00:49.620> play<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
level two or three and then play the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.119 
level two or three and then play the
lane<00:00:50.640> from<00:00:51.030> level<00:00:51.390> one<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.350> mindset<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
lane from level one with that mindset to

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.490 
lane from level one with that mindset to
set<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.670> decent<00:00:53.940> fight<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.260> set<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
set up a decent fight you have to set it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.619 
set up a decent fight you have to set it
up<00:00:55.680> that's<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.250> key<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:57.210> top<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.480> that

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
up that's the key and on top of that

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.660 
up that's the key and on top of that
it's<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.109> about<00:00:58.289> weighing<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.859> risk<00:00:59.129> versus

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
it's all about weighing the risk versus

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.369 
it's all about weighing the risk versus
your<00:00:59.850> reward<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.570> you're<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> big

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
your reward if you're at a big

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.200 
your reward if you're at a big
disadvantage<00:01:01.590> because<00:01:02.340> maybe<00:01:02.550> your<00:01:02.789> champion

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
disadvantage because maybe your champion

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.119 
disadvantage because maybe your champion
is<00:01:03.359> weak<00:01:03.600> early<00:01:04.110> or<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.860> might<00:01:05.010> get

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
is weak early or you think you might get

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.190 
is weak early or you think you might get
ganked<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.700> you're<00:01:05.850> getting<00:01:05.970> pushed<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.570> then

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
ganked or you're getting pushed in then

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.440 
ganked or you're getting pushed in then
yes<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.890> fight<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.280> probably<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:08.939> worth<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
yes the fight is probably not worth it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.820 
yes the fight is probably not worth it
but<00:01:09.810> there's<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> lot<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> things<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.680> can

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
but there's a lot of things that can

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.440 
but there's a lot of things that can
make<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.130> go<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.400> your<00:01:11.430> favor<00:01:11.790> assuming<00:01:12.360> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
make it go in your favor assuming you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.520 
make it go in your favor assuming you
don't<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> worry<00:01:13.049> about<00:01:13.110> those<00:01:13.470> things

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
don't have to worry about those things

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.950 
don't have to worry about those things
to<00:01:14.369> lower<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.820> risk<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.299> increase<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
to lower the risk and increase the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140 
to lower the risk and increase the
reward<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.830> totally<00:01:17.490> worth<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.030> go

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
reward to make it totally worth it to go

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.440 
reward to make it totally worth it to go
for<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> play<00:01:19.759> now<00:01:20.759> with<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.119> being<00:01:21.299> said

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
for a play now with that being said

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.020 
for a play now with that being said
there's<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.200> ton<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.619> solid<00:01:23.100> reasons<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.820> fight

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
there's a ton of solid reasons to fight

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030 
there's a ton of solid reasons to fight
early<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> game<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.470> first<00:01:25.619> being<00:01:25.950> that

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
early in the game the first being that

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.649 
early in the game the first being that
you<00:01:26.250> are<00:01:26.280> relatively<00:01:26.880> free<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.390> jungle

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
you are relatively free of jungle

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.630 
you are relatively free of jungle
pressure<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.799> first<00:01:29.009> clear<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> only

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
pressure as the first clear is the only

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.550 
pressure as the first clear is the only
time<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.000> junglers<00:01:30.540> will<00:01:30.780> pretty<00:01:31.110> much<00:01:31.200> just

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
time that junglers will pretty much just

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.190 
time that junglers will pretty much just
not<00:01:31.829> gank<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.970> until<00:01:33.240> about<00:01:33.450> 3:20

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
not gank so you have until about 3:20

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.859 
not gank so you have until about 3:20
3:30<00:01:34.799> or<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.340> fight<00:01:35.640> your<00:01:35.820> opponent

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
3:30 or so to fight your opponent

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.270 
3:30 or so to fight your opponent
without<00:01:36.869> being<00:01:37.200> ganked<00:01:37.439> most<00:01:37.740> likely

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
without being ganked most likely

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.940 
without being ganked most likely
sometimes<00:01:39.210> junglers<00:01:39.720> might<00:01:40.110> chisa<00:01:40.560> gank

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
sometimes junglers might chisa gank

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.580 
sometimes junglers might chisa gank
level<00:01:41.310> 2<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:42.060> generally<00:01:42.630> everyone<00:01:43.110> tends<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
level 2 but generally everyone tends to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.800 
level 2 but generally everyone tends to
just<00:01:43.740> do<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> full<00:01:44.250> clear<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> then<00:01:45.240> look<00:01:45.570> for

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
just do a full clear and then look for

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.690 
just do a full clear and then look for
ganks<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> fight<00:01:47.040> early<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.520> get<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
ganks so if you fight early you get a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.580 
ganks so if you fight early you get a
really<00:01:47.970> nice<00:01:48.210> opportunity<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.140> fight<00:01:49.409> without

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
really nice opportunity to fight without

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
really nice opportunity to fight without
the<00:01:50.070> jungler<00:01:50.430> coming<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.060> without<00:01:51.479> really

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the jungler coming and without really

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.789 
the jungler coming and without really
having<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.140> ward<00:01:52.409> either<00:01:54.140> next<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.619> it's

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
having to ward either next is that it's

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.010 
having to ward either next is that it's
not<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.369> hard<00:01:56.700> at<00:01:56.880> all<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.390> set<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.780> good

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
not that hard at all to set up a good

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.840 
not that hard at all to set up a good
early<00:01:58.350> game<00:01:58.530> fight<00:01:58.829> all<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.399> really<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.670> to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
early game fight all you really have to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.940 
early game fight all you really have to
do<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.180> hit<00:02:00.329> level<00:02:00.540> 2<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.079> hit<00:02:01.259> level<00:02:01.409> 3<00:02:01.770> before

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
do is hit level 2 or hit level 3 before

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.130 
do is hit level 2 or hit level 3 before
your<00:02:02.250> opponent<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.420> such<00:02:03.869> a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
your opponent and you have such a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.649 
your opponent and you have such a
massive<00:02:04.439> advantage<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:06.000> difference<00:02:06.299> between

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
massive advantage the difference between

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.040 
massive advantage the difference between
level<00:02:06.840> 1<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.320> level<00:02:07.350> 2<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.700> big<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.509> is

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
level 1 and level 2 is just so big as is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.120 
level 1 and level 2 is just so big as is
the<00:02:10.229> difference<00:02:10.530> between<00:02:10.920> level<00:02:11.129> 2<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.670> level

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
the difference between level 2 and level

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.400 
the difference between level 2 and level
three<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:13.000> pushing<00:02:13.360> for<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.600> EXP<00:02:13.990> advantage

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
three that pushing for the EXP advantage

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.900 
three that pushing for the EXP advantage
and<00:02:14.590> then<00:02:14.680> fighting<00:02:15.070> can<00:02:15.250> lead<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.580> quite<00:02:15.850> a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
and then fighting can lead to quite a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.770 
and then fighting can lead to quite a
few<00:02:16.030> easy<00:02:16.390> kills<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:16.990> your<00:02:17.140> games<00:02:17.410> in<00:02:18.780> addition

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
few easy kills in your games in addition

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.390 
few easy kills in your games in addition
a<00:02:19.900> lot<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.230> players<00:02:20.530> tend<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.040> make<00:02:21.190> mistakes

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
a lot of players tend to make mistakes

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.880 
a lot of players tend to make mistakes
early<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:22.210> only<00:02:22.450> matter<00:02:22.930> if<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.590> make<00:02:23.740> those

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
early that only matter if you make those

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.440 
early that only matter if you make those
mistakes<00:02:24.160> early<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.910> game<00:02:25.120> such<00:02:25.420> as

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
mistakes early in the game such as

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.780 
mistakes early in the game such as
before<00:02:25.840> level<00:02:26.140> four<00:02:26.410> or<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.890> things<00:02:27.550> like

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
before level four or so things like

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.550 
before level four or so things like

opponent's level one two or three power
spike<00:02:35.410> is<00:02:35.770> just<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.160> handful<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.580> mistakes<00:02:37.030> that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
spike is just a handful of mistakes that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.600 
spike is just a handful of mistakes that
a<00:02:37.270> lot<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.660> players<00:02:37.870> make<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:39.160> reason<00:02:39.490> for

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
a lot of the players make the reason for

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.490 
a lot of the players make the reason for
this<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.300> very<00:02:40.630> large<00:02:40.930> majority<00:02:41.170> of

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
this is that a very large majority of

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.190 
this is that a very large majority of
players<00:02:41.920> are<00:02:42.280> super<00:02:43.030> lazy<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:43.870> they<00:02:43.990> don't

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
players are super lazy and so they don't

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.110 
players are super lazy and so they don't
really<00:02:44.380> pay<00:02:44.500> attention<00:02:44.680> since<00:02:45.520> those<00:02:45.790> kinds

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
really pay attention since those kinds

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.700 
really pay attention since those kinds
of<00:02:46.180> things<00:02:46.390> won't<00:02:46.570> really<00:02:46.810> matter<00:02:47.110> once<00:02:47.530> they

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
of things won't really matter once they

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.950 
of things won't really matter once they
hit<00:02:47.830> level<00:02:48.040> four<00:02:48.370> anyways<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.660> players

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
hit level four anyways and so players

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.200 
hit level four anyways and so players
tend<00:02:50.320> to<00:02:50.440> play<00:02:50.620> super<00:02:51.010> passive<00:02:51.430> up<00:02:51.550> until<00:02:52.060> that

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
tend to play super passive up until that

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.420 
tend to play super passive up until that
point<00:02:52.270> but<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.380> can<00:02:53.620> take<00:02:53.830> advantage<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.340> this

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
point but you can take advantage of this

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.950 
point but you can take advantage of this
by<00:02:54.640> fighting<00:02:54.970> at<00:02:55.180> level<00:02:55.450> one<00:02:55.630> two<00:02:55.780> or<00:02:55.930> three

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
by fighting at level one two or three

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.260 
by fighting at level one two or three
and<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.870> addition<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.950> power<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.550> combat

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
and in addition the power of combat

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.090 
and in addition the power of combat
summoner<00:03:01.750> spells<00:03:02.080> in<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.290> early<00:03:02.590> levels<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.070> a

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
summoner spells in the early levels is a

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.240 
summoner spells in the early levels is a
lot<00:03:03.460> weaker<00:03:03.790> for<00:03:04.600> example<00:03:05.170> at<00:03:05.320> level<00:03:05.800> one<00:03:06.040> a

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
lot weaker for example at level one a

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.300 
lot weaker for example at level one a
health<00:03:06.670> potion<00:03:07.000> will<00:03:07.390> heal<00:03:07.780> for<00:03:08.380> more<00:03:08.830> than<00:03:09.160> an

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
health potion will heal for more than an

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.540 
health potion will heal for more than an
ignite<00:03:09.820> deals<00:03:10.300> damage<00:03:10.840> for<00:03:11.110> even<00:03:11.950> including

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
ignite deals damage for even including

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.820 
ignite deals damage for even including
the<00:03:12.580> healing<00:03:12.970> debuff<00:03:13.360> through<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.440> debuff

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
the healing debuff through the debuff

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.010 
the healing debuff through the debuff
ignite<00:03:15.310> will<00:03:15.520> deal<00:03:15.700> 70<00:03:16.270> damage<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.870> the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
ignite will deal 70 damage and the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.860 
ignite will deal 70 damage and the
potion<00:03:17.440> will<00:03:17.590> heal<00:03:17.860> for<00:03:18.160> 75<00:03:18.820> damage<00:03:19.360> so<00:03:19.750> the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
potion will heal for 75 damage so the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.050 
potion will heal for 75 damage so the
ignite<00:03:20.230> becomes<00:03:20.710> completely<00:03:21.370> useless<00:03:21.580> and

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
ignite becomes completely useless and

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
significant because it means you can

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.500 
significant because it means you can
start<00:04:11.860> carrying<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.580> game<00:04:12.790> as<00:04:13.000> soon<00:04:13.360> as
