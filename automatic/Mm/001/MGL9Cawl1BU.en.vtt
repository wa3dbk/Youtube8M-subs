00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
frames at 1920 x 1080 which is just

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.589 
frames at 1920 x 1080 which is just
obviously<00:03:57.439> common<00:03:57.829> sense<00:03:58.099> but<00:03:58.370> when<00:03:59.299> it<00:03:59.390> comes

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
obviously common sense but when it comes

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.179 
obviously common sense but when it comes
to<00:03:59.750> Phi<00:03:59.900> Phi<00:04:00.200> it's<00:04:00.530> still<00:04:00.739> having<00:04:00.950> a<00:04:01.010> major

push into activate man evasion okay what

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:53.500 
push into activate man evasion okay what
the<00:04:44.590> hell<00:04:44.710> have<00:04:44.889> to<00:04:44.980> do<00:04:45.190> it<00:04:45.220> oh<00:04:47.250> come<00:04:48.250> on<00:04:48.400> dude

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.990 

GPU<00:04:54.510> one<00:04:54.780> usage<00:04:55.290> is<00:04:57.020> ninety-seven<00:04:58.020> percent

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
GPU one usage is ninety-seven percent

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.850 
GPU one usage is ninety-seven percent
memory<00:05:00.000> usage<00:05:00.180> is<00:05:00.620> 1.5<00:05:01.620> gig<00:05:03.800> gpgpu<00:05:05.360> two<00:05:06.360> is<00:05:06.860> at

memory usage is 1.5 gig gpgpu two is at
ninety-eight<00:05:08.220> percent<00:05:08.340> so<00:05:08.700> it's<00:05:08.880> pretty<00:05:08.970> much

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
ninety-eight percent so it's pretty much

ninety-eight percent so it's pretty much
using<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.840> CP<00:05:10.410> GPUs<00:05:11.160> properly<00:05:12.290> okay<00:05:13.290> and<00:05:13.790> what

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
using the CP GPUs properly okay and what

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.300 
using the CP GPUs properly okay and what
kind<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.000> 281<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.480> have<00:05:15.660> to<00:05:15.810> fix<00:05:15.960> that<00:05:16.310> but

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
kind of 281 I have to fix that but

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.450 
kind of 281 I have to fix that but
otherwise<00:05:17.550> I'm<00:05:18.090> it's<00:05:18.480> running<00:05:19.160> its<00:05:20.160> using

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
otherwise I'm it's running its using

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.540 
otherwise I'm it's running its using
about<00:05:20.610> 1.5<00:05:21.180> gigs<00:05:21.450> on<00:05:21.600> memory<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.169> the<00:05:22.550> usage

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
about 1.5 gigs on memory and the usage

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.890 
about 1.5 gigs on memory and the usage
is<00:05:23.730> getting<00:05:24.060> like<00:05:24.330> ninety-eight<00:05:24.750> percent
