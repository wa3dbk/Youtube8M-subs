00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
technology provided by real VNC so we've

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.369 
technology provided by real VNC so we've
been<00:00:59.699> working<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.059> real<00:01:00.329> VNC<00:01:00.570> denso<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
been working with real VNC denso the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.689 
been working with real VNC denso the
hardest<00:01:01.710> black<00:01:01.890> I'm<00:01:02.039> working<00:01:02.340> closely<00:01:02.579> with

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
hardest black I'm working closely with

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.100 
hardest black I'm working closely with
rim<00:01:03.030> obviously<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.570> make<00:01:03.870> sure<00:01:03.989> the

rim obviously to make sure the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469 
rim obviously to make sure the
integration<00:01:04.619> works<00:01:04.769> well<00:01:05.010> okay<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.119> one

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
integration works well okay so one

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.370 
integration works well okay so one

and<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.340> pretty<00:01:44.490> useful<00:01:44.729> from<00:01:45.000> that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and so it's pretty useful from that

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.580 
and so it's pretty useful from that
point<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.479> view<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.409> other<00:01:46.530> things

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
point of view one of the other things

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.280 
point of view one of the other things
that<00:01:46.860> we've<00:01:47.040> also<00:01:47.220> done<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.899> we've<00:01:48.899> enabled

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
that we've also done is we've enabled

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.620 
that we've also done is we've enabled
and<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.189> control<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.240> we've<00:01:51.390> got

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
and we have control because we've got

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.969 
and we have control because we've got
the<00:01:51.720> car<00:01:51.899> signals<00:01:52.320> where<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.860> actually

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the car signals where you can actually

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.620 
the car signals where you can actually
control<00:01:53.369> which<00:01:53.579> apps<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:54.030> want<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.270> show<00:01:54.420> or

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
control which apps we want to show or

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.480 
control which apps we want to show or
not<00:01:54.810> show<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.619> we've<00:01:55.770> got<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> telly<00:01:56.159> nerve<00:01:56.340> up

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
not show so we've got a telly nerve up

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.999 
not show so we've got a telly nerve up
here<00:01:56.930> navigation<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.140> helps<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.500> driving<00:01:58.770> aid

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
here navigation it helps to driving aid

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.530 
here navigation it helps to driving aid
so<00:01:59.369> we've<00:01:59.520> enabled<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.000> app<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.450> will

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
so we've enabled this app and it will

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.819 
so we've enabled this app and it will
give<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.689> traffic<00:02:00.930> information<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.590> give<00:02:01.740> you

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
give you traffic information to give you

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.819 
give you traffic information to give you
ten<00:02:02.040> by<00:02:02.159> ten<00:02:02.369> guidance<00:02:02.790> okay<00:02:03.600> now<00:02:04.110> obviously

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
ten by ten guidance okay now obviously

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.740 
ten by ten guidance okay now obviously
smartphones<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.790> cars<00:02:06.000> they<00:02:06.240> offer<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.509> lot<00:02:06.540> of

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
smartphones and cars they offer a lot of

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.999 
smartphones and cars they offer a lot of
technology<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.469> we<00:02:07.590> don't<00:02:07.649> want<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> show

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
technology and we don't want to show

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.559 
technology and we don't want to show
everything<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> vehicles<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.270> motion

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
everything with the vehicles in motion

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.110 
everything with the vehicles in motion
okay<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.530> turn<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> audio<00:02:10.860> off<00:02:11.069> there<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
okay I just turn the audio off there and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.760 
okay I just turn the audio off there and
one<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.510> things<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:12.959> won't<00:02:13.140> do<00:02:13.349> is

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
one of the things that we won't do is

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.770 
one of the things that we won't do is
we<00:02:13.860> won't<00:02:14.070> allow<00:02:14.220> text<00:02:14.880> messaging<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.420> emails

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
we won't allow text messaging and emails

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.810 
we won't allow text messaging and emails
to<00:02:15.930> be<00:02:16.020> read<00:02:16.320> while<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.740> vehicles<00:02:17.040> emotion<00:02:17.400> so

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
to be read while the vehicles emotion so

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.490 
to be read while the vehicles emotion so
for<00:02:17.940> example<00:02:18.030> if<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.660> try<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:18.990> call<00:02:19.140> up<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.350> nap

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
for example if I try and call up a nap

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.440 
for example if I try and call up a nap
we<00:02:19.980> want<00:02:20.190> obviously<00:02:20.280> display<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.120> because

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
we want obviously display that because

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.940 
we want obviously display that because
the<00:02:21.510> drive<00:02:21.690> instruction<00:02:21.960> so<00:02:22.350> we<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.800> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the drive instruction so we have the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.770 
the drive instruction so we have the
control<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.340> do<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.760> right<00:02:23.850> but<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.450> are<00:02:24.600> you

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
control to do that right but you are you

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.360 
control to do that right but you are you
did<00:02:24.960> say<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.170> me<00:02:25.320> that<00:02:25.590> potentially<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.340> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
did say to me that potentially in the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.550 
did say to me that potentially in the
future<00:02:26.460> that<00:02:26.910> could<00:02:26.940> be<00:02:27.120> changed<00:02:27.240> because<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
future that could be changed because the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.650 
future that could be changed because the
real<00:02:28.860> VNC<00:02:29.280> protocol<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:29.940> very<00:02:30.120> flexible

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
real VNC protocol is very flexible

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.000 
real VNC protocol is very flexible
correct<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.230> one<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.650> things<00:02:31.680> we're

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
correct and one of the things we're

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.320 
correct and one of the things we're
trying<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.490> we<00:02:32.640> want<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.880> work<00:02:32.970> with<00:02:33.030> app

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
trying to do is we want to work with app

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.180 
trying to do is we want to work with app
developers<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:34.350> example<00:02:34.410> let's<00:02:34.770> just<00:02:35.070> say

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
developers so for example let's just say

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.950 
developers so for example let's just say
somebody<00:02:35.760> wants<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.120> develop<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.570> parking

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
somebody wants to develop and parking

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.200 
somebody wants to develop and parking
app<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.590> useful<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.310> car<00:02:38.520> it's<00:02:38.850> actually

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
app it's useful to the car it's actually

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.330 
app it's useful to the car it's actually
useful<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.780> need<00:02:40.020> now<00:02:40.530> if<00:02:40.710> we<00:02:40.920> work<00:02:41.130> with

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
useful to you need now if we work with

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.850 
useful to you need now if we work with
the<00:02:41.430> app<00:02:41.550> developer<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.540> can<00:02:42.810> understand<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
the app developer we can understand the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.950 
the app developer we can understand the
UI<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:44.730> make<00:02:44.940> sure<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:45.330> safe<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.840> then

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
UI we can make sure it's safe and then

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.450 
UI we can make sure it's safe and then
we<00:02:46.140> have<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.470> power<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.680> enable<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.400> feature

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
we have the power to enable that feature

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.460 
we have the power to enable that feature
when<00:02:48.060> it's<00:02:48.210> ready<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.690> we<00:02:48.810> will<00:02:48.900> certify<00:02:49.290> that

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
when it's ready so we will certify that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.140 
when it's ready so we will certify that
so<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.430> reasons<00:02:50.760> why<00:02:50.850> we're<00:02:51.000> talking

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
so one of the reasons why we're talking

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.330 
so one of the reasons why we're talking
about<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.540> technology<00:02:52.110> now<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.680> before<00:02:53.160> he

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
about this technology now and before he

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.310 
about this technology now and before he
goes<00:02:53.490> in<00:02:53.640> production<00:02:54.090> which<00:02:54.270> is<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.540> late<00:02:54.690> 2012

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
goes in production which is in late 2012

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.080 
goes in production which is in late 2012
so<00:02:55.740> we<00:02:55.920> can<00:02:56.070> work<00:02:56.220> with<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.490> app<00:02:56.580> developers

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
so we can work with the app developers

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.550 
so we can work with the app developers
and<00:02:57.240> actually<00:02:57.750> make<00:02:57.930> sure<00:02:58.200> we<00:02:58.380> have<00:02:58.530> that

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
and actually make sure we have that

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.520 
and actually make sure we have that
integration<00:02:59.070> in<00:02:59.310> place<00:02:59.490> right<00:03:00.240> so<00:03:00.720> what<00:03:01.380> else

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
integration in place right so what else

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.380 
integration in place right so what else
can<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.710> show<00:03:01.920> me<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.070> this<00:03:02.280> right<00:03:02.400> now<00:03:02.700> can

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
can you show me on this right now can

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.030 
can you show me on this right now can
you<00:03:03.450> tell<00:03:03.480> me<00:03:03.660> also<00:03:04.050> when<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.770> will<00:03:04.950> be

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
you tell me also when this will be

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.740 
you tell me also when this will be
available<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:06.030> any<00:03:06.180> data<00:03:06.420> for<00:03:06.630> that

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
available if we have any data for that

right most importantly always have a
top-four<00:04:08.880> battery<00:04:09.240> and<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.780> second<00:04:10.200> one<00:04:10.350> is

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
top-four battery and the second one is

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.520 
top-four battery and the second one is
it<00:04:10.709> enables<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.610> VNC<00:04:12.200> bandwidth<00:04:13.200> to

it enables the VNC bandwidth to

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.080 
it enables the VNC bandwidth to
obviously<00:04:13.800> push<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.280> screen<00:04:14.700> image<00:04:14.940> to

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
obviously push the screen image to

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.210 
obviously push the screen image to
display<00:04:15.239> and<00:04:15.720> potentially<00:04:16.410> data<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.890> be<00:04:17.010> fed

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
display and potentially data to be fed

back<00:04:17.370> for<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.669> car<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.209> asean<00:04:18.750> at<00:04:18.840> some<00:04:19.080> point

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
back for a car to asean at some point

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.960 
back for a car to asean at some point
that's<00:04:19.680> correct<00:04:19.919> so<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.489> is<00:04:20.669> one<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:20.880> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
that's correct so that is one of the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.490 
that's correct so that is one of the
important<00:04:21.359> things<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.870> then<00:04:22.020> journey<00:04:22.320> that

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
important things and then journey that

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.170 
important things and then journey that
we've<00:04:22.650> taken<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:23.070> Jagger<00:04:23.340> ease<00:04:23.550> were<00:04:23.820> embracing

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
we've taken a Jagger ease were embracing

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.850 
we've taken a Jagger ease were embracing
the<00:04:24.419> smartphone<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.169> one<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.830> things

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
the smartphone and one of the things

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.290 
the smartphone and one of the things
that<00:04:26.130> we'd<00:04:26.310> like<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.610> do<00:04:26.700> in<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.820> future

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
that we'd like to do in the future

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.809 
that we'd like to do in the future
to<00:04:27.419> use<00:04:27.599> the<00:04:27.750> signals<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.259> control<00:04:28.819> elements

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
to use the signals to control elements

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.240 
to use the signals to control elements
such<00:04:30.389> as<00:04:30.419> applications<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:31.379> one<00:04:31.680> example<00:04:31.830> you

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
such as applications and one example you

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.710 
such as applications and one example you
saw<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.639> is<00:04:32.759> we<00:04:33.090> can<00:04:33.240> actually<00:04:33.270> block

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
saw that is we can actually block

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.240 
saw that is we can actually block
certain<00:04:33.960> applications<00:04:34.680> right<00:04:34.830> from<00:04:35.129> the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
certain applications right from the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.980 
certain applications right from the
vehicle<00:04:35.400> signals<00:04:35.849> and<00:04:36.030> so<00:04:36.240> of<00:04:36.419> course<00:04:36.599> here<00:04:36.870> we

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
vehicle signals and so of course here we

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.260 
vehicle signals and so of course here we
are<00:04:37.139> black<00:04:37.379> very<00:04:37.590> well<00:04:37.830> but<00:04:38.159> you<00:04:38.400> said<00:04:38.729> your

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
are black very well but you said your

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.029 
are black very well but you said your
approach<00:04:39.569> is<00:04:39.599> very<00:04:39.750> agnostic<00:04:40.050> at<00:04:40.560> this<00:04:40.740> point

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
approach is very agnostic at this point

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.890 
approach is very agnostic at this point
because<00:04:41.310> this<00:04:41.550> is<00:04:41.669> real<00:04:41.819> VNC<00:04:42.090> so<00:04:42.449> it's<00:04:42.569> an<00:04:42.659> open

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
because this is real VNC so it's an open

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.080 
because this is real VNC so it's an open
protocol<00:04:43.319> obviously<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.400> demonstration

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
protocol obviously the demonstration

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.490 
protocol obviously the demonstration
