00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.130
 hi to all the guys from spazioogames 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.049
 I'm Dr. Weitz and I'm here on 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.000
 its own official space for games 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.389
 to inaugurate my column which 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.130
 will involve the fifa game 13 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.960
 in particular I will deal with the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.600
 methods completed but reviewed gradually 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.270
 various different players on the team 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.029
 of the week and however worthy of 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.580
 a review to start I chose a 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.320
 player probably hated by many 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.529
 of you since the player anyway 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.149
 much used is also very strong me 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.770
 apparently it remained bonanni david luiz 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.690
 but this time I don't bring you the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.399
 basic version then the defender 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.550
 central but the man of the match version 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.170
 output last week to reward the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.050
 Brazilian player after the splendid 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.590
 his chelsea's performance against the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.480
 benfica 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.760
 the first thing that catches your eye 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.410
 seeing the card of david luiz is the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.329
 fact that has been turned into a 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.010
 central defensive midfielder is the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.579
 contrary to the basic card that defender 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.520
 central 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.250
 this is very important for david luiz 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.559
 in fact in my opinion as a defender 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.270
 central is wasted in fact has of the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.049
 excellent states that are great for a 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.390
 midfielder 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.040
 especially in series talking about the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.990
 world games the world race 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.580
 for those who do not know it is the tendency to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.140
 player to participate is the stage 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.150
 offensive than defensive 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.570
 there are therefore two work racing worlds 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.850
 offensive race and defensive workspace in 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.470
 particularly, an offensive word trade 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.960
 high then a player who participates 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.579
 very actively in the offensive maneuver 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.500
 average defensive world race so it is not 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.060
 always present on defense 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.560
 this for a defender a big one 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.060
 disadvantage while for a midfielder 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.700
 is very good 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.810
 the main statistics that between a 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.090
 jump went to improve in this 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.399
 player are definitely the shot 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.310
 the passage is the dripping let's start though 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.049
 from shooting the shot is very good indeed 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.970
 david lewis combines great power 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.040
 shooting with a great shot from the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.960
 distance so you can solve many 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.710
 games simply by pulling even 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.930
 30 meters for the spaces will mark a note 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.969
 negative but it is also justified 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.729
 counting that he is not a striker is the 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.320
 low finalization so sometimes in the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.170
 1 against 1 against the goalkeeper will fail 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.170
 mag you can justify and understand the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.990
 dribbling 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.670
 the passages are also very good 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.530
 certainly don't expect a player 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.390
 maybe how andrea pirlo able to do 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.250
 throw 50 meters but we don't have to 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.709
 forget that David Lewis is born 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.890
 central defender where the statistics 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.750
 to spend bie are not often 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.209
 main prerogative therefore anyway 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.580
 a very good player in these too 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.040
 statistics force filters physical strength 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.170
 as you may already know if you have tried 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.630
 the base player is really good 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.250
 will quietly move most of the 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.170
 opposing players 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.540
 other merit and david luiz and of the fact 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.769
 that he is a very versatile player 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.180
 in fact you can use it in 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.670
 many roles both as a midfielder 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.860
 central to have in a three midfield 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.330
 be also playmaker you could 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.489
 hazard this thing then a 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.670
 trequartista to exploit his great 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.500
 throws and in any case the excellent known passages 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.350
 negative of this player 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.840
 the price certainly is not up 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.580
 everyone can afford 300,000 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.769
 credits needed to buy this 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.500
 extra player the three stars comes 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.030
 weak and the three stars so not trick 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.299
 is able to jump with dribbles 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.209
 more difficult and it is not that with the foot 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.250
 weak that in his case to the left well 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.180
 guys with today we ended with 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.030
 this review 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.350
 the first review on spazioogames.it if 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.570
 you liked the video left a layman

 a comment subscribe to the channel us there 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.560

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.250

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.120
 this channel 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.120
