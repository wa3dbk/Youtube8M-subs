00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.840
 The diamond is gorgeous 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.160
 The best thing about Maine Craft 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.700
 There is nothing better than diamonds 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.040
 what's this noise 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.200
 I hope this is not what I think 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.400
 I think I know where this sound comes from 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.840
 The soil is gorgeous 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.840
 The best thing about Maine Craft 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.940
 The dirt and wooohoo 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.620
 The soil is fun 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.920
 Amazing 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.760
 I hate these people 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.900
 Why do they like dirt a lot? 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.180
 This is illogical 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.080
 I hope the dust disappears 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.680
 Then they have nothing to boast about 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:34.960
 If the dirt became rare 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.440
 orepros by 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.240
 I heard that the dirt is now scarce 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.560
 This is a ridiculous idea 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.780
 It just makes the environment ugly 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.900
 Who will look for dirt 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.520
 !!!No !! The soil is rare 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.680
 We must look for it throughout the day 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.760
 We will find it 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.520
 A few minutes later 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.120
 The soil is rare now 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.600
 I need to find some of them, it's rare, so be great 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.980
 But how do I find it? 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.760
 I can help you 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.040
 What if you give me Stack diamond blocks? 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.220
 For a guide to find dirt 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.400
 Without him you will never find dust 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.700
 What did you say ? 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.900
 I think you are right 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.040
 The soil is now rare 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.580
 I need a guide to find some 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.140
 ...Here 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.660
 Take the diamond blocks 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.780
 Thanks for the diamonds, Nub 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.380
 ... 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.120
 come back here 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.380
 Give me the diamond 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.160
 at the same time 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.580
 Time is impossible 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.640
 I will find dust 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.880
 Amazing ... this sounds very simple 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.060
 The dirt is not very rare 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.220
 Oh, okay 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.100
 It's time to find the dirt 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.700
 After 452 bum 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.560
 I can not believe this 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.480
 Finally found a dust 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.480
 Everyone will be cocky of me 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.480
 Spend another 452 days to find the dirt worth 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.480
 Coarse dust 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.280
 Are you serious? 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.280
 This is not ordinary dust 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.280
 You must be playing with me 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.600
 What a beautiful sunny day 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.760
 Wow !! It's Saadi's day 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.700
 I found dust 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.260
 Why people say it is impossible to find it 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.920
 I just walked for 5 minutes and found it 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.420
 Later 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.060
 what a beautiful day 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.800
 Peace and peace 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.480
 Nothing can ruin this day 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.900
 Finally I can rest 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.960
 Is this dust? 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.160
 No no 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.900
 It's just accommodation 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.480
 I'm a player 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.140
 I am not a dusty mess 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.680
 Let's get the dirt 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.540
 No !!! Leave me alone 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.560
 Help me 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.700
 finally 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.340
 Now I can play Maine Craft a little 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.180
 I have not played for a while 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.520
 It's time to start playing 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.080
 Okay 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.040
 Where is the grass? 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.780
 This makes no sense 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.900
 What happened here? 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.000
 It's a new update 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.640
 The soil has become scarce 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.760
 Well, how do I find dirt? 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.640
 its very easy 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.560
 Here is a guide on how to find it 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.560
 By him I am sure you will find dirt 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.800
 Guide to finding dirt 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.600
 Page 1 of 50 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.820
 The game will be fantastic if the dirt is rare 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:08:01.600
 thank you for watching
