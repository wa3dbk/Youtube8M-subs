00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.120
 when I plan to open a cafe everyone does 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.549
 some calculations 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:19.230
 that's completely overlooked calendar 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:33.960
 plan and there are important points in it 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:49.500
 important and so march april may june august 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:52.680
 september december month this we drew 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.030
 Year I see it square because 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.800
 because here on these turns 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.710
 proceeds this happens turning 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.840
 moments changing 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.340
 and not only the restaurant business in 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.939
 man's head oh summer is over 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.490
 started in the fall he already thinks differently 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.909
 this can be observed in all areas 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.549
 look there you have downstairs 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.810
 three items we need from the calendar 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.869
 three point plan 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:25.380
 they are important the first summer in general to drink from 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.159
 there is a recession 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.740
 sly overheard and the rule of me letters 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.479
 which says selling there are those months 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.430
 cat whose name is the letter d then 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.820
 have and we get this here 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.200
 I fenced off the off season 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.899
 May June July August when I am the first time 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.310
 I worked my first cafe I expected that 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.270
 Well, we worked there in the fall and 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.329
 March 8 holiday is generally sold out here 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.040
 and we expected it to be Easter now and we 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.140
 now here is both money 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.299
 earn this raw material purchased something else 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:10.020
 then it was a huge disappointment in 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.790
 Easter no one in the company and can not be 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.040
 if we bring quality 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.329
 pre-training we 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.689
 and not some number of keys in front 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:19.280
 Easter but it's all in Easter all dies 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:23.359
 Appas just have to April 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:27.590
 mine usually here in may arise may 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:31.090
 holidays ever people have just 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.799
 opportunity to dump a week or 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.829
 1 sun pops out and they want to 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.920
 the air and everything I already have these things here is the effect 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:44.959
 beginning of may all institution let and let 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.150
 instantly summer as Michael spoke 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.209
 Zadornov one big nationwide 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.209
 celebration 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:57.709
 Here in the summer we have a recession but speak there 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.189
 there are no percentages it can be different 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.760
 not less huge not only catering 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.650
 other areas also thrive 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.650
 construction area but they have the volume 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.409
 that is, everyone is engaged in the stay of the boards 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.519
 canopy something else yes and accordingly 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:21.010
 this does not apply for example 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:24.650
 embankment bruges be at your risk 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.470
 have been to the address to remember that nabil along 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.290
 the beach 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.409
 the strongest sensation that is downloads oh 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.949
 here it is when four to five hours 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:39.470
 these people are roasted sun color with 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:42.199
 beach crawl here and here is the same 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.989
 fried fish there and steaks slept 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:48.769
 dzhotto hare that is there such here 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:51.769
 Cooper is not quite healthy food and yet 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.840
 less they have in the summer but they let 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.489
 empty the rest of the season too 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:05.299
 understandable reason that is, we are talking about 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:07.010
 standard yes here's the second speech I will name 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.769
 three factors then we consider them as 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:15.069
 they replaced each other ie first 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.069
 factor is summer sleep second factor
