00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.290
 hi girls, how are you waiting 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.790
 that they are well and today they 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.790
 I bring this nail design 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.660
 what is a galaxy nail style that 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.430
 super easy to do and do not really 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.740
 It takes a long time to do it so I'll 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.120
 I encourage you to do and you stay watching 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.460
 this video 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.390
 in the main thing that you should always put 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.580
 It's a tone that protects your nails in this 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.300
 I occupy this case because I like it a lot 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.580
 and leaves the surface of the nail smooth for 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.590
 what I'm going to apply next but 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.860
 If you do not have this, you can apply 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.570
 simply a shine any brightness 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.510
 that helps you protect or some basis 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.880
 vitaminada serves you very well our 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.640
 second tone that is so important is 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.559
 this a black tone 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.680
 these will be all the tones that I'm going to 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.680
 use 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.790
 I show you that he occupied this 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.119
 this blue so beautiful that is this 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.119
 brand 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.270
 which is very nice to look at 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.040
 and if this is what stage is very 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.930
 beautiful 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.930
 and do not occupy this pitch mints 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.420
 with this yellow tone of vision 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.250
 to give a more beautiful touch to our 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.920
 design I used a varnish with frost 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.259
 anyone with this style 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.240
 and it has very nice flashes that 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.060
 they pretend to be like stars so 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.259
 that I will occupy you to finish the design 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.259
 apply me a shine 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.490
 and also what it takes to do this 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.490
 effect against these sponges 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.300
 ok is to occupy some that is for 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.920
 makeup there is no problem and another 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.400
 very important thing that we are going to occupy 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.660
 it will be acetone and we will also occupy 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.610
 that useful to go removing oystein those 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.980
 excesses because obviously we're going to 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.620
 Staining the eyes is a very easy design 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.750
 so encourage yourself to do it 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.049
 here is the design stay to see the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.049
 video 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.380
 good first thing we must do to 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.140
 make this design on our nails something 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.980
 what is very important is to apply a 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.370
 shine you can occupy everything also in 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.380
 a base that is vitaminized or any 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.210
 thing what in another your dreams I in 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.600
 this case you already know that I always apply 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.600
 this 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.519
 I am dread 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.030
 you have to wait for it to dry well 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.550
 our second step will be to apply 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.910
 our base that will be this enamel 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.910
 black 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.530
 to me 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.450
 my dream 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.560
 everyone 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.060
 d 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.670
 good and after a few minutes is in 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:34.409
 reality more so so dry my nails and 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.269
 that is the goal because because for 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.159
 put more tones on me I feel that 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.970
 they are going to mix more and I like more 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:47.110
 effect well so that's how I'll do it the first 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:53.880
 it's lack that I'll put on will be this tone 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.880
 and I do it like that, I apply a little in 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:01.540
 here on a tip like that and this is where 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.219
 I start to apply and it is that they do not remain 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.770
 equal the nails so that it looks more 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.990
 beautiful 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.470
 then we will always apply 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.030
 little touches if you spend do not worry 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.820
 because right now with the other enamels 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.650
 let's go combining colors occupied 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.930
 the same sponge the same little bit that 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.930
 occupy so now let's apply this 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.460
 I'm going to apply this yellow 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.410
 let's apply this blue 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.780
 once we have done this we will 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.700
 to clean 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.870
 because obviously we have passed 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.880
 we have a lot 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.009
 a lot of nail polish outside the nail 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.350
 clean when you 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.890
 and do everything 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.890
 will was 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.820
 here 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.060
 and they would be clean 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.480
 and now what remains would be you 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.760
 You can apply a shine a top coat 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.070
 so that the design is protected and 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.540
 obviously the tones highlight even more what 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.180
 What I suggest is that if you want your 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:43.080
 design highlight further and see more 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.660
 nice is we're going to apply a glaze 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.060
 conguitos con escarcha what this will do 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.010
 enamel is that it will simulate that they are like 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.000
 little stars I like this effect 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.000
 so I'm going to apply 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.410
 s page 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.820
 d 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:06.270
 let's apply look how is 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:08.610
 Pregnant looks good and what would be missing 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.860
 and finally the brightness would be applied 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.520
 to protect the design that would be the 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.340
 design 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.310
 it looks good amount 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.940
 I like it very much, it looks good 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.420
 father 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.480
