two major differences from my current
lifestyle<00:00:36.300> right<00:00:36.649> one<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.129> would<00:00:38.250> be

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
lifestyle right one is that I would be

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.260 
lifestyle right one is that I would be
female<00:00:38.940> um<00:00:40.129> which<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.730> i'm<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:42.120> i'm

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
female um which you know i'm just i'm

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.869 
female um which you know i'm just i'm
not<00:00:42.540> i'm<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.350> sure<00:00:43.739> i'm<00:00:43.890> really<00:00:44.160> prepared<00:00:44.670> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
not i'm not sure i'm really prepared and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.950 
not i'm not sure i'm really prepared and
prepared<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:47.719> quite<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:48.930> being

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
prepared for that I quite like being

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.590 
prepared for that I quite like being
male<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.860> don't<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.210> would<00:00:51.329> be<00:00:51.420> kind

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
male I don't I think that would be kind

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.439 
male I don't I think that would be kind
of<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.750> radical<00:00:51.960> shift<00:00:52.699> what<00:00:53.699> would<00:00:53.879> probably

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
of a radical shift what would probably

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.600 
of a radical shift what would probably
be<00:00:54.600> even<00:00:54.870> more<00:00:55.289> radical<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> shift<00:00:56.309> is

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
be even more radical of a shift is

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.459 
be even more radical of a shift is
living<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.510> sea<00:00:58.879> because<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.719> mean<00:01:01.320> they

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
living in the sea because I mean they

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.779 
living in the sea because I mean they
have<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.859> they<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.280> whole<00:01:02.460> different

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
have that they have a whole different

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.729 
have that they have a whole different
society<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.840> not<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.379> change<00:01:04.619> in

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
society like it's not just a change in

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.170 
society like it's not just a change in
environment<00:01:04.860> right<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.700> would<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> change

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
environment right this would be a change

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.050 
environment right this would be a change
in<00:01:06.360> culture<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.430> you've<00:01:08.430> got<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.880> whole

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
in culture and you've got this whole

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
in culture and you've got this whole

fish<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.790> bottom<00:01:42.210> right<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.290> you're<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
fish on bottom right but if you're a

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.319 
fish on bottom right but if you're a
woman<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.979> top<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.060> would<00:01:45.180> mean

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
woman on top you know that would mean

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.880

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.359 
woman eyeballs and so you would just see
you<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> normal<00:01:51.360> human<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:52.070> they<00:01:53.070> can't

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you like a normal human but they can't

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.330 
you like a normal human but they can't
be<00:01:53.490> completely<00:01:54.350> human<00:01:55.350> woman<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.860> top<00:01:56.100> because

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
be completely human woman on top because

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.440 
be completely human woman on top because
then<00:01:56.549> they<00:01:56.640> would<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.790> lungs<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.360> they

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
then they would have lungs and they

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.609 
then they would have lungs and they
wouldn't<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.780> guilts<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.500> they<00:01:58.590> have

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
wouldn't have guilts like do they have

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.080 
wouldn't have guilts like do they have
gills<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.130> their<00:01:59.280> tail<00:01:59.490> somewhere<00:01:59.969> or

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
gills in their tail somewhere or

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.399 
gills in their tail somewhere or
something<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.479> don't<00:02:00.570> know<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.049> guess<00:02:01.259> that's

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
something I don't know so I guess that's

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.630 
something I don't know so I guess that's
kind<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.770> shaky<00:02:02.390> we<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.570> probably<00:02:03.869> assume

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
kind of shaky we can probably assume

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.510 
kind of shaky we can probably assume
that<00:02:05.960> they're<00:02:06.960> naturally<00:02:07.590> suited<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.369> their

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that they're naturally suited to their

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.249 
that they're naturally suited to their
environment<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.629> getting<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:10.140> weird

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
environment this is getting really weird

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.760 
environment this is getting really weird
um<00:02:11.720> ok<00:02:12.720> so

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
um ok so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.160 
um ok so
so<00:02:14.490> they're<00:02:14.640> probably<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:15.420> see<00:02:15.630> further<00:02:15.900> than

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
so they're probably can see further than

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.200 
so they're probably can see further than
weekend<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.740> water<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.640> maybe<00:02:17.880> it's<00:02:18.090> not

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
weekend in the water so maybe it's not

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.180 
weekend in the water so maybe it's not
so<00:02:18.390> much<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.750> concern<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.410> being<00:02:19.890> surrounded

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
so much of a concern of being surrounded

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.470 
so much of a concern of being surrounded
by<00:02:20.490> this<00:02:20.550> stuff<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.030> can't<00:02:21.270> see<00:02:21.450> through

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
by this stuff that you can't see through

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.870 
by this stuff that you can't see through
as<00:02:21.810> well<00:02:22.130> because<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.220> just<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.520> don't<00:02:23.580> like<00:02:23.850> that

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
as well because I just I don't like that

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.140 
as well because I just I don't like that
I<00:02:24.060> don't<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.540> idea<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.840> being<00:02:25.050> like<00:02:25.290> open

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
I don't like the idea of being like open

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.840 
I don't like the idea of being like open
to<00:02:27.150> all<00:02:27.420> sides<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.740> sharks<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.490> things

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
to all sides to like sharks and things

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.610 
to all sides to like sharks and things
that<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:30.390> can't<00:02:30.660> see<00:02:30.870> until<00:02:31.170> they're<00:02:31.350> really

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
that you can't see until they're really

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.610 
that you can't see until they're really
close<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:33.300> you're<00:02:33.600> just<00:02:33.720> exposed<00:02:34.320> and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
close and and you're just exposed and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.370 
close and and you're just exposed and
you<00:02:34.740> can't<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.340> mean<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.730> mermaid<00:02:36.150> can<00:02:37.080> swim

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
you can't but I mean a mermaid can swim

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.110 
you can't but I mean a mermaid can swim
around<00:02:37.620> quickly<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.430> they're<00:02:38.610> naturally

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
around quickly like they're naturally

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.380 
around quickly like they're naturally
suited<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> water<00:02:40.140> but<00:02:41.090> maybe<00:02:42.090> if<00:02:42.300> you

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
suited to the water but maybe if you

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.810 
suited to the water but maybe if you
didn't<00:02:42.630> grow<00:02:42.900> up<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.470> environment<00:02:43.820> maybe

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
didn't grow up in that environment maybe

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.940 
didn't grow up in that environment maybe
it<00:02:45.240> wouldn't<00:02:45.570> be<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:46.470> would<00:02:46.650> still<00:02:46.800> be

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
it wouldn't be it would still be

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.120 
it wouldn't be it would still be
difficult<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:48.350> would<00:02:49.350> be<00:02:49.380> rough<00:02:49.710> okay

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
difficult this just would be rough okay

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.830 
difficult this just would be rough okay
and<00:02:50.310> that's<00:02:50.460> only<00:02:50.670> half<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.270> we<00:02:51.450> said<00:02:51.630> we

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
and that's only half of it we said we

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.780 
and that's only half of it we said we
need<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.050> talk<00:02:52.140> about<00:02:52.310> having<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.400> mermaid

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
need to talk about having a mermaid

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.690 
need to talk about having a mermaid
girlfriend<00:02:54.450> man<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.230> would<00:02:55.380> be<00:02:55.530> like<00:02:56.520> that

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
girlfriend man that would be like that

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.520 
girlfriend man that would be like that
would<00:02:56.790> be<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.910> difficult<00:02:57.180> relationship<00:02:57.600> one<00:02:58.380> of

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
would be a difficult relationship one of

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.200 
would be a difficult relationship one of
you<00:02:58.620> who<00:02:58.740> lives<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.220> water<00:02:59.400> one<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.120> you

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
you who lives in the water one of you

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.700 
you who lives in the water one of you
lives<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.630> land<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.110> can't<00:03:01.350> really

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
lives on land you can't really

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.370 
lives on land you can't really
intermingle<00:03:02.580> all<00:03:03.210> that<00:03:03.450> much<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.930> assume<00:03:04.230> a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
intermingle all that much I assume a

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.140 
intermingle all that much I assume a
mermaid<00:03:04.740> can't<00:03:05.040> survive<00:03:05.370> for<00:03:05.760> too<00:03:05.910> long

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
mermaid can't survive for too long

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.780 
mermaid can't survive for too long
outside<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.900> water<00:03:07.260> unless<00:03:07.620> she<00:03:08.430> had<00:03:08.610> like<00:03:08.760> a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
outside of water unless she had like a

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.330 
outside of water unless she had like a
special<00:03:09.270> tank<00:03:09.540> set<00:03:10.050> up<00:03:10.200> in<00:03:10.440> your<00:03:10.500> house<00:03:11.010> or

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
special tank set up in your house or

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.690 
special tank set up in your house or
something<00:03:11.610> maybe<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.180> can<00:03:12.300> do<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:13.520> but<00:03:14.520> then

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
something maybe you can do that but then

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.170 
something maybe you can do that but then
she'd<00:03:14.910> never<00:03:15.060> see<00:03:15.330> your<00:03:15.450> family<00:03:16.640> just<00:03:17.640> it's

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
she'd never see your family just it's

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.060 
she'd never see your family just it's
very<00:03:18.330> complicated<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:22.320> really<00:03:22.770> what

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
very complicated so and really what

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.699 
very complicated so and really what
would<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.750> how<00:03:24.750> could<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.080> work<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.560> have

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
would you how could that work you have

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.300 
would you how could that work you have
very<00:03:26.100> very<00:03:26.490> different<00:03:26.610> life<00:03:27.060> experiences<00:03:28.310> but

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
very very different life experiences but

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.560 
very very different life experiences but
if<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.520> know<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.940> could<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.240> plus<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.140> I

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
if you know that could be a plus so I

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.420 
if you know that could be a plus so I
don't<00:03:33.570> know<00:03:33.709> feel<00:03:34.709> like<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:34.890> need<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.100> be<00:03:35.190> some

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.080 
having a mermaid girlfriend added to my
current<00:03:48.300> life<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:49.410> know<00:03:49.530> either<00:03:49.770> in<00:03:50.550> a<00:03:50.760> tank

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
current life you know either in a tank

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.510 
current life you know either in a tank
or<00:03:51.330> maybe<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.840> like<00:03:52.260> move<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.830> coast<00:03:53.070> or

or maybe I like move to the coast or

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.250 
or maybe I like move to the coast or
maybe<00:03:54.510> she<00:03:54.720> lives<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:54.990> a<00:03:55.080> lake<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.560> don't<00:03:55.950> know<00:03:56.209> I

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
maybe she lives in a lake I don't know I

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.310 
maybe she lives in a lake I don't know I
feel<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.740> would<00:03:58.980> be<00:03:59.360> much<00:04:00.360> less<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.990> a

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
feel like that would be much less of a

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.949 
feel like that would be much less of a
negative<00:04:01.730> disruption<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.760> my<00:04:03.120> life<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.780> could

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
negative disruption to my life and could

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.930 
negative disruption to my life and could
be<00:04:04.110> positive<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.890> mean<00:04:05.220> if<00:04:05.400> she's<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.610> nice<00:04:05.910> lady

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
be positive I mean if she's a nice lady

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.780 
be positive I mean if she's a nice lady
a<00:04:06.600> nice<00:04:07.170> mer<00:04:07.440> lady<00:04:07.940> um<00:04:10.100> but<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.370> think<00:04:11.610> that

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
a nice mer lady um but I think that

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.600 
a nice mer lady um but I think that
would<00:04:11.880> be<00:04:12.030> much<00:04:12.239> less<00:04:12.750> of<00:04:13.080> a<00:04:13.620> negative<00:04:14.070> then

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
would be much less of a negative then

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.659 
would be much less of a negative then
then<00:04:15.330> like<00:04:15.630> completely<00:04:16.200> changing<00:04:16.890> my<00:04:17.340> body

then like completely changing my body

then like completely changing my body
and<00:04:18.209> living<00:04:18.959> in<00:04:19.080> a<00:04:19.200> different<00:04:19.350> place<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:20.900> yeah
