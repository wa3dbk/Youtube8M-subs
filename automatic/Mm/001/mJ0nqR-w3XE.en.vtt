this<00:02:50.690> car<00:02:50.930> would<00:02:51.080> have<00:02:51.230> without<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.710> turbo

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
this car would have without the turbo

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.230 
this car would have without the turbo
that's<00:02:52.490> maybe<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.850> downside<00:02:53.630> but<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:55.970> kind

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
that's maybe a downside but it is kind

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.770 
that's maybe a downside but it is kind
of<00:02:56.300> fun<00:02:57.670> but<00:02:58.670> then<00:02:58.850> we<00:02:58.970> start<00:02:59.240> thinking<00:02:59.630> about

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
of fun but then we start thinking about

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.130 
of fun but then we start thinking about
what<00:03:00.710> other<00:03:00.860> cars<00:03:01.190> can<00:03:01.460> you<00:03:01.760> get<00:03:02.060> for<00:03:02.570> the

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
what other cars can you get for the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.580 
what other cars can you get for the
price<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.620> an<00:03:03.740> our<00:03:03.860> line<00:03:04.100> turbo<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.990> our<00:03:06.170> line

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
price of an our line turbo the our line

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.660 
price of an our line turbo the our line
starts<00:03:07.190> at<00:03:07.340> 24<00:03:08.090> 995<00:03:09.190> now<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.490> might<00:03:10.640> not

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
starts at 24 995 now that might not

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.790 
starts at 24 995 now that might not
sound<00:03:11.060> like<00:03:11.210> a<00:03:11.330> lot<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.630> money<00:03:11.840> until<00:03:12.680> you

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
sound like a lot of money until you

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.090 
sound like a lot of money until you
start<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.190> think<00:03:13.400> about<00:03:13.490> cars<00:03:13.970> like<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.660> Ford

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
start to think about cars like the Ford

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.970 
start to think about cars like the Ford
Mustang<00:03:16.100> or<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.300> Chevy<00:03:17.630> Camaro<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.590> Camaro

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
Mustang or the Chevy Camaro the Camaro

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.600 
Mustang or the Chevy Camaro the Camaro
for<00:03:19.250> instance<00:03:19.640> starts<00:03:19.940> at<00:03:20.090> 1<00:03:20.810> under<00:03:21.610> $24,000

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
for instance starts at 1 under $24,000

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.160 
for instance starts at 1 under $24,000
and<00:03:22.820> has<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.270> 323<00:03:24.230> horsepower<00:03:24.680> v6<00:03:25.570> okay<00:03:26.570> so

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
and has a 323 horsepower v6 okay so

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.840 
and has a 323 horsepower v6 okay so
you've<00:03:27.650> got<00:03:27.680> more<00:03:27.950> power<00:03:28.220> with<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.550> Camaro

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
you've got more power with the Camaro

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.660 
you've got more power with the Camaro
but<00:03:29.090> surely<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.870> beetle<00:03:30.200> is<00:03:30.350> more<00:03:31.160> frugal

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
but surely the beetle is more frugal

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.230 
but surely the beetle is more frugal
right

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
right

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.920 
right
well<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.620> Arline<00:03:34.160> gets<00:03:34.490> 31<00:03:34.970> miles<00:03:35.360> per<00:03:35.630> gallon

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
well the Arline gets 31 miles per gallon

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.500 
well the Arline gets 31 miles per gallon
on<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.140> highway<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.680> Camaro<00:03:37.070> gets<00:03:37.280> 30<00:03:37.670> so

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
on the highway and the Camaro gets 30 so

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.810 
on the highway and the Camaro gets 30 so
they're<00:03:38.690> pretty<00:03:38.930> close<00:03:39.200> if<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.430> were<00:03:40.580> to<00:03:40.670> go

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
they're pretty close if you were to go

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.770 
they're pretty close if you were to go
down<00:03:41.050> grade-a<00:03:42.050> beetle<00:03:42.770> to<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.130> base<00:03:43.340> engine

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
down grade-a beetle to the base engine

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.510 
down grade-a beetle to the base engine
you're<00:03:44.780> still<00:03:45.080> only<00:03:45.260> getting<00:03:45.530> 33<00:03:46.130> miles<00:03:46.370> per

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
you're still only getting 33 miles per

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.500 
you're still only getting 33 miles per
gallon<00:03:47.030> so<00:03:47.840> unless<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.320> jump<00:03:48.530> up<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.740> a<00:03:48.920> diesel

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
gallon so unless you jump up to a diesel

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.000 
gallon so unless you jump up to a diesel
you're<00:03:50.510> not<00:03:50.690> gonna<00:03:50.870> be<00:03:51.080> getting<00:03:51.260> much<00:03:51.770> better

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
you're not gonna be getting much better

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.920 
you're not gonna be getting much better
gas<00:03:52.400> mileage<00:03:52.430> than<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.209> Camaro<00:03:53.630> or<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.840> Mustang

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
gas mileage than a Camaro or a Mustang

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.650 
gas mileage than a Camaro or a Mustang
so<00:03:56.200> inside<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.380> beetle<00:03:57.740> the<00:03:58.490> Arline<00:03:59.120> gives<00:03:59.540> a

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
so inside the beetle the Arline gives a

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.810 
so inside the beetle the Arline gives a
couple<00:03:59.959> upgrades<00:04:00.140> over<00:04:00.740> the<00:04:00.890> base<00:04:01.070> beetle<00:04:01.490> it

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
couple upgrades over the base beetle it

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.180 
couple upgrades over the base beetle it
gives<00:04:02.030> this<00:04:02.209> simulated<00:04:02.870> carbon<00:04:03.410> fiber<00:04:03.680> you

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
gives this simulated carbon fiber you

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.890 
gives this simulated carbon fiber you
notice<00:04:04.490> how<00:04:04.610> it<00:04:04.730> matches<00:04:04.910> my<00:04:05.450> ring<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:07.720> we<00:04:08.720> get

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
notice how it matches my ring and we get

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.070 
notice how it matches my ring and we get
these<00:04:09.050> piano<00:04:09.530> black<00:04:09.970> accents<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.510> base<00:04:11.720> cars

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
these piano black accents the base cars

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.590 
these piano black accents the base cars
come<00:04:12.410> with<00:04:12.440> body<00:04:12.860> coloured<00:04:13.340> accents<00:04:14.120> both<00:04:14.360> on

so<00:05:12.110> we<00:05:12.260> mentioned<00:05:12.680> that<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:13.270> beetle<00:05:14.270> our<00:05:14.540> line

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
so we mentioned that the beetle our line

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.490 
so we mentioned that the beetle our line
gets<00:05:15.640> 31<00:05:16.640> miles<00:05:17.030> per<00:05:17.210> gallon<00:05:17.660> on<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.900> highway

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
gets 31 miles per gallon on the highway

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.970 
gets 31 miles per gallon on the highway
well<00:05:19.190> our<00:05:19.400> real-world<00:05:20.260> experience<00:05:21.260> has

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
well our real-world experience has

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.360 
well our real-world experience has
resulted<00:05:22.340> in<00:05:22.640> 32<00:05:23.630> miles<00:05:24.050> per<00:05:24.230> gallon<00:05:24.800> I<00:05:25.010> was

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
resulted in 32 miles per gallon I was

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.970 
resulted in 32 miles per gallon I was
very<00:05:25.730> impressed<00:05:26.000> with<00:05:26.480> that<00:05:26.510> that<00:05:27.410> exceeds

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
very impressed with that that exceeds

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.550 
very impressed with that that exceeds
not<00:05:28.430> the<00:05:28.670> that's<00:05:29.060> not<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:29.510> average<00:05:30.080> rating

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
not the that's not the average rating

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.350 
not the that's not the average rating
that's<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.130> highway<00:05:31.760> rating<00:05:32.000> that<00:05:32.240> we

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
that's the highway rating that we

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.300 
that's the highway rating that we
exceeded<00:05:32.870> and<00:05:33.050> that<00:05:33.470> was<00:05:33.590> with<00:05:33.740> mixed<00:05:34.100> driving

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
exceeded and that was with mixed driving

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.930 
exceeded and that was with mixed driving
and<00:05:34.640> you<00:05:35.210> know<00:05:35.330> how<00:05:35.450> we<00:05:35.510> are<00:05:35.780> enthusiastic

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
and you know how we are enthusiastic

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:54.790 
and you know how we are enthusiastic
whenever<00:05:37.940> we<00:05:38.180> can

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.230 

we<00:05:55.800> really<00:05:56.099> enjoyed<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.400> handling<00:05:56.969> of<00:05:57.090> this

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
we really enjoyed the handling of this

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.270 
we really enjoyed the handling of this
car<00:05:57.509> though<00:05:57.750> you<00:05:58.289> know<00:05:58.379> normally<00:05:58.889> we<00:05:59.039> take<00:05:59.250> a

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
car though you know normally we take a

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
car though you know normally we take a
preference<00:05:59.819> to<00:06:00.030> rear-wheel<00:06:00.389> drive<00:06:00.419> cars<00:06:01.020> and

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
preference to rear-wheel drive cars and

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.439 
preference to rear-wheel drive cars and
this<00:06:03.300> car<00:06:04.340> handles<00:06:05.340> quite<00:06:05.729> well<00:06:05.969> despite

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
this car handles quite well despite

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.850 
this car handles quite well despite
being<00:06:06.719> front-wheel<00:06:07.229> drive<00:06:09.680> one<00:06:10.680> of<00:06:10.800> the

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
being front-wheel drive one of the

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.339 
being front-wheel drive one of the
things<00:06:11.099> that<00:06:11.310> no<00:06:11.430> doubt<00:06:11.669> helps<00:06:12.120> the<00:06:12.360> handling

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
things that no doubt helps the handling

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:14.959 
things that no doubt helps the handling
is<00:06:13.469> the<00:06:13.500> independent<00:06:14.069> rear<00:06:14.189> suspension<00:06:14.219> that

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:14.969 
is the independent rear suspension that

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.309 
is the independent rear suspension that
is<00:06:15.030> not<00:06:15.509> something<00:06:15.810> that<00:06:15.990> was<00:06:16.169> originally

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
is not something that was originally

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:20.570 
is not something that was originally
offered<00:06:17.129> when<00:06:17.340> we<00:06:17.900> revised<00:06:18.900> beetle<00:06:19.680> came<00:06:20.400> out

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
offered when we revised beetle came out

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.790 
offered when we revised beetle came out
years<00:06:21.060> ago<00:06:21.270> so<00:06:21.689> that<00:06:21.719> is<00:06:22.020> an<00:06:22.169> upgrade<00:06:22.560> that<00:06:22.590> is

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
years ago so that is an upgrade that is

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.659 
years ago so that is an upgrade that is
an<00:06:23.039> improvement

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
an improvement

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:34.689

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.040 
kudos to VW so has the beetle grown up
when<00:06:35.699> you<00:06:35.789> consider<00:06:36.180> that<00:06:36.270> there<00:06:36.509> are<00:06:36.629> cars<00:06:36.840> on

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
when you consider that there are cars on

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.050 
when you consider that there are cars on
the<00:06:37.139> market<00:06:37.289> like<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.830> Chevrolet<00:06:38.279> Spark<00:06:38.460> the

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
the market like the Chevrolet Spark the

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
think the answer is yes

think the answer is yes
the<00:06:45.689> real<00:06:45.870> question<00:06:46.469> though<00:06:46.620> is<00:06:46.800> can<00:06:47.400> it

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
the real question though is can it

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.939 
the real question though is can it
compete<00:06:47.819> with<00:06:48.000> the<00:06:48.090> Mustang<00:06:48.479> and<00:06:48.599> Camaro<00:06:48.990> that

compete with the Mustang and Camaro that
is<00:06:50.279> for<00:06:50.580> you<00:06:50.669> to<00:06:50.759> decide
