00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hello, how are you? I'm very happy 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.529
 up another week with you in a 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.529
 new video 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.900
 as many of you already know the 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.670
 vacations are over for many 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.830
 for others they still have a little 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.689
 to be about to finish and that's why 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.189
 today I bring a day just as it is going to 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.619
 serve a lot for this season of 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.570
 back to school the cool day of today is 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.249
 inspired by the carrie diaries or the 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.050
 carrie's diaries I do not know if you 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.519
 know the series if you do not know it, do not know 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.739
 worry I'll leave a link for 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.239
 here subtitled in Spanish in which 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.400
 you can see more or less what 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.170
 try this series if you like it so that 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.970
 you start to see me I love it because 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.130
 seriously it 's like that super romantic and 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.200
 it's like all retro then I think 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.970
 super chivas returning to the subject the video 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.320
 there's today will be inspired by this 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.150
 series and what we are going to do is 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.430
 customize our notebooks with 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.840
 our notebooks and this what 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.360
 let's do it in a very easy way 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.100
 very economical and super different and in 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.740
 seriously the end result will be very 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.710
 very very original so if the camera me 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.480
 accompanies let's see the tutorial for 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.010
 This tutorial is going to need a 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.229
 notebook of the most economical that 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.420
 find enamels of many colors and 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.890
 black paper to line the notebook if 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.540
 you have black spray paint 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.550
 you can use that paint to paint the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.659
 cover of your notebook but in this case 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.100
 I'm going to use paper 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.289
 to line because I think the idea 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.420
 from the diego to those that are economical 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.549
 and spray paint did not seem 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.200
 so cheap once we have lined 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.429
 our notebook we will cover the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.979
 surface on which we are working 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.840
 so that it will not be stained and now 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.240
 let's proceed to make patches of 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.099
 enamel in our notebook make sure 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.049
 make strong movements with your hands 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:37.649
 so that this effect is like lines 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.649
 Of paint 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.070
 i 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.080
 repeat this with various colors of 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.000
 enamel until you like how it looks like 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.010
 final when you're finished you're going to have 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.050
 something like this and in a corner 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.680
 you can paint a heart or you can 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.680
 write your name 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.979
 I like rustic finishes 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.119
 so I'm going to leave it like that but if you 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.280
 you want something a little more elaborate 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.409
 You can cover the final result with 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.149
 transparent contact paper or can you 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.830
 apply a layer of colbÃºn so that it 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.039
 see bright when the glue is 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.319

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.209
