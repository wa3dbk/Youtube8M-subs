in<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:01.230> video<00:00:01.439> I'm<00:00:01.709> going<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.979> be

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
in this video I'm going to be

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.710 
in this video I'm going to be
demonstrating<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.879> couple<00:00:03.179> more<00:00:03.300> bugs<00:00:03.570> that

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
demonstrating a couple more bugs that

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.470 
demonstrating a couple more bugs that
I've<00:00:03.929> done<00:00:04.049> in<00:00:04.110> Minecraft<00:00:04.650> had<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.980> do<00:00:05.100> with

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.480 
I've done in Minecraft had to do with

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.270 
I've done in Minecraft had to do with
interactions<00:00:06.480> between<00:00:06.799> redstone<00:00:07.799> elements

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
interactions between redstone elements

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.230 
interactions between redstone elements
and<00:00:08.490> pistons<00:00:10.490> one<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.580> these<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.730> actually<00:00:12.000> a

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
and pistons one of these is actually a

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.629 
and pistons one of these is actually a
bug<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.599> settling<00:00:13.200> just<00:00:13.440> showed<00:00:13.590> off<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:13.920> one

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
bug that settling just showed off in one

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.779 
bug that settling just showed off in one
of<00:00:14.670> his<00:00:14.790> bug<00:00:15.000> videos<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:17.250> prove<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.730> i

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
of his bug videos and I can prove that i

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.670 
of his bug videos and I can prove that i
found<00:00:18.119> independently<00:00:18.690> because<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:19.770> my<00:00:21.680> piston

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
found independently because in my piston

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.029 
found independently because in my piston
door<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.730> James<00:00:23.970> man<00:00:24.210> video<00:00:24.680> this<00:00:25.680> stuff<00:00:25.920> was

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
door for James man video this stuff was

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.670 
door for James man video this stuff was
in<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.250> background<00:00:26.640> already<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.029> just<00:00:27.680> just

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
in the background already I just just

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.769 
in the background already I just just
taken<00:00:29.010> me<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> month<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.880> find<00:00:30.330> time<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
taken me like a month to find time to

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.939 
taken me like a month to find time to
get<00:00:30.869> around<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.140> making<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.410> video<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.920> I

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
get around to making the video that I

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.370 
get around to making the video that I
just<00:00:32.189> saw<00:00:32.340> he<00:00:32.550> made<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.880> yesterday<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:34.350> of

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
just saw he made it yesterday so one of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.650 
just saw he made it yesterday so one of
these<00:00:34.500> bugs<00:00:34.770> has<00:00:34.920> already<00:00:35.040> been<00:00:35.450> shown<00:00:36.450> by

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
these bugs has already been shown by

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.119 
these bugs has already been shown by
someone<00:00:36.989> else<00:00:37.140> anyways<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:39.000> bug<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.300> want<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
someone else anyways the bug I want to

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.190 
someone else anyways the bug I want to
focus<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.309> today<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.610> related<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.600> bug

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
focus on today is related to the bug

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.660 
focus on today is related to the bug
where<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:45.829> piston<00:00:46.829> next<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
where if you have a piston next to a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.400 
where if you have a piston next to a
block<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.090> put<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> torch<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.809> top<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
block and you put a torch on top of the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.729 
block and you put a torch on top of the
block<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.280> piston<00:00:50.700> will<00:00:50.820> extend<00:00:51.500> this<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
block the piston will extend this is a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.590 
block the piston will extend this is a
bug<00:00:53.039> essentially<00:00:53.760> because<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> piston

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
bug essentially because the piston

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.340 
bug essentially because the piston
really<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:54.960> empowering<00:00:55.440> anything<00:00:57.260> but<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
really is empowering anything but the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.959 
really is empowering anything but the
piston<00:00:58.710> extends<00:00:59.160> anyway<00:00:59.430> or<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> sorry<00:00:59.879> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
piston extends anyway or the sorry the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.160 
piston extends anyway or the sorry the
torch<00:01:00.210> isn't<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:00.629> powering<00:01:00.899> anything

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
torch isn't really powering anything

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.270 
torch isn't really powering anything
with<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.379> piston<00:01:01.680> extents<00:01:02.039> anyways

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.279 

so<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.399> related<00:01:07.820> bug<00:01:08.000> is<00:01:08.299> this<00:01:08.750> one<00:01:08.930> if<00:01:09.110> you

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
so the related bug is this one if you

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.770 
so the related bug is this one if you
have<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.979> piston<00:01:10.610> underneath<00:01:11.180> a<00:01:11.299> block<00:01:11.509> and

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
have a piston underneath a block and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.270 
have a piston underneath a block and
then<00:01:11.869> place<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.320> torch<00:01:12.469> on<00:01:12.710> top<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:13.009> that<00:01:13.100> block

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
then place a torch on top of that block

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.240 
then place a torch on top of that block
with<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.360> conduction<00:01:14.750> block<00:01:14.929> next<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.560> then

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
with a conduction block next to it then

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.219 
with a conduction block next to it then
the<00:01:16.369> piston<00:01:16.579> will<00:01:16.909> extend<00:01:17.210> very<00:01:17.719> briefly<00:01:18.049> and

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
the piston will extend very briefly and

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.850 
the piston will extend very briefly and
then<00:01:18.289> retracting<00:01:18.860> in<00:01:19.869> another<00:01:20.869> way<00:01:21.530> we<00:01:21.679> can

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
then retracting in another way we can

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.679 
then retracting in another way we can
know<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:21.979> this<00:01:22.159> is<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.369> bug<00:01:22.700> is<00:01:23.000> if<00:01:23.240> we<00:01:23.390> remove

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
know that this is a bug is if we remove

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.950 
know that this is a bug is if we remove
that<00:01:23.869> block<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.409> then<00:01:25.179> place<00:01:26.179> the<00:01:26.390> torch

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
that block and then place the torch

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.440 
that block and then place the torch
again

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.840 

the<00:01:31.899> piston<00:01:32.200> does<00:01:32.320> not<00:01:32.500> extend<00:01:32.710> so<00:01:33.430> it<00:01:33.759> is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
the piston does not extend so it is

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.510 
the piston does not extend so it is
specifically<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.810> that<00:01:35.469> torch<00:01:35.799> powering<00:01:36.430> the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
specifically the that torch powering the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.789 
specifically the that torch powering the
block<00:01:36.759> next<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.240> it<00:01:37.420> or<00:01:37.689> something<00:01:38.649> like<00:01:38.740> that

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
block next to it or something like that

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.429 
block next to it or something like that
that<00:01:39.159> causes<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.729> torque<00:01:40.119> that<00:01:40.450> piston<00:01:40.899> below

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
that causes the torque that piston below

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.240 
that causes the torque that piston below
it<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.799> extend

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.160 

we<00:01:45.250> can<00:01:45.369> also<00:01:45.659> demonstrate<00:01:46.659> that<00:01:47.020> this

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
we can also demonstrate that this

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.630 
we can also demonstrate that this
happens<00:01:47.590> when<00:01:48.189> you<00:01:48.280> place<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:50.159> torch<00:01:51.159> on<00:01:51.369> the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
happens when you place the torch on the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.080 
happens when you place the torch on the
side<00:01:51.970> of<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.720> block<00:01:52.899> on<00:01:53.170> top<00:01:53.200> of<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.560> piston

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
side of the block on top of the piston

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.520 
side of the block on top of the piston
next<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.240> another<00:01:55.540> conduction<00:01:56.049> block<00:01:56.140> again

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
next to another conduction block again

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.380 
next to another conduction block again
the<00:01:57.100> piston<00:01:57.399> will<00:01:57.490> extend<00:01:57.729> very<00:01:58.000> Wiggly<00:01:58.360> and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
the piston will extend very Wiggly and

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.609 
the piston will extend very Wiggly and
then<00:01:58.570> retract<00:01:59.159> the<00:02:00.159> piston<00:02:00.549> isn't<00:02:01.270> just

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
then retract the piston isn't just

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.929 
then retract the piston isn't just
extending<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:02.890> then<00:02:02.979> instantly<00:02:03.340> losing

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
extending and then instantly losing

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.609 
extending and then instantly losing
signal<00:02:04.179> retracting<00:02:04.810> or<00:02:04.990> losing<00:02:05.289> power<00:02:05.439> to

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
signal retracting or losing power to

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.469 
signal retracting or losing power to
attract<00:02:05.860> ting<00:02:06.039> and<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.880> way<00:02:06.970> we<00:02:07.090> can<00:02:07.240> notice

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
attract ting and the way we can notice

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.229 
attract ting and the way we can notice
is<00:02:07.630> because<00:02:08.160> once<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.340> pistol<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:09.940> piston

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
is because once the pistol and piston

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.410 
is because once the pistol and piston
extends<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:11.500> actually<00:02:12.190> stays<00:02:12.459> extended<00:02:12.670> for<00:02:13.390> a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
extends it actually stays extended for a

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.990 
extends it actually stays extended for a
full<00:02:15.030> redstone<00:02:16.030> tip<00:02:16.239> which<00:02:16.450> i<00:02:16.600> guess<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:16.750> two

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
full redstone tip which i guess is two

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.650 
full redstone tip which i guess is two
updates<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.180> game<00:02:19.269> engine<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.430> so

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
updates of the game engine and so

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.020 
updates of the game engine and so
somehow<00:02:22.660> is<00:02:23.019> retaining<00:02:23.709> power<00:02:24.580> long<00:02:25.000> enough

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
somehow is retaining power long enough

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.740 
somehow is retaining power long enough
to<00:02:25.600> do<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.170> then<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.970> for<00:02:28.120> example<00:02:28.209> if<00:02:28.630> I

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
to do that and then so for example if I

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.970 
to do that and then so for example if I
were<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.959> place<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.170> block<00:02:29.410> here<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.840> then<00:02:32.830> do

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
were to place a block here and then do

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.759 
were to place a block here and then do
this<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:34.510> sticky<00:02:34.720> piston<00:02:35.140> does<00:02:35.260> not<00:02:35.440> drop<00:02:35.590> the

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
this the sticky piston does not drop the

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.690 
this the sticky piston does not drop the
block<00:02:35.950> which<00:02:36.850> only<00:02:37.299> happens<00:02:37.569> if<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.700> piston

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
block which only happens if the piston

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.789 
block which only happens if the piston
stays<00:02:39.970> extended<00:02:40.380> longer<00:02:41.380> than<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.620> minimum

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
stays extended longer than the minimum

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.150 
stays extended longer than the minimum
amount<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.489> needs<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.760> say<00:02:42.940> extended

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
amount it needs to say extended

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.320 
amount it needs to say extended
therefore<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.280> means<00:02:45.459> it's<00:02:45.670> still<00:02:45.819> somehow

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
therefore that means it's still somehow

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.430 
therefore that means it's still somehow
getting<00:02:46.630> powered<00:02:47.760> after<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:48.850> torch<00:02:49.150> was<00:02:49.359> out

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
getting powered after this torch was out

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.710 
getting powered after this torch was out
or<00:02:51.980> sorry<00:02:52.250> not<00:02:52.430> goes<00:02:52.610> out<00:02:52.730> but<00:02:52.970> after<00:02:53.240> he<00:02:53.570> gets

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
or sorry not goes out but after he gets

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.440 
or sorry not goes out but after he gets
placed<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.830> then<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.280> updated<00:02:55.670> case

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.320 

the<00:03:00.349> second<00:03:00.680> bug<00:03:00.860> that<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.250> want<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.520> show<00:03:01.700> is<00:03:03.280> I

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
the second bug that I want to show is I

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.080 
the second bug that I want to show is I
uses<00:03:05.330> this<00:03:05.569> bug<00:03:06.050> actually<00:03:06.500> but<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.459> allows<00:03:07.910> you

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
uses this bug actually but it allows you

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.680 
uses this bug actually but it allows you
to<00:03:08.269> delete<00:03:08.569> blocks<00:03:09.019> using<00:03:09.500> pistons<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:11.060> you

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
to delete blocks using pistons so you

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.210 
to delete blocks using pistons so you
just<00:03:11.840> have<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.080> set<00:03:12.260> up<00:03:12.379> this<00:03:12.920> sort<00:03:13.160> of

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
just have to set up this sort of

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.270 
just have to set up this sort of
configuration<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:15.050> is<00:03:15.349> going<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.920> be<00:03:16.040> set

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
configuration so this is going to be set

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.979 
configuration so this is going to be set
up<00:03:16.370> here<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.819> then<00:03:16.970> there's<00:03:17.150> another<00:03:17.209> sticky

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
up here and then there's another sticky

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.440 
up here and then there's another sticky
piston<00:03:18.319> name<00:03:18.560> backwards<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.910> conducting

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
piston name backwards and a conducting

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.559 
piston name backwards and a conducting
block<00:03:21.459> so<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:22.610> do<00:03:22.700> is<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:22.880> place<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.390> block

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
block so you do is you place a block

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.930 
block so you do is you place a block
down<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.230> then<00:03:24.860> place<00:03:25.160> our<00:03:25.310> at<00:03:25.430> some<00:03:25.580> torch<00:03:25.819> on

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
down and then place our at some torch on

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.990 
down and then place our at some torch on
top<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.299> block<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.739> top<00:03:28.459> block<00:03:28.700> is

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
top of that block and the top block is

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.150 
top of that block and the top block is
deleted<00:03:29.540> by<00:03:30.549> this<00:03:31.549> sticky<00:03:32.209> piston<00:03:32.540> over<00:03:32.720> here

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
deleted by this sticky piston over here

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.020 
deleted by this sticky piston over here
to<00:03:34.160> show<00:03:34.430> that<00:03:34.519> again

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.030 

and<00:03:40.150> any<00:03:42.840> conducting<00:03:43.840> block<00:03:44.050> apparently

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.869 

so<00:03:47.760> if<00:03:47.849> i<00:03:47.909> put<00:03:47.939> sand<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.510> there<00:03:48.689> instead<00:03:49.879> again

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
so if i put sand in there instead again

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:56.550 
so if i put sand in there instead again
it'll<00:03:51.180> be<00:03:51.239> deleted

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.100 

alright<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.370> that's<00:03:57.819> basically<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.720> bugs<00:03:58.989> I

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
alright so that's basically the bugs I

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.290 
alright so that's basically the bugs I
wanted<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.349> show<00:03:59.470> in<00:03:59.590> this<00:03:59.680> video<00:03:59.830> I<00:04:00.610> was

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
wanted to show in this video I was

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.930 
wanted to show in this video I was
putting<00:04:02.050> off<00:04:02.310> making<00:04:03.310> this<00:04:03.459> video<00:04:03.610> just

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
putting off making this video just

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.490 
putting off making this video just
because<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.270> wanted<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.720> try<00:04:05.020> to<00:04:05.080> figure<00:04:05.290> out

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
because I wanted to try to figure out

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.350 
because I wanted to try to figure out
what<00:04:05.650> was<00:04:05.739> going<00:04:05.770> on<00:04:06.010> first<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.640> also<00:04:06.849> show<00:04:07.330> a

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
what was going on first and also show a

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.070 
what was going on first and also show a
way<00:04:08.080> to<00:04:08.140> use<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:09.030> kind<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.209> did<00:04:10.390> but<00:04:10.420> it's<00:04:10.959> not

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
way to use it I kind of did but it's not

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.420 
way to use it I kind of did but it's not
that<00:04:11.230> great<00:04:11.410> so<00:04:13.739> I'll<00:04:14.739> show<00:04:14.769> it<00:04:14.980> from<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.220> side

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
that great so I'll show it from the side

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.970 
that great so I'll show it from the side
what<00:04:15.580> this<00:04:15.730> device<00:04:15.910> does<00:04:16.060> is<00:04:16.829> when<00:04:17.829> you're

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
what this device does is when you're

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.159 
what this device does is when you're
standing<00:04:18.370> on<00:04:18.730> this<00:04:19.060> block<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.780> you<00:04:19.810> place<00:04:20.139> a

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
standing on this block and you place a

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.640 
standing on this block and you place a
sand<00:04:20.560> block<00:04:20.859> there<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:21.700> then<00:04:22.540> read<00:04:23.410> some

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
sand block there and then read some

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.180 
sand block there and then read some
torch<00:04:23.950> on<00:04:24.610> top<00:04:24.850> of<00:04:25.000> this<00:04:25.090> block<00:04:25.980> or<00:04:26.980> actually

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
torch on top of this block or actually

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:37.559 
torch on top of this block or actually
no<00:04:27.310> sorry<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:27.760> side<00:04:27.940> of<00:04:27.970> this<00:04:28.090> block

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:49.999 

so<00:04:38.080> that<00:04:38.199> he<00:04:38.289> can

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.999 

alright<00:04:50.699> so<00:04:51.499> now<00:04:52.499> it<00:04:52.619> seems<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.860> be<00:04:52.889> working

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
alright so now it seems to be working

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.850 
alright so now it seems to be working
again<00:04:54.229> when<00:04:55.229> you're<00:04:55.319> standing<00:04:55.499> on<00:04:55.619> top<00:04:55.800> of

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
again when you're standing on top of

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.219 
again when you're standing on top of
this<00:04:56.099> block<00:04:56.400> if<00:04:56.999> you<00:04:57.419> place<00:04:57.629> the<00:04:57.779> same<00:04:57.990> block

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229

because that torch up there and the
reason<00:05:45.240> I<00:05:45.480> wanted<00:05:45.960> to<00:05:46.020> design<00:05:46.410> this<00:05:46.530> is

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
reason I wanted to design this is

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
because I wanted there to be some way to

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:54.530 
because I wanted there to be some way to
open<00:05:49.500> up<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.800> trap<00:05:50.010> door<00:05:50.930> even<00:05:51.930> though<00:05:53.270> the<00:05:54.270> land

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
open up a trap door even though the land

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.860 
open up a trap door even though the land
around<00:05:55.170> it<00:05:55.350> was<00:05:55.470> completely<00:05:55.860> flat<00:05:56.690> and<00:05:57.690> I

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
around it was completely flat and I

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.570 
around it was completely flat and I
couldn't<00:05:58.050> quite<00:05:58.290> figure<00:05:58.590> it<00:05:58.740> out<00:05:58.950> still<00:05:59.430> need

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
couldn't quite figure it out still need

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.310 
couldn't quite figure it out still need
to<00:05:59.640> place<00:05:59.820> the<00:05:59.970> sand<00:06:00.210> block<00:06:00.390> and<00:06:00.720> it's<00:06:01.080> still

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
to place the sand block and it's still

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.820 
to place the sand block and it's still
these<00:06:01.380> a<00:06:03.140> with<00:06:04.140> some<00:06:04.350> torch<00:06:04.620> above<00:06:05.490> ground<00:06:06.830> the

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
these a with some torch above ground the

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.310 
these a with some torch above ground the
least<00:06:08.040> it<00:06:08.190> works

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.920 

alright<00:06:11.980> so<00:06:12.340> that<00:06:12.820> was<00:06:13.030> bugs<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:13.630> this<00:06:13.750> is

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
alright so that was bugs and this is

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.920 
alright so that was bugs and this is
sort<00:06:14.350> of<00:06:14.410> an<00:06:14.530> application<00:06:14.650> of<00:06:15.310> the<00:06:15.430> idea

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
sort of an application of the idea

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.090 
sort of an application of the idea
doesn't<00:06:16.930> quite<00:06:17.320> use<00:06:17.530> it<00:06:17.680> because<00:06:17.800> it<00:06:17.950> actually

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
doesn't quite use it because it actually

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.300 
doesn't quite use it because it actually
uses

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.790 

the<00:06:23.820> torch<00:06:24.090> being<00:06:24.330> on<00:06:24.450> the<00:06:24.510> block<00:06:24.720> aside<00:06:27.800> this

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
the torch being on the block aside this

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.440 
the torch being on the block aside this
oh<00:06:29.040> yeah<00:06:29.220> also<00:06:29.400> I<00:06:29.550> want<00:06:29.760> to<00:06:29.820> show<00:06:30.000> that<00:06:30.180> this

torso<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:34.230> dispenser<00:06:34.650> doesn't<00:06:34.890> activate<00:06:35.220> and

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
torso the dispenser doesn't activate and

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.970 
torso the dispenser doesn't activate and
if<00:06:36.600> I<00:06:36.660> put<00:06:36.870> a<00:06:36.900> torch<00:06:37.110> to<00:06:37.140> their<00:06:37.380> the<00:06:37.560> dispenser

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
if I put a torch to their the dispenser

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
but I use the normal thing by putting it

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.050 
but I use the normal thing by putting it
there<00:06:44.820> it<00:06:45.300> does<00:06:45.510> activate
