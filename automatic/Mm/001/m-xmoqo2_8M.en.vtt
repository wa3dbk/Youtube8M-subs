00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.650
 hi to all your kids in there 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:12.530
 this new video we will see the unboxing 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.849
 of the hard with the be x2 a heatsink 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.679
 of the triad to write 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.090
 the heat sink to the homage of the triad 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.320
 which I thank 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.570
 find the links to the site on the page 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.280
 description facebook I recommend 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.910
 been quoted if you want a nice one 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.330
 I like it 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.680
 we are doing it shortly with unboxing 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.480
 well guys here we are with the box 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.039
 containing the heat sink where in the 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.500
 front part we find the logo of 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.500
 thermalright let's move on to boxing 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.840
 inside we find a package 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.460
 containing all the accessories for the 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:54.489
 assembly that we will examine better between 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:54.489
 just two 140 mm fans 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.899
 Hello 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.619
 and to finish the lip sync we pass now 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.700
 to see in detail the contents 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.350
 of the package 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.250
 in detail we have a backplate 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:30.920
 universal for socket intel lga775 11 50 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:35.060
 11 55 11 56 13 66 and I think it tends m2m 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.970
 ii plus am3 am3 plus fm1 and fm2 thickness 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.220
 for socket intel lga775 and thickness in 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.439
 mylar anchor bar 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.039
 assembly of different that interest you 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.679
 already 2011 thickness for intel sockets 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.959
 thicknesses I think the dvd times for 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.450
 pd backplate for anchor bar 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.310
 split mounting bar was y 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.069
 anti-vibration pads I already have 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.869
 mounted on the thermal paste heat sink ed 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.000
 a sticker and with the company logo 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.979
 let's now go to the sink we see 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.159
 some specific single-sinks 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:11.120
 tower dimensions height 165 mm 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.860
 width 155 thickness 105 weight a kilo 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.690
 and one hundred grams the cooling is 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.150
 entrusted to eight the psi nickel-plated copper 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.850
 6 mm cooled by two fans from 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.590
 140 mm in the upper part we can 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.299
 better to see the terminations of the 8 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.950
 heatpipes in the center a vertical cut 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.720
 which serves to improve the air flow 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.970
 and at both ends the holes for 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.920
 clip the fan clip lip sync the body 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.690
 central composed of 42 fins in 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.160
 aluminum where in the front e 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.109
 we do not find any later 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.910
 groove to insert fan clips 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.230
 I would also like to point out the particular 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.970
 shape of the fins used for 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.859
 optimize the air flow on the ip 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.470
 singh we find in the front part e 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.940
 rear and two 140 mm fans 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.069
 docked with two fan clips in 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.350
 metal let's see now how to remove e 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.180
 hang up the fans to remove them 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:59.590
 simply push the fans 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.590
 clip outward this way one 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:09.040
 and two same thing on the other side ed 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.870
 here is the pot in the four corners 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:18.370
 furthermore, as you can see, there are the rubber tips 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:20.050
 anti-vibration are adhesive the fan clips 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.350
 as you see they are hooked into these 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.960
 holes to remove them will suffice 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.770
 simply pull up and then 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.140
 downward 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:36.160
 in this way same thing 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:42.780
 on the other side and here it is for 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.780
 put it back instead we have to do it 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.440
 we already get all upside down 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:59.160
 don't be afraid it won't break 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:02.720
 we insert and align and here it is 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.720
 same thing on the other side 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.620
 and here it is 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.370
 let's take the fan 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.370
 in the center 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:28.300
 and now we have to pull the fans in 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.520
 this way we pull up here and 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.210
 we push inside the hole here 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.210
 no 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.760
 and two 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.940
 same thing on the other side 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.330
 1 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.330
 and two 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.950
 and here it is while in the lower part 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.930
 we can see better the 8 and the psi 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.520
 nickel-plated copper contact area with 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.440
 the gpu nickel copper ago by the 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.290
 mirror and power cables for 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.030
 the event 11 of the splitter to 4 ya 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.680
 pin then the fan speed 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.190
 will vary based on the temperature of the 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.960
 gpu 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.610
 also as we can see from this 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.530
 framing the contact area with the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.390
 gpu and decentralized compared to ips in 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.640
 this therefore prevent the ip singh of 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.050
 hinder the first PCI express slot 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.730
 what can we say about this sink 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.770
 with a high 5 46 70k of 4.5 gb if 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.420
 temperatures are around 76 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.710
 however remember degrees of 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.270
 temperatures also vary based on 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.350
 the environmental one that the money denied 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.880
 etc 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.380
 therefore each result must be evaluated 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.450
 taking these factors into account 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.980
 among these factors it must be said that c more 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.020
 hardware like mine don't have the 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.270
 flux welding the narrow spreader and dai 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.400
 this tends to make these cp more 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.020
 hot compared to a sandy for example 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.120
 bridge where temperatures would be 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.040
 been significantly lower in each 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.480
 case of the given the cp law applying 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.070
 keep spending by a bit 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.420
 liquid proven collaborators 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.760
 significantly improved temperatures 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.200
 there is also to add that we love it more 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.450
 not really lucky together with 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.430
 lack of welding flux worsen 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.050
 the situation aesthetically the product 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.650
 it is pleasant enough for how much 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.900
 simple 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.550
 the performances are very good taking 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.350
 account repeat of the arcs own pine 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.820
 lucky and platform as well 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.080
 as for the noise level e 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.180
 sink has proved to be enough 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.160
 silent with the fans at maximum 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.750
 even if, however , little noise 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.730
 higher than the fans at 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.740
 minimum the heat sink to be mounted 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.780
 does not need low profile ram also 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.490
 if on some cards magic are more trams 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.210
 near the socket you could cover the 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.710
 first slot 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.630
 thanks also to the contact area 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.940
 decentralized and heat sink will not go to 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.680
 Our value of the first PCI express slot 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.840
 ultimately we are talking about 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.250
 a good good performance heatsink 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.440
 Pleasant to the eye is enough 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.450
 silent well guys the unboxing of the 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.060
 you can end up here 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.450
 find now at a price of around 65 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.590
 EUR
