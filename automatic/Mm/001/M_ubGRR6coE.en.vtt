yeah took its time so the high score

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.300 
yeah took its time so the high score
previous<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.580> 61<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.950> was<00:01:28.950> actually<00:01:29.070> got

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
previous it was 61 I was actually got

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.340 
previous it was 61 I was actually got
better<00:01:29.460> last<00:01:29.670> time<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.450> we'll<00:01:30.810> obviously<00:01:31.110> go

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
better last time so we'll obviously go

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.899 
better last time so we'll obviously go
to<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> next<00:01:31.680> level<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.310> let's<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.670> show

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
to the next level and let's just show

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.530 
to the next level and let's just show
you<00:01:32.970> how<00:01:33.119> fluid<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.570> actually<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
you how fluid it actually is so and

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.359 
you how fluid it actually is so and
again<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.409> most<00:01:37.560> intensive<00:01:38.130> game

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
again it's not the most intensive game

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.370 
again it's not the most intensive game
in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> world<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.750> does<00:01:39.900> need<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.079> certain

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
in the world but it does need a certain

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.690 
in the world but it does need a certain
level<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.710> specification<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
level of specification for it to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.480 
level of specification for it to
actually<00:01:41.759> run<00:01:42.119> once<00:01:42.869> again<00:01:42.960> will<00:01:43.320> Paul<00:01:44.280> abide

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
actually run once again will Paul abide
