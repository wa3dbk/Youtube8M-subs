anime<00:04:44.280> did<00:04:44.789> like<00:04:44.939> anime<00:04:45.330> so<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:45.960> figured<00:04:46.469> I

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
anime did like anime so I figured I

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.369 
anime did like anime so I figured I
would<00:04:46.680> do<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:46.919> video<00:04:47.189> for<00:04:47.490> that<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:48.030> um<00:04:48.900> you

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
would do the video for that so um you

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:50.929 
would do the video for that so um you
know<00:04:49.500> started<00:04:50.159> out<00:04:50.250> for<00:04:50.370> one<00:04:50.490> video<00:04:50.729> but<00:04:50.849> it

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:50.939 
know started out for one video but it

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:52.189 
know started out for one video but it
could<00:04:51.060> actually<00:04:51.180> be<00:04:51.360> for<00:04:51.599> both<00:04:51.719> because<00:04:52.050> that

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
could actually be for both because that

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.719 
could actually be for both because that
I<00:04:52.229> made<00:04:52.379> for<00:04:52.500> fun<00:04:52.680> is<00:04:52.830> extremely<00:04:53.310> similar<00:04:53.580> to

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729

and stuff like that so it's it's the

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.480 
and stuff like that so it's it's the
same<00:05:09.300> thing<00:05:09.599> in<00:05:10.379> two<00:05:10.620> different<00:05:10.770> places<00:05:11.009> that

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
same thing in two different places that

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.730 
same thing in two different places that
work<00:05:11.669> very<00:05:11.940> well<00:05:12.030> so<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:12.810> always<00:05:12.990> with<00:05:13.409> XBMC
