00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.860
 my dogs ca all gas and the comedian that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.089
 speaks 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.720
 welcome back to another comic blog 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.449
 k3 in the column the thoughts of the comic 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.619
 this new column I want 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.019
 dedicate myself so I never leave you 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.550
 alone you know that the comedian is not me 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.050
 never leaves you alone 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.280
 I'm here in the company of butter 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.149
 peanuts because they snack time and some 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.719
 pasto is but I go but let's talk a little 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.489
 of the mobile world congress e in 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.670
 especially 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.140
 I wanted to concentrate, this will be a video 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:58.520
 short short but as I say intense on 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:04.250
 galaxy s 5 expected by everyone with this 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:08.909
 I don't know this performance anxiety no 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.369
 because I say this because those who know believed 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.200
 who knows what they would have presented of 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.530
 so innovative 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.500
 well in my opinion it was not even because 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.710
 evening read technical features 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.850
 I think it seems to me that of these 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.439
 innovations that everyone was also waiting for 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.079
 someone assumed these bodies 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.259
 body in metal that I continue to 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.310
 reiterate that I know I do not know I will not have 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.610
 will have absorbed a business of a company 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.590
 not a plastic factory 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.710
 because it is attached to plastic 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.509
 rightly and I will immediately start talking 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.800
 of this very new plastic back 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.780
 plasticky 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:03.440
 I know it's a bothering word 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:08.030
 however, it is very plasticky then 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.030
 let's say right away that I think they have it 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.530
 copied from a patch because if you go to 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.040
 see the gold color 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.660
 put aside those patches you know 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.920
 looks like a casino or more 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:26.540
 they copied it from the nexus 7 there 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.240
 remember the first nex 7 su 7 in short 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.130
 these behind with these therefore rellini 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.740
 in short, it is a bit copied, that is, fantasy 0 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.470
 I don't know what's worse if it's fake leather 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.470
 with plastic stitching or these 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.760
 some holes are questionable 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.100
 they may like it as they may not like it 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.840
 well what did they have increased the 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.540
 display I had doubts 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.690
 I had no doubt I try to accelerate for 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.790
 I want this video formally short 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.440
 year me totti display because it was small 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.989
 before that was too small then 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.970
 the increase I still love etc has problems there 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:11.030
 we bring close to rightly struggle 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.300
 they are geniuses they make i 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.290
 then brainstorm between days 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.860
 moment I call and we make 5 inches 16 the 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.870
 resolution everyone thought 4k 4k 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.580
 madonna of the screens actually have 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:31.130
 used a full hd that is already on 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.450
 devices for quite a while therefore it is 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:39.200
 however the technology is a resolution 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:43.930
 not revolutionary but actual here of 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.590
 kune nex 5 and full hd as a screen I can 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:52.140
 tell others well how 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.959
 taiwan lg2 etcetera etcetera etc. but 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.370
 the invention that they launched their own 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.340
 it seems that they are limited because they are not 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.010
 when apple brought out the iphone 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.040
 you don't need a dick with the touch 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:10.069
 we'd be fucking good for nothing 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:14.569
 and what made them some kind of di 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:17.010
 a kind of absolutely thaci 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.169
 only that I think they are complicated 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.720
 life because that peace of you must not 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.090
 put on the thumb unlocks maybe 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.350
 also but you have to drag down then with 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.570
 a hand in my opinion I do not know oh well then 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.790
 I think this has made it worse 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.220
 technology is good then they added 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.510
 this sensor that is calculated to you 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.210
 heartbeats robert beats of the 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.729
 heart I put in and then oh well 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.130
 in short, we calculate 16 megapixels of 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.400
 camera commented on pixels because 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.169
 rightly a 13 was not going well 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.180
 we need to increase the pixels and robben 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:00.000
 may like or dislike processor 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.280
 snapdragon 800 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.320
 now I have read a pizza that I am worth 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:15.050
 instead the 800 19 decides at 800 800 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:19.860
 one of the ram ram expect 3g a 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.590
 which unfortunately have put it still two is 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.510
 what intrigued me rather than 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.550
 less at all surprised and when the 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.320
 phone in the middle of the first time with 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.970
 you have sixteen laps at your disposal 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.310
 only 65 and a half ie I don't understand I was 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.720
 finally they have all the dust inside 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:43.410
 inside in and that's it 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.240
 boh me it did not impress me years 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.930
 resident to the waterborne dust have 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.310
 also plagiarized there since 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:56.470
 the z 102 now that they presented 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:06:00.400
 sony surely there is not really 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:05.169
 compare as an aesthetic between the sony z2 and 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:08.860
 samsung s5620 design know either 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.850
 what is they enough that they copy and are 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.560
 so happy 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:17.610
 I said my dear friends, tell me the 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.530
 what do you think of these five 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:24.849
 of these great innovations what they are 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:28.500
 I haven't seen her and we'll see each other at 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.500
 next comic thought all gas
