to go that you don't really know what
car<00:02:00.530> it's<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.679> successful<00:02:02.280> rises<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.000> there's

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
car it's a successful rises so there's

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.510 
car it's a successful rises so there's
so<00:02:03.509> many<00:02:03.630> things<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:04.200> happen<00:02:04.289> and<00:02:04.740> things<00:02:05.250> can

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
so many things can happen and things can

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.990 
so many things can happen and things can
go<00:02:05.729> wrong<00:02:05.759> or<00:02:06.179> right<00:02:06.450> for<00:02:07.140> any<00:02:07.799> people<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.549> we

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
go wrong or right for any people so we

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.819 
go wrong or right for any people so we
just<00:02:09.209> need<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.599> make<00:02:09.750> sure<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.170> we<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.799> our

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
just need to make sure that we do our

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.520 
just need to make sure that we do our
best<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.519> hopefully<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:12.180> can<00:02:12.360> win<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:13.079> races

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
best and hopefully we can win in races

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.190 
best and hopefully we can win in races
and<00:02:13.769> we<00:02:14.069> see<00:02:14.220> what<00:02:14.400> isn't<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.900> tracks

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and we see what isn't it this tracks

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.800 
and we see what isn't it this tracks
more<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.530> what<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.709> call<00:02:16.920> an<00:02:17.040> all-timer<00:02:17.459> track

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
more of what I call an all-timer track

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.910 
more of what I call an all-timer track
unlike<00:02:18.810> some<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.079> the<00:02:19.110> modern<00:02:19.440> computer

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
unlike some of the modern computer

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.949

design<00:02:20.220> tracks<00:02:20.579> that<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.819> raised<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.599> do

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
design tracks that you raised on I do

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:22.729 
design tracks that you raised on I do
you<00:02:22.079> think<00:02:22.230> what<00:02:22.380> do<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.470> think<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.650> this

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
you think what do you think of this

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.550 
you think what do you think of this
place<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.280> think<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.209> it's<00:02:24.599> quite<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.989> nice<00:02:25.260> place

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
place I think so it's quite a nice place

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.100 
place I think so it's quite a nice place
but<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.730> service<00:02:27.120> itself<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.720> natural

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
but the service itself is natural

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.680 
but the service itself is natural
challenging<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:28.890> only<00:02:29.130> two<00:02:29.910> three<00:02:30.209> corners

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
challenging this only two three corners

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.350 
challenging this only two three corners
and<00:02:30.930> for<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> change<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.940> not<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
and for a change so this is not the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.200 
and for a change so this is not the
major<00:02:33.629> amateur

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
major amateur

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.240 
major amateur
difficult<00:02:35.990> circuit<00:02:36.470> by<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.740> seeing<00:02:37.130> the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
difficult circuit by the seeing the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.590 
difficult circuit by the seeing the
carnage<00:02:37.460> to<00:02:37.820> be<00:02:37.970> good<00:02:38.240> though<00:02:38.390> with<00:02:38.570> the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
carnage to be good though with the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.740 
carnage to be good though with the
curves<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.260> be<00:02:39.740> really<00:02:40.070> really<00:02:40.550> quick<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:41.330> good

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
curves to be really really quick a good

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.480 
curves to be really really quick a good
strong<00:02:42.020> right<00:02:42.260> leg<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.530> put<00:02:42.800> those<00:02:42.890> brakes<00:02:43.250> on

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
strong right leg to put those brakes on

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.480 
strong right leg to put those brakes on
lots<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.880> times<00:02:44.440> yeah<00:02:45.440> it's<00:02:45.710> gonna<00:02:45.890> be<00:02:46.130> okay<00:02:46.430> so

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
lots of times yeah it's gonna be okay so

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.370 
lots of times yeah it's gonna be okay so
actually<00:02:47.300> it's<00:02:47.390> not<00:02:47.480> too<00:02:47.690> bad<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.020> just<00:02:48.050> need

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
actually it's not too bad you just need

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.840 
actually it's not too bad you just need
to<00:02:48.500> make<00:02:48.650> sure<00:02:48.710> that<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.160> brakes<00:02:49.370> are<00:02:49.610> strong

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
to make sure that the brakes are strong

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.310 
to make sure that the brakes are strong
enough<00:02:50.090> for<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.420> race<00:02:50.600> because<00:02:51.050> otherwise

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
enough for the race because otherwise

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.340 
enough for the race because otherwise
need<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.460> start<00:02:52.700> slowing<00:02:52.940> down<00:02:53.240> it's<00:02:54.230> not

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
need to start slowing down it's not

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.440 
need to start slowing down it's not
