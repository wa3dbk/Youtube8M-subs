00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.700
 very good to all and welcome from 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.040
 new ego addicts show in this third 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.350
 channel video I show you the first 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.110
 unboxing of lego mini figurines as ya 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.880
 I promised you on twitter as you can see 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.730
 it's about the lego movie that is the 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.679
 series number 12 of mini figurines and 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.900
 let's see what has touched me at the moment 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.330
 I do not have any figurines of this 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.550
 series therefore I do not care about the 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.530
 that touched me as you can see it 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.329
 it's about the blue color shade that stops 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.210
 me is one of the coolest envelopes of 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.600
 the 12 series and as I say let's see 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.600
 what has touched me 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.260
 let's open the envelope 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.719
 and for those who have not yet seen 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.940
 to the ego movie I recommend that you go 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.250
 to see her because she is very very funny 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.760
 Well, first, I'm going to show you the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.260
 brochure with the 16 mini figurines these 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.960
 I teach it once because there was not yet 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.240
 done no review so you see the 16 that 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.240
 there is if someone had not seen them and 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.860
 behind there are some details of 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.710
 pictures of the movie 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.049
 very well 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.220
 Now let's see what I have been figurine 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.369
 touched and I think it's the if it's abraham 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.030
 lincoln one of the master builders of the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.979
 lego movie well let's start the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.650
 review first of all showing the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.610
 abraham lincoln torso as you can see 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.460
 it's about a black uniform a suit 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.550
 as you can see with him with a very 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.399
 elegant with a chain and from behind 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.460
 all black contains no detail by 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.850
 back since it's a suit now 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.560
 we put the pants on, that is, the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.649
 legs that as you can see are also 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.820
 totally black, black 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.500
 in front same color black on the back and 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.250
 now what I like most about this set 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.550
 what is the face because it is very, very 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.350
 detailed characterizes much that was 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.530
 really abraham lincoln have done 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.900
 many details does not have double-sided like 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.790
 you can see it is very very well made me 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.970
 I really like this this mini face 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.240
 figurine 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.550
 to finish the hat with the beard 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.800
 characteristic as we know to 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.160
 Abraham Lincoln 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.070
 and here also an additional piece that 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.100
 brings is the famous speech of abraham 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.460
 lincoln that as you can see it reads 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.490
 phrase in English and then there are lines 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.020
 which symbolize other written phrases 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.940
 we can only hook it in the hand 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.870
 thus 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.050
 if you can see or also it 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.460
 engaged in this way also forgiveness is 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.040
 I have fallen or we can also 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.840
 hooking in this way is good for 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.080
 the two forms that is already going to taste of each 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.640
 one I'll leave it like that because it's like 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.190
 I like it more 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.640
 Now I'm going to put the figurine in the base 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.410
 and we can already see abraham lincoln 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.860
 figurine of the series number 12 of the 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.100
 bequeathed complete movie that you can see 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.110
 by the sides very cool to the truth is 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.680

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.330
