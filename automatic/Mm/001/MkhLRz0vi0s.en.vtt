here<00:00:05.040> we<00:00:05.160> have<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.549> basic<00:00:05.910> multimeter<00:00:06.450> which

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
here we have is a basic multimeter which

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.930 
here we have is a basic multimeter which
registers<00:00:07.140> volts<00:00:07.529> amps<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.980> homes<00:00:08.400> for

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
registers volts amps and homes for

registers volts amps and homes for
resistance<00:00:09.510> we're<00:00:10.139> going<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.349> be<00:00:10.410> using<00:00:10.559> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
resistance we're going to be using the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.799 
resistance we're going to be using the
resistance<00:00:11.190> scale<00:00:11.490> today<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.660> what<00:00:12.750> I'm

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
resistance scale today and what I'm

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.030 
resistance scale today and what I'm
going<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:12.960> do<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.139> I'm<00:00:13.259> just<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.679> test<00:00:13.920> to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
going to do is I'm just going to test to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.200 
going to do is I'm just going to test to
make<00:00:14.070> sure<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.370> thing<00:00:14.549> actually<00:00:14.670> works<00:00:14.880> when

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
make sure this thing actually works when

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.939 
make sure this thing actually works when
I<00:00:15.240> short<00:00:15.599> these<00:00:15.809> two<00:00:15.990> probes<00:00:16.289> together<00:00:16.680> I

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
I short these two probes together I

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.929 
I short these two probes together I
should<00:00:17.430> read<00:00:17.730> zero<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:19.619> do<00:00:19.680> well<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.880> do

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
should read zero and I do well what do

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.550 
should read zero and I do well what do
you<00:00:21.000> think<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.330> ok<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.109> first<00:00:22.320> things

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
you think of that ok so first things

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.340 
you think of that ok so first things
first<00:00:22.619> let's<00:00:23.250> check<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:24.090> resistance<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.779> hot

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
first let's check the resistance of hot

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.700 
first let's check the resistance of hot
water<00:00:29.480> ok<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.599> will<00:00:30.689> take<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> little<00:00:31.050> bit<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
water ok this will take a little bit to

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.560 
water ok this will take a little bit to
reach<00:00:32.040> its<00:00:32.219> final<00:00:32.430> destination<00:00:32.700> or<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.480> this

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
reach its final destination or is this

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.160 
reach its final destination or is this
cold<00:00:33.840> no<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.469> huh<00:00:34.590> hmm<00:00:35.250> ok<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:37.020> what

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
cold no this is huh hmm ok so what

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.959 
cold no this is huh hmm ok so what
somewhere<00:00:37.500> around<00:00:37.559> three<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.520> half<00:00:38.550> now

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
somewhere around three and a half now

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.049 
somewhere around three and a half now
for<00:00:39.450> mega<00:00:39.960> ohms<00:00:40.340> four<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.489> half<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.910> is

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
for mega ohms four and a half this is

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.340 
for mega ohms four and a half this is
going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.239> vary<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> temperature<00:00:43.290> of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
going to vary because the temperature of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.600 
going to vary because the temperature of
the<00:00:43.440> water<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.710> changing<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.430> staying

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the water is changing is with staying

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.549 
the water is changing is with staying
here<00:00:44.789> watch<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.210> alright<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.260> that's<00:00:46.350> hot

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
here watch it alright so that's hot

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.729 
here watch it alright so that's hot
water<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:46.950> let's<00:00:47.100> try<00:00:47.309> cold<00:00:47.730> water<00:00:48.559> as<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.680> can

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
water so let's try cold water as you can

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.029 
water so let's try cold water as you can
see<00:00:49.920> cold<00:00:50.190> water<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:51.020> a<00:00:52.020> little<00:00:52.320> less<00:00:52.500> but

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
see cold water is a little less but

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.979 
see cold water is a little less but
somewhere<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.699> same<00:00:54.059> two<00:00:54.390> three<00:00:54.719> four

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
somewhere in that same two three four

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.099 
somewhere in that same two three four
mega<00:00:55.230> home<00:00:55.440> range<00:00:55.710> alright<00:00:56.840> let's<00:00:57.840> put<00:00:57.960> this

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
mega home range alright let's put this

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.160 
mega home range alright let's put this
on<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.289> side<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:59.370> now<00:00:59.870> let's<00:01:00.870> use<00:01:01.050> our

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
on the side for for now let's use our

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.189 
on the side for for now let's use our
cold<00:01:01.500> water<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> test<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.080> some

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
cold water as a test here we have some

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.590 
cold water as a test here we have some
ordinary<00:01:04.470> table<00:01:04.830> salt<00:01:04.979> table<00:01:05.790> salt<00:01:05.939> hmm

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
ordinary table salt table salt hmm

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960 
ordinary table salt table salt hmm
otherwise<00:01:07.049> known<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.260> NaCl<00:01:07.979> sodium<00:01:08.220> chloride

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
otherwise known as NaCl sodium chloride

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.940 
otherwise known as NaCl sodium chloride
yeah<00:01:09.270> ok<00:01:09.960> not<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.710> high<00:01:10.799> blood

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
yeah ok not good if you have high blood

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.520 
yeah ok not good if you have high blood
pressure<00:01:11.479> I'm<00:01:12.479> currently<00:01:12.810> reading<00:01:13.020> somewhere

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
pressure I'm currently reading somewhere

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.630 
pressure I'm currently reading somewhere
around<00:01:14.360> six<00:01:15.360> mega<00:01:15.570> ohms<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.430> rising<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
around six mega ohms and rising is the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.160 
around six mega ohms and rising is the
temperature<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> water<00:01:18.240> rises<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.869> little

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
temperature of the water rises a little

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.440 
temperature of the water rises a little
bit<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.790> vary<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.299> we're

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
bit now this is going to vary as we're

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.999 
bit now this is going to vary as we're
doing<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.080> i<00:01:22.320> want<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:22.920> what

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
doing this but i want you to see what

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.289 
doing this but i want you to see what
happens<00:01:23.479> when<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.630> put<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.200> bit<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.530> salt

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
happens when we put a little bit of salt

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.109 
happens when we put a little bit of salt
in<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.659> mixture<00:01:28.400> and<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.520> doesn't<00:01:29.790> take<00:01:29.939> much

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
in the mixture and it doesn't take much

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:44.780 
in the mixture and it doesn't take much
it<00:01:33.119> mix<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.479> up<00:01:33.570> nicely<00:01:43.280> let's<00:01:44.280> wait<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.520> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
it mix it up nicely let's wait for that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
it mix it up nicely let's wait for that
to<00:01:44.820> settle<00:01:45.210> down<00:01:49.729> ok<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.240> resistance<00:01:51.509> is

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
to settle down ok the resistance is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.990 
to settle down ok the resistance is
dropped<00:01:52.170> by<00:01:52.530> about<00:01:52.560> half<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.579> get<00:01:53.759> its<00:01:53.880> kind

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
dropped by about half and get its kind

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.999 
dropped by about half and get its kind
of<00:01:54.090> vary<00:01:54.329> based<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> temperature<00:01:55.079> so

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
of vary based on the temperature so

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.620 
of vary based on the temperature so
let's<00:01:56.130> put<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.369> bit<00:01:56.909> more<00:01:57.090> salt<00:01:57.390> in

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
let's put a little bit more salt in

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.580 
let's put a little bit more salt in
there<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.649> we're<00:01:58.770> showing<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.399> salt

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
there what we're showing is that salt

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.580 
there what we're showing is that salt
changes<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.579> way<00:02:03.229> electricity<00:02:04.229> flows

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
changes the way electricity flows

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.740 
changes the way electricity flows
what<00:02:06.460> ah<00:02:06.640> there<00:02:07.210> we<00:02:07.390> go<00:02:08.940> now<00:02:09.940> look<00:02:10.420> how<00:02:10.569> much

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
what ah there we go now look how much

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.199 
what ah there we go now look how much
resistance<00:02:10.959> we<00:02:11.440> have<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:12.190> compared<00:02:12.879> to<00:02:13.060> what

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
resistance we have that compared to what

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.690 
resistance we have that compared to what
we<00:02:13.330> started<00:02:13.720> with<00:02:14.040> that's<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.160> reduction<00:02:15.610> of

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
we started with that's a reduction of

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.640 
we started with that's a reduction of
about<00:02:15.790> four<00:02:16.510> times<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.319> amount<00:02:17.410> of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
about four times the amount of

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.770 
about four times the amount of
resistance<00:02:17.950> which<00:02:18.340> means<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:19.090> dropping<00:02:19.690> even

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
resistance which means of dropping even

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.259 
resistance which means of dropping even
further<00:02:19.900> as<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:21.129> salt<00:02:21.400> gets<00:02:21.700> mixed<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.180> with

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
further as the salt gets mixed in with

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.180 
further as the salt gets mixed in with
the<00:02:22.330> water<00:02:22.690> we<00:02:23.440> now<00:02:23.590> reach<00:02:23.799> a<00:02:23.890> point<00:02:24.069> where

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
the water we now reach a point where

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.339 
the water we now reach a point where
it's<00:02:24.370> reading<00:02:24.640> almost<00:02:24.790> zero<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.989> we<00:02:26.019> switch<00:02:26.319> to

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
it's reading almost zero so we switch to

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.570 
it's reading almost zero so we switch to
a<00:02:26.530> lowest<00:02:26.890> scale<00:02:28.019> now<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.049> somewhere<00:02:29.650> below<00:02:29.830> 1

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
a lowest scale now is somewhere below 1

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.150 
a lowest scale now is somewhere below 1
megaohm<00:02:30.940> maybe<00:02:31.299> about<00:02:31.480> 800<00:02:31.989> kilo<00:02:32.230> ohms<00:02:32.470> is

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
megaohm maybe about 800 kilo ohms is

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.190 
megaohm maybe about 800 kilo ohms is
rising<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.670> little<00:02:33.700> bit<00:02:33.970> again<00:02:34.239> based<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.110> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
rising a little bit again based on the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.839 
rising a little bit again based on the
fluctuation<00:02:35.769> in<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.069> water<00:02:36.519> temperature

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
fluctuation in the water temperature

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.509 
fluctuation in the water temperature
between<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.530> where<00:02:38.739> we<00:02:38.860> started<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.489> a

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
between that and where we started is a

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.089 
between that and where we started is a
reduction<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.090> about<00:02:40.180> six<00:02:40.660> times<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:42.010> amount

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
reduction of about six times the amount

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.789 
reduction of about six times the amount
of<00:02:42.280> resistance<00:02:42.549> that<00:02:43.110> being<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.170> case<00:02:44.440> if

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
of resistance that being the case if

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.680 
of resistance that being the case if
anything<00:02:45.130> electric<00:02:45.849> would<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.180> be<00:02:46.269> running

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
anything electric would it be running

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.229 
anything electric would it be running
through<00:02:46.930> this<00:02:47.079> water<00:02:47.519> about<00:02:48.519> six<00:02:48.819> times<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
through this water about six times the

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.690 
through this water about six times the
amount<00:02:49.299> of<00:02:49.480> current<00:02:49.989> flow<00:02:50.160> could<00:02:51.160> also<00:02:51.340> be

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
amount of current flow could also be

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.580 
amount of current flow could also be
running<00:02:52.000> through<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.329> water<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.780> don't<00:02:53.200> blow

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
running through that water so don't blow

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.150 
running through that water so don't blow
dry<00:02:53.829> your<00:02:53.860> hair<00:02:54.069> in<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:55.209> bathtub<00:02:55.980> not<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.010> good

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
dry your hair in the bathtub not a good

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.699 
dry your hair in the bathtub not a good
idea<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.849> certainly<00:02:58.690> don't<00:02:58.900> do<00:02:59.079> it<00:02:59.260> in<00:02:59.410> the

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
idea and certainly don't do it in the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.339 
idea and certainly don't do it in the

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
ocean salt water conducts electricity

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:11.910 
ocean salt water conducts electricity
far<00:03:03.250> better<00:03:09.090> we're<00:03:10.090> holding<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.420> about<00:03:10.920> point

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
far better we're holding it about point

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.370 
far better we're holding it about point
five<00:03:12.250> five<00:03:12.280> mega<00:03:12.940> ohms<00:03:13.180> that's<00:03:13.450> 550<00:03:14.139> killa

five five mega ohms that's 550 killa
homes<00:03:18.510> yeah<00:03:19.859> now<00:03:21.420> let's<00:03:22.420> go<00:03:22.540> back<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.720> our

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
homes yeah now let's go back to our

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.539 
homes yeah now let's go back to our
other<00:03:23.019> water<00:03:23.319> which<00:03:23.470> has<00:03:23.620> no<00:03:23.799> salt<00:03:24.099> in<00:03:24.220> it

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.819 

watch<00:03:27.549> carefully<00:03:28.049> say<00:03:29.049> now<00:03:29.230> we're<00:03:29.380> back<00:03:29.500> up<00:03:29.680> to

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
watch carefully say now we're back up to

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.659 
watch carefully say now we're back up to
many<00:03:30.160> mega<00:03:30.609> ohms<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:31.239> resistance<00:03:32.400> no<00:03:33.400> salt

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
many mega ohms of resistance no salt

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:42.790 
many mega ohms of resistance no salt
salt

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.100 

this<00:03:43.430> is<00:03:43.550> going<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.730> drop<00:03:43.940> almost<00:03:44.150> 20<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:44.990> we'll

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
this is going to drop almost 20 so we'll

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:52.030 
this is going to drop almost 20 so we'll
switch<00:03:45.410> scales<00:03:50.110> Thank<00:03:51.110> big<00:03:51.470> difference

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
switch scales Thank big difference

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.580 
switch scales Thank big difference
between<00:03:52.190> salt<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:52.970> no<00:03:53.330> salt<00:03:53.630> now<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.440> reason

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
between salt and no salt now the reason

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.800 
between salt and no salt now the reason
why<00:03:54.800> this<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:55.490> numbers<00:03:55.820> go<00:03:56.030> up<00:03:56.180> or<00:03:56.360> down<00:03:56.390> based

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
why this the numbers go up or down based

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.900 
why this the numbers go up or down based
on<00:03:57.050> when<00:03:57.200> I<00:03:57.230> switch<00:03:57.560> this<00:03:57.800> is<00:03:58.010> because<00:03:58.790> the

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
on when I switch this is because the

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.730 
on when I switch this is because the
meter<00:03:59.150> itself<00:03:59.330> is<00:03:59.900> actually<00:04:00.050> providing<00:04:00.680> a

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
meter itself is actually providing a

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.080 
meter itself is actually providing a
little<00:04:00.980> bit<00:04:01.100> of<00:04:01.190> electricity<00:04:01.550> with<00:04:01.850> two

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
little bit of electricity with two

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.570 
little bit of electricity with two
double<00:04:02.480> A<00:04:02.600> batteries<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:04.010> it's<00:04:04.190> providing

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
double A batteries so it's providing

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.570 
double A batteries so it's providing
three<00:04:04.970> volts<00:04:05.420> of<00:04:05.510> juice<00:04:06.380> going<00:04:07.250> through<00:04:07.430> these

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
three volts of juice going through these

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.300 
three volts of juice going through these
cables<00:04:08.090> when<00:04:08.840> I<00:04:08.870> switch<00:04:09.260> this<00:04:09.530> range<00:04:09.920> it

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
cables when I switch this range it

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.040 
cables when I switch this range it
changes<00:04:10.850> the<00:04:11.000> amount<00:04:11.120> of<00:04:11.360> power<00:04:11.660> going

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
changes the amount of power going

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.870 
changes the amount of power going
through<00:04:12.320> these<00:04:12.470> cables<00:04:12.920> in<00:04:13.370> order<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:13.730> measure

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
through these cables in order to measure

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.920 
through these cables in order to measure
resistance<00:04:16.930> okay<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:18.140> here<00:04:18.350> we<00:04:18.440> are<00:04:18.620> salt<00:04:19.160> and

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
resistance okay so here we are salt and

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.470 
resistance okay so here we are salt and
again<00:04:22.000> watch<00:04:23.000> carefully<00:04:23.530> no<00:04:24.530> salt<00:04:25.480> much

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
again watch carefully no salt much

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.440 
again watch carefully no salt much
higher<00:04:26.780> with<00:04:27.230> no<00:04:27.440> salt<00:04:27.770> which<00:04:28.550> means<00:04:28.850> less

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
higher with no salt which means less

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:36.040 
higher with no salt which means less
current<00:04:29.840> can<00:04:30.140> flow<00:04:30.730> there's<00:04:31.730> no<00:04:31.880> salt<00:04:35.050> yeah

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
current can flow there's no salt yeah

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.600 
current can flow there's no salt yeah
one<00:04:36.860> would<00:04:37.070> then<00:04:38.920> use<00:04:39.920> me<00:04:40.130> as<00:04:40.220> a<00:04:40.250> test<00:04:40.550> subject

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
one would then use me as a test subject

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:51.239 
one would then use me as a test subject
let<00:04:41.480> me<00:04:41.660> drop<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:42.020> rooms<00:04:42.230> down

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:51.249 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.109 

and<00:04:51.879> I'm<00:04:51.969> registering<00:04:52.419> about<00:04:52.689> 1.1<00:04:53.559> mega<00:04:53.829> ohms

00:04:54.109 --> 00:04:54.119 
and I'm registering about 1.1 mega ohms

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:56.309 
and I'm registering about 1.1 mega ohms
now<00:04:55.119> I'm<00:04:55.359> going<00:04:55.479> to<00:04:55.569> take<00:04:55.719> some<00:04:55.929> of<00:04:55.989> this<00:04:56.139> here

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
now I'm going to take some of this here

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.719 
now I'm going to take some of this here
salt<00:04:56.679> water<00:04:58.709> get<00:04:59.709> it<00:04:59.799> will<00:04:59.949> wet<00:05:00.189> on<00:05:00.309> my<00:05:00.459> hands

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
an electric current and where it needs

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.629 
an electric current and where it needs
to<00:05:11.319> go<00:05:11.669> so<00:05:12.669> now<00:05:12.819> I'm<00:05:12.939> full<00:05:13.119> of<00:05:13.239> saltwater<00:05:14.639> look

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:20.079 
at the resistance now a lot less than it

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:24.869 
at the resistance now a lot less than it
was<00:05:20.289> minute<00:05:20.919> ago<00:05:21.479> yeah<00:05:22.799> so<00:05:23.799> wet<00:05:24.159> hands<00:05:24.669> and
