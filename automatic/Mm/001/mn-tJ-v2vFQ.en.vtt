reasons but one of them is safety
because<00:03:10.489> it's<00:03:11.860> because<00:03:12.860> there<00:03:13.069> is<00:03:13.220> something

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
because it's because there is something

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.420 
because it's because there is something
on<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.269> lane<00:03:14.450> what<00:03:14.959> could<00:03:15.500> be<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.889> substance

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
on the lane what could be that substance

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.650 
on the lane what could be that substance
that<00:03:16.639> they<00:03:16.730> put<00:03:16.910> on<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.150> link<00:03:17.389> before<00:03:17.720> glaze

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
that they put on the link before glaze

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.050 
that they put on the link before glaze
grease<00:03:20.660> wax<00:03:21.400> stuff<00:03:22.400> that<00:03:22.549> makes<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.819> fall

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
grease wax stuff that makes it fall

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.520 
grease wax stuff that makes it fall
probably<00:03:23.690> wax<00:03:24.139> wax<00:03:25.010> wax<00:03:25.870> what<00:03:26.870> kind<00:03:27.049> of<00:03:27.079> wax<00:03:27.260> do

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
probably wax wax wax what kind of wax do

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.110 
probably wax wax wax what kind of wax do
you<00:03:27.620> think<00:03:27.799> that<00:03:27.950> they<00:03:28.069> would<00:03:28.160> use<00:03:28.370> bowling

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
you think that they would use bowling

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.210 
you think that they would use bowling
wax<00:03:29.359> boiling<00:03:30.049> wax<00:03:30.170> yeah<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.650> makes<00:03:30.829> sense

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
wax boiling wax yeah that makes sense

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.289 
wax boiling wax yeah that makes sense
do<00:03:31.400> they<00:03:31.489> use<00:03:31.639> carnuba<00:03:33.579> don't<00:03:34.579> think<00:03:34.819> so<00:03:35.000> would

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
do they use carnuba don't think so would

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.870 
do they use carnuba don't think so would
wax<00:03:35.569> would<00:03:36.319> whack<00:03:36.620> yeah<00:03:36.889> wax<00:03:37.220> for<00:03:37.430> wood<00:03:37.639> right

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
wax would whack yeah wax for wood right

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.610 
wax would whack yeah wax for wood right
because<00:03:38.120> it's<00:03:38.269> wood<00:03:38.480> lane<00:03:38.720> no<00:03:39.079> it's<00:03:39.500> oil

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
because it's wood lane no it's oil

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.479 
because it's wood lane no it's oil
grease<00:03:43.900> oil<00:03:44.900> they<00:03:45.380> play<00:03:45.620> different<00:03:46.010> types<00:03:46.310> of

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
grease oil they play different types of

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.039 
grease oil they play different types of
oil<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.060> there<00:03:47.239> are<00:03:47.359> lots<00:03:47.599> of<00:03:47.720> different

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
oil and there are lots of different

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.690 
oil and there are lots of different
kinds<00:03:48.319> of<00:03:48.410> bowling<00:03:48.829> oil<00:03:49.010> that's<00:03:49.400> what<00:03:49.549> makes

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
kinds of bowling oil that's what makes

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.440 
kinds of bowling oil that's what makes
it<00:03:49.819> slippery

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
it slippery

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.750 
it slippery
so<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:50.900> people<00:03:51.109> can<00:03:51.200> fall<00:03:51.380> well<00:03:52.069> so<00:03:52.489> that<00:03:52.639> our

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
so that people can fall well so that our

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.240 
so that people can fall well so that our
bar<00:03:53.299> our<00:03:53.569> bowling<00:03:54.049> balls<00:03:54.230> can<00:03:54.440> glide<00:03:54.680> smoothly

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
bar our bowling balls can glide smoothly

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.760 
bar our bowling balls can glide smoothly
down<00:03:55.609> the<00:03:55.760> lane

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
down the lane

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.450 
down the lane
you're<00:03:57.760> learning<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.030> lot<00:03:58.090> about<00:03:58.150> boy
