00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.940 
fellow man you can break the two
greatest<00:02:23.600> Commandments<00:02:24.320> love<00:02:24.440> of<00:02:24.710> God<00:02:24.920> and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
greatest Commandments love of God and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.250 
greatest Commandments love of God and
love<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.280> fellow<00:02:25.580> man<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.090> still<00:02:26.810> be<00:02:26.960> saved

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
love of fellow man and still be saved

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.410 
love of fellow man and still be saved
now<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.190> think<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.610> position<00:02:28.790> would<00:02:29.060> be<00:02:29.210> well

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
now I think the position would be well

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.210 
now I think the position would be well
but<00:02:29.690> if<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.020> have<00:02:30.200> faith<00:02:30.530> you'll<00:02:30.740> do<00:02:30.980> these

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
but if you have faith you'll do these

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.050 
but if you have faith you'll do these
things<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.380> don't<00:02:33.560> have<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.520> order<00:02:34.970> to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
things but you don't have to in order to

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.760 
things but you don't have to in order to
be<00:02:35.150> saved<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.780> that's<00:02:35.990> what<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.380> position

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
be saved and that's what the position

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.110 
be saved and that's what the position
comes<00:02:37.010> down<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.430> that's<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.700> logical

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
comes down to that's the logical

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.520 
comes down to that's the logical
conclusion<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.750> that's<00:02:38.870> why<00:02:38.990> so<00:02:39.200> many<00:02:39.350> people

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
conclusion and that's why so many people

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.160 
conclusion and that's why so many people
I<00:02:39.860> know<00:02:39.890> who<00:02:40.880> used<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.240> be<00:02:41.420> Protestant<00:02:41.720> and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
I know who used to be Protestant and

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.490 
I know who used to be Protestant and
live<00:02:42.710> by<00:02:43.250> faith<00:02:43.550> alone<00:02:43.970> they<00:02:44.870> were<00:02:44.930> never<00:02:45.140> sure

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
live by faith alone they were never sure

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.250 
live by faith alone they were never sure
they<00:02:46.460> felt<00:02:46.820> free<00:02:47.210> they<00:02:47.360> had<00:02:47.540> license<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.110> do

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
they felt free they had license to do

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.450 
they felt free they had license to do
whatever<00:02:48.440> they<00:02:48.710> wanted<00:02:49.040> because<00:02:49.280> they

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
whatever they wanted because they

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.310 
whatever they wanted because they
believed<00:02:49.880> they<00:02:50.270> had<00:02:50.300> faith<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:50.930> they<00:02:51.050> could<00:02:51.230> go

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
believed they had faith so they could go

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.920 
believed they had faith so they could go
out<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.440> sin<00:02:51.830> now<00:02:51.980> they<00:02:52.400> shouldn't<00:02:52.880> sin<00:02:53.210> but

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
out and sin now they shouldn't sin but

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.900 
out and sin now they shouldn't sin but
when<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:54.200> comes<00:02:54.380> right<00:02:54.470> down<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.830> it<00:02:55.070> because

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
when it comes right down to it because

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.880 
when it comes right down to it because
of<00:02:56.030> our<00:02:56.150> human<00:02:56.390> nature<00:02:56.600> our<00:02:57.110> tendency<00:02:57.590> toward

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
of our human nature our tendency toward

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.430 
of our human nature our tendency toward
sin<00:02:58.160> concupiscence<00:02:58.970> we<00:02:59.510> end<00:02:59.720> up<00:02:59.870> sitting<00:03:00.230> but

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
sin concupiscence we end up sitting but

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.680 
sin concupiscence we end up sitting but
we<00:03:00.560> say<00:03:00.770> well<00:03:00.980> I'm<00:03:01.250> already<00:03:01.880> saved<00:03:02.300> so<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.450> don't

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
we say well I'm already saved so I don't

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.280 
we say well I'm already saved so I don't
have<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.470> don't<00:03:04.370> have<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:05.060> not<00:03:05.239> sin<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.959> would

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
have to I don't have to not sin I would

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.320 
have to I don't have to not sin I would
like<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.709> not<00:03:06.860> sin<00:03:07.190> but<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.730> don't<00:03:07.910> have<00:03:08.120> to

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
like to not sin but I don't have to

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.320 
like to not sin but I don't have to
because<00:03:08.780> I'm<00:03:08.900> still<00:03:09.170> saying<00:03:09.850> his<00:03:10.850> personal

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
because I'm still saying his personal

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.810 
because I'm still saying his personal
testimony<00:03:11.480> his<00:03:12.020> a<00:03:12.320> wonderful<00:03:13.220> thing<00:03:13.400> but<00:03:13.700> my

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
testimony his a wonderful thing but my

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.340 
testimony his a wonderful thing but my
personal<00:03:14.209> testimony<00:03:14.420> would<00:03:14.900> pretty<00:03:15.140> much<00:03:15.230> be

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
personal testimony would pretty much be

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.070 
personal testimony would pretty much be
the<00:03:15.620> exact<00:03:15.920> opposite<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.420> noticed<00:03:17.780> he<00:03:17.870> said

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
the exact opposite and I noticed he said

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.310 
the exact opposite and I noticed he said
he<00:03:18.530> prayed<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:18.890> prayer<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.640> faith<00:03:20.200> that's<00:03:21.200> a

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
he prayed a prayer of faith that's a

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.460 
he prayed a prayer of faith that's a
work<00:03:21.530> isn't<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.209> first<00:03:23.209> Timothy<00:03:23.480> 5<00:03:23.900> verse<00:03:24.260> 8

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
work isn't it first Timothy 5 verse 8

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.550 
work isn't it first Timothy 5 verse 8
again<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.980> brought<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.459> up<00:03:25.580> a<00:03:25.820> man<00:03:26.330> who<00:03:27.290> was<00:03:27.470> a

again I brought it up a man who was a

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.720 
again I brought it up a man who was a
Christian<00:03:28.190> he's<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.820> believer<00:03:29.830> if<00:03:30.830> he<00:03:31.040> doesn't

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
Christian he's a believer if he doesn't

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.520 
Christian he's a believer if he doesn't
care<00:03:32.030> for<00:03:32.330> his<00:03:32.510> family

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
care for his family
