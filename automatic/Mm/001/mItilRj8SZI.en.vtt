00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.890
 invitation of preference number two 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.629
 will be inside our garage number 3 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.180
 we are going to have a vehicle parked in 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.799
 this place that obviously is 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.420
 totally tuned to give us the 

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:44.370
 as much money as possible when 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.449
 what it was to show and sell ok now 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.549
 we also occupy what is a vehicle 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.900
 which we do not mind losing in this 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:51.299
 case I have what is a street in reveals 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.010
 at the end of what is this grain 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.540
 now let's take out the cell phone we're going to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.640
 go to the internet let's go to the section 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.619
 of travel and transportation here we will go down 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.970
 until the last section of vehicles and 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:01.110
 well let's go to choose any 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.670
 vehicle that is here not 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.369
 matter what it is simply to do 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.619
 one step of what is this little trick 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.210
 in this case to use what meat 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.070
 reveal how I can buy the color 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.420
 but I'm not going to put any 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.800
 channel just to get this out 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.600
 small menu of part 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.950
 left now with this I will be able to 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.750
 move what is this little box of 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.610
 tools which I'm obviously going to 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.860
 push twice in front with the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.750
 left pad now let's start 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.110
 move the vehicle so that more or 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.220
 less attached to what is the wall now 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.530
 eye here it is very important that the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.120
 circle that is here that makes 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.390
 that moves the good vehicles to stay more 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.280
 or less in what is the middle part 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.500
 between what is the car and the defense of 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.120
 this vehicle ok now the box 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.840
 tools have to cover the door 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.720
 of the copilot 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.400
 now we will stop and then we 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.020
 we will apply the b button once 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.040
 cancel and the button and to cancel what 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.070
 which is the vehicle which obviously 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.320
 we are asking now we stand back 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.030
 in this little circle and we're going to 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.160
 crush what is the button and or the button 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.320
 triangle and quickly the pad towards the 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.910
 right so obviously we can 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.520
 put the vehicle and we can move the 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.440
 then we selected first the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.170
 leader which is obviously we climb 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.700
 and we will clone it in this place that 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.230
 Find the chain in revel as you can 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.500
 see there do it now we do not accelerate 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.570
 quickly now we take out the vehicle 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.550
 obviously we put it back and like 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.230
 you can see this is the original and this one 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.440
 is here at the end or at the beginning 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.950
 as you want to see it is the copy no 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.720
 Now we can sell this copy here 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.430
 and the simplest thing just now 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.810
 I have to take out this vehicle and go 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.850
 quickly what are the saints that 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.860
 you here we're going to expect the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.660
 sexy hat will attend us if it hits 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.730
 this is the vehicle in the course of 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.850
 garage to the saints custom good you're going to 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.350
 repair it obviously and good after 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.190
 followed by this we will sell it as 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.080
 you can see they are going to give me 759 thousand 540 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.280
 dollars for selling this vehicle now 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.840
 obviously appear in the part of 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.820
 outside I simply ask again what 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.000
 it's another street in revel and good 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.410
 I repeat again what the process is not 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.090
 and this is going to be giving me 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.830
 pretty money every so often not 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.270
 so I hope you liked this 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.620

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.450
 video for more videos like these 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.680
 Remember that money can vary 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.390
 they always go to the same thing because 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.980
 obviously they are book but good i hope 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.030
