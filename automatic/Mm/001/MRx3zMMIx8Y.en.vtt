00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.799
 hello in this video let's see the point 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.720
 of the virgin made at half a point 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.730
 point of the virgin is a point with 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.980
 many variants 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.529
 the majority is differentiated by the points 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.289
 that are used to make the point of 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.210
 the virgin but there are also differences 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.939
 depending on where you have to put 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.830
 the pins for example in this chopping 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.260
 that we have here we will put four 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.730
 pins that will be one up one down 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.159
 and one on each side in this chopping you see 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.220
 that we will also put prick four 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:50.010
 pins in it in them 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.010
 sites although the drawing is different 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.199
 however here we have a diagram of 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.749
 point of the virgin also but 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.559
 we will puncture 8 pins because we have 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:05.379
 to click on each corner of the box and 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.259
 we will also click up and down on the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.259
 side as we do in the chopped 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.060
 previous to make the point of the 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.710
 virgin pricking up and down we 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.080
 we can find with this chopping that 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.759
 I have put or with this that I finish 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.420
 to show that the point of the virgin 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.460
 is marked by a cross is very 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.069
 important to keep in mind that before 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.090
 make the point of the virgin we have to 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:33.180
 close the two pairs that appear 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.160
 by the sides 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.410
 and I am knitting the virgin 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.170
 but in the event that you came from a 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.420
 torton also or of a half point 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 you should also close the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.830
 corners before making the point of the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.860
 virgin because although here in this design 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.420
 do not put pins if you have to 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.580
 close the corners 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.100
 to make this point of the virgin 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.950
 we will need four pairs of bobbins 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.810
 which will be the ones that cross in the part 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.170
 from above and then we will combine 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.149
 the crosses to finish the point east 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.410
 We are going to do with virgin 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.780
 half point 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.700
 then assuming we came from a 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.430
 torchon for example the first thing that 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.930
 we would have to do would be to close the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.510
 corner of the virgin 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.510
 back and crossing 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.920
 we would close the other side 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.980
 back and crossing 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.280
 and now with the two pairs that have 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.820
 stayed in the center back crossing and 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.540
 we will put the pin in the point 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:50.489
 higher 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.370
 you see and we close the pin that is turned 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.379
 and crossing 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:00.890
 now with the one that has taken us down from the crossroad 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:03.230
 from the left side and the one that remains 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.420
 to the left of the junction that we just 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.200
 do we give them a return crossing 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.480
 and we put the pin in the side point 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.010
 from the left 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.760
 back and it 's crossing 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:25.239
 we do the same with the right side a 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.239
 return crossing we put the pin 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.090
 at the point on the right side 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.489
 we turn the bobbins and 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.349
 crossing and now with the two pairs of 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.550
 bobbin we have in the center 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:45.060
 we take a turn crossing 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:49.400
 we put the pin in the point below 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.400
 and the drawing and we close the pin 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.640
 this is one of the most important things 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.510
 now we have to close the sides 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.030
 lower then turn and cross to 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.880
 have them ready to start the 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.880
 next point we have a closed side 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.830
 and we close the other side 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.750
 and this is how we will work the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.580
 points of the old now we will see 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.620
 from closer to see the 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:25.770
 nuances look at this virgin I already have it 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.220
 closed you can see how it is already here 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.120
 the crossing however this one that I have 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.650
 left here this is open 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.560
 if we start doing cross pairs 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.260
 the one above without having closed it later 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.229
 it will be ugly and it also shows a lot 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.139
 well I advise you that at the point of 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.870
 the virgin you take the habit of when 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.240
 you have done the point below that is 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.760
 closed the pin work the 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.639
 lower side to not to let the 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.440
 well open and after you forget 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.949
 close the virgin then let's 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.900
 close it we turn around and cross and now 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.969
 yes we will work the pin above 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.249
 return 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.249
 and cross we put the pin 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.150
 and we close the pin with half a point 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:27.089
 let's do the pin on the left 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.260
 we put the needle 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.639
 back and it grows because we are working 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.340
 to half a point 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.340
 let's now do the one on the right 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.389
 back and crossing 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:02.169
 and we work the center down back and 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.169
 crossed 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:14.960
 and when we have done what is what 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:17.780
 I commented the pin below 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.120
 we already have it put we work the 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.690
 lateral 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.620
 and we leave them ready for the 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.620
 next point 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.630
 and so we have finished our point 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:37.210
 of the virgin as she goes thinking 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.720
 the threads we have the point well 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.720
 formed 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.449
 look here we have an example of a 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.970
 point of the virgin that we have not closed 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:50.819
 the lateral before doing the next 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.220
 point you see here is a hole 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:56.069
 very large while at this point of 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.509
 the virgin and in this for example yes that 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:00.569
 all four sides are closed 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:03.960
 I hope this video is helpful and 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:05.430
 you leave me I love before we left if 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.740
 you do not want to lose any of the 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.970
 videos that I'm going to subscribe to 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.970
 channel until soon
