your water slightly brown now I haven't
got<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.250> very<00:00:30.240> bad<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.759> but<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.940> more

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
got that very bad and but it's more

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.290 
got that very bad and but it's more
noticeable<00:00:33.840> when<00:00:34.140> you've<00:00:34.320> got<00:00:34.440> more<00:00:34.649> water<00:00:35.300> so

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
noticeable when you've got more water so

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.150 
noticeable when you've got more water so
if<00:00:36.600> i<00:00:36.690> come<00:00:36.960> down<00:00:36.989> side<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.920> see

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
if i come down side here you can see

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.060 
if i come down side here you can see
what<00:00:38.910> has<00:00:39.120> clawed<00:00:39.570> ever<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.170> slightly<00:00:40.590> brown

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
what has clawed ever so slightly brown

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.580 
what has clawed ever so slightly brown
and<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.969> means<00:00:42.210> something<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> tank<00:00:43.260> now<00:00:43.559> i

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
and that means something in a tank now i

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.029 
and that means something in a tank now i
put<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.100> recently<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.989> coloring<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.230> brownish

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
put in recently is coloring or brownish

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.639 
put in recently is coloring or brownish
color<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.940> that's<00:00:48.570> most<00:00:48.809> lately<00:00:49.079> going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.559> be

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
color and that's most lately going to be

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.549 
color and that's most lately going to be
organic<00:00:50.280> material<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.020> only<00:00:52.170> thing<00:00:52.289> i<00:00:52.500> can

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
organic material so the only thing i can

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.470 
organic material so the only thing i can
think<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:55.110> compost<00:00:56.239> I've<00:00:57.239> put

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
think of it is is the compost I've put

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.689 
think of it is is the compost I've put
in<00:00:57.600> lately<00:00:57.989> another<00:01:00.859> so<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.010> releasing<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
in lately another so it's releasing a

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.509 
in lately another so it's releasing a
ton<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.840> water<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.339> coloring<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
ton in the water that's coloring it a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.510 
ton in the water that's coloring it a
slight<00:01:06.000> brown<00:01:06.330> color<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.710> turnon<00:01:08.280> doesn't

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
slight brown color and a turnon doesn't

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.960 
slight brown color and a turnon doesn't
affect<00:01:08.850> most<00:01:09.090> fish<00:01:09.650> in<00:01:10.650> fact<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.340> benefits<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
affect most fish in fact it benefits a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.260 
affect most fish in fact it benefits a
few<00:01:12.180> fish<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:13.350> benefits<00:01:13.920> pretty<00:01:14.549> much<00:01:14.700> every

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
few fish it benefits pretty much every

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.380 
few fish it benefits pretty much every
type<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> tetra<00:01:16.110> mainly<00:01:17.009> neon<00:01:17.250> tetras<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
type of tetra mainly neon tetras and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.649 
type of tetra mainly neon tetras and
also<00:01:19.259> benefits<00:01:19.770> prana<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.490> well<00:01:20.700> mainly

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
also benefits prana as well mainly

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.530 
also benefits prana as well mainly
amazon<00:01:22.170> fish<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.680> lots<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.580> decomposing<00:01:24.210> wood

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
amazon fish as lots of decomposing wood

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.649 
amazon fish as lots of decomposing wood
in<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> amazon<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.860> whatnot<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.479> it's<00:01:27.479> not

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
in the amazon and whatnot so it's not

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.420 
in the amazon and whatnot so it's not
necessarily<00:01:27.720> bad<00:01:28.439> thing<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.189> don't

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
necessarily bad thing but if you don't

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.810 
necessarily bad thing but if you don't
like<00:01:30.259> brownish<00:01:31.259> water<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.770> I've<00:01:31.860> cough<00:01:32.070> tea

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
like brownish water that I've cough tea

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.870 
like brownish water that I've cough tea
colored<00:01:33.090> water<00:01:33.439> then<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.280> get<00:01:35.460> rid<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.700> it

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
colored water then you can get rid of it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.080 
colored water then you can get rid of it
by<00:01:36.090> two<00:01:36.150> ears<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.680> activated<00:01:38.490> carbon<00:01:38.939> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
by two ears one is activated carbon in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.780 
by two ears one is activated carbon in
your<00:01:39.240> folder<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:40.770> you've<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.400> slightly

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
your folder so if you've got slightly

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.420 
your folder so if you've got slightly
brown<00:01:42.119> water<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.920> you've<00:01:43.920> got<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.100> piece<00:01:44.399> of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
brown water and you've got a piece of

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.270 
brown water and you've got a piece of
driftwood<00:01:44.909> or<00:01:45.210> soil<00:01:45.479> any<00:01:45.659> tank<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.259> good<00:01:47.070> thing

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
driftwood or soil any tank a good thing

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.700 
driftwood or soil any tank a good thing
to<00:01:47.399> do<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.329> some<00:01:48.630> activated<00:01:49.320> carbon

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
to do is get there some activated carbon

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
to do is get there some activated carbon
for<00:01:49.890> your<00:01:50.009> filter<00:01:50.399> because<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.479> remembers

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
for your filter because that remembers

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.950 
for your filter because that remembers
any<00:01:52.049> chemical<00:01:52.649> impurities<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:53.399> your<00:01:53.610> eye<00:01:54.149> can

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
any chemical impurities in your eye can

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.420 
any chemical impurities in your eye can
build<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.350> such<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.390> talents<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.280> good

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
build up such as talents so it's a good

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.789 
build up such as talents so it's a good
idea<00:01:59.579> get<00:02:00.000> some<00:02:00.270> activated<00:02:00.930> carbon<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.500> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
idea get some activated carbon if you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.389 
idea get some activated carbon if you
don't<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:03.560> another<00:02:04.560> way<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.979> get<00:02:05.189> rid

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
don't like it but another way to get rid

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.300 
don't like it but another way to get rid
of<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:06.149> water<00:02:06.390> changes<00:02:07.280> every<00:02:08.280> time

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
of it is just water changes every time

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.210 
of it is just water changes every time
you<00:02:08.550> do<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> water<00:02:08.940> change<00:02:09.090> will<00:02:09.649> slowly<00:02:10.649> bring

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you do a water change will slowly bring

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.850 
you do a water change will slowly bring
you

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
you

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.330 
you
hands<00:02:12.310> down<00:02:12.820> low<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.180> Laura<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:14.470> then<00:02:14.710> one

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
hands down low and Laura and then one
