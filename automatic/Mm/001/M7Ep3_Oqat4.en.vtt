00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.789 
what was going on and in fact the for
some<00:01:17.040> reason<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.900> home<00:01:18.900> button<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.560> menu

just that one power button here with a
very<00:01:49.619> tiny<00:01:50.009> LED<00:01:50.610> indicator<00:01:51.149> probably<00:01:52.020> you

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
very tiny LED indicator probably you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.830 
very tiny LED indicator probably you
don't<00:01:52.350> see<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.560> Network<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.399> let<00:01:53.549> see<00:01:53.729> it

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
don't see it Network you just let see it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.200 
don't see it Network you just let see it
at<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.899> back<00:01:55.290> there's<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.950> 5-megapixel<00:01:56.210> camera

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
at the back there's a 5-megapixel camera

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.910 
at the back there's a 5-megapixel camera
and<00:01:58.140> an<00:01:58.740> LED<00:01:59.130> flash<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.850> with<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
and an LED flash to go with it and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.550 
and an LED flash to go with it and
actually<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.880> above<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.210> flash<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
actually just above the flash is the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.560 
actually just above the flash is the
secondary<00:02:04.950> Mike<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.460> we're<00:02:05.790> guessing<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
secondary Mike and we're guessing is to

for<00:05:10.260> downloading<00:05:11.260> games<00:05:11.680> there<00:05:12.130> will<00:05:12.640> be<00:05:12.760> a

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
for downloading games there will be a

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.780 
for downloading games there will be a
separate<00:05:13.210> thing<00:05:13.650> but<00:05:14.650> until<00:05:15.190> we<00:05:15.220> see<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.460> final

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
separate thing but until we see a final

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.080 
separate thing but until we see a final
thing<00:05:15.970> we'll<00:05:16.450> never<00:05:16.780> know<00:05:17.050> as<00:05:17.980> for<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.760> camera

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
thing we'll never know as for the camera

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.090 
thing we'll never know as for the camera
app<00:05:19.210> here<00:05:19.480> it's<00:05:19.780> still<00:05:20.140> just<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.710> stock

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
app here it's still just the stock

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.430 
app here it's still just the stock
flavor<00:05:21.490> nothing<00:05:22.210> exciting<00:05:22.540> here<00:05:22.780> and<00:05:23.020> in<00:05:23.200> fact

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
flavor nothing exciting here and in fact

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.750 
flavor nothing exciting here and in fact
it<00:05:23.940> still<00:05:24.940> doesn't<00:05:25.270> do<00:05:25.390> 720p<00:05:25.810> video<00:05:26.440> recording

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
it still doesn't do 720p video recording

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.640 
it still doesn't do 720p video recording
so<00:05:27.760> chances<00:05:28.450> are<00:05:28.600> sony<00:05:29.020> ericsson<00:05:29.470> will

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
so chances are sony ericsson will

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.610 
so chances are sony ericsson will

the infinity button here and we saw the
same<00:06:04.840> thing<00:06:04.900> on<00:06:05.170> the<00:06:05.260> ark<00:06:05.500> so<00:06:05.950> it<00:06:06.820> looks<00:06:07.000> like

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
same thing on the ark so it looks like

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.570 
same thing on the ark so it looks like
this<00:06:07.510> won't<00:06:07.630> be<00:06:07.810> changed<00:06:08.080> much<00:06:08.320> you<00:06:09.280> can<00:06:09.400> see

not much to see the gallery app it's

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.520 
not much to see the gallery app it's
just<00:06:19.510> the<00:06:19.630> stock<00:06:20.160> Android<00:06:21.160> gallery<00:06:21.460> up<00:06:21.640> here

just the stock Android gallery up here
the<00:06:23.530> last<00:06:23.680> but<00:06:23.860> not<00:06:24.010> least<00:06:24.420> here's<00:06:25.420> the<00:06:25.900> dialer

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
the last but not least here's the dialer

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.030 
the last but not least here's the dialer
it<00:06:27.310> looks<00:06:27.700> very<00:06:28.030> much<00:06:28.240> like<00:06:28.320> the<00:06:29.320> one<00:06:29.500> on<00:06:29.740> the

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
it looks very much like the one on the

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.360 
it looks very much like the one on the
x10<00:06:30.670> and<00:06:31.000> maybe<00:06:31.570> the<00:06:31.810> the<00:06:32.110> other<00:06:32.370> extensive

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.840 
x10 and maybe the the other extensive
series<00:06:34.440> so<00:06:37.350> nothing<00:06:38.350> too<00:06:38.500> exciting<00:06:38.830> here<00:06:39.280> that

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
series so nothing too exciting here that
