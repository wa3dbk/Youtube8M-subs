00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.559
 Ayrton Senna Formula One World Champion 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.710
 1 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.710
 an indescribable scene on the podium 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.700
 thank you my brother 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.090
 The whole Brazil thanks you for the pleasure of 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.090
 see you here 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.040
 but and Roberto, I remember funny I 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.320
 I remember the films of his races 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.870
 their ram snakes if they really like 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.910
 of speed races mainly 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.500
 in films I celebrate almost as much as 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.530
 You in the movies in the movies is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.900
 You should not be a nerd. 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.900
 I prefer to stay on the right and 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:56.250
 with the driver also the driver, right? 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.060
 So sing a little and now it's going to 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.090
 will also drive with someone singing 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.810
 Now it's a joke of questions that 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.360
 we always want to make the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.509
 people like you are 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.030
 for example scene i know aaa 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:19.649
 but it's a very stressful time. 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.979
 there is some time there is a line where 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.330
 has a small reflex that you think of 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.729
 something that is not exactly 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.330
 on that 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.330
 in relation to the race 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.979
 It's only two hours of racing. 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.960
 attention a lot of anxiety and uncertainty 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.030
 Doubts and a lot going on and you? 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.470
 go controlling everything goes assimilating goes 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.500
 reacting 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.869
 but although it is so complicated 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.570
 just everything happening normally one 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:54.320
 naturally going all flowing 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.990
 and you and that is part of you you 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.680
 it's down from here 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.409
 This is ugly and tell me something and talk. 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.979
 so an instant of doubt if it is that 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.979
 there is not 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.220
 the tower woman in a race 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:17.650
 England as always raining on the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.970
 center is I went into a cloud of water in the 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.050
 car that is in front of me to 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.760
 first according to that will 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.290
 anxiety overtake and catch the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.530
 I entered the race. 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.630
 water cloud, I can not see anything, it's just 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.090
 I was in blind flight beyond 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.650
 I went, was that what it takes to last? 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.980
 hours and time off is in 23 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.110
 seconds 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.379
 a black figure at that moment my 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:51.069
 ed institute goes out're on I went out 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.540
 out and out on the clean lane and made the 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.400
 overtaking is actually the back of the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.620
 the front car left the track or 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.239
 need to have the passage I took the tip of the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.239
 needle and there it was 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.660
 in those hours at those times really 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:11.410
 paints the sun uncertainty 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.410
 very strong 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.340
 What do you think about the moment of victory? 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.590
 only after those two hours of tension 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:28.280
 around great uncertainty and anxiety 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.020
 It is a mixture of anger and love 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.760
 same time you're doing here 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.090
 in the moment of victory when you can 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.209
 to relax 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.500
 who you then overflow all that she 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.480
 all those sensations he took 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.780
 I know that you 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.110
 accelerating and slowing down and making you 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.280
 grow up 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.370
 is a special moment is what it is 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:00.190
 Every time, every effort to reach 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:03.040
 I'm the future the future is my 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.630
 Roberto is alive, the past is all that 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.240
 that I went through everything that I 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.050
 grew up 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.740
 I just hope to stay the same 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.570
 rhythm with the same enthusiasm even love 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.570
 in races in everything I do 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:26.660
 How are you? This is it. 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.660
 and speak of an instant with God 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.950
 It's very difficult to talk about God, it 's very difficult. 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.310
 Sinte hard in God and I had 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.840
 privilege of 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.840
 to have this experience 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.970
 to be practical in the world that people 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.380
 Did you see that we have to be reality? 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.960
 I had this experience 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.990
 This happened at the Japanese Grand Prix. 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.730
 but clearly for me and the last 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.280
 round of the race on lap time 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.230
 final championship victory 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.060
 I started thanking what I was doing. 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.100
 making the last turn I started 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.510
 thank you thank you that i could not 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.660
 do not even believe that I was going to win 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.680
 finally the championship ran a lot in 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.310
 tremendous capacity with attention and I 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.480
 felt the presence of him 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.020
 I watched it and wii was a special thing 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.259
 in my life with sensation 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.879
 My name is something I have. 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:30.470
 recorded in my memory the see and I 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.470
 I have as part of me 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.430
 I think it's a privilege I had 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.430
 that few people have 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.330
 I really care about this. 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:50.060
 How beautiful maybe there? 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:52.490
 japan's mouth to stop going to win 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.010
 does not manifest in lack of money 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.560
 the director of the company waits with Brazil 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.030
 whole waited for the departure of the 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.070
 Luis and Elton 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.070
 Look there, do you work in Brazil? 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.250
 housing 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.580
 It's very difficult to talk about God, it 's very difficult. 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:30.979
 Hard to feel God, I had the privilege. 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:35.599
 to have this experience and I felt the 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:38.150
 his presence I visualized I saw was 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:42.099
 a special thing in my life with 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:45.650
 huge sensation is one thing I have 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:49.639
 recorded in the memory see it and I have as 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:55.400
 part of me and I think it's a privilege 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:58.610
 I had a lot of people have or had me 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:02.659

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:05.169

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.580
 O
