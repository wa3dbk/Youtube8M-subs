00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.300
 hi friends agree christian 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.509
 the canons of carnival is the last week 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.100
 before you can still eat milk 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.470
 cheese eggs are not put to Shrovetide 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.430
 meat but still allowed fish and dairy 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.380
 products therefore week is called cheese 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.289
 pancakes are an indispensable attribute of carnival 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.869
 they had a ritual significance 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.460
 a symbol of the sun 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.730
 usually pancakes baked from buckwheat or 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.520
 wheat flour they were served different 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.219
 seasoning sour cream eggs caviar 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.420
 but sometimes you want a variety 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.039

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:11.720
 further pancakes with salad 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.400

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.460
 these pancakes will decorate your table on 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.979

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.189
 traditions can be combined with 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.360
 by experiments 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.060
 I use to make pancakes 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.850
 extraordinarily simple recipe i will leave 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.659
 a reference to the video in which I 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.640
 telling me how I make my pancakes 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.659
 even if you first took up pancakes not 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.390
 worry 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.610
 this recipe is a win-win you are not 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.850
 you risk even the first spoiled pancake 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.360
 In my video there are 7 tips to avoid 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.360
 of this 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.570
 Now I will use ready-made 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.560
 pancakes 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.500
 ready stuffing just say it ordinary 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.100

 Chinese cabbage and for decoration 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.069
 few pieces 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.100
 salmon in front of green onions I use 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.470
 for decoration is also not for fixing 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.310
 baskets 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.350
 put stuffing in the center of the pancake 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.480
 stuffing can be used any little 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.000
 I'll show you later options that fit. 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:34.510
 for Shrovetide like this our filling on 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.250
 place not put much because there will be 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.250
 difficult to tie then the edges of the pancake 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.850
 lifted and beautifully forming edge 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:04.320
 we fix feathers onions like a ribbon 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:07.530
 our basket is tied in a knot and 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.530
 correct the edges 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.910
 from above I decorate my basket with pieces 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.440
 senge 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.010

 feathers 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:30.380
 cut aside so that they have 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:32.720
 I like a neat look to make stuffing 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.750
