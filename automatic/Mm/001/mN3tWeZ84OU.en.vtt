00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.730
 Hi, youtube friends, we came back again. 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.510
 with our tutor web ebs the chapel 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.190
 4 and today passing another brief tip 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.320
 about web a chapel 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.870
 I'll demonstrate how we can 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.840
 use some features in the chapel cuiabÃ¡ 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.400
 that it is to implement or 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.580
 we put html javascript and hp codes 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.080
 as well as many other codes that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.820
 It makes it possible for us to begin, let's go. 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.300
 observe first how we can 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.020
 to put a java script code in our is 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.350
 chapel 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.070
 just remembering that java script is different 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.690
 from java 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.430
 are programming languages actions 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.460
 completely different from one another 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.520
 then a very practical example that 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.180
 we can demonstrate here is when creating 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.520
 a button 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.559
 we'll create in a button is in the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.550
 button here 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.390
 usually when we create our own 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.600
 button is he open this box of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.900
 dialogue we already know very well 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:12.090
 on the link button if you noticed there 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:18.119
 we have here a little symbol called 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 js esse js is the abbreviation for java script 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.960
 so what are we going to do? 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.840
 Click this button 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.540
 He will open this window for us. 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.369
 we're going to put our java code 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.259
 script already has a ready code here goes 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.009
 a text message appears as 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.909
 alerj 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.170
 It will be written here goes to 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.180
 Your message 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.430
 only it has an interesting detail that 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.399
 I would like to show you here 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.509
 if we put all this java code 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.790
 written here 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.159
 note that I opened it from the beginning java 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.530
 spirit in java script type 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.060
 java script text 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.850
 then the command for him to break an alert 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.070
 written that any noe of the chapel 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.829
 there is no need for us to put 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.400
 all of it then what are we going to do 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.560
 let's delete this first command 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.099
 because the skin is already 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.180
 has it pre-formulated in it and the rest 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.610
 which is the closing of the afternoon command 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.630
 script in java script we go too 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.620
 delete 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.760
 then you will only get the alert opens 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.880
 relatives opens quotation marks 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.330
 the text that I want quenches and 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.430
 close parent is coded here 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.380
 you can see that it has changed to the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.940
 little button was blue turned green 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.709
 showing that it is being used 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.410
 I can play with him there is a page 11 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.489
 file as not incarnate leave without 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.540
 no link 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:59.010
 Let's see what happens next. 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:02.040
 It's ready and we'll test it so it 's there. 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.599
 on my page in case the person goes 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.250
 click the z button 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.950
 now what will happen will appear 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.319
 a message on the page and here you will have a 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.830
 your site's name is when you use 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.540
 he is putting it on the internet is 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.570
 fix the cert will show the name of the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.989
 your site then your site one such page 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.359
 says here it is written your message or the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.100
 message you wanted to put there did not 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.459
 it's just a very practical way for us 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.280
 put there is to leave our site 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.459
 webware paper a little more interactive 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:40.340
 good the end user that box that 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:47.040
 appears here that we observe is her 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.510
 it will change the shape and depending on the 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.549
 that you are using the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.500
 browser you are using 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.109
 she will appear has been implementing 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.799
 some other codes there with the 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:01.680
 javascript it appears so this is a 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.660
 as we put chava code 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.340
 ours is from the chapel 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.889
 Now we'll show otherwise 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.600
 we can also make use of the 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:14.639
 feature is from the chapel which is the html code 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.979
 here is the html code for what it is 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.799
 this html code 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.599
 maybe you want to put a counter 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.540
 of links that put a counter of 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.820
 downloads that have 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.610
 I found the visits that put a 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.220
 banner anything else you get the 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.840
 his html code plays in here and he 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.560
 will appear on your page where you 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:41.450
 I put here an example only for 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.530
 easy here then let's go then 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.670
 click here or double click 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:53.390
 let's zoom in on it 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:55.520
 easy then just center more or 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.430
 any less 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.820
 here we are going to put the title of our 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.720
 html code for us is in our 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.520
 Our problem with this white box is 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.890
 where we'll put our code in 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.340
 yes we will get a certain 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.590
 place 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.210
 so I put the new code as a 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.220
 hit counter 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:23.270
 it is activated by activating on the 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:26.030
 html code and I can also activated the 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.870
 I only see this 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:33.410
 box it appeared not here to 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.550
 me is a creation time my code 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.600
 html 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.880
 then this html code I can put 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.910
 it anywhere on my site by 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.820
 example is below the text me 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.590
 make it more organized I can put it 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.480
 at the bottom of the page and so on 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.850
 Let's leave it under the text here. 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.340
 only raw so that everyone can have a 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:01.450
 idea I put my javascript code 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.900
 in the code of a text counter of 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.050
 pages 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.910
 There I 'll click here. 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.760
 message saying what I write 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.710
 or will face the next page 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.750
 and here is a visit counter that 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.840
 every time I opened my father and 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.970
 my page it will increase 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.280
 that is, I will update every time the 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.250
 altar refresh my page 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.290
 he starts counting 30 it's as if the 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.720
 person has opened on the site will not 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.280
 telling how many times the person is 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.440
 accessing the site 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.670
 so this is a personal few here 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.580
 cave features simple chapel has 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:42.660
 but that helps us a lot and leaves our 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.250
 more interactive site and also 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.160
 implement with some resources 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.140
 I hope you all enjoyed our 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.560
 video lesson and again one more tip is 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.930
 Chapel can be aware and is 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.330
 then our channel in developing the 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.330
 other subjects and not only is she able to 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.980
 It's about time we participated that we all 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:08.460
 Let's take good advantage of it. 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:08.460
 if we can find it here on youtube
