00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.470
 and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.810
 my expectations with sharing are that 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.090
 the boys can have like another 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.430
 tool to apply in the 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.110
 classroom knowledge with this new 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.730
 tool what I think especially that 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.800
 will improve is the issue of attention 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.570
 inside the class in the boys are 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.730
 as accustomed to everything being more 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.880
 fast more dynamic and out there write 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.440
 on the chalk board and copy from the board 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.690
 or give the class with the theme of 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.490
 projector computer that is energized 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.460
 much more than boys get hooked 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.040
 because the reality is that it is very difficult 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.940
 today catch them this without speaking at the same 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.940
 language that they 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.820
 it's something super motivating but this for 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.040
 a computer see an image that is 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.380
 put on the screen where it moves there 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.660
 animation is a bit in language that 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.610
 they are driving at this moment to 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.680
 principle when one faces the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.450
 technology is difficult as it has a 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.880
 little scared does not know if he will be able to 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.620
 comply with everything and little by little 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.600
 growing is going to overcome them the 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.090
 technology is causing nothing more than 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.700
 to act but to learn 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.920
 many things and I think we have won 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.580
 no only reaches adults 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.580
 as logical 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.500
 the truth is that for us it is all 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.430
 new and we are learning at the same time 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.810
 they are waiting to see 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.209
 How many things can we do because 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.550
 we want that they need and they want the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.220
 technology are constantly very 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.230
 in need of technological devices in 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.750
 everyday life for me cantillana 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.960
 sharing today is a challenge and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.050
 a motivation 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.030
 curiosity in my case that is a 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.580
 great flax lover 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.330
 the technology complement it with me 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.330
 it looks like it is 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.760
 today we present it for the first time 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.560
 the 23 and scenes that await 3 - with a 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.569
 total excitement that actually the 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.060
 most of them have a computer but 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.610
 good to see it reflected in a projector and 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.760
 what sites like we were super 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.560
 excited or excited they were 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.450
 that everyone wanted to sit down first as 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.150
 if they were in the cinema until more or 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.459
 less understood the dynamic streamlines 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.190
 very much more the class the boys are 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.410
 super excited about the subject everything 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.720
 what is new to them is always 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.030
 super positive is obviously a challenge 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.790
 because it's explaining a lot of things 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.500
 but there is the playful side and from 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.980
 a side where the guys are going to have 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.380
 much more fixes the attention on something 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.239
 attractive something that you want to stand out with 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.250
 the technology theme implemented in the 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.520
 classroom that is not something that will flow all 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.310
 what are physical contact books 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.320
 with things the know-how but that is 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.110
 an additional plus as can also 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.820
 be the books as can also be the 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.200
 work with nature with the garden 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.870
 it is a complement that has to 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.180
 accompany the changes that are taking place 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.359
 in the world tips that could give you 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.070
 other teachers that are encouraged that outside 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.500
 everything you can think of whenever you 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.240
 encourage me to take the step and this proposal is 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.130
 as it opens us to another panorama to 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.570
 all teachers with sincerity to 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.610
 principle I thought it was going to be 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.330
 much more difficult and the truth that in 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.520
 the practice was very, very simple and 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.940
 quite agile I did not have any problem 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.070
 how to use it is a good 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.930
 tool for us as teachers 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.340
 to be able to adapt to the life that 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.070
 they carry today that goes 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.730
 modifying socially with the step 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.730
 of time 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.690
 Y
