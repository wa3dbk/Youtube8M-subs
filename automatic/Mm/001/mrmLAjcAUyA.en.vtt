00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the expectations that I had versus the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.160 
the expectations that I had versus the
reality<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.240> what<00:00:21.539> would<00:00:21.660> happen<00:00:21.840> when<00:00:22.109> I

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
reality of what would happen when I

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.590 
reality of what would happen when I
would<00:00:22.380> get<00:00:22.500> there<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.010> let's<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.550> start

would get there so let's just start

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.689 
would get there so let's just start
so<00:00:24.810> my<00:00:24.990> first<00:00:25.170> expectation<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.340> always

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
so my first expectation is that I always

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.609 
so my first expectation is that I always
used<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.150> wish<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.449> my<00:00:27.779> teacher<00:00:28.019> would<00:00:28.410> just

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
used to wish that my teacher would just

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.259 
used to wish that my teacher would just
give<00:00:28.769> us<00:00:28.920> one<00:00:29.220> piece<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.670> homework<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.029> was

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
give us one piece of homework that was

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.999 
give us one piece of homework that was
really<00:00:30.630> easy<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.140> would<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.500> take<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
really easy that would just take up the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.470 
really easy that would just take up the
whole<00:00:32.189> week<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.000> didn't<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
whole week so that we didn't have to

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.180 
whole week so that we didn't have to
worry<00:00:33.719> about<00:00:33.899> anything<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.770> week<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
worry about anything for that week and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.650 
worry about anything for that week and
we<00:00:35.250> could<00:00:35.399> kind<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:35.910> move<00:00:36.120> slowly

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
we could kind of just like move slowly

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.720 
we could kind of just like move slowly
back<00:00:37.140> into<00:00:37.170> school<00:00:37.770> now<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.160> my<00:00:38.280> head<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.550> kind

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
back into school now in my head it kind

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.830 
back into school now in my head it kind
of<00:00:38.790> looked<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.090> little<00:00:39.239> bit<00:00:39.450> like<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:44.840> in

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
of looked a little bit like this but in

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.950 
of looked a little bit like this but in
reality<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:47.039> always<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.520> five<00:00:48.480> page

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
reality there was always that five page

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.810 
reality there was always that five page
piece<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.590> homework<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.190> had<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.579> by

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
piece of homework that you had to do by

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.340 
piece of homework that you had to do by
the<00:00:50.879> end<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.449> week<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.989> then<00:00:52.110> there<00:00:52.260> was

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
the end of that week and then there was

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.930 
the end of that week and then there was
a<00:00:52.379> test<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> amount<00:00:53.879> of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
a test on it and so the amount of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.459 
a test on it and so the amount of
homework<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.420> they<00:00:54.480> gave<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> first

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
homework that they gave you on the first

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.410 
homework that they gave you on the first
day<00:00:55.680> kind<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.100> looked<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:56.489> this<00:01:01.879> moving<00:01:02.879> on

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.179 
day kind of looked like this moving on
so<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.899> second<00:01:04.170> expectation<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.920> used<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so the second expectation that I used to

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.250 
so the second expectation that I used to
have<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.729> used<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.330> scared<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.960> people

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.200 
awesome let's chill sometime
really<00:01:39.220> yeah<00:01:39.700> oh<00:01:40.090> that's<00:01:40.630> so<00:01:41.200> cool

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
really yeah oh that's so cool

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.090 
really yeah oh that's so cool
so<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.720> third<00:01:43.960> expectation<00:01:44.679> that<00:01:44.799> I<00:01:44.830> had

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
so the third expectation that I had

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.980 
so the third expectation that I had
which<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:45.490> probably<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.179> best<00:01:46.479> thing<00:01:46.780> that<00:01:46.840> I

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
which is probably the best thing that I

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.499 
which is probably the best thing that I
could<00:01:47.289> have<00:01:47.320> done<00:01:47.590> was<00:01:47.830> that<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:48.310> used<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:49.060> want

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
could have done was that I used to want

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.330 
could have done was that I used to want
to<00:01:49.630> have<00:01:49.810> everything<00:01:50.259> organized<00:01:50.950> for<00:01:51.250> the

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
to have everything organized for the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.919 
to have everything organized for the
morning<00:01:51.700> so<00:01:51.909> that<00:01:52.030> when<00:01:52.149> I<00:01:52.179> wake<00:01:52.570> up<00:01:52.600> I

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
morning so that when I wake up I

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.270 
morning so that when I wake up I
wouldn't<00:01:53.200> have<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.500> get<00:01:53.679> ready<00:01:53.890> or<00:01:54.069> anything

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
wouldn't have to get ready or anything

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.980 
wouldn't have to get ready or anything
so<00:01:54.640> I<00:01:54.670> wanted<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.209> to<00:01:55.360> look<00:01:55.509> like<00:01:55.539> this<00:02:00.990> but

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
so I wanted it to look like this but

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.109 
so I wanted it to look like this but
after<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:02.380> day<00:02:02.440> or<00:02:02.950> however<00:02:03.369> long<00:02:03.670> I<00:02:04.000> was

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
after that day or however long I was

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.330 
after that day or however long I was
able<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.509> actually<00:02:04.750> do<00:02:05.289> that<00:02:05.530> this<00:02:05.830> is<00:02:05.890> what<00:02:06.250> it

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
able to actually do that this is what it

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:17.650 
able to actually do that this is what it
changed<00:02:06.670> into

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.000 

another<00:02:18.660> expectation<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.500> thought<00:02:19.709> maybe

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
another expectation that I thought maybe

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.949 
another expectation that I thought maybe
would<00:02:20.430> happen<00:02:20.849> one<00:02:21.030> year<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.540> all<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.930> my
