cutouts on the SSD cage to secure the
drives<00:02:45.810> inside<00:02:46.349> so<00:02:46.980> that's<00:02:47.159> considerate<00:02:47.879> and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
drives inside so that's considerate and

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.880 
drives inside so that's considerate and
you<00:02:48.359> can<00:02:48.480> also<00:02:48.629> appreciate<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.290> simplicity

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
you can also appreciate the simplicity

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.460 
you can also appreciate the simplicity
of<00:02:50.099> assembly<00:02:50.700> but<00:02:51.480> yeah<00:02:51.780> we'll<00:02:52.019> have<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.319> work

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
of assembly but yeah we'll have to work

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.500 
of assembly but yeah we'll have to work
around<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.920> cabling<00:02:53.340> for<00:02:53.760> those<00:02:53.909> SSDs

around the cabling for those SSDs

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.839

especially<00:02:55.440> since<00:02:55.650> they're<00:02:55.829> facing<00:02:56.129> inside

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
especially since they're facing inside

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.259 
especially since they're facing inside

the spacing between each slot isn't much

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.809 
the spacing between each slot isn't much

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
so populating both top and bottom was a

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.750 
so populating both top and bottom was a
bit<00:03:03.120> problematic<00:03:03.359> in<00:03:03.989> our<00:03:04.349> scenario<00:03:04.680> plus<00:03:05.579> the
