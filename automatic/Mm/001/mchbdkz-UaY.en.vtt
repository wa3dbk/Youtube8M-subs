00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:14.459
 I want more 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.689
 I have said it again and again 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.450
 I'm not a fan of the original series of 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.250
 saint seiya is more removing the beating from 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.529
 Gemini saga does and it's enough 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.690
 difficult to find another moment in said 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.730
 series that can say that I like it is not 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.769
 that considers it a bad series at all 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.870
 Greek mythology from a very young 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.670
 I've always liked it and a lot and although 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.040
 the work of Kurumada is not precisely 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.960
 faithful to said mythology yes it seems to me 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.540
 quite interesting the use that it makes of 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.730
 her more however the repetitive plot 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.620
 of the damsel in danger the strange 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.780
 need to repeat over and over again the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.879
 sequence of homosexual poses to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.739
 fight by removing all the dynamism that 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.570
 could the battles have the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.140
 characters that did not seem to me the great 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.940
 thing 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.160
 among other things they do not 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.410
 consider a series of liked me more without 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.390
 But a good day of boredom 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.670
 I decided to give an opportunity to one of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.070
 its so many spin of saint seiya the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.899
 you change and my surprise was pleasant is a 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.210
 series that I think is much better than 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.310
 original improving your weaknesses and 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.649
 creating a story that personally 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.430
 I found it much more interesting in order 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.800
 Enough 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.140
 blah blah let's start a good time with 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.900
 this review to saint seiya the canvas 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.790
 the manga of the cambas created by jordi 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.800
 teixidor and with a collaboration of 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.800
 creator of the original masami series 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.479
 Kurumada began publishing in 2006 in 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.510
 the pages of the journal in 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.540
 champions and ended in 2011 finishing 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.050
 with 25 compilation volumes in addition 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.970
 2009 cms entertainment started broadcasting 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.700
 an anime series in oba format 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.550
 counting on two seasons both of 12 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.899
 episodes coming to adapt 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.940
 approximately only a quarter of 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.160
 the original manga story the anime 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.320
 as I understand it was canceled and there is no 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.390
 signs that it will be resumed in the future 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.910
 the story is a prequel to the series 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.160
 original tour mainly around 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.200
 three friends orphans sacha the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.450
 reincarnation of the goddess of war to 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.550
 tena alone sacha's brother is the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.410
 guest chosen by hades lord of the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.959
 infamous and rival of atena for its 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.850
 wake up and fear the reincarnation of 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.890
 pegasus the mythological hero that is 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.440
 remembered for being the only one capable of 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.000
 hurting hades under that concept the series 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.340
 tells us the events of the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.380
 santa previous to the by all known 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.210
 counted in the saga of a from the series 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.610
 original said holy war it 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.070
 develops between the goddess of the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.860
 wisdom and war together with their 88 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.140
 Knights each as you already know based 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.290
 in the cosmic constellations and hades 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.660
 with its 108 spectra I know that what 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.000
 I just said it looks exactly like 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.190
 typical story of saint seiya but not 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.350
 it's like that since the pace and development of 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.630
 it is totally different for 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.130
 start already said that this series corrects 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.230
 several of the errors of the work 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.239
 original of kurumada well then do not 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.610
 I said because if we do not have the 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.530
 history so repetitive this series does not 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.870
 based on the classic of going defeating 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.910
 enemy after enemy to save the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.860
 goddess of the problem in turn so that 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.930
 at the end, everything is worth shit, since 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.790
 it was always the same goddess who 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.070
 He was in charge of defeating the bad guy too 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.350
 this manga allows us to know more about the 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.420
 characters and their motivations thing that 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.760
 I did not do the previous series since each 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.890
 Knight above all the golds here 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.840
 comes to have its moment of glory what 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.489
 that also makes them have much more 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.300
 weight of what they came to have in the 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.370
 original series 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.200
 where everything was based on the knights 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.120
 of bronze maybe the most point 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.010
 important in favor of the series is its 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.230
 script that the truth is that it's pretty 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.880
 mature possibly thinking of that 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.130
 outside enjoyed by fans of the 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.050
 original series in the nineties that 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.480
 for the dates when the cambas came out 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.400
 they would be more mature people besides 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.470
 this manga has several twists in the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.940
 pretty cool plot and up to a certain 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.070
 surprising point 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.350
 removing the linear and predictable from the 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.020
 original series another point in favor is the 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.240
 drawing which is not not that it is the best 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.250
 that I have seen but it is much better than 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.440
 the one of Kurumada in the original in this 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.090
 series is well taken care of although I think 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.160
 that comparing it with the one of kurumada 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.049
 anything is gold haha 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.910
 by the way the opening of the anime 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.910
 love for some damn reason 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.800
 yes 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.130
 good happening to the manga characters 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.230
 They are pretty great starting with theme 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.240
 the protagonist a thousand times better than 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.340
 seville although it is not that it is very 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.260
 different from him is a man who is left 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.820
 Carry for your emotions is not so 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.280
 irritating as seville and is 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.350
 extremely strong coming to activate 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.510
 on several occasions the mythical armor 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.910
 divine then we have to sacha the 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.070
 reincarnation of atena on this occasion to 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.080
 difference from dowser she does not need 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.120
 being protected in fact shows that 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.550
 she is brave enough to 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.140
 fighting with hades and talking about him is a 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.390
 villain that generates opinions 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.280
 found on the one hand shows that 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.440
 it can be quite cruel at times 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.510
 but in others it lets pass opportunities 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.340
 very good to kill ten mesh sacha 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.140
 although I do not think it's such a villain 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.030
 disappointing as it was from the series 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.890
 original I must also say that the 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.900
 relationship created by the author between 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.090
 these three adds a nice touch 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.250
 emotive making it that much more 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.380
 interesting to read but I have to 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.480
 say it those who in my opinion take 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.150
 the palms in this series are not the 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.250
 protagonists although they are not bad are 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.420
 totally overshadowed by the knights 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.460
 golden as 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.680
 I said before this series claims 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.600
 completely to the golden knights in 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.250
 the original series those who took 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.320
 all the reflectors were the 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.300
 bronze knights fighting with the 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.100
 bad to be saved in the last 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.230
 moment by which it was a 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.120
 useless except in the final moments of 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.070
 each saga here the golds have 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.290
 battles completely fucking as 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.540
 reaching levels of equity never 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.610
 seen in the original series being my 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.040
 favorite the fight of manny gold or of 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.260
 Cancer against Thanatos and Regulus of 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.850
 I read against radamantis by the way there 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.520
 some specters of birds that also 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.190
 they are pretty fuckers like the same 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.140
 radamantis pandora the bird attendant 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.240
 that has a super cool design and 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.190
 mephistopheles that guy is a fucking 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.710
 bastard in all the extension of the 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.170
 good word already to end up like 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.180
 conclusion I can say that the cambas do not 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.730
 it's just a prequel worthy of the work 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.680
 original of kurumada but rather I would say 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.750
 which is a prequel that far exceeds 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.640
 to his spiritual successor in all 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.740
 aspects fixing the errors 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.690
 plot of the original series and 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.790
 making it easier and simpler 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.169
 reading the manga at the same time it's a lot 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.240
 easier to relate 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:04.669
 the characters and if they had not 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.919
 noticed at this point this became 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:09.289
 in one of issuing in favorites about his 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.029
 anime not much to say was a 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:13.370
 pretty good adaptation 

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:15.319
 has a little mother animation about 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.840
 all in the fights and a soundtrack 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:19.759
 that is up to scratch and good and without more 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.979
 I say goodbye I know it's not a 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:23.990
 review as long as others I've done 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:25.879
 but try to summarize as much as I could 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.430
 every point I wanted to try so that 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:31.449
 it was so boring in the end I say goodbye 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.449
 we see in another video
