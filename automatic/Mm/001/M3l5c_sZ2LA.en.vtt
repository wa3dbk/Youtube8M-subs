again it's a 2000 Becky no 2 or o3 used

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.089 
again it's a 2000 Becky no 2 or o3 used
in<00:04:15.299> an<00:04:15.389> accident<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.620> owner<00:04:16.799> at<00:04:16.979> that

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
in an accident and the owner at that

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.259 
in an accident and the owner at that
point<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.639> you<00:04:17.729> never<00:04:17.849> know<00:04:18.060> why<00:04:18.209> these

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
point and you never know why these

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.509 
point and you never know why these
things<00:04:18.449> happen<00:04:18.989> but<00:04:19.139> they<00:04:19.650> said<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.190> total

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
things happen but they said it to total

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.580 
things happen but they said it to total
it<00:04:20.639> out<00:04:20.959> probably<00:04:21.959> for<00:04:22.049> insurance<00:04:22.470> reasons

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
it out probably for insurance reasons

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.960 
it out probably for insurance reasons
sometimes<00:04:23.130> they<00:04:23.430> just<00:04:23.580> sue<00:04:23.699> that<00:04:23.820> because

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
sometimes they just sue that because

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.029 
sometimes they just sue that because
they<00:04:24.030> don't<00:04:24.150> want<00:04:24.389> to<00:04:24.509> mess<00:04:25.320> with<00:04:25.349> fixing<00:04:25.949> the

they don't want to mess with fixing the
car<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.370> paying<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.580> insurance<00:04:26.699> or<00:04:27.120> they

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
car and paying the insurance or they

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.760 
car and paying the insurance or they
just<00:04:27.240> say<00:04:27.509> not<00:04:27.659> just<00:04:27.720> total<00:04:28.169> it<00:04:28.289> and<00:04:28.590> we'll<00:04:28.710> get

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
just say not just total it and we'll get

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.200 
just say not just total it and we'll get
something<00:04:28.979> different<00:04:29.130> we'll<00:04:29.430> take<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.699> check

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
something different we'll take the check

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.990 
something different we'll take the check
but<00:04:30.780> she<00:04:31.380> her<00:04:31.680> uncle<00:04:31.889> fixed<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.280> gave<00:04:32.789> it<00:04:32.909> to

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
but she her uncle fixed it gave it to

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.879 
but she her uncle fixed it gave it to
her<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.599> she's<00:04:33.840> got<00:04:33.960> over<00:04:33.990> seven<00:04:34.409> years<00:04:34.650> now

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
so I'm not worried about that because I

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.029 
so I'm not worried about that because I
don't<00:04:37.169> want<00:04:37.259> to<00:04:37.440> tell<00:04:37.620> you<00:04:37.680> something<00:04:38.009> you
