00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 welcome to the channel a little bit 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.180
 100 as always and without more 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.670
 Bait presentations will be passed to 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.769
 what we have come good then as 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.570
 most know the link of the program what 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.450
 can be found in the description of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.340
 video right now I'm hanging it already 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.020
 they know that if they have any problem with 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.400
 the link can inform me 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.400
 immediately change 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.510
 then here they inform me that a new 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.640
 file has been hung and good some already 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.530
 they know what comes next but for the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.960
 who is not very familiar with the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.040
 downloads we will explain to you step to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.040
 step how can they do it 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.699
 when they click on the link that is 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.680
 in the description of the video that 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.230
 find a little below the video 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.329
 will direct you to this page only 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.170
 you click to download and then to 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.170
 free download 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.290
 now they choose where they want to be saved 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.450
 the file to download I always choose 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.940
 the desk because it's easier to 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.100
 find but as I already have the 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.990
 file because it would be very idiot if not 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.850
 I had it to cancel 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.580
 you are wait for the download 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.590
 finish the file is weird and you can 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.930
 find where you chose to be 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.060
 download very well now that what 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.550
 they signed right click on the right 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.840
 rap file and extract here and ready 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.840
 they have the file covered 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.360
 then they open in file they choose the 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.360
 language and follow the step by step the video 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.060
 and finally we finished with the installation 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.100
 and they have open the good program the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.530
 who thinks he can use it without need 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.789
 and nothing else but the video ended 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.560
 for the one who wants a small 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.000
 introduction can be the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.000
 program is very easy to use 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.220
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.300
 select the video we want 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.270
 extract the gif 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.630
 then I'm going to write I'm going to catch it by not 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.930
 choose the same from the intro 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.220
 I will choose one that is short to see 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.750
 this school this is the one that I use 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.400
 from time to time though now 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.770
 lately I do not do it to finish my 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.150
 videos we are going to reproduce it so that 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.120
 you know what is this that will sound to you of 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.970
 end of my videos now we choose 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.600
 with these two tools that are here 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.050
 we select a piece of the video by 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:45.300
 example, let's select 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.300
 from here we put to the beginning 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.629
 and we want the animation to go 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.200
 that the paper comes out and here we put the 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.870
 final 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.629
 we already have a selection made for 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.370
 gif then it's as simple as giving it to 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:05.700
 this button that puts is track gif 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.379
 render renders the format 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.379
 of the video to gif format 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.010
 and you will see the result in about 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.069
 instants 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.900
 is an image that weighs very little and 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.819
 imagine all the possibilities that 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.000
 have this to put a gif animation 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:27.579
 you have already created the gif veis is down here 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.579
 you can save it as a gif image 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.210
 you can also have told us to insert 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.950
 in the image gif an object or insert 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.620
 text with some options that you have here 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.820
 but that I already discovered you because 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.910
 It is very easy to use 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.280
 we are going to close the program 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.900
 I do not want to save the changes and we're going to 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.200
 see the result of the gif that has 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.920
 created that is this is an image that 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.800
 it weighs just 1.6 megabytes that we can 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.550
 upload perfectly to a web page and 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.590
 we have the animation as you see 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.560
 repetitive that is typical of the images 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.580
 gif is not the enlarge it is seen that it is 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.010
 a quality not very good because of that 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.960
 it's about it being light but we're not going 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.519
 to make such a big bis never gifs 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.069
 they are usually tiny 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.819
 and we can have it on a web page there 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.819
 moving constantly
