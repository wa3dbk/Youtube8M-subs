00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.429 
and then out the other vent and then
you'd<00:01:15.840> pass<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.350> strap<00:01:16.680> through<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:19.080> buckle

and then tighten it down this mount is
really<00:01:24.000> cool<00:01:24.390> because<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.590> permanent

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.999 
forward and back because it doesn't have
that<00:02:05.490> much<00:02:05.909> stability<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:07.560> way<00:02:07.770> just

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
that much stability this way just

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.859 
that much stability this way just
because<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.849> size<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> base<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:09.810> you

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
because of the size of the base so you

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.190 
because of the size of the base so you
can<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> little<00:02:10.349> bit<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.500> Rocking

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
can get a little bit of Rocking

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.980 
can get a little bit of Rocking
in<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:12.430> can<00:02:12.670> be<00:02:12.790> worsened<00:02:13.390> if<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.630> don't

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
in it that can be worsened if you don't

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.440 
in it that can be worsened if you don't
manage<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.319> get<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.709> tight<00:02:15.280> what<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.000> like<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.330> do

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
manage to get it tight what I like to do

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.330

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
it with the clips open I then crank down

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.780 
it with the clips open I then crank down

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
on my with my thumbs my hand and then I

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.870 
on my with my thumbs my hand and then I
lock<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.840> latches<00:02:25.989> down<00:02:26.440> when<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.730> it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
through various parts of the kayak which

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.059 
through various parts of the kayak which
allow<00:03:04.150> me<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.420> get<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.780> prairie<00:03:05.290> stable<00:03:05.799> shot

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
rough on it but most the time it was

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.360 
rough on it but most the time it was
fairly<00:03:16.030> stable<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:17.109> that<00:03:17.140> was<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> overview<00:03:18.130> of

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
fairly stable so that was a overview of

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.210
