00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.359
 very bitter, very disheartening then 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.160
 eugenio benetazzo author of his latest 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.559
 book the infinite crisis 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.089
 we were poor and we will return poor and so 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.180
 is silent because there are those who are 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.430
 enriches we have seen we have seen 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.640
 as I must say that then for a level playing field 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.340
 let's say they are center right men of 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.119
 center left I quote giampiero marchese 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.000
 del pd giorgio orsoni for another 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.010
 affair but always connected with money 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.829
 public and who had to resign from 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.129
 single of venice and then the turnover 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.329
 of the mafia does not end of the cauldron 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.809
 to respect the limits of the GDP ratio 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.379
 deficit no so it's something in some 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.250
 so the bribes the generality beat 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.280
 with with that the infinite crisis 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.900
 I'm 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.540
 the latter work those who 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.070
 really rather recent writing 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.680
 during the month of August 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.380
 Also weighing our significant 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.630
 satisfaction in professional terms 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.360
 has a main heart on which one is 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.150
 develops all the message he wants 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.060
 convey that this point on 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.250
 subtitle we were poor ie how 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.450
 macroarea as a macro-region we will return 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.190
 poor and then the crisis we are already there 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.860
 still much demand then maybe up 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.800
 this so-called cd and then the crisis 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.360
 infinite because infinite crisis because 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.570
 I challenge everyone who listens to us from 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.930
 home remember since it started 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.940
 2008 every year we heard the mantra 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.800
 is but next year there is growth is 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.810
 but next year there is a recovery but 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.720
 next year will be better 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.550
 already now the projections he has made 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.410
 even the government does not have the fund 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.780
 monetary the ocse speak of a 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.000
 so-called recovery for 2015 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.210
 unfortunately there will never be recovery 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.580
 the Italian system for reasons that 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.820
 maybe then during the course of the evening 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.459
 we will face there is a theme of nature 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.670
 always financial that was little 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.959
 treated last week in the media 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.500
 Italians that is related to the size of 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.800
 financial wealth that has fled and 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.940
 exit from Italy in the last three months 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.580
 we are talking about 67 bars at 68 billion 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.130
 of euros that in the last three months have 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.750
 taken and lido and have gone towards 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.930
 countries or community or 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.500
 belonging to and financial 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.410
 considered more secure more peaceful or more 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.770
 condescending this is the first 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.850
 time that occurs from the entry of 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:03:00.170
 that is, three years have now passed 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:03.980
 11 November 2011 there was baptism 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.080
 of mario monti gave hope 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.510
 Italians of a change of governance e 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.180
 so we saw that he was not in 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.370
 these three years 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.090
 There has been an increase in resources 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.070
 financial institutions that are slowly 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.590
 come home this thanks to the 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.380
 contribution that also gave mario 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.420
 dragons he lowered allowed 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.180
 the lowering of spreads and therefore has 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.450
 cooled that situation of fis 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.310
 football that had hit and saved 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.560
 banks the danger 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.470
 the anguish and so on talking from 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.160
 this summer at the end of this summer 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.350
 Instead it resumed leaking 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.900
 look at financial resources elsewhere that 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.269
 there are so many almost 70 billion in three 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.440
 months and we're not talking about money of 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:58.340
 large industrial companies but 20 30 40 50 thousand 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.200
 euro that could have retired on 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.470
 small and medium entrepreneur or whoever 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.900
 not the best investor he had 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.340
 availability and that realizing of 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.130
 those will be the recipe to come 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.920
 applied in the next 18 months which it is not 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.049
 other than going to draw from 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.079
 so-called real estate wealth because 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.299
 that real estate has already suffered a 300 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.330
 percent off withdrawal from mountains 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:27.260
 to date without making so many names but the three 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.060
 governments that have what we have had in 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.070
 these last three years have used 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.850
 the house of Italians of the Italians like 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.419
 cash machine 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:39.140
 because from there there is now the thesis on media 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.340
 it goes from 270 to 300 per cent increase 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.990
 then 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.600
 the message we saw first 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.810
 on the screens that said if not 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.510
 understand that they must lower the 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.900
 pressure the voltage on the buildings that 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.510
 to date they have been transformed exactly like 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.910
 prodigal home generators of 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.130
 ready cash for those who governed and therefore 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.620
 have raised those 15 20 from the market 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.560
 billions that now make the difference 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.330
 and do not allow you to put them back 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.310
 expectations are anything but 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.070
 comforting because comforting for the 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.290
 next step will etc. is almost certain 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.070
 that the only uncertainty is the extent 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.900
 of the first unina further intervention 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.950
 tightening on the taxation of 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:31.030
 savings that can go so far on response 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.940
 on the dossier titles as a true e 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.670
 own mini new first asset 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.770
 which will affect wealth 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.810
 so-called financial and then step 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.900
 next are the pensions but not the 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.840
 pensions gold ones pensions of 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.890
 lead those that have most 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.360
 of the Italians it had to be 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:54.760
 touch up if renzi wo n't do it or if he does 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.920
 someone else will do when in renzi if they do 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.960
 it will go away because it will be without padoan 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:04.240
 indeed speaks or our accent will be the 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.520
 troika that will intervene and propose this 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:12.220
 recipe that was the same one 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:15.630
 implemented in Spain and Greece vote 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.630
 clear stolen money is a disgrace
