00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.470
 Mai is ready to show you 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.809
 In the meantime I have myself for 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.019
 the color red decided there are 50 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.750
 gram and about seven people 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.390
 I recorded 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.330
 this is what the finished decision looks like 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.600
 should note that you are still a meter 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.730
 had space at the end and the stitches 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.760
 are on the right hand 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.559
 the ab chain is quite simply a song 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:40.260
 through two times from the back through 2 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:44.550
 by picking up the thread pulls one 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.680
 go through and let the two 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.039
 misanthropic pushes this mesh 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.039
 dreams and chains 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.090
 catch up again 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.760
 if that's too loose for you just the 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.760
 still rides a follow 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.450
 with the many by the rides high 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.290
 let some unite and above 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:18.810
 You could also shake that way in principle 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.050
 when stretching from four fingers through 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.210
 pull through 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.920
 through the two meshes the two 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:31.590
 Drop people and a bit 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:36.340
 We have to tighten three times 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.990
 need the two people and the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.660
 mesh and takes off 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:46.410
 We are already on the move 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.410
 had to go through the next people 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.740
 hol 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.659
 again the taut pull the end as 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.659
 bees knotted 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:18.360
 where a punishment is not that with the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:20.910
 Decision takes so zemp chained one 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.740
 can let the sound so was in shape 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:29.370
 the flight as clever then the two 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.430
 superimposed so that the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:38.060
 knitted side and not the whole 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.060
 serve one above the other 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:50.250
 and that's just how they are going to be 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.400
 mesh taken at the beginning and 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:59.480
 at the end gave knitted and you chained 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.480
 just go through the rest of the thread 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.389
 You can also do it over the fingers 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.849
 but that's a bit of a shame for me 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:11.730
 complicated i just take that 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.730
 mesh and go through with the times 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.090
 Of course you can also want to take 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:28.989
 without glitter and optimal take double 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.370
 then you could have a different effect to 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.040
 can of course also the role lupe 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.510
 take either from Schachenmayr or 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.720
 jersey that's the white one 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.450
 Want a lot on a night light 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:47.440
 Also ideal as a gift I need for 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.140
 a scarf with a wave of 100 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.989
 about 20 minutes 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.450
 once you know how it works 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:01.599
 if you put it in then you 're done quickly 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.470
 so we are already at the end of 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.470
 knot both m 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.360
 Also be careful here not too tight 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.560
 knot here a double on 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.560
 the simple one 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.210
 then you cut the two I know 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:31.870
 turn around at the moment and already 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.470
 you have a finished one 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.810
 you do not see that here is something 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.410
 has entangled or sewn with the 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.570
 hand but fits nicely into the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.810
 shine 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:51.020
 Finally, you can do it all a bit 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.380
 It will be a bit longer and longer 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.700
 herbs to be beautiful 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:00.650
 I wish you much fun while learning 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.890
 and of course I am pleased about positive 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.890
 feedback
