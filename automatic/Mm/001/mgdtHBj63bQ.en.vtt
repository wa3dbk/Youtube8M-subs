00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 
they were going to run at it think we

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.190 
they were going to run at it think we
underestimated<00:07:04.030> how<00:07:04.570> powerful<00:07:05.020> they<00:07:05.140> were

underestimated how powerful they were

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.960

with<00:07:05.680> her<00:07:05.800> past<00:07:06.040> play<00:07:06.250> and<00:07:06.730> their

with her past play and their

with her past play and their
explosiveness<00:07:07.420> and<00:07:08.700> we<00:07:09.700> did<00:07:09.820> take<00:07:09.940> it<00:07:10.060> for

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
explosiveness and we did take it for

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.370 
explosiveness and we did take it for
granted<00:07:10.240> probably<00:07:10.840> in<00:07:10.900> the<00:07:10.960> fourth<00:07:11.200> quarter

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
granted probably in the fourth quarter

that<00:07:11.650> we<00:07:11.710> had<00:07:11.830> the<00:07:11.920> game<00:07:12.100> walk<00:07:13.560> been<00:07:14.560> doing

that we had the game walk been doing

things we had done the whole game we

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.150 
things we had done the whole game we
