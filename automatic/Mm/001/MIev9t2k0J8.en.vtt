knocked out and lost cleanly or lost a
clear-cut<00:01:05.790> decision<00:01:05.970> or<00:01:06.510> no<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.320> tweeted

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
clear-cut decision or no I I tweeted

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.450 
clear-cut decision or no I I tweeted
that<00:01:07.830> actually<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.400> was<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.060> worse<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
that actually I was like is it worse to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.190 
that actually I was like is it worse to
lose<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> fight<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.330> know<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.510> lost<00:01:12.840> or

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
lose a fight and really know you lost or

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960 
lose a fight and really know you lost or
to<00:01:13.710> lose<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> fight<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.310> no<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.460> really<00:01:14.670> want

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
to lose a fight and no you really want

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.280 
to lose a fight and no you really want
and<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:16.610> think<00:01:17.610> when<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.420> comes<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:18.990> ego

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
and I think when it comes to your ego

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.330 
and I think when it comes to your ego
and<00:01:19.439> every<00:01:19.619> fighter<00:01:19.799> has<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.189> go<00:01:20.310> you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
and every fighter has that you go you

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.609 
and every fighter has that you go you
need<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.270> sport<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.810> think

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
need one to get to this sport I think

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
need one to get to this sport I think
would<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:22.799> better<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.369> think<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:24.000> better<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
would be better I think it's better to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.910 
would be better I think it's better to
get<00:01:24.869> robbed<00:01:25.080> because<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.710> deep

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
get robbed because then you know deep

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.590 
get robbed because then you know deep

robbed in a fight when you know what so
thing<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.020> know<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.320> point<00:02:07.500> thing<00:02:07.770> you

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
thing is you know it's a point thing you

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.999 
thing is you know it's a point thing you
know<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.310> punches<00:02:09.000> landed<00:02:09.420> that

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
know the punches landed that

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.770 
know the punches landed that
well<00:02:10.519> it<00:02:10.640> was<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.789> point<00:02:11.090> system<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.480> switch

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
well it was a point system to switch

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.240 
well it was a point system to switch
dress<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:12.230> they<00:02:12.319> switch<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.739> point<00:02:12.950> system

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
dress so they switch the point system

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.649 
dress so they switch the point system
and<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.400> think<00:02:13.430> one<00:02:13.819> of<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:13.970> factors<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.510> this

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
and I think one of the factors of this

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.140 
and I think one of the factors of this
whole<00:02:15.049> tournament<00:02:15.319> was<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.459> they<00:02:16.790> changed

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
whole tournament was that they changed

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.309 
whole tournament was that they changed
the<00:02:17.209> scoring<00:02:17.480> system<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:17.870> then<00:02:18.080> they<00:02:18.140> threw

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
the scoring system and then they threw

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.020 
the scoring system and then they threw
the<00:02:18.409> judges<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:18.799> there<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.069> said<00:02:19.220> here<00:02:19.580> new

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
the judges in there and said here new

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.699 
the judges in there and said here new
scoring<00:02:20.299> systems<00:02:20.690> go<00:02:20.870> after<00:02:21.349> a<00:02:21.379> couple<00:02:21.590> weeks

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
scoring systems go after a couple weeks

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.220 
scoring systems go after a couple weeks
and<00:02:22.159> the<00:02:23.090> judges<00:02:23.390> didn't<00:02:23.569> really<00:02:23.780> know<00:02:23.930> what

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
and the judges didn't really know what

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.920 
and the judges didn't really know what
their<00:02:24.379> what<00:02:24.709> they<00:02:24.830> were<00:02:24.890> judging<00:02:25.159> so<00:02:25.750> they<00:02:26.750> go

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
their what they were judging so they go

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.240 
their what they were judging so they go
in<00:02:27.080> there<00:02:27.230> with<00:02:27.319> no<00:02:27.410> idea<00:02:27.470> what<00:02:27.739> they<00:02:28.010> should

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
in there with no idea what they should

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.250 
in there with no idea what they should
be<00:02:28.370> judging<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.030> creating<00:02:29.690> come<00:02:29.840> out<00:02:29.989> with

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
be judging and creating come out with

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.520 
be judging and creating come out with
these<00:02:30.830> crazy<00:02:31.220> decisions<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.120> then<00:02:32.379> they<00:02:33.379> have

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
these crazy decisions and then they have

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.020 
these crazy decisions and then they have
this<00:02:33.620> new<00:02:33.890> thing<00:02:33.920> where<00:02:34.280> there's<00:02:34.430> five<00:02:34.700> judges

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
this new thing where there's five judges

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.089 
this new thing where there's five judges
and<00:02:35.269> they're<00:02:35.360> only<00:02:35.540> taking<00:02:35.870> three<00:02:36.349> out<00:02:37.069> of

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
and they're only taking three out of

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.509 
and they're only taking three out of
five<00:02:37.400> judges<00:02:37.670> score<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:39.370> could<00:02:40.370> really

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
five judges score so you could really

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.770 
five judges score so you could really
win<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.819> fight<00:02:41.000> but<00:02:41.030> if<00:02:41.299> they<00:02:41.420> don't<00:02:41.569> pick

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
win the fight but if they don't pick

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.569 
win the fight but if they don't pick
those<00:02:42.079> three<00:02:42.829> judges<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.310> are<00:02:43.400> in<00:02:43.459> your

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
those three judges that are in your

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.670 
those three judges that are in your
favor<00:02:43.849> after<00:02:44.299> five<00:02:44.510> you're<00:02:45.200> not<00:02:45.319> going<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.560> get

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
favor after five you're not going to get

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.589 
favor after five you're not going to get
it<00:02:45.829> I<00:02:46.010> think<00:02:46.340> it's<00:02:46.670> gonna<00:02:46.790> change<00:02:47.060> again<00:02:47.209> very

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
it I think it's gonna change again very

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.940 
it I think it's gonna change again very
soon<00:02:47.840> because<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.410> don't<00:02:48.560> think<00:02:48.739> it's<00:02:48.829> very

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
soon because I don't think it's very

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.190 
soon because I don't think it's very
efficient<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:50.120> as<00:02:50.420> far<00:02:50.599> as<00:02:50.660> your<00:02:50.840> training<00:02:51.109> as
