00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
one of the things I noticed with this

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.319 
one of the things I noticed with this
machine<00:00:59.890> gun<00:01:00.250> right<00:01:00.489> off<00:01:00.609> the<00:01:00.760> bat<00:01:00.910> is<00:01:01.149> it

definitely has the same amount of damage
as<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.190> m60<00:01:04.030> so<00:01:04.690> this<00:01:05.229> would<00:01:05.470> make<00:01:05.619> it<00:01:05.860> right

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
as the m60 so this would make it right

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
as the m60 so this would make it right
on<00:01:06.369> par<00:01:06.610> with<00:01:06.640> being<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.650> know<00:01:09.060> being<00:01:10.060> up

there is one of the you know highest
damaging<00:01:13.000> machine<00:01:13.659> guns<00:01:13.990> for<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.340> medic

class<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:17.409> also<00:01:17.590> boasts<00:01:18.009> a<00:01:18.310> little<00:01:18.610> bit<00:01:18.700> better

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
class it also boasts a little bit better

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.649 
class it also boasts a little bit better
range<00:01:19.240> from<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:19.799> m60<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:22.030> it<00:01:22.119> does<00:01:22.270> have<00:01:22.630> a

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
range from the m60 but it does have a

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.670 
range from the m60 but it does have a
little<00:01:23.020> bit<00:01:23.200> less<00:01:23.470> accuracy<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.619> know

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
little bit less accuracy so you know

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.050 
little bit less accuracy so you know
just<00:01:26.920> keep<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.399> mind<00:01:27.580> when<00:01:27.759> you're<00:01:27.850> using

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.370 
just keep that in mind when you're using
this<00:01:28.299> particular<00:01:28.830> machine<00:01:29.830> gun<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:32.350> other

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
down scope it seems to be relatively

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.070 
down scope it seems to be relatively
quick<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.729> even<00:01:40.030> before<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.539> scope<00:01:40.869> has<00:01:41.050> a

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
quick and even before the scope has a

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.980 
quick and even before the scope has a
chance<00:01:41.530> to<00:01:42.149> or<00:01:43.149> you<00:01:43.240> know<00:01:43.330> before<00:01:43.569> the<00:01:43.810> zoom

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990

has a chance to complete you can also
fire<00:01:46.060> off<00:01:46.300> your<00:01:46.479> rounds<00:01:46.899> quite<00:01:47.170> accurately

fire off your rounds quite accurately
shots<00:01:49.700> are<00:01:49.880> going<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:50.870> you<00:01:51.290> don't<00:01:51.440> have<00:01:51.530> to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710

you get with the mish the with the q JY

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.430 
you get with the mish the with the q JY
overall<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.730> actually<00:02:19.239> four<00:02:19.959> hundred<00:02:20.260> bullets

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440

when it clicked you know the head uh you

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.780 
when it clicked you know the head uh you
know<00:03:02.440> this<00:03:02.620> machine<00:03:02.950> gun<00:03:03.100> does<00:03:03.340> have<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.610> lot

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
know this machine gun does have a lot

know this machine gun does have a lot
going<00:03:03.850> for<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.690> know<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.960> aim<00:03:05.050> down<00:03:05.320> sight

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
going for it you know the aim down sight

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.310 
going for it you know the aim down sight
is<00:03:05.920> relatively<00:03:06.520> quick<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:07.210> like<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:07.990> said<00:03:08.050> yet

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
is relatively quick and like I said yet

is relatively quick and like I said yet
again<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.740> know<00:03:08.830> before<00:03:09.580> you<00:03:09.610> even

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
again you know before you even

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.110 
again you know before you even
completely<00:03:10.540> aim<00:03:10.810> down<00:03:11.080> sight<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.740> fire<00:03:12.730> you

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
completely aim down sight and fire you

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.970 
completely aim down sight and fire you
can<00:03:13.300> free<00:03:13.510> fire<00:03:13.780> before<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.230> before<00:03:14.710> that

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
can free fire before the before that

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.570 
can free fire before the before that
fact<00:03:15.100> just<00:03:15.340> like<00:03:15.460> you<00:03:15.580> seen<00:03:15.790> right<00:03:15.970> there

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.110 

really<00:03:20.580> good<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:22.280> know<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.400> aim<00:03:23.549> down<00:03:23.730> sight

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
really good you know the aim down sight

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.929 
really good you know the aim down sight
you<00:03:24.750> know<00:03:24.870> isn't<00:03:25.290> obscuring<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.250> any<00:03:26.430> way<00:03:26.640> for

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
you know isn't obscuring in any way for

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.759 
you know isn't obscuring in any way for
your<00:03:27.090> view<00:03:27.360> so<00:03:27.629> you<00:03:27.659> do<00:03:27.930> have<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.170> good<00:03:28.379> field<00:03:28.620> of

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
your view so you do have a good field of

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.030 
your view so you do have a good field of
view<00:03:28.890> with<00:03:29.099> it<00:03:29.220> as<00:03:29.340> well<00:03:29.519> um<00:03:30.860> you<00:03:31.860> know<00:03:31.980> you

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
view with it as well um you know you

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.289 
view with it as well um you know you
would<00:03:32.250> think<00:03:32.400> with<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.700> amount<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:33.000> bullets

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
would think with the amount of bullets

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.059 
would think with the amount of bullets
that<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.689> get<00:03:33.989> with<00:03:34.379> this<00:03:34.530> particular

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
that you get with this particular

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.309 
that you get with this particular
machine<00:03:35.280> gun<00:03:35.670> would<00:03:36.000> be<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.450> problem<00:03:38.870> as<00:03:39.870> far<00:03:39.930> as

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
machine gun would be a problem as far as

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.569 
machine gun would be a problem as far as
being<00:03:40.500> able<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.799> burn<00:03:40.920> through<00:03:41.190> them<00:03:41.400> really

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
being able to burn through them really

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.610 
being able to burn through them really
quick<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.390> around<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.989> thing<00:03:43.170> is<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.470> due

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
quick and around but the thing is is due

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.990 
quick and around but the thing is is due
to<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.860> fact<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.340> does<00:03:44.489> have<00:03:44.519> high

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
to the fact that it does have high

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.720 
to the fact that it does have high
damage<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:46.470> takes<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.799> lot<00:03:46.829> less<00:03:47.159> bullets<00:03:47.579> to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
damage it takes a lot less bullets to

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.960 
damage it takes a lot less bullets to
take<00:03:47.909> out<00:03:48.120> your<00:03:48.810> enemies<00:03:49.640> you<00:03:50.640> know<00:03:50.760> for

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
take out your enemies you know for

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.509 
take out your enemies you know for
medium<00:03:51.359> range<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:52.170> close<00:03:52.590> range<00:03:52.950> you'll<00:03:53.280> take

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
medium range to close range you'll take

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.330 
medium range to close range you'll take
about<00:03:53.730> three<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.239> four<00:03:54.480> bullets<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:56.010> actually

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
about three to four bullets to actually

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.039 
about three to four bullets to actually
kill<00:03:56.549> an<00:03:56.670> enemy<00:03:56.760> depending<00:03:57.599> on<00:03:57.690> where<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.930> hit

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.149 
amount of course and you know over long
ranges<00:04:01.650> I've<00:04:01.980> seen<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.970> actually<00:04:03.090> tank<00:04:03.480> about

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
ranges I've seen it actually tank about

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:09.229 
ranges I've seen it actually tank about
you<00:04:05.159> know<00:04:05.280> five<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.790> six<00:04:06.000> shots<00:04:06.379> but<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:09.120> know
