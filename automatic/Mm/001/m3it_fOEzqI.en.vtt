00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 which one is rebellious good I want 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.270
 present them the famous oil of 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.360
 extra virgin olive this olive oil 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.400
 has many benefits appear me here 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.070
 I have the information information 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.630
 nutritional that says value every 14 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.539
 126 calories 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.630
 enough calories but has fat 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.840
 monounsaturates of oleic origin that are 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.599
 very good for a salad made 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.850
 feel very good and preferably the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.339
 Olive oil should not be cooked because 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.100
 loses its properties and well I'm going to 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:40.650
 go on to explain some of the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.420
 benefits of consuming olive oil 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.739
 daily 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.920
 we can say that it prevents the appearance 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.659
 cardiovascular disease as 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.109
 control the level of cholesterol in 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:56.940
 blood is a good stomach protector since 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:59.929
 that we say protects against secretions 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.129
 acid in the stomach a curious fact 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.429
 prevents constipation when it is 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.410
 taken on an empty stomach and raw we can say 

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:09.420
 that improves metabolic functions and 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.880
 structural functions of the brain already 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.310
 that these fatty acids facilitate 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.810
 generation of cell membranes 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.759
 we can say that it serves for the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.159
 bone growth as this to 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.600
 efe and olive stimulates the absorption of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.619
 calcium therefore 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.470
 and the formation of new bone mass very 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.479
 important and that you have to emphasize what 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.840
 the olive oil is a powerful 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.960
 antioxidant when we tell ourselves 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.070
 antioxidant is a product that protects 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.750
 against cellular deterioration and good and 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.810
 for all this we can say that this 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.810
 Olive oil is expensive but 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.580
 We may well say that an oil 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.970
 olive is much richer than an oil 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.670
 of sunflower or corn that is in sight 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.979
 more with one you buy a type of each 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.890
 oil and try us on a salad 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.580
 raw and you will see the difference but for 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.870
 course there are some precautions because 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:14.420
 although it is an oil that gives us health and 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.670
 prevents certain diseases there are 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.340
 consume it with precautions since as 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.959
 all oil has many calories and I 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.360
 I would not recommend more than two tablespoons 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.770
 by day three to the good ones but to 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.750
