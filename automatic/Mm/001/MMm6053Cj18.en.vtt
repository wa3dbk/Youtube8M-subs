of her and her good behavior you know
one<00:03:35.680> thing<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.190> works<00:03:36.400> too<00:03:36.730> is<00:03:37.030> when<00:03:37.180> my

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
one thing that works too is when my

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.740 
one thing that works too is when my
bunnies<00:03:37.569> aren't<00:03:37.750> listening<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.379> me<00:03:38.530> very<00:03:38.709> well

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
bunnies aren't listening to me very well

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.319 
bunnies aren't listening to me very well
we<00:03:40.750> do<00:03:41.620> threaten<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.730> put<00:03:42.879> him<00:03:42.970> in<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.150> cage

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
we do threaten to put him in the cage

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.689 
we do threaten to put him in the cage
they<00:03:43.599> actually<00:03:44.019> know<00:03:44.199> what<00:03:44.500> that<00:03:44.680> means<00:03:44.919> so<00:03:45.160> if

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
they actually know what that means so if

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.390 
they actually know what that means so if
they're<00:03:45.879> not<00:03:45.910> behaving<00:03:47.220> sometimes<00:03:48.220> they'll

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
they're not behaving sometimes they'll

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.830 
they're not behaving sometimes they'll
start<00:03:48.609> cooperating<00:03:48.790> if<00:03:49.239> I<00:03:49.359> mentioned<00:03:49.750> that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
start cooperating if I mentioned that

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.259 
start cooperating if I mentioned that
they<00:03:49.959> might<00:03:50.139> go<00:03:50.260> in<00:03:50.379> their<00:03:50.530> cage<00:03:50.879> and<00:03:51.879> then

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
they might go in their cage and then

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.479 
they might go in their cage and then
that<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.660> one<00:03:52.840> way<00:03:53.019> that<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.440> discipline<00:03:54.099> is<00:03:54.310> I

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
that is one way that I discipline is I

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.610

good<00:05:26.890> walk<00:05:27.100> and<00:05:27.670> I<00:05:28.150> think<00:05:28.420> that<00:05:28.630> you<00:05:28.780> know

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
good walk and I think that you know

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.240 
good walk and I think that you know
anybody<00:05:29.260> who's<00:05:29.440> patient<00:05:29.830> with<00:05:29.950> their<00:05:30.070> bunny

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
anybody who's patient with their bunny

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.000 
anybody who's patient with their bunny
can<00:05:30.520> teach<00:05:30.700> them<00:05:30.880> just<00:05:30.910> you<00:05:31.810> know<00:05:31.840> how<00:05:32.650> to<00:05:32.710> walk

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
can teach them just you know how to walk

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.250 
can teach them just you know how to walk
on<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.310> leash<00:05:33.490> maybe<00:05:33.730> even<00:05:34.000> outside<00:05:34.260> although

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
on the leash maybe even outside although

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.900 
on the leash maybe even outside although
that<00:05:35.440> could<00:05:35.590> be<00:05:35.740> a<00:05:35.770> bit<00:05:35.980> more<00:05:36.100> distracting<00:05:36.700> too

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
that could be a bit more distracting too

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.190 
that could be a bit more distracting too
although<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:37.450> think<00:05:37.780> it<00:05:37.870> can<00:05:38.050> definitely

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
although I think it can definitely

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.290 
although I think it can definitely
probably<00:05:38.650> be<00:05:38.890> done<00:05:39.070> there's<00:05:39.760> they're<00:05:40.120> not

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
probably be done there's they're not

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.360 
probably be done there's they're not
