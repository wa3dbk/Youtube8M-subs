on the on the film because sometimes it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.350 
on the on the film because sometimes it

does lose a bit through the through the
microphone<00:02:08.690> but<00:02:09.140> he<00:02:09.860> really<00:02:10.250> sounds<00:02:10.459> like

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
microphone but he really sounds like

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.760 
microphone but he really sounds like
this<00:02:10.850> show<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.240> that<00:02:11.300> is<00:02:11.570> really<00:02:12.050> crystal

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
this show and that is really crystal

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.710 
this show and that is really crystal
clear<00:02:12.800> as<00:02:13.250> well<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:14.270> can<00:02:14.390> see<00:02:14.540> where<00:02:14.660> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
clear as well so you can see where the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.630 
clear as well so you can see where the
extra<00:02:14.930> money's<00:02:15.170> gone<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.470> this<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:16.310> basically

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
extra money's gone on this is basically

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.710 
extra money's gone on this is basically
I<00:02:16.730> think<00:02:16.850> gone<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.330> fact<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.570> these

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
I think gone on the fact that these

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.270 
I think gone on the fact that these
mouth<00:02:17.930> moves<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.709> speaker's<00:02:19.070> about

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
mouth moves and the speaker's about

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
quality inside that's ways a bit more
