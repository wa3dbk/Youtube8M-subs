flowing<00:00:21.570> back<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.990> forth<00:00:22.199> until<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.920> engines

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
flowing back and forth until the engines

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.349

need<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.760> little<00:00:23.880> bit<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.090> it'll<00:00:24.300> go

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
need it and a little bit of it'll go

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.720 
need it and a little bit of it'll go
under<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> engine<00:00:24.750> but<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.920> reason<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.490> I

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
under the engine but the reason is I

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.070 
under the engine but the reason is I
think<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.240> haven't<00:00:27.510> been<00:00:27.599> back<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> nether

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
think I haven't been back to the nether

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.929 
think I haven't been back to the nether
to<00:00:28.230> check<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.369> guys<00:00:29.490> know<00:00:29.519> we<00:00:29.789> took

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and I was able to build a second engine

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.620 
and I was able to build a second engine
from<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.760> iron<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.090> collected<00:00:36.480> in

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
from the iron that I collected in

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.060 
from the iron that I collected in
between<00:00:36.870> episodes<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.469> actually<00:00:37.559> got<00:00:37.800> quite<00:00:37.950> a

between episodes I actually got quite a
bit<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.250> iron<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.920> I<00:00:40.920> only<00:00:41.160> had<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.790> excess

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
bit of iron and I only had one excess

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.680 
bit of iron and I only had one excess
inviting<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.469> left<00:00:43.649> over<00:00:43.920> sadly<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.210> no<00:00:45.510> more

inviting get left over sadly so no more

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.069 
inviting get left over sadly so no more
engines<00:00:46.020> for<00:00:46.230> now<00:00:46.620> our<00:00:47.629> ferrous<00:00:48.629> metal<00:00:48.930> eyes

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the quarry is not there to do that the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.380 
the quarry is not there to do that the
chunks<00:00:59.309> are<00:00:59.399> saying<00:00:59.670> loaded<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> nethers

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
chunks are saying loaded the nethers

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.229 
chunks are saying loaded the nethers
just<00:01:01.109> shutting<00:01:01.530> down<00:01:01.770> basically<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.640> so

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
there's no lava to be pumped back to the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.190 
there's no lava to be pumped back to the
the<00:01:05.210> overworld<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.510> keep<00:01:06.659> calling<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> real

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.219 
the overworld I keep calling it the real
world<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> overworld<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.869> what<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.110> have

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
world so the overworld so what we have

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.980 
world so the overworld so what we have
to<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.439> now<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.619> set<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.159> some<00:01:11.430> device<00:01:11.729> that

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
to do now is set up some device that

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.149 
to do now is set up some device that
will<00:01:12.990> sit<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> nether<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.830> keep<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
will sit in the nether and keep the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.190 
will sit in the nether and keep the
chunks<00:01:14.430> active<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:15.659> continue<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> get

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
chunks active so we can continue to get

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960 
chunks active so we can continue to get
all<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.530> our<00:01:16.590> precious<00:01:16.950> precious<00:01:17.340> lava<00:01:17.729> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
all of our precious precious lava and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.789 
all of our precious precious lava and
yes<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.270> still<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.600> these<00:01:18.780> running<00:01:19.170> best

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
working until I'm able to get two more

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.609 
working until I'm able to get two more
of<00:01:26.100> our<00:01:26.430> lovely<00:01:27.210> magmatic<00:01:27.720> engines<00:01:28.229> installed

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
of our lovely magmatic engines installed

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.590 
of our lovely magmatic engines installed
and<00:01:28.829> once<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.000> magnetic<00:01:30.329> engines

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and once we have for magnetic engines

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.170 
and once we have for magnetic engines
it'll<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.140> better<00:01:31.320> than<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> eight<00:01:32.400> steam

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it'll be better than the eight steam

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.550 
it'll be better than the eight steam
engines<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.750> over<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.140> well<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.470> only

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
engines we have over here well we only

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.800 
engines we have over here well we only
have<00:01:34.710> seven<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.189> we'll<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.460> doing<00:01:35.600> peachy<00:01:36.600> keen

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
have seven so we'll be doing peachy keen

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
have seven so we'll be doing peachy keen
so<00:01:37.590> these<00:01:37.829> are<00:01:37.890> about<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.460> well<00:01:38.850> they're<00:01:38.970> not

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
so these are about to well they're not

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.609 
so these are about to well they're not
get<00:01:39.180> about<00:01:39.329> two<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:39.659> get<00:01:39.810> some<00:01:39.960> time<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.500> we

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
get about two they get some time but we

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.080 
get about two they get some time but we
need<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.829> go<00:01:40.920> ahead<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.369> build<00:01:41.640> what<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
need to go ahead and build what is

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.749 
need to go ahead and build what is
called<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.710> dimensional<00:01:43.710> anchor<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.610> just

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
called a dimensional anchor so we just

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.230 
called a dimensional anchor so we just
look<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:45.200> anchor<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.920> quickly<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:48.119> will

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
look up anchor really quickly we will

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.149 
look up anchor really quickly we will
find<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.049> rancher<00:01:49.619> which<00:01:50.009> is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
find that we have the rancher which is

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.550 
find that we have the rancher which is
nothing<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.820> with<00:01:51.210> anchor<00:01:51.780> two<00:01:52.259> different

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
nothing to do with anchor two different

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.530 
nothing to do with anchor two different
things<00:01:52.680> we'll<00:01:53.340> need<00:01:53.460> gold<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.119> block<00:01:54.329> of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
things we'll need gold and a block of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.050 
things we'll need gold and a block of
iron<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.979> if<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.130> ever<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> Tekkit<00:01:56.850> server

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
iron and if I ever do a Tekkit server

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.080 
iron and if I ever do a Tekkit server
these<00:01:57.960> will<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.590> certain<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.340> banned<00:01:59.670> because

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
these will for certain be banned because

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.209 
these will for certain be banned because
they<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.450> cause<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.899> much<00:02:01.049> lag<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:02.009> because

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
they can cause so much lag but because

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.130 
they can cause so much lag but because

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
about it I understand the confusion but

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.960 
about it I understand the confusion but
yeah<00:02:48.390> slow<00:02:49.110> down<00:02:49.260> our<00:02:49.290> dimensional<00:02:49.970> anchor

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
yeah slow down our dimensional anchor

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.580 
yeah slow down our dimensional anchor
here<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.450> you'll<00:02:51.540> see<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:51.840> keeping<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.410> one

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
here and you'll see it's keeping a one

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.560 
here and you'll see it's keeping a one
by<00:02:52.740> one<00:02:52.950> area<00:02:53.250> one<00:02:53.459> by<00:02:53.580> one<00:02:53.730> chunk<00:02:54.030> loaded<00:02:54.420> and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
by one area one by one chunk loaded and

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.210 
by one area one by one chunk loaded and
that's<00:02:54.720> fine<00:02:54.959> by<00:02:55.140> me<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.860> need<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.070> make<00:02:56.190> sure

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
that's fine by me we need to make sure

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.620 
that's fine by me we need to make sure
that<00:02:56.550> those<00:02:56.730> items<00:02:56.970> are<00:02:57.150> actually<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
that those items are actually in the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.880 
that those items are actually in the
chunk<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.280> believe<00:02:59.280> f9<00:02:59.790> will<00:03:00.180> open<00:03:00.390> up<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.570> grid

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
chunk I believe f9 will open up a grid

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.040 
chunk I believe f9 will open up a grid
okay<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.400> chunk<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.880> these<00:03:03.720> are

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
okay so this is the chunk and these are

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
we go it'll show the the updated chunk

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.259 
we go it'll show the the updated chunk
that<00:03:28.320> it's<00:03:28.500> using<00:03:28.860> here<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.820> you'll<00:03:30.060> see<00:03:30.239> that

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
yes this is just barely within the chunk

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.240

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
of course expand the chunk if you can't

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.900 
of course expand the chunk if you can't
get<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.510> just<00:03:39.720> right<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.550> toggle<00:03:41.550> around<00:03:41.850> to

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.009 
you where monsters can spot it will put
little<00:03:56.730> X's<00:03:57.030> on<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.209> ground<00:03:57.390> saying<00:03:57.630> monsters

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
little X's on the ground saying monsters

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.990 
little X's on the ground saying monsters
can<00:03:58.260> spawn<00:03:58.590> here<00:03:58.920> that's<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.550> cool<00:03:59.790> and<00:03:59.970> I

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
can spawn here that's the cool and I

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.880 
can spawn here that's the cool and I
found<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.330> other<00:04:00.390> day<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:01.320> don't<00:04:01.650> think

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
found the other day that I don't think

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.190 
found the other day that I don't think
I've<00:04:01.980> mentioned<00:04:02.190> before<00:04:02.750> but<00:04:03.750> yeah<00:04:03.840> if<00:04:03.959> we<00:04:04.050> hop

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
I've mentioned before but yeah if we hop

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.840 
I've mentioned before but yeah if we hop
back<00:04:04.410> into<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.800> overworld<00:04:05.160> will<00:04:05.519> see<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:05.790> I

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
back into the overworld will see that I

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.220 
back into the overworld will see that I
have<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.120> potential<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.630> have<00:04:06.750> monstrous

fondant yeah what have to fix that let's
see<00:04:10.650> if<00:04:10.709> I<00:04:10.769> move<00:04:10.950> this<00:04:11.070> torch<00:04:11.430> over<00:04:11.580> any

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
see if I move this torch over any

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:19.000 
see if I move this torch over any
federal<00:04:12.150> help<00:04:13.220> helped<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.280> little<00:04:14.400> bit

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.500 

alright<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.310> I'll<00:04:20.730> bring<00:04:20.970> some<00:04:21.150> more<00:04:21.239> torches

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
alright and I'll bring some more torches

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.840 
alright and I'll bring some more torches
down<00:04:21.630> later<00:04:22.079> I<00:04:22.350> guess<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.280> have<00:04:23.400> more<00:04:23.520> important

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
down later I guess I have more important

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.270 
down later I guess I have more important
things<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.060> worry<00:04:24.120> about<00:04:24.240> for<00:04:24.630> now<00:04:25.020> but<00:04:25.980> anyway

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
things to worry about for now but anyway

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.620 
things to worry about for now but anyway
I<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:26.610> as<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:26.880> can<00:04:26.940> see<00:04:27.090> here<00:04:27.210> we're<00:04:27.330> not<00:04:27.510> in

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
I so as you can see here we're not in

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.510 
I so as you can see here we're not in
the<00:04:27.690> nether<00:04:27.900> but<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.320> anchor<00:04:29.040> is<00:04:29.070> keeping<00:04:29.430> the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
the nether but the anchor is keeping the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.040 
the nether but the anchor is keeping the
nether<00:04:29.670> loaded<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.210> thus<00:04:30.360> keeping<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.840> full

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
nether loaded and thus keeping a full

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.170 
nether loaded and thus keeping a full
thing<00:04:31.230> of<00:04:31.410> lava<00:04:32.100> pumping<00:04:32.550> into<00:04:32.670> here<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:32.910> our

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
thing of lava pumping into here and our

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.450 
thing of lava pumping into here and our
machines<00:04:33.540> so<00:04:34.470> there<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:34.770> go<00:04:34.800> very<00:04:35.130> short

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
machines so there you go very short

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.010 
machines so there you go very short
episode<00:04:35.820> I<00:04:35.850> looks<00:04:36.330> like<00:04:36.540> it's<00:04:36.690> going<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:36.840> come

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
episode I looks like it's going to come

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.870 
episode I looks like it's going to come
in<00:04:37.170> at<00:04:37.320> around<00:04:37.440> five<00:04:38.130> minutes<00:04:38.400> if<00:04:38.610> I<00:04:38.670> keep

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
in at around five minutes if I keep

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.390 
in at around five minutes if I keep
talking<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.540> little<00:04:40.110> bit<00:04:40.290> more<00:04:40.590> although<00:04:41.040> if<00:04:41.250> I

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
talking a little bit more although if I

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.130 
talking a little bit more although if I
go<00:04:41.520> ahead<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:41.790> add<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.000> ending<00:04:42.210> on<00:04:42.300> now<00:04:42.570> just

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
go ahead and add the ending on now just

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.930 
go ahead and add the ending on now just
the<00:04:43.320> where<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.860> rocket<00:04:44.160> flies<00:04:44.370> by<00:04:44.610> it'll<00:04:44.850> be

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
the where the rocket flies by it'll be

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.060 
the where the rocket flies by it'll be
exactly<00:04:45.030> five<00:04:45.510> minutes<00:04:45.750> but<00:04:46.680> yeah<00:04:46.770> that's<00:04:46.920> the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
exactly five minutes but yeah that's the

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.550 
exactly five minutes but yeah that's the
dimensional<00:04:47.490> anchor<00:04:47.700> that's<00:04:47.910> how<00:04:48.030> that<00:04:48.090> works

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
dimensional anchor that's how that works
