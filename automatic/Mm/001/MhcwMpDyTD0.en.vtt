00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.410
 Well, here we already have 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.900
 to our plant planted well here and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.840
 good as you can appreciate the roots 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.960
 they are very good I am not going to throw water anymore 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.540
 she was manipulated enough look like 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.230
 they have the leaves and you can see 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.510
 I have saved the orchid and it is already 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.330
 it has changed I have already put him not 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.800
 I changed nothing or the earth is here 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.080
 That is the land that was already coming 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.120
 factory, all I did was open 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.860
 the holes to the container as there 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.590
 I think I've shown it in some video 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.190
 how do I open the toys to aerate 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.649
 that is to favor a little ventilation 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.739
 of the plant inside and well then 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.790
 as you can see the leaves there 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.850
 they are perfect 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.190
 the leaves are very good they are very 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.489
 stops the roots are very good there 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.500
 see perfectly the roots today I do not 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.930
 I'm going to do nothing else what 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.500
 what I did that cinnamon milk in the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.030
 little tips 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.630
 you can see that they arrived were the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.789
 tipitas good there is a 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.680
 one of the tutors I saved it 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.119
 because those tutors are long to me not 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.200
 I like what I did then was that 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.799
 I left one alone and there is a wand that is 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.330
 a little bit like it's loose but that has 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.680
 remedy 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.560
 then you can 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.230
 Stoic, here comes this 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.840
 device that has two holes and 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.770
 you just grab it and then 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.539
 they are all perfect all grabs 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.469
 let's put a single tutor because both 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.659
 sculptors like good I cross my fingers 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:56.250
 let's see if we are lucky and that of 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.020
 some of those yolks 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.430
 sprout another floral wand or kiki or something 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:08.369
 I these days today is day 11 10 Thursday 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.890
 possibly on Sunday we are going to leave it 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.780
 tranquilize so that this one adapts to your 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.580
 new habitat I 'm going to leave it 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.630
 quiet on Sunday possibly good 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.180
 Monday and then I deny them milk 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.490
 water of course with water not tracing 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.170
 already not to be pouring water from the 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.810
 key is as it is very full of lime 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.510
 next week I'll be giving you a 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.900
 little fertilizer and other good 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.090
 this has been everything and here I have a 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.730
 and show them what was 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.849
 saying d 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.400
 of the waste or you look for a 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.290
 any container and throw everything 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.500
 that is going to submerge them and 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.120
 leaves to this is little plant you dropped 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.319
 two leaves the first one that I showed in 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.709
 camera that had the brand is of water and 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.720
 well it's fine rarely stadium is the 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.180
 remove personally but this one fell 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.069
 when I was already sowing and everything 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.650
 others are the roots 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.549
 That is the software do keep 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.319
 they do it 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.090
 well no they do not have to be the complex and 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.790
 the drug itself as a cemetery of 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:19.349
 the orchids and just as I named it and 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.290
 where the powder waste is used 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.750
 of what is the orchid roots of 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.900
 you let them dry a powder and that 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.500
 It also serves to 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:36.850
 what they call symbiotic germination 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.040
 of the seeds there is no germination of the 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.350
 that you know in vitro that is in a 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.480
 laboratory and there is another combination that 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.600
 it is called or it is named germination 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.510
 symbiotic and in one of the steps it 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.970
 uses orchid root powder or 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.580
 that step is not in vitro that step is not 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.370
 has a narcolaboratory 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.200
 we'll talk a little more truth 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.200
 go ahead because I 've done it 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.880
 you can count them well you can then 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.890
 that has been all for today 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.540
