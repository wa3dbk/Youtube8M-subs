00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.269
 or the people so that I complain that 18 and 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.090
 good is I bring a tutorial it's about 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.559
 many dolphin you will know the video that 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.690
 I did about a year ago if I did not 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.429
 it will be three months before a year and 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.189
 it is a wii emulator and of 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:24.199
 gamecube how good the video had many 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.750
 reproductions I'm going to leave the link in 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.490
 the description for you to see and good 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.140
 I'll bring it back because I want to 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.750
 answer some of the questions that 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.329
 you have done to me and some failures that no 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.370
 they fall into that good time as they already 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.780
 you know we should go to the link of 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.960
 download that I will leave in the description 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.670
 it is the official and good page 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.629
 Now we have to know if our 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.579
 windows is 32 or 64 bits what 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.649
 we have to do if you have windows 7 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.310
 notice that I have been asked page 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.200
 people who had a windows 8 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.610
 and good also point us to those who 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.530
 you have windows 8 that you can also 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.940
 teach from here for those who have 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.580
 windows 7 you must click on start 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.300
 Right click on equipment or properties 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.340
 and here I should leave for example in 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.540
 this case I have an operating system 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.270
 64 - bit so I come I 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.560
 I come here and downloads is the mother 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.840
 the 64 bit version 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.780
 for those who have windows 8 what 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.549
 we must do is go here to this 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.729
 icon that is about the icon of the 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.939
 explorer and what we should do here is 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.549
 Right click on the computer and you see it 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.960
 properties and we should leave once 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.289
 downloaded will be a file 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.270
 winrar that if you do not have the program what 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.829
 you can download from site bonuses 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.840
 official you look for it in google and then 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.479
 you have or if I do not leave the link in the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.750
 description and you will have a folder 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.909
 like this one after unzipping it like this 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.520
 that we just have to open it and good 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.280
 here we have the program now I come to 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.000
 tell 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.220
 a failure to the ruling that I wanted to tell you 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.390
 many people when it gives the executed 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.880
 they jump an error that what is missing 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.790
 a dll file then you can 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.580
 solve this problem by as 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.920
 I will explain to you now we have here another 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.540
 page that I will leave the description well 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.640
 that you click on this link if 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.520
 you have the problem and what we should 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.770
 make the signs here and give it to download 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.190
 file of agreement 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.750
 we download again with the windows this 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.600
 it does not come out because it's a trial version 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.530
 good and what we should do is if we 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.690
 goes to the rhythm section and for example 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.730
 if we have windows 7 that is my 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.070
 case we should go to this folder 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.430
 two point bar windows bar 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.340
 there are 32 and you will say where the nose is 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:06.500
 that then we 're going to team and 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:10.020
 normally it is usually him 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.790
 the hard disk let's say 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.580
 the default for the system 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.590
 operative if we give double click 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.290
 then we go to the windows folder 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.420
 what is this and then we look for here 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.590
 there are 32 I usually press the s 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.630
 here we have it there are 32 and there we paste 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.410
 we paste our file that is here 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.130
 we just have to drag and restart 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.510
 the computer after this step then 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.819
 we should be able to double click on it 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.340
 to the program and start it without any kind 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.400
 of problem 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.349
 ok today I'll leave you again 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.319
 the recommended settings that I 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.110
 I have certainly the performance has been 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.849
 increased I also say them as well as we 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.510
 taught to my configuration you if 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:04.000
 they spend passing the video seconds as 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.440
 you can see here we have the section of 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.680
 general 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.859
 in interface 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.510
 the audio the gamecube section good 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.849
 it's all we can change a language that 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.280
 I want to give to Spanish the 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.289
 week section I have in Spanish and 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.310
 in 16 9 that already depends on our 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.310
 screen if it is panoramic 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.349
 it is good that we can see that it is 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.620
 square of the old ones usually the 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:32.860
 modern are almost all panoramic 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.870
 If you have one that is not panoramic, 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.550
 you can give 43 and if not 16 9 and 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.919
 directories this is already for each one of me 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.349
 I have here where I have the 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.560
 game and now we go to the section on 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.560
 graphics 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:52.009
 here we can see the section of 

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:54.889
 general I have the direct engine of 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:57.199
 9 is the one I recommend most this depends 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:02.269
 of each pc that we already have an ati 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:03.739
 hd 5670 if you have another 

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:06.309
 graphic card should come out here 

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:06.309
 this does not 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.650
 well do not influence too much the truth 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.290
 although if I tell you that you have to have 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.680
 a fairly powerful computer 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.800
 pulling for more powerful as you say 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.860
 forgiveness brings me to that kind of 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.129
 in kabul ario this 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.060
 please have you asked me too 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:32.219
 many people by private message and it's 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.069
 because it's based this did not cry meter 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:37.560
 I have 1.5 because I have a 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:39.599
 pretty powerful graphics card let's 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.580
 but if you want to have the maximum 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.340
 performance I recommend you have it 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.020
 to 1 x 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.630
 and good if you want a higher quality 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.600
 you can give 11.5 to see how it goes 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.900
 but I usually recommend one a new 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.990
 point an X apologize then we have 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.260
 Hacks section that good is not hacks 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:03.730
 itself but it is a 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:06.320
 a type of commands or hacks as he says 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.500
 here that is for him 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.740
 the game flows with greater or greater 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.000
 quickly and good here we have more 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.030
 characteristics I already tell you and passing the 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.600
 video and here in advanced I only have this 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.860
 activated I do not see what 's most useful 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.750
 so well once we have all that 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.810
 configured we should give the 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.640
 star that puts search and here 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.090
 look for our folder where it is 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.700
 located the iso file I can not leave you 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.500
 no web page to download them 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.200
 points of the games so I can not 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.960
 influence piracy so good not 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.700
 It is very difficult but good we 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.390
 We give where we have installed our 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.220
 folder sorry our game iso you 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.910
 We click and we accept and we 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.440
 should appear here the game that is 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.910
 located in the iso or we can give double 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.889
 click to our game 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.229
 sorry for him 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:03.020
 on screen is done and good as 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:05.990
 we can see here our interface comes out 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:10.000
 from willy we can give 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.000
 in this case I have it since clicks 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:21.860
 I'm going to remove the audio so that axis 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.870
 because I know it's a bit a little high and 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.870
 well that would be all if you liked 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:29.530
 the law favorites and good we see ourselves a 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.530
 deaf
