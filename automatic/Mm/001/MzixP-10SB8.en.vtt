00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:13.750
 know of my video where unfortunately only 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.470
 One minute went though in the video 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:21.340

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.820
 four minutes where I'm five conscious 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.940
 open is any video error 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.519
 I'm sorry but that happens 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.920
 most important one has indeed seen 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.359
 that pulled the jersey card the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.679
 I 'll have a day too 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:43.570
 Sent later after the video and 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:46.449
 not even three days later came too 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.710
 already the answer or the card from 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.120
 topps deutschland gmbh in frankfurt 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.730
 Of course you are already so curious about 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.280
 I opened it but I just wanted you 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.010
 In this short video I show what I am 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.999
 because for a card had pulled and 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.650
 I came here now in one 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:08.940
 Good envelope of air is padded 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.950
 So nothing happens to the card 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:17.950
 ever be so far from his player 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.660
 leverkusen and there that is mine 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.890
 fico card I sent one 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:28.710
 namely his jersey card because she is around 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:38.370
 that can recognize has the number 26 of 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.370
 400 taken out of the shell out so now 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.280
 very nice and if not everything is wrong 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:55.460
 you see the white here either that is 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:02:00.440
 white from here or even from the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:04.220
 This is my jersey card 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.170
 I've got short video only 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.080
 to show you what I mean for you 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.280
 Deco card I'm glad it 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.020
 there are better there is worse jersey 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.209
 cards you could have got 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.970
 That's why I'm satisfied with it 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.750
 this jersey card and that's it 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.209
 again 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.860
 then have a nice day until 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.860
