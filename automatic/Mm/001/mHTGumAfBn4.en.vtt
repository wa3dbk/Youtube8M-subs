usually<00:03:27.700> who<00:03:28.120> comes<00:03:28.419> as<00:03:28.569> a<00:03:28.599> pole<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.109> we<00:03:29.200> do

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
usually who comes as a pole and we do

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.659 
usually who comes as a pole and we do
everything<00:03:29.349> together<00:03:29.769> but<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.489> was<00:03:30.639> a

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
everything together but this was a

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.680 
everything together but this was a
little<00:03:30.880> bit<00:03:30.970> different<00:03:31.269> it<00:03:31.329> was<00:03:31.419> a<00:03:31.480> mishmash

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
little bit different it was a mishmash

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.300 
little bit different it was a mishmash
of<00:03:32.019> people<00:03:32.319> coming<00:03:32.530> from<00:03:32.680> all<00:03:32.799> over<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:33.160> place

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
of people coming from all over the place

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.490 
of people coming from all over the place
so<00:03:33.940> we<00:03:34.090> decided<00:03:34.389> that<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.660> good<00:03:34.989> theme<00:03:35.260> for<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
so we decided that a good theme for the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.050 
so we decided that a good theme for the
trip<00:03:35.680> would<00:03:35.829> be<00:03:35.859> science<00:03:36.310> experiments<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:36.880> we

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
trip would be science experiments so we

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.059 
trip would be science experiments so we
literally<00:03:37.359> spent<00:03:37.540> five<00:03:37.900> days<00:03:37.930> just<00:03:38.530> try<00:03:38.799> new
