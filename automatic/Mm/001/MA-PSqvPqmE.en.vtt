00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.050 

what<00:02:31.570> I'm<00:02:31.660> gonna<00:02:31.780> do<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.530> back<00:02:33.460> on<00:02:33.790> this

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.910 

but<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.310> reason<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.730> need<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:43.940> back<00:02:44.239> home<00:02:44.480> is

but the reason you need to back home is

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.410 
but the reason you need to back home is
because<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.099> need<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.340> foundation<00:02:46.879> for<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
because you need a foundation for the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.110 
because you need a foundation for the
hair<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.840> curl<00:02:48.050> around<00:02:48.260> otherwise<00:02:49.250> it's<00:02:49.910> just

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
hair to curl around otherwise it's just

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.150 
hair to curl around otherwise it's just
going<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.540> be<00:02:50.660> too<00:02:50.870> soft<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.500> fall<00:02:51.830> out<00:02:52.010> of

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
going to be too soft and fall out of

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:02.710 
going to be too soft and fall out of
place

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720

for<00:03:15.530> this<00:03:15.620> thing<00:03:27.820> so<00:03:28.820> roll<00:03:29.360> this<00:03:30.760> into<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:32.000> loop

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:42.220 

kind<00:03:36.020> of<00:03:36.200> pull<00:03:36.470> this<00:03:36.680> section<00:03:37.130> with<00:03:37.310> you

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:59.750 

Oh

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.250 

you<00:04:00.360> just<00:04:00.569> pee<00:04:00.930> put<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.620> pin<00:04:01.860> straight<00:04:02.400> down

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
you just pee put the pin straight down

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.949 
you just pee put the pin straight down
and<00:04:04.260> that's<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.920> hasn't<00:04:05.430> held<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.909> so<00:04:06.840> what

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
and that's it hasn't held it so what

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.780 
and that's it hasn't held it so what
you're<00:04:07.079> gonna<00:04:07.140> do<00:04:07.379> is<00:04:07.560> cross<00:04:08.189> over<00:04:08.549> that<00:04:08.670> other

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
you're gonna do is cross over that other

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:20.659 
you're gonna do is cross over that other
pin<00:04:09.150> with<00:04:09.360> this<00:04:09.480> one<00:04:14.030> no<00:04:15.030> holds<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.629> place<00:04:19.639> so<00:04:20.639> I

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
pin with this one no holds in place so I

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.520 
pin with this one no holds in place so I
mean<00:04:21.000> is<00:04:22.039> case<00:04:23.039> you<00:04:23.190> don't<00:04:23.370> really<00:04:23.639> better<00:04:24.530> if

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
mean is case you don't really better if

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.850 
mean is case you don't really better if
you<00:04:25.680> just<00:04:25.710> put<00:04:26.039> a<00:04:26.070> pin<00:04:26.310> in<00:04:26.340> like<00:04:26.669> that

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
you just put a pin in like that

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.930 
you just put a pin in like that
sometimes<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:28.979> doesn't<00:04:29.130> hold<00:04:29.460> but<00:04:29.820> if<00:04:29.910> you

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
sometimes it doesn't hold but if you

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.240 
sometimes it doesn't hold but if you
cross<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.300> one<00:04:30.630> over<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:31.169> it<00:04:31.470> locks<00:04:31.919> it<00:04:32.130> into

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
cross a one over it it locks it into

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:44.689 
cross a one over it it locks it into
place<00:04:33.169> so<00:04:34.169> that's<00:04:34.320> something<00:04:34.470> you<00:04:34.560> do

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.760 

I<00:04:44.729> haven't<00:04:45.419> practiced<00:04:45.840> this<00:04:45.990> by<00:04:46.289> the<00:04:46.349> way<00:04:46.560> this

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
I haven't practiced this by the way this

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.010 
I haven't practiced this by the way this
is<00:04:46.919> just<00:04:47.069> me<00:04:47.280> doing<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.669> now<00:04:47.849> so<00:04:48.509> if<00:04:48.599> it<00:04:48.750> looks<00:04:48.900> a

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
is just me doing it now so if it looks a

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.059 
is just me doing it now so if it looks a
bit<00:04:49.050> rubbish

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
bit rubbish

00:04:50.069 --> 00:05:16.340 
bit rubbish
it's<00:04:50.849> cause<00:04:51.060> it's<00:04:51.210> my<00:04:51.360> first<00:04:51.599> attempt

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.320

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
it's already curled is take the first

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.490 
it's already curled is take the first
section<00:06:35.250> just<00:06:36.090> pull<00:06:36.300> up<00:06:36.330> smooth<00:06:36.840> it<00:06:37.020> out<00:06:37.139> so

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
section just pull up smooth it out so

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.890 
section just pull up smooth it out so
all<00:06:38.070> the<00:06:38.280> curls<00:06:38.520> that<00:06:38.699> you've<00:06:39.210> just<00:06:39.600> made

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
all the curls that you've just made

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.950 
all the curls that you've just made
they'll<00:06:40.740> go<00:06:40.889> into<00:06:41.010> one<00:06:41.220> big<00:06:41.490> one<00:06:41.699> get<00:06:42.419> that<00:06:42.660> and

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
they'll go into one big one get that and

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.070 
they'll go into one big one get that and
then<00:06:43.169> just<00:06:43.410> roll<00:06:43.680> it<00:06:43.889> in

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
then just roll it in

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.850 
then just roll it in
then<00:06:46.080> take<00:06:46.470> the<00:06:46.620> rod<00:06:46.860> section<00:06:48.440> pin<00:06:49.440> that<00:06:49.650> in

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
then take the rod section pin that in

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.670 
then take the rod section pin that in
enough<00:06:50.789> it<00:06:51.000> shouldn't<00:06:51.419> need<00:06:51.570> pinned<00:06:51.960> if<00:06:52.199> it

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
enough it shouldn't need pinned if it

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.560 
enough it shouldn't need pinned if it
has<00:06:52.860> very<00:06:53.220> thick<00:06:53.550> and<00:06:53.699> heavy<00:06:53.910> then<00:06:54.240> you<00:06:54.360> might

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
has very thick and heavy then you might

00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:02.960 
has very thick and heavy then you might
do<00:06:54.780> in<00:06:55.020> which<00:06:55.199> case<00:06:57.470> just<00:06:58.470> take<00:07:01.099> hello<00:07:02.099> okay

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
do in which case just take hello okay

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.409 
do in which case just take hello okay
and<00:07:03.949> you<00:07:04.949> don't<00:07:04.979> want<00:07:05.370> to<00:07:05.430> see<00:07:05.669> them<00:07:05.880> the<00:07:06.150> worst

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:06.419 
and you don't want to see them the worst

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:07.969 
and you don't want to see them the worst
thing<00:07:06.690> I<00:07:06.840> think<00:07:07.050> is<00:07:07.139> when<00:07:07.289> you<00:07:07.410> see<00:07:07.590> loads<00:07:07.770> of

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
thing I think is when you see loads of

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:15.310 
thing I think is when you see loads of
pins<00:07:08.250> and<00:07:08.490> hairstyles<00:07:09.210> so<00:07:09.389> if<00:07:10.050> you<00:07:10.199> get<00:07:10.410> it

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.320 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:22.040 

take<00:07:16.320> the<00:07:16.470> pin<00:07:16.650> like<00:07:16.830> this<00:07:18.260> get<00:07:19.260> it<00:07:20.090> and<00:07:21.090> fold

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
take the pin like this get it and fold

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.770 
take the pin like this get it and fold
it<00:07:22.289> in<00:07:22.410> on<00:07:22.530> itself<00:07:22.650> so<00:07:23.160> you<00:07:23.250> can<00:07:23.310> see<00:07:23.849> just<00:07:24.630> be

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
it in on itself so you can see just be

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.460 
it in on itself so you can see just be
tiny<00:07:25.229> ahead<00:07:25.740> of<00:07:25.860> it<00:07:25.979> I<00:07:27.169> don't<00:07:28.169> think<00:07:28.199> I've<00:07:28.440> got

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470 
tiny ahead of it I don't think I've got

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.510 
tiny ahead of it I don't think I've got
any<00:07:28.680> is<00:07:30.020> there's<00:07:31.020> big<00:07:31.380> pins<00:07:31.740> that<00:07:31.949> you<00:07:32.010> can<00:07:32.280> get

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 
any is there's big pins that you can get

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.879 
any is there's big pins that you can get
in<00:07:32.729> the<00:07:32.909> very<00:07:33.120> thin<00:07:33.449> but<00:07:33.750> but<00:07:34.440> just<00:07:34.650> like<00:07:34.860> that

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:34.889 
in the very thin but but just like that

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:38.719 
in the very thin but but just like that
and<00:07:35.599> there's<00:07:36.599> specially<00:07:37.560> made<00:07:37.770> to<00:07:38.159> hold<00:07:38.340> her

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:38.729 
and there's specially made to hold her

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:41.689 
and there's specially made to hold her
in<00:07:38.789> a<00:07:38.970> place<00:07:39.240> not<00:07:40.080> actually<00:07:40.530> kind<00:07:41.280> of<00:07:41.400> grip

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 
in a place not actually kind of grip

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:44.930 
in a place not actually kind of grip
them<00:07:41.970> or<00:07:42.449> just<00:07:42.690> to<00:07:42.930> to<00:07:43.650> lightly<00:07:43.889> pin<00:07:44.520> it<00:07:44.669> so<00:07:44.880> you

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 
them or just to to lightly pin it so you

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.450 
them or just to to lightly pin it so you
can't<00:07:45.270> really<00:07:45.510> see<00:07:45.810> any<00:07:46.020> of<00:07:46.199> the<00:07:46.380> grips<00:07:46.620> so

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 
can't really see any of the grips so

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.960 
can't really see any of the grips so
they're<00:07:47.639> better<00:07:48.030> ones<00:07:48.300> to<00:07:48.570> be<00:07:48.690> honest<00:07:49.020> but

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:49.970 
they're better ones to be honest but

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.770
