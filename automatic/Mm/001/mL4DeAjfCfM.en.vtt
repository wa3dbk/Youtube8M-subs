actually the first raid we ever

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.979 
actually the first raid we ever
participated<00:03:50.100> in<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:51.000> that's<00:03:51.239> pretty<00:03:51.420> cool<00:03:51.480> we

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
participated in so that's pretty cool we

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.830 
participated in so that's pretty cool we
did<00:03:52.350> nothing<00:03:52.800> yeah<00:03:53.280> because<00:03:53.489> really<00:03:53.840> nubium

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
did nothing yeah because really nubium

it<00:03:59.489> now<00:03:59.780> unfortunately<00:04:00.780> it's<00:04:00.900> not<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.140> plus

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.840 
it now unfortunately it's not the plus
version<00:04:01.410> but<00:04:01.890> I'm<00:04:02.010> happy<00:04:02.250> with<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.550> normal

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
version but I'm happy with the normal

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.729 
version but I'm happy with the normal
the<00:04:03.600> plus<00:04:03.780> version<00:04:03.810> would<00:04:04.200> have<00:04:04.320> cost<00:04:04.470> us

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
the plus version would have cost us

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.380 
the plus version would have cost us
quite<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:05.010> few<00:04:05.190> gems<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.820> I<00:04:05.880> heard<00:04:06.120> there<00:04:06.299> were

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
quite a few gems and I heard there were

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.210 
quite a few gems and I heard there were
a<00:04:06.420> lot<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:06.630> guilds<00:04:06.989> going<00:04:07.200> for<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:08.040> there's

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
a lot of guilds going for it and there's

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.979 
a lot of guilds going for it and there's
honestly<00:04:08.370> no<00:04:08.850> point<00:04:09.120> going<00:04:09.360> for<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.750> oh<00:04:09.840> yeah

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
honestly no point going for it oh yeah

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.470 
honestly no point going for it oh yeah
because<00:04:10.200> there's<00:04:10.530> uh<00:04:10.860> more<00:04:11.519> epics<00:04:11.880> available

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
because there's uh more epics available

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.819 
because there's uh more epics available
first<00:04:12.720> yeah<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.140> was<00:04:13.260> pretty<00:04:13.380> cool<00:04:13.650> though

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
first yeah it was pretty cool though

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.410 
first yeah it was pretty cool though
because<00:04:14.310> they've<00:04:14.610> actually<00:04:14.820> upgraded<00:04:15.269> the

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
because they've actually upgraded the

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.650 
because they've actually upgraded the
rewards<00:04:16.640> there's<00:04:17.640> like<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:18.060> can<00:04:18.180> get<00:04:18.329> epics

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
rewards there's like you can get epics

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
from top 750 so I presume that gold

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.200 
from top 750 so I presume that gold
cactus<00:04:21.540> got<00:04:21.720> an<00:04:21.870> epic<00:04:22.140> as<00:04:22.290> well<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:23.090> as<00:04:24.090> you
