00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 good morning of certain yes to the hair 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.780
 wet I learned the art of 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 who cares 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.200
 today I would like to talk to you about a 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.150
 topic that interests me a lot e 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.429
 hence the main reason why 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.559
 I make this video where I really don't 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.309
 I will say practically nothing is to know the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.410
 your opinions 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.000
 I don't know if the title v gave one 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.800
 some ideas but today I would like to talk about 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.270
 books that speak for themselves then 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.550
 paradoxically I shouldn't even 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.000
 talk and we immediately begin the discomfort 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.619
 I know for sure that each of us 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.420
 at least once in a lifetime has 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.890
 met one of those books that speak 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.140
 alone or those books that you like 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.030
 they strike and in a sense yes 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.879
 they always carry around but when 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.309
 someone asks us to talk about it we do 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 stay that way 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.840
 in short, I'm talking about that kind of 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.420
 books that are beautiful but you can't tell 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.430
 Nothing else doors read that kind of 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.440
 books on which there is also maybe so much to 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.480
 say you can't say anything because 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.190
 he important thing to succeed in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.469
 understand everything you want to say about 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.879
 that book is to read it and therefore against 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.470
 another person who said the same 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.540
 book no need to say anything 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.869
 because it is established with the species of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.250
 mental connection that causes you and 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.430
 that person 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.350
 be equally connected and understand yourself 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.150
 even without talking about that book because 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.460
 of that book one cannot speak the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.890
 unease continues now I do not know today 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.470
 talk but I hope to be able to explain myself 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.750
 these books are special are special 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.150
 because there is no review to make it 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.460
 justice are special because you don't 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.200
 can talk about them in their entirety e 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.119
 something will always remain outside because it is there 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.979
 so much to say at the same time not 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.750
 no suitable word comes out for 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.340
 describe it because all the words 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.299
 they seem out of place you understand of 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.979
 what am i talking about 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.509
 if you haven't understood, I'll bring you some 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.399
 examples and we hope you understand 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.229
 so I have dozens of books of the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.670
 genre in the library but I didn't know 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.409
 exactly which to choose then to 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.210
 I ended up taking the ones that came to me 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.659
 in mind first and just the first one that 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.070
 the farm came to mind 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.159
 seas of orwell because it is self- contained 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.749
 that is, it explains itself and at the end 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.979
 no one knows when the book is closed 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.780
 what to say because he has already said everything 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.219
 he among other things lohan that already said in 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.390
 another video seems to me no need 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:12.069
 to know the historical period in which it is 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.349
 set and the various allusions for 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.180
 being able to understand this second book 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.680
 me it is not necessary to motions 20 for not 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.989
 have nothing tactical because it is not there 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.670
 need to contextualize it because 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.230
 so you can understand when I am 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.819
 they ask to talk about this book not 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.129
 I never know what to say and I'd like 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.260
 a lot to succeed to recover to 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.910
 editing I had done in the second one 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.829
 superior perhaps because I had it there 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.239
 spoken and I had tried too hard but 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.920
 I absolutely don't remember what 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.120
 I had said the second that came to me 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.250
 in mind to be a winter night a 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.629
 calvino traveler who is a read 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.489
 quite recently I bought it 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.140
 finally last year after years that 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.209
 I was looking for him and I realize that he is 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.180
 literally absurd to have nothing 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.980
 to say but I have nothing to say 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.660
 read it if any of that bed 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.560
 can understand why I can't say 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.060
 nothing in this book 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.769
 the third that came to mind at 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.440
 Diogenes suicidal virgins and I hope 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.180
 ardently that you never arrive in one 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.799
 chosen by you because if you get it e 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.200
 win and I had to do it 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.880
 review I would remain silent for the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.980
 eight minutes into the review this is 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.130
 truly one of the books they speak from 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.130
 alone with the highest voice one understands is 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.709
 extremely disturbing as well as 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.630
 bizarre and honestly I tried 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.130
 seriously reviewing the first one 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.720
 Once I read it I tried to do 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.769
 the review on names but failed 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.299
 the words and then read it but then a 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.549
 book that is in your choice of 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.459
 this month and I ardently hope that 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:36.160
 don't win because I love him but I can't 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:40.120
 to do the review and honestly I have 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.980
 fear because he's kind of making a head 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.049
 each with a different book e 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.030
 so he's there to win and I'm there 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.620
 praying in Japanese for you to choose 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.959
 another book I'm talking about trilogy 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.379
 of the city of k of agota kristof in 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.060
 reality the disturbing kristof in all 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.970
 six books that is not just that 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.830
 speaks for itself 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.050
 all his books speak for themselves and me 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.800
 I find it brilliant an author is kind 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.130
 of amélie nothomb however much more 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.600
 disturbed 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.430
 in any case this is one of the most popular books 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.230
 beautiful I 've ever said so if not 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.700
 you still read it move another 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.500
 of my favorite books not mentioned 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.200
 I can talk because I'm convinced 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.410
 that just read it because it speaks for itself 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.920
 again the title is redundant speaks of 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.480
 daniel pennac's novel color and I don't know 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.970
 I wouldn't know what to say, I find it 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.470
 absolutely brilliant and I think every 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.510
 reader should read at least one 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.210
 time in life if only for i 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.740
 imprescriptible rights of the reader who 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.230
 they are more or less the bible 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.030
 finally the very first novel that is me 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.330
 came to mind but I left for 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.740
 last and you will understand why it is so much ndò 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.180
 ndò ndò going so yes veronika 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.230
 Decides to Die I promised you that 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.150
 sooner or later I'll do the review 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.040
 even when you propose 100 from 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.570
 you refuse veronika decides to die 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.480
 because sooner or later I will make it 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.220
 review but it's a review that i get 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.080
 I have to study ie I have to prepare in 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.580
 advance the things I have to say because 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.169
 otherwise it's a mess 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.720
 and in short I showed you all these 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.550
 books to be able to see if you understand me 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.530
 that is if you also think that these 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.450
 books speak for themselves that they do not have 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.340
 need reviews you don't have 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.890
 need words you need 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.080
 be explained why they do it already from 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.610
 alone and if they do not do it alone is in the 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.620
 their nature and that's okay 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.450
 now I would like to know you also have gods 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.760
 books that you think speak for themselves or 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.890
 it's just me normal and in the case of them 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.630
 you could tell me what it is today 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.570
 It was an extremely uncomfortable video from 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.700
 I'm around two more so it will be uncomfortable 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.740
 I am still very sorry but before 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.300
 all I had no ideas for 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.500
 this week and secondly 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.720
 when I read 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.550
 what was my recent reading how 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.950
 a novel I recently re-read as 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.960
 a novel and therefore I had thought of 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.610
 talk about it but then I thought that not 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.200
 I had nothing to say and from here and do 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.790
 the whole subject of all the real video 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.490
 you liked this video too 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:01.310
 if he is a little uncomfortable and I'll see you 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.310
 Wednesday I think hello micetti
