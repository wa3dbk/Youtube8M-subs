00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Good morning, we start today with the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.180
 images of a video that shows 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.470
 good part of what happened in the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.840
 Philadelphia International Airport 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.700
 when the Mexican team was ready 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.009
 to return to the city of mexico 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.719
 what we see on the screen are the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.270
 images taken with a cell phone 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.060
 Cristian Magnoli see there being 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.460
 pushed by the one they describe in the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.710
 Video as the daughter of Miguel Herrera 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.599
 coach of the Mexican national team we see 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.609
 members of the coaching staff and to own 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.230
 miguel herrera changing next to luís 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.410
 Garcia another sportscaster from the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.780
 Azteca TV chain where it was headed 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.320
 apparently he was pushing his daughter to this 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.030
 sports commentator who then denounces 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.610
 have been assaulted by the director 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.320
 coach of the Mexican national team in a 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.579
 video also that we're going to see 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.140
 then this is the time in the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.829
 that the daughter of Miguel Herrera claims 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.320
 luís garcía and then cheek to what we saw 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.370
 there clearly and then comes Miguel 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.370
 herrera with luís garcía 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.879
 they have an exchange of words miguel 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.070
 Herrera asks her daughter to keep 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.360
 silence and apparently arranges part of 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.520
 the equation we will see some players 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.530
 members of the coaching staff trying to 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.270
 intervene there have an exchange 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.790
 words I'm trying to narrate because 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.410
 Sound 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.000
 and the video is not enough 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.290
 good to hear exactly 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.510
 when they say they're working 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.890
 in it we received it some 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.500
 instants but that's why I try to 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.880
 narrate what happened there we see already 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.590
 later to luis garcía walking with 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.520
 Miguel Herrera embraced 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.240
 that is the entrance to the airport 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.170
 philadelphia international and this video 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.390
 this video is the one that shows what 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.370
 occurs in the security line prior to 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.010
 the entrance to the waiting rooms for 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.750
 the flights there are appreciated to Miguel 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.280
 Herrera we see Carlos sailing in 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.860
 the video in the row and on the other side of 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.720
 the row to christian martinoli the 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.790
 sportscaster of the tv channel 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.900
 Aztec who claims to have been attacked 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.330
 several witnesses confirm this version 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.560
 Miguel's love was then we see how Miguel 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.560
 herrera jump safety lines 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.990
 can not 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.420
 maintain and keep your hands high 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.420
