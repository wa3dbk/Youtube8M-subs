itou-san 30 and if we add the BB preamp
you<00:00:37.250> notice<00:00:37.610> there<00:00:38.030> isn't<00:00:38.210> really<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.690> change

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
you notice there isn't really a change

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.729 
you notice there isn't really a change
in<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.680> tone<00:00:40.340> as<00:00:40.550> such<00:00:40.820> or<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:41.570> volume<00:00:41.960> but<00:00:42.559> if

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
in the tone as such or the volume but if

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.619 
in the tone as such or the volume but if
you<00:00:43.070> listen<00:00:43.249> to<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.550> difference<00:00:43.969> and<00:00:44.179> the

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
you listen to the difference and the

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:56.890 
you listen to the difference and the
quality<00:00:45.289> of<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.469> distortion

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:06.700 

notice<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.950> basis<00:00:58.340> do<00:00:58.490> that<00:00:58.670> -<00:01:05.290> so<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:06.350> get<00:01:06.650> a

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
notice the basis do that - so you get a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.160 
notice the basis do that - so you get a
really<00:01:06.920> good<00:01:07.040> quality<00:01:07.520> sound<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.180> you're<00:01:09.020> not

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
really good quality sound and you're not

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.240 
really good quality sound and you're not

losing anything
you're<00:01:10.430> not<00:01:10.520> losing<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.910> characteristics<00:01:11.630> of

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
down the game a little bit she's really

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.719 
down the game a little bit she's really
good<00:01:38.750> if<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.410> into<00:01:39.649> the<00:01:39.740> bluesy<00:01:40.190> of<00:01:40.220> stuff<00:01:40.610> so

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.699 

if<00:02:08.060> we<00:02:08.300> back<00:02:08.509> down<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:09.019> bass<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.229> little<00:02:09.470> bit

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
if we back down the bass a little bit

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.900 
if we back down the bass a little bit
more<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.220> tread<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:12.620> then<00:02:13.040> increase<00:02:13.610> the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
more and the tread and then increase the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.930 
more and the tread and then increase the
game<00:02:14.090> it's<00:02:15.080> quite<00:02:15.290> sensitive<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:16.550> get<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> lot

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
game it's quite sensitive you get a lot

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.540 
game it's quite sensitive you get a lot
of<00:02:17.060> power<00:02:17.360> from<00:02:17.769> Distortion

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.880 

because<00:02:25.030> it's<00:02:25.420> not<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.630> high-gain<00:02:26.020> pedo<00:02:26.650> it's

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
because it's not a high-gain pedo it's

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.380 
because it's not a high-gain pedo it's
really<00:02:27.250> based<00:02:27.490> for<00:02:27.850> giving<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.180> nice

really based for giving you a nice
warmth<00:02:28.900> home<00:02:29.200> but<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.920> does<00:02:30.070> have<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.520> power

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
warmth home but it does have the power

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.690 
warmth home but it does have the power
there<00:02:31.000> should<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:31.330> need<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:36.190> course<00:02:36.460> it's

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
there should you need it of course it's

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.550 
there should you need it of course it's
not<00:02:36.820> for<00:02:37.060> metal<00:02:37.390> guitar<00:02:37.690> players<00:02:37.960> but<00:02:38.380> for

not for metal guitar players but for

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.050 
not for metal guitar players but for
classic<00:02:39.250> rock<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:39.490> anything<00:02:39.940> in<00:02:40.030> between

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
classic rock and anything in between

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.080 
classic rock and anything in between
it's<00:02:40.900> ideal<00:02:41.350> now<00:02:41.860> if<00:02:42.040> we<00:02:42.190> back<00:02:42.430> down<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.910> gain

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
it's ideal now if we back down the gain

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.980 
it's ideal now if we back down the gain
a<00:02:43.120> little<00:02:43.300> bit<00:02:43.620> I'm<00:02:44.620> gonna<00:02:44.860> increase<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.220> bass

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
a little bit I'm gonna increase the bass

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.570 
a little bit I'm gonna increase the bass
got<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.110> be<00:02:47.170> careful<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.710> bass<00:02:47.890> really<00:02:48.220> does

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
got to be careful the bass really does

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.850 
got to be careful the bass really does
it<00:02:49.150> gives<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.480> it's<00:02:49.810> very<00:02:50.080> responsive<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.680> mean

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
it gives you it's very responsive I mean

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.610 
it gives you it's very responsive I mean
here<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:51.130> can<00:02:51.310> hear<00:02:51.930> quite<00:02:52.930> different<00:02:53.470> so

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
here you can hear quite different so

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.570 
here you can hear quite different so
you're<00:02:53.740> never<00:02:53.890> gonna<00:02:54.070> need<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.400> on<00:02:54.520> the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
you're never gonna need that on the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.970 
you're never gonna need that on the
phone<00:02:54.820> and<00:02:55.030> put<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.990> treble<00:02:56.380> about<00:02:56.560> half<00:02:56.770> way

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
phone and put the treble about half way

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.780 
phone and put the treble about half way
now

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
now

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.950 
now
listen<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.240> difference<00:02:58.660> when<00:02:58.870> you

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
listen to the difference when you

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.720 
listen to the difference when you
increase<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.440> volume<00:02:59.800> this<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:00.640> volume

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
increase the volume this is the volume

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.620 
increase the volume this is the volume
and<00:03:01.270> it's<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.350> same<00:03:02.560> power<00:03:03.150> it's<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.210> clean<00:03:04.480> on

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
and it's the same power it's a clean on

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.020 
and it's the same power it's a clean on
the<00:03:04.750> amp<00:03:05.970> now<00:03:06.970> we're<00:03:07.090> going<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.240> increase<00:03:07.630> that

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
the amp now we're going to increase that

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.430 
the amp now we're going to increase that
that's<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.180> pedal<00:03:10.510> alone<00:03:10.750> not<00:03:10.990> touching<00:03:11.350> the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
that's the pedal alone not touching the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:28.949 
that's the pedal alone not touching the
air<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:12.970> can<00:03:13.150> be<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.390> really<00:03:13.690> good<00:03:13.930> boost
