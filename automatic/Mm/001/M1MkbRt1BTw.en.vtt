00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.729

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.839
 different languages 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:20.839
 a football that practices 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.679
 file can be said 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.100
 how comfortable it was time for knobs to open it 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.100
 what I did to carriÃ³ also 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.550
 what has to come back that 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.390
 box 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.480
 It has some magnets 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.760
 from both sides 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
 for anything else 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 it also comes 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.970
 a lot of account 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.990
 the two was just a good 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.990
 but we have the possibility of 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
 or from the other side 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.670
 detroit max on this side 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.800
 inside the tent 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.190

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.190
 bracelets 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.970
 rossi is cheaper 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.039
 but button 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.889
 both are original 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.629
 the difference that 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.209
 one comes with the climax 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.209
 well in the last 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.819
 the other come 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.989
 the scrubland between max below 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.989
 then yes we are crazy 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.599
 according to the box in it 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.909
 what we have differences 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.229

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.209
 open box 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.209
 that does not mean that it is not the same 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.819
 under tents are alike 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.699
