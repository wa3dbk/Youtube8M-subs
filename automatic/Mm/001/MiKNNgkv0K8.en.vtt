00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.510 

all<00:04:48.880> right<00:04:49.120> basically<00:04:49.920> what<00:04:50.920> I've<00:04:51.070> noticed

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
all right basically what I've noticed

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.210 
all right basically what I've noticed
that<00:04:51.940> makes<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.390> car<00:04:52.570> stall<00:04:52.930> is<00:04:53.200> if<00:04:53.860> when<00:04:54.130> you

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
that makes the car stall is if when you

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.980 
that makes the car stall is if when you
come<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:54.520> a<00:04:54.550> stop<00:04:54.790> and<00:04:55.030> you're<00:04:55.150> in<00:04:55.300> neutral<00:04:55.570> and

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
come to a stop and you're in neutral and

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.660 
come to a stop and you're in neutral and
you<00:04:56.110> flick<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.650> paddle<00:04:57.070> sometimes<00:04:57.550> it

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
you flick the paddle sometimes it

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.580 
you flick the paddle sometimes it
doesn't<00:04:57.970> go<00:04:58.060> into<00:04:58.300> first<00:04:58.600> gear<00:04:58.840> right<00:04:59.290> away

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
doesn't go into first gear right away

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.010 
doesn't go into first gear right away
and<00:04:59.830> if<00:05:00.100> you're<00:05:00.250> too<00:05:00.460> quick<00:05:00.760> on<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.150> gas<00:05:01.360> it

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
and if you're too quick on the gas it

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.980 
and if you're too quick on the gas it
can<00:05:02.080> stall<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.340> car<00:05:03.640> from<00:05:04.120> a<00:05:04.210> standstill<00:05:04.600> it's

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
can stall the car from a standstill it's

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.750 
can stall the car from a standstill it's
important<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.560> really<00:05:05.800> give<00:05:05.980> it<00:05:06.100> some<00:05:06.130> gas<00:05:06.430> off

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
important to really give it some gas off

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.130 
important to really give it some gas off
the<00:05:07.180> line<00:05:07.390> in<00:05:07.870> order<00:05:08.200> to<00:05:08.410> take<00:05:09.340> away<00:05:09.520> smoothly

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
the line in order to take away smoothly

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.600 
the line in order to take away smoothly
if<00:05:11.140> you<00:05:11.200> don't<00:05:11.560> give<00:05:11.740> it<00:05:11.830> enough<00:05:12.100> gas<00:05:12.310> you'll

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
if you don't give it enough gas you'll

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.790 
if you don't give it enough gas you'll
bog<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:13.060> engine<00:05:13.390> down<00:05:13.570> of<00:05:14.080> course<00:05:14.140> too<00:05:14.650> much

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
bog the engine down of course too much

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.560 
bog the engine down of course too much
gas<00:05:15.040> and<00:05:15.340> you'll<00:05:15.460> spend<00:05:15.670> all<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.180> wheels<00:05:16.390> but
