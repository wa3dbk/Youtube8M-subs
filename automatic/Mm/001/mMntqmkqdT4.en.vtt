so<00:00:37.530> much<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:39.420> may<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.960> other<00:00:40.140> side

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so much it may be on the other side

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.810 
so much it may be on the other side

there's another room just like this on
the<00:00:41.940> other<00:00:41.969> side

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.610 

anyway<00:00:50.040> so<00:00:50.880> back<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.120> branding<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
anyway so back to branding is it the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.680 
anyway so back to branding is it the
spending<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.460> generates<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.000> brand

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
spending that generates that brand

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.840 
spending that generates that brand
preference<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> brand<00:00:56.340> preference

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
preference or is the brand preference

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.250 
preference or is the brand preference
there<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.360> therefore<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.020> more<00:00:58.140> money

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
there and therefore they have more money

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.490 
there and therefore they have more money
to<00:00:58.379> spend<00:00:58.470> because<00:00:58.860> a<00:00:59.040> lot<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.220> customers<00:01:03.470> no<00:01:04.470> I
