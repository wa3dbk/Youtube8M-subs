chlorine generator we get a lot of
customer<00:00:11.809> questions<00:00:12.049> as<00:00:12.440> asking<00:00:12.799> this<00:00:12.950> this

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
customer questions as asking this this

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.820 
customer questions as asking this this
exact<00:00:13.940> question<00:00:14.090> so<00:00:14.870> many<00:00:15.259> people<00:00:15.589> may<00:00:15.710> have

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
exact question so many people may have

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.499 
exact question so many people may have
heard<00:00:16.040> of<00:00:16.130> a<00:00:16.219> saltwater<00:00:16.490> pool<00:00:16.730> but<00:00:17.450> they

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:17.509 
heard of a saltwater pool but they

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.150 
heard of a saltwater pool but they
really<00:00:17.720> don't<00:00:17.779> know<00:00:17.930> what<00:00:18.140> it<00:00:18.259> is<00:00:18.290> so<00:00:18.980> it's<00:00:19.099> a

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
really don't know what it is so it's a

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.040 
really don't know what it is so it's a
really<00:00:19.400> cool<00:00:19.640> piece<00:00:20.270> of<00:00:20.330> equipment<00:00:20.900> that's

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
really cool piece of equipment that's

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.050 
really cool piece of equipment that's
really<00:00:21.410> gained<00:00:21.590> popular<00:00:22.130> popularity<00:00:22.970> in<00:00:23.029> the

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
really gained popular popularity in the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.330 
really gained popular popularity in the
last<00:00:23.210> five<00:00:23.689> or<00:00:23.720> ten<00:00:24.050> years<00:00:24.079> and<00:00:24.590> basically

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
last five or ten years and basically

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.220 
last five or ten years and basically
what<00:00:25.700> assault<00:00:26.029> system<00:00:26.480> consists<00:00:26.899> of<00:00:27.050> it's

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
what assault system consists of it's

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.870 
what assault system consists of it's
going<00:00:27.380> to<00:00:27.439> consist<00:00:27.739> of<00:00:27.829> a<00:00:27.919> power<00:00:28.099> supply<00:00:28.399> a

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
going to consist of a power supply a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.870 
going to consist of a power supply a
salt<00:00:29.809> cell<00:00:30.140> our<00:00:30.919> example<00:00:31.369> today<00:00:31.460> is<00:00:31.730> the

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
salt cell our example today is the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.400 
salt cell our example today is the
Hayward<00:00:32.239> aqua<00:00:32.660> right<00:00:32.840> one<00:00:33.110> of<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.260> most

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
Hayward aqua right one of the most

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.740 
Hayward aqua right one of the most
popular<00:00:33.860> systems<00:00:34.370> on<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:35.180> market<00:00:35.570> and

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
popular systems on the market and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.169 
popular systems on the market and
basically<00:00:36.500> how<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.739> system<00:00:37.190> works<00:00:37.429> is<00:00:37.670> that

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:38.179 
basically how the system works is that

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.180 
basically how the system works is that
you<00:00:38.239> would<00:00:38.420> plumb<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.870> salt<00:00:39.140> cell<00:00:39.440> into<00:00:40.070> your

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
you would plumb the salt cell into your

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.759 
you would plumb the salt cell into your
plumbing<00:00:40.579> there's<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.320> cable<00:00:42.320> right<00:00:42.710> here

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
plumbing there's a cable right here

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.410 
plumbing there's a cable right here
that's<00:00:43.160> going<00:00:43.309> to<00:00:43.370> go<00:00:43.460> back<00:00:43.670> into<00:00:43.940> this<00:00:44.179> power

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
that's going to go back into this power

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.150 
that's going to go back into this power
supply<00:00:44.690> there's<00:00:45.109> a<00:00:45.170> port<00:00:45.530> on<00:00:45.679> the<00:00:45.980> power

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
supply there's a port on the power

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.340 
supply there's a port on the power
supply<00:00:46.429> which<00:00:47.269> accepts<00:00:47.690> that<00:00:47.809> cable<00:00:48.230> and

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
supply which accepts that cable and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.840 
supply which accepts that cable and
essentially<00:00:49.280> what<00:00:49.370> you're<00:00:49.429> going<00:00:49.609> to<00:00:49.670> do<00:00:49.730> is

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
essentially what you're going to do is

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.889 
essentially what you're going to do is
you're<00:00:49.940> going<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.089> add<00:00:50.210> salt<00:00:50.539> to<00:00:50.690> your

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
you're going to add salt to your

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.840 
you're going to add salt to your
swimming<00:00:51.140> pool<00:00:51.320> this<00:00:52.190> is<00:00:52.309> going<00:00:52.429> to<00:00:52.489> be<00:00:52.579> below

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
swimming pool this is going to be below

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.939 
swimming pool this is going to be below
the<00:00:53.329> taste<00:00:53.780> threshold<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:54.620> you<00:00:54.679> don't

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
the taste threshold so you don't

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.059 
the taste threshold so you don't
typically<00:00:55.249> taste<00:00:55.609> salt<00:00:56.390> in<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.719> pool<00:00:56.929> and<00:00:57.679> as

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:58.069 
typically taste salt in the pool and as

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:59.919 
typically taste salt in the pool and as
that<00:00:58.190> diluted<00:00:58.640> salt<00:00:58.879> water<00:00:59.089> passes<00:00:59.600> through

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
that diluted salt water passes through

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.290 
that diluted salt water passes through
your<00:01:00.199> salt<00:01:01.010> cell<00:01:01.339> there's<00:01:01.760> an<00:01:01.879> electrical

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
your salt cell there's an electrical

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.479 
your salt cell there's an electrical
reaction<00:01:02.809> here<00:01:03.050> there<00:01:03.170> are<00:01:03.229> some<00:01:03.350> blades<00:01:03.620> and

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
reaction here there are some blades and

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.130 
reaction here there are some blades and
that<00:01:04.699> electrical<00:01:05.330> reaction<00:01:05.810> actually

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
that electrical reaction actually

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.230 
that electrical reaction actually
creates<00:01:06.530> chlorine<00:01:07.100> which<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:07.760> sent<00:01:08.000> back<00:01:08.210> to

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
creates chlorine which is sent back to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.760 
creates chlorine which is sent back to
your<00:01:08.540> swimming<00:01:08.780> pool<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.560> you're<00:01:09.650> actually

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
your swimming pool so you're actually

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.560 
your swimming pool so you're actually
making<00:01:10.280> all<00:01:10.550> of<00:01:10.580> your<00:01:10.790> own<00:01:10.970> chlorine<00:01:11.450> you

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
making all of your own chlorine you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.780 
making all of your own chlorine you
don't<00:01:11.720> need<00:01:11.870> to<00:01:11.990> worry<00:01:12.170> about<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.740> know

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
don't need to worry about you know

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.490 
don't need to worry about you know
purchasing<00:01:13.790> liquid<00:01:14.180> chlorine<00:01:14.480> or<00:01:14.840> shock<00:01:15.140> or

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
purchasing liquid chlorine or shock or

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.290 
purchasing liquid chlorine or shock or
tablets<00:01:15.950> basically<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.700> system<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:17.090> going<00:01:17.210> to

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
tablets basically the system is going to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.390 
tablets basically the system is going to
be<00:01:17.360> doing<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:17.630> all<00:01:17.750> for<00:01:18.080> you<00:01:18.230> the<00:01:19.010> other<00:01:19.130> really

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
be doing it all for you the other really

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.160 
be doing it all for you the other really
nice<00:01:19.550> thing<00:01:19.880> about<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:20.420> salt<00:01:20.840> chlorine

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
nice thing about the salt chlorine

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.260 
nice thing about the salt chlorine
generator<00:01:21.560> it's<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.220> much<00:01:22.400> better<00:01:22.610> quality<00:01:22.970> of

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
generator it's a much better quality of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.810 
generator it's a much better quality of
chlorine<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.230> it's<00:01:24.470> going<00:01:24.650> to<00:01:24.710> have<00:01:24.860> your

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
chlorine so it's going to have your

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.700 
chlorine so it's going to have your
really<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.180> negative<00:01:26.600> effects<00:01:27.320> of<00:01:27.500> chlorine

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
really the negative effects of chlorine

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.680 
really the negative effects of chlorine
are<00:01:28.040> typically<00:01:28.610> tied<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.150> chloramines

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
are typically tied to the chloramines

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.350 
are typically tied to the chloramines
and<00:01:29.960> this<00:01:30.740> particular<00:01:31.040> setup<00:01:31.520> doesn't

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
and this particular setup doesn't

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.660 
and this particular setup doesn't
produce<00:01:32.660> chlorine<00:01:33.080> so<00:01:33.620> that<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.220> red<00:01:34.430> eyes

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
produce chlorine so that the red eyes

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.910 
produce chlorine so that the red eyes
the<00:01:35.030> itchy<00:01:35.150> skin<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.840> chlorine<00:01:36.200> smell<00:01:36.350> is

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
the itchy skin the chlorine smell is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.020 
the itchy skin the chlorine smell is
really<00:01:37.190> going<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.370> be<00:01:37.430> eliminated<00:01:37.910> with<00:01:38.000> a

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
really going to be eliminated with a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.320 
really going to be eliminated with a
salt<00:01:38.330> chlorine<00:01:38.600> generator<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.100> they<00:01:40.820> do<00:01:41.000> the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
salt chlorine generator so they do the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.630 
salt chlorine generator so they do the
control<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.410> chlorine<00:01:42.890> has<00:01:43.160> done<00:01:43.370> through

control of the chlorine has done through

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.390 
control of the chlorine has done through
your<00:01:43.790> power<00:01:43.970> supply<00:01:44.480> so<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.050> can<00:01:45.230> you<00:01:45.650> set<00:01:46.280> it

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
your power supply so you can you set it

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.430 
your power supply so you can you set it
to<00:01:46.610> a<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:47.270> know<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.390> high<00:01:47.780> production<00:01:48.350> of

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
to a you know a high production of

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.290 
to a you know a high production of
chlorine<00:01:48.890> or<00:01:49.070> lower<00:01:49.280> production<00:01:49.670> chlorine

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
chlorine or lower production chlorine

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.210 
chlorine or lower production chlorine
and<00:01:50.990> then<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.590> know<00:01:51.680> it's<00:01:51.860> just<00:01:52.010> going<00:01:52.130> to

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
and then you know it's just going to

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.550 
and then you know it's just going to
maintain<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.700> chlorine<00:01:53.180> level<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:53.870> you

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
maintain that chlorine level so you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.320 
maintain that chlorine level so you
don't<00:01:54.710> get<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:54.980> highs<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.190> lows<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.730> the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
don't get the highs and lows of the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.470 
don't get the highs and lows of the
chlorine<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.320> this<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:58.100> really<00:01:58.130> just<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.550> good

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
chlorine so I this is really just a good

chlorine so I this is really just a good
overview<00:01:59.870> of<00:02:00.080> what<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.500> salt<00:02:00.680> system<00:02:01.100> is<00:02:01.310> I

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
overview of what the salt system is I
