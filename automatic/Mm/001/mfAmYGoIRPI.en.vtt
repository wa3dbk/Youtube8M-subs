I<00:05:07.460> mean<00:05:07.610> I<00:05:07.819> think<00:05:08.060> we're<00:05:08.210> between<00:05:08.479> a<00:05:08.599> rock<00:05:08.719> and

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
I mean I think we're between a rock and

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.390 
I mean I think we're between a rock and
a<00:05:09.080> hard<00:05:09.110> place<00:05:09.289> we<00:05:09.650> can't<00:05:09.860> give<00:05:10.039> the<00:05:10.219> country

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
a hard place we can't give the country

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.149 
a hard place we can't give the country

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
to the jihadist and at the same time I

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:14.770 
to the jihadist and at the same time I
think<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.610> US<00:05:13.909> and<00:05:14.120> their<00:05:14.300> interest<00:05:14.659> would

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
think the US and their interest would

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.589 
think the US and their interest would
like<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.520> cut<00:05:16.520> off<00:05:16.669> that<00:05:16.940> alliance<00:05:17.419> between
