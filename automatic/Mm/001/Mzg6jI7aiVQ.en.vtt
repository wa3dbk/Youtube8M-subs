slide this down and slide that over and
you<00:01:16.830> see<00:01:17.009> your<00:01:17.130> ruby<00:01:18.650> I'm<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:19.979> small

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
you see your ruby I'm in a really small

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
you see your ruby I'm in a really small
space<00:01:20.400> right<00:01:20.729> now

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409

basically it oh and I also want to show
you<00:01:45.380> my<00:01:46.380> brick<00:01:46.979> separator<00:01:48.200> it's<00:01:49.200> right<00:01:49.380> here

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
you my brick separator it's right here

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
you my brick separator it's right here
it's<00:01:52.470> really<00:01:52.920> helpful<00:01:53.340> I'll<00:01:54.240> make<00:01:54.539> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
it's really helpful I'll make a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:26.180 
it's really helpful I'll make a
demonstration<00:01:55.140> hold<00:01:55.530> on<00:02:19.190> okay<00:02:21.319> okay<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:25.190> you

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
demonstration hold on okay okay so you

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.759 
demonstration hold on okay okay so you
can't<00:02:26.690> separate<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.750> brick<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.200> all<00:02:31.590> you

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
can't separate a brick like this all you

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.979 
can't separate a brick like this all you
do<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:31.980> get<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> brick<00:02:32.400> separator<00:02:32.810> let<00:02:33.810> me<00:02:33.900> get

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
do is get the brick separator let me get

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.319 
do is get the brick separator let me get
this<00:02:34.110> out<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.290> light<00:02:34.790> all<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.880> do<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.060> get<00:02:36.239> the

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
this out of light all you do is get the

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.949 
this out of light all you do is get the
brick<00:02:36.510> separator<00:02:37.820> this<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> bottom<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.600> top

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
brick separator this is the bottom a top

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.009 
brick separator this is the bottom a top
and<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.470> technique<00:02:41.299> what<00:02:42.299> you<00:02:42.390> do<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.989> just

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
and a technique what you do is you just

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:53.560 
and a technique what you do is you just
do<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:44.030> then<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.180> do<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:46.670> breaks<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.820> up

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.650 

and<00:02:54.980> if<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.549> bottom<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:57.329> can't<00:02:57.510> get

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
and if it's on the bottom you can't get

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.880 
and if it's on the bottom you can't get
it<00:02:57.810> take<00:02:58.590> your<00:02:58.739> brick<00:02:58.950> separator<00:02:59.989> do<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.170> and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
it take your brick separator do that and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.090 
it take your brick separator do that and
then<00:03:02.100> it's<00:03:02.250> off<00:03:02.400> um<00:03:03.560> I'm<00:03:04.560> not<00:03:04.739> going<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:04.950> show

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
then it's off um I'm not going to show

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.640 
then it's off um I'm not going to show
you<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.310> Technic<00:03:05.870> it's<00:03:06.870> kind<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.109> hard<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.410> use

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
you the Technic it's kind of hard to use

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.980 
you the Technic it's kind of hard to use
um<00:03:09.859> so<00:03:12.140> yeah<00:03:13.140> that's<00:03:13.380> basically<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.769> guys
