aggressive now I'm not sure how he that
would<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.430> best<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.760> him<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.940> try<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
would be best for him to try and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.790 
would be best for him to try and
capitalize<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.780> small<00:00:43.230> advantage<00:00:43.649> he's

I'm he does start if that does get web
dirt<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.750> decided<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.439> or

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
dirt and decided for this one or

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.020 
dirt and decided for this one or
something<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.070> could<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.759> bad

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
something it could be really really bad

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.149 
something it could be really really bad
here<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.390> rent<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.140> mean<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:35.009> nice

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
here for rent and I mean a really nice

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.859 
here for rent and I mean a really nice
never<00:01:35.490> taking<00:01:35.759> out<00:01:35.850> those<00:01:35.939> let<00:01:36.180> those<00:01:36.600> schools

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
never taking out those let those schools

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
never taking out those let those schools
so<00:01:37.170> quickly<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.189> think<00:01:38.460> that's<00:01:38.939> something

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
so quickly and I think that's something

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.310 
so quickly and I think that's something
that<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.659> need<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.900> take<00:01:40.170> into

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
that you really need to take into

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.719 
that you really need to take into
consideration<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.040> need<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.310> stop<00:01:41.579> getting

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
consideration do we need to stop getting

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.370 
consideration do we need to stop getting
ghouls<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.180> some<00:01:42.329> point<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.049> think<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.290> was

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
ghouls at some point and I think it was

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.679 
ghouls at some point and I think it was
a<00:01:43.409> bit<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.250> while<00:01:44.430> ago<00:01:44.700> now<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.180> will

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
a bit of a while ago now that that will

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.300 
a bit of a while ago now that that will
five<00:01:45.840> letters<00:01:46.200> out<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.710> some<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.130> nice

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
five letters out but some really nice

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.219 
five letters out but some really nice
Nova's<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.880> off<00:01:48.030> they're<00:01:48.270> taking<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.020> this

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
Nova's going off they're taking all this

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.560 
Nova's going off they're taking all this
um<00:01:49.500> all<00:01:50.009> these<00:01:50.220> units<00:01:50.520> down<00:01:50.640> really<00:01:51.149> quite<00:01:51.360> low

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
um all these units down really quite low

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.929 
um all these units down really quite low
and<00:01:51.720> looks<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:52.710> Miss<00:01:53.220> Lich<00:01:53.430> will<00:01:53.670> need<00:01:53.820> to

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
nothing really from a mentor to try and

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.390 
nothing really from a mentor to try and
stop<00:04:19.739> by<00:04:19.909> here<00:04:20.909> and<00:04:20.970> so<00:04:21.440> I'm<00:04:22.440> actually<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.860> just

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
stop by here and so I'm actually I just

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.740 
stop by here and so I'm actually I just
go<00:04:23.490> try<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:23.849> turn<00:04:23.940> around<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.390> try<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.570> get<00:04:24.690> a

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
go try and turn around and try and get a

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.180 
go try and turn around and try and get a
couple<00:04:25.320> hits<00:04:25.590> off<00:04:25.860> on

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
couple hits off on

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.400 
couple hits off on
these<00:04:26.580> worms<00:04:26.820> he<00:04:27.570> doesn't<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:28.050> think<00:04:28.260> how<00:04:28.350> many

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
these worms he doesn't I think how many

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.290 
these worms he doesn't I think how many
fiends<00:04:28.980> left<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:29.430> think<00:04:29.610> his<00:04:29.730> last<00:04:29.880> beam<00:04:30.120> went

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
fiends left I think his last beam went

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.360 
fiends left I think his last beam went
down<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:31.170> there's<00:04:31.320> someone<00:04:31.740> less<00:04:32.100> action

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
down and so there's someone less action

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.680 
down and so there's someone less action
a<00:04:32.520> lot<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.730> trouble<00:04:32.970> should<00:04:33.120> be<00:04:33.240> keeping<00:04:33.390> up

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
a lot of trouble should be keeping up

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.790 
a lot of trouble should be keeping up
because<00:04:33.930> this<00:04:34.020> were<00:04:34.170> other<00:04:34.440> that's<00:04:34.680> just

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
because this were other that's just

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.520 
because this were other that's just
coming<00:04:34.920> back<00:04:35.100> in<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.610> he<00:04:35.730> does<00:04:35.910> TP<00:04:36.330> out<00:04:36.530> really

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
coming back in and he does TP out really

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.690 
coming back in and he does TP out really
epic<00:04:37.650> you<00:04:37.920> shouldn't<00:04:38.190> have<00:04:38.280> stayed<00:04:38.460> and

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
epic you shouldn't have stayed and

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.360 
epic you shouldn't have stayed and
fought<00:04:38.880> there<00:04:39.150> but<00:04:39.570> still<00:04:40.080> well<00:04:41.010> actually<00:04:41.190> I

like<00:05:27.600> flies<00:05:27.990> but<00:05:28.320> as<00:05:28.620> actually<00:05:28.950> turn<00:05:29.100> this

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
like flies but as actually turn this

far<00:05:33.210> and<00:05:33.950> it<00:05:34.950> looks<00:05:35.310> like<00:05:35.490> this<00:05:35.669> is<00:05:35.910> gonna<00:05:36.060> be

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
far and it looks like this is gonna be

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.630 
far and it looks like this is gonna be
pretty<00:05:36.690> bad<00:05:36.960> for<00:05:37.169> end<00:05:37.320> here<00:05:37.470> and<00:05:37.710> really<00:05:38.460> needs
