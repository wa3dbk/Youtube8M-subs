GTA<00:00:10.139> body<00:00:10.440> kit<00:00:10.860> on<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.270> it<00:00:12.270> was<00:00:12.539> a<00:00:13.639> big<00:00:14.639> head<00:00:14.879> a

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
GTA body kit on it it was a big head a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:23.300 
GTA body kit on it it was a big head a
narrow<00:00:17.449> so<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.540> CBO<00:00:18.900> didn't<00:00:19.430> Minari<00:00:22.310> and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
narrow so the CBO didn't Minari and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.070 
narrow so the CBO didn't Minari and
we've<00:00:23.490> just<00:00:23.520> been<00:00:23.730> true<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.900> little

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
we've just been true and it's a little

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.480 
we've just been true and it's a little
while<00:00:25.289> ago<00:00:25.410> didn't<00:00:26.130> most<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
while ago didn't most of the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.070 
while ago didn't most of the
modifications<00:00:27.120> the<00:00:27.270> wheels<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.810> actually

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
modifications the wheels have actually

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.100 
modifications the wheels have actually
just<00:00:28.230> got<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:29.090> and<00:00:30.090> we've<00:00:30.360> just<00:00:30.390> got<00:00:30.869> them<00:00:30.990> on

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
just got here and we've just got them on

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.540 
just got here and we've just got them on
in<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.770> big<00:00:31.920> brown<00:00:32.129> with<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.340> wheels

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
in the big brown with the wheels

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.860 
in the big brown with the wheels
actually<00:00:34.610> I'm<00:00:35.610> all<00:00:36.120> going<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> little

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
actually I'm all going in with a little

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.810 
actually I'm all going in with a little
bit<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.050> work<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:38.130> managed<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.610> them<00:00:38.730> on

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
bit of work we managed to get them on

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.400 
bit of work we managed to get them on
the<00:00:38.910> car<00:00:39.150> and<00:00:39.630> I<00:00:39.840> think<00:00:39.900> they're<00:00:40.170> doing<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the car and I think they're doing the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.620 
the car and I think they're doing the
car<00:00:40.560> quite<00:00:40.800> justice<00:00:41.250> anyway<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> walk

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
car quite justice anyway this is a walk

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.190 
car quite justice anyway this is a walk
around<00:00:42.930> video<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:44.360> Steve<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.540> owner<00:00:45.720> can

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
around video so that Steve the owner can

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.049 
around video so that Steve the owner can
actually<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.309> look<00:00:47.430> cause<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.640> can't<00:00:47.880> be

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
actually have a look cause you can't be

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.900 
actually have a look cause you can't be
here<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.360> moment<00:00:49.399> and<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.579> we're<00:00:50.730> doing

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
here at the moment and what we're doing

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.690 
here at the moment and what we're doing
that<00:00:51.059> Lamaze<00:00:51.329> will<00:00:51.510> show<00:00:51.690> everyone<00:00:52.489> what<00:00:53.489> he's

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
that Lamaze will show everyone what he's

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.670 
that Lamaze will show everyone what he's
built<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.540> here's<00:00:54.750> some<00:00:54.899> more<00:00:54.989> plans<00:00:55.290> for<00:00:55.590> it

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
built and here's some more plans for it

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
built and here's some more plans for it
there's<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> bit<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.570> probably<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> bit<00:00:57.780> of

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
there's a bit of probably a bit of

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.270 
there's a bit of probably a bit of
carbon<00:00:58.230> fiber<00:01:00.320> body<00:01:01.320> work<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.829> go<00:01:01.950> onto<00:01:02.160> this

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
carbon fiber body work to go onto this

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.569 
carbon fiber body work to go onto this
thing<00:01:03.379> just<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.559> finish<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.979> off<00:01:05.100> into<00:01:05.339> what<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
thing just to finish it off into what it

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.840 
thing just to finish it off into what it
is<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:05.969> um<00:01:06.679> yeah<00:01:07.679> it's<00:01:07.889> not<00:01:07.979> bad<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
is but um yeah it's not bad just like it

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.599 
is but um yeah it's not bad just like it
is<00:01:09.709> he's<00:01:10.709> one<00:01:10.859> of<00:01:10.889> the<00:01:11.009> mods<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.399> to<00:01:11.520> this

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:11.609 
is he's one of the mods we do to this

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.169 
is he's one of the mods we do to this
thing<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.969> put<00:01:12.149> the<00:01:12.619> start<00:01:13.619> switch<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.909> over

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
thing we put the start switch and over

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.699 
thing we put the start switch and over
there<00:01:15.329> in<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> middle<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.929> the<00:01:17.240> dash<00:01:18.529> and<00:01:19.529> then

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:19.709 
there in the middle of the dash and then

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:38.010 
there in the middle of the dash and then
we'll<00:01:19.859> show<00:01:19.979> em<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> bonnet<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.639> well

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.109 

that's<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.710> v7<00:01:39.280> vortech<00:01:40.829> 427<00:01:41.829> engine<00:01:42.119> I'll

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
that's a v7 vortech 427 engine I'll

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.179 
that's a v7 vortech 427 engine I'll
attach<00:01:43.390> some<00:01:43.630> previous<00:01:44.290> video<00:01:44.500> of<00:01:44.829> the<00:01:47.189> this

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
attach some previous video of the this
