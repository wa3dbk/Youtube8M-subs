out the unboxing on first look because
you<00:00:23.760> get<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> close-up<00:00:24.210> look<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:25.170> what<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.470> get

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
you get a close-up look of what you get

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.800 
you get a close-up look of what you get
inside<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.099> box<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.490> also<00:00:26.789> what<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> LX<00:00:27.300> 14

inside the box and also what the LX 14

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.560 
inside the box and also what the LX 14
looks<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.310> now<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.970> moment<00:00:30.420> on

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
looks like now at the moment on

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.110 
looks like now at the moment on
recording<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.170> audio<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.130> video<00:00:32.460> from

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
recording the audio in this video from

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.889 
recording the audio in this video from
my<00:00:33.420> Panasonic<00:00:34.320> X<00:00:34.530> 900<00:00:35.309> s<00:00:35.370> internal<00:00:36.149> built-in

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.459 
microphones
now<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.210> manual<00:00:39.629> picture<00:00:40.050> settings

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
now I have got manual picture settings

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.889 
now I have got manual picture settings
on<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.040> X<00:00:41.160> 900<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> audio<00:00:42.540> settings

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
on the X 900 but with the audio settings

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.650 
on the X 900 but with the audio settings
I've<00:00:43.410> actually<00:00:44.100> set<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.730> automatically

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
I've actually set it to automatically

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.529 
I've actually set it to automatically
adjust<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> audio<00:00:46.739> levels<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:48.390> you're

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
adjust the audio levels so what you're

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.330 
adjust the audio levels so what you're
probably<00:00:48.719> hearing<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.440> fairly<00:00:49.770> decent<00:00:50.190> audio

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
probably hearing is fairly decent audio

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.880 
probably hearing is fairly decent audio
because<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> high-end<00:00:51.329> camcorder<00:00:52.170> but

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
because it is a high-end camcorder but

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.430 
because it is a high-end camcorder but
it<00:00:53.070> will<00:00:53.370> maybe<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> slight<00:00:54.480> echo<00:00:54.960> II<00:00:54.989> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
it will maybe have a slight echo II and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.860 
it will maybe have a slight echo II and
solver<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.489> not<00:00:56.670> very<00:00:56.789> sort<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.180> rounded

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
solver and not very sort of rounded

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.810 
solver and not very sort of rounded
sounds<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.469> ease<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:59.129> very<00:00:59.370> hard<00:00:59.670> to

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
sounds with ease it's very hard to

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.459 
sounds with ease it's very hard to
explain<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.449> you'll<00:01:00.629> see<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.440> difference

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
explain but you'll see the difference

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.160 
explain but you'll see the difference
once<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.219> start<00:01:02.489> recording<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> olympus

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
once I start recording with the olympus

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.640 
once I start recording with the olympus
LS<00:01:04.530> 14<00:01:05.119> now<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.180> want<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> show<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.930> LS<00:01:07.260> 14

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
LS 14 now I want to show you the LS 14

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.929 
LS 14 now I want to show you the LS 14
little<00:01:07.890> bit<00:01:07.979> closer<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.700> stand

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
little bit closer so I'm going to stand

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.850 
little bit closer so I'm going to stand
up<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.299> show<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:10.260> here<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.680> have

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
up and just show you just here we have

up and just show you just here we have
got<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.070> wheel<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.630> actually

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
got a wheel here that you can actually

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.980 
got a wheel here that you can actually
move<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.500> got<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> quick<00:01:13.950> mode<00:01:14.570> just<00:01:15.570> on

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
move and it's got a quick mode just on

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.899 
move and it's got a quick mode just on
the<00:01:16.110> bottom<00:01:16.290> there<00:01:16.680> we're<00:01:17.009> set<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.280> manual<00:01:17.610> at

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the bottom there we're set on manual at

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.640 
the bottom there we're set on manual at
the<00:01:18.000> moment<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.630> also<00:01:18.750> got<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.170> smart

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the moment but it's also got this smart

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.950 
the moment but it's also got this smart
mode<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.280> I'm<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.210> put<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> smart

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
mode and I'm going to put it to smart

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.890 
mode and I'm going to put it to smart
mode<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:22.530> hit<00:01:22.740> record<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> I'll<00:01:24.659> turn

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
mode and then hit record so I'll turn

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.440 
mode and then hit record so I'll turn
that<00:01:25.080> wheel<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.470> smart<00:01:25.830> mode<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:27.180> hit

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
that wheel to smart mode and then hit

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.870 
that wheel to smart mode and then hit
record<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.159> starts<00:01:29.490> doing<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.850> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
record and what it starts doing is a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
record and what it starts doing is a
countdown<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.860> 30-second

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
countdown it's like a 30-second

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.370 
countdown it's like a 30-second
countdown<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.600> countdown<00:01:34.020> is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
countdown and what that countdown is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.700 
countdown and what that countdown is
trying<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:36.390> optimize<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
trying to do is to optimize the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.679 
trying to do is to optimize the
recording<00:01:38.340> level<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> volume<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.420> I'm

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
recording level for the volume that I'm

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.319 
recording level for the volume that I'm
speaking<00:01:40.229> at<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.369> I'll<00:01:41.520> keep<00:01:41.700> speaking<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
speaking at so I'll keep speaking at a

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.690 
speaking at so I'll keep speaking at a
normal<00:01:42.840> level<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.320> then<00:01:43.920> hopefully<00:01:44.189> let<00:01:44.640> me

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
normal level and then hopefully let me

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.730 
normal level and then hopefully let me
just<00:01:44.850> check<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.270> timer<00:01:45.570> we're<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.320> twelve

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
just check that timer we're at twelve

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.389 
just check that timer we're at twelve
seconds<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:47.780> after<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> timer<00:01:49.590> reaches<00:01:50.130> zero

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
seconds now after the timer reaches zero

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.080 
seconds now after the timer reaches zero
the<00:01:50.759> LS<00:01:51.450> 14<00:01:52.110> really<00:01:52.770> cleverly<00:01:53.159> starts

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the LS 14 really cleverly starts

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.319 
the LS 14 really cleverly starts
recording<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:56.159> should<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.670> your<00:01:56.820> recording

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
recording so it should be your recording

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.330 
recording so it should be your recording
now<00:01:57.540> really<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.079> I'll<00:01:58.170> switch<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.950> audio

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
now really so I'll switch the audio

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.929 
now really so I'll switch the audio
level<00:01:59.759> over<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.719> LS<00:02:01.079> 14<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.729> what

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
level over to the LS 14 and now what

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.120 
level over to the LS 14 and now what
you're<00:02:03.090> hearing<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.990> audio<00:02:04.680> that's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
you're hearing is the audio that's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.520 
you're hearing is the audio that's
recorded<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> LS<00:02:06.479> 14<00:02:07.020> now<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.500> a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
recorded with the LS 14 now this is a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.490 
recorded with the LS 14 now this is a
linear<00:02:07.920> PCM<00:02:08.550> recorder<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.660> has<00:02:09.869> got<00:02:10.080> built-in

ecard<00:02:14.129> into<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.849> device<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.390> well<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:15.870> prefer

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
ecard into the device as well I prefer

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.410 
ecard into the device as well I prefer
to<00:02:16.920> use<00:02:16.950> memory<00:02:17.400> cards<00:02:17.849> with<00:02:18.000> something<00:02:18.299> like

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
to use memory cards with something like

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.640 
to use memory cards with something like
this<00:02:18.540> because<00:02:18.780> then<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.049> can<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:19.290> pop<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
this because then you can just pop the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.380 
this because then you can just pop the
memory<00:02:19.680> card<00:02:20.189> out<00:02:20.340> put<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.090> into<00:02:21.269> your

memory card out put it into your

memory card out put it into your
computer<00:02:21.540> transfer<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.680> audio<00:02:22.709> over<00:02:23.400> and

footage<00:02:26.099> that<00:02:26.129> you've<00:02:26.430> recorded<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.180> think

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
footage that you've recorded I think

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.929 
footage that you've recorded I think
that<00:02:28.290> recorder<00:02:28.799> like<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.129> is<00:02:29.280> really<00:02:29.640> good

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
that recorder like this is really good

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.209 
that recorder like this is really good
it's<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.209> very<00:02:30.510> very<00:02:30.810> good<00:02:30.959> investment<00:02:31.260> because

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
it's a very very good investment because

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.129 
it's a very very good investment because
if<00:02:32.310> you've<00:02:32.459> bought<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.730> cheaper<00:02:33.299> end<00:02:33.450> camcorder

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:34.139 
if you've bought a cheaper end camcorder

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.099 
if you've bought a cheaper end camcorder
or<00:02:34.290> perhaps<00:02:34.859> a<00:02:35.069> DSLR<00:02:35.639> and<00:02:35.780> dslr's<00:02:36.780> are<00:02:36.989> well

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
or perhaps a DSLR and dslr's are well

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
microphones something like this allows

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.390 
microphones something like this allows
you<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.129> position<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.969> audio<00:02:45.420> recorder<00:02:46.079> in

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
you to position the audio recorder in

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.250 
you to position the audio recorder in
different<00:02:47.400> locations<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.629> could<00:02:48.930> have<00:02:49.079> my

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
different locations so I could have my

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.140
