00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.290
 hello friends with you panda and 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.300
 today we have a small one 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.250
 monologue but I hope that he will 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.840
 dialogue when you comment on this 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.859
 video and tell me your opinion on this 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.439
 about the fact that in the world of warcraft 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.970
 Apparently now you can buy 90 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.570
 level this opportunity has already appeared 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.939
 on loss 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.710
 As far as I understand the implementation, that is 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.119
 you can not ride a character 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.949
 self -paid by yourself 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.420
 some amount of money I think that not 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.250
 small judging by the fact that usually have 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.800
 Blizzard all worth well enough my 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.629
 a look of decent money what's in it 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.870
 positive what's good about it 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.309
 First it will kill the market for the sale of pumping 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.960
 levels because all she does 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.590
 worries of course this is not very correct 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.850
 having worked I already told more than once and in 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.039
 Overall this is not very correct on my 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.079
 a look with respect to honest players 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.070
 eat unfairly wrong wrong 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.750
 this question is a little bit more complicated 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.460
 secondly perhaps closer to what 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.489
 gold will start selling then it will kill 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.470
 black market and gold market in addition 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.140
 together with the level pumping market with 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.760
 bots riga still start selling 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.960
 wait for the bill this here's the pumping 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.630
 right but on the other hand if all the same 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.090
 look negatively at this here 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.770
 what detail is let's say you're an adult 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.450
 a person who works without 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.270
 time hire warlock but jump 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.140
 me that is me now if i am very 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.299
 I even wanted to pump 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.170
 warlock or is there some magician 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.119
 new character 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.130
 but the problem is that if I create 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.049
 Now 7 warlock level 90 that is 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.520
 take advantage of this opportunity and they 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.369
 will know his skills i will need 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.439
 mastering times if i go there tomorrow 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.470
 im wolfart I'll be terrible warlock 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.000
 pfr especially if i go to re 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.649
 it is clear that of course many adequate 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.180
 adults won't go right away 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.340
 learn skills will read them 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.740
 honor skillbuild and honor some 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.869
 class guides ie generally nothing 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.729
 although I usually criticize my eyes but in general 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.399
 i'm nothing too bad for sale 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.220
 I do not see levels on the other hand I see 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.840
 bad just in the trend of what 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.520
 blizzard sells everything in the game in which 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.050
 so paid subscription ie me 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.510
 This fact confuses 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.610
 I have long been about mounts to go through helmets about 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.010
 all thousand well, which is there a helmet specification 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.960
 and a couple of satellites that is confuses me 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.890
 the very trend of selling everything in toll 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.360
 the game but exactly what 90 can be turned off 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.690
 for money to change honestly not really 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.940
 confused though it is from some of their position 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.910
 recognition by the breezes of their content in 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.580
 principle is not interesting to pass 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.530
 the second third time but in the long run 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.970
 this is so because quests and very 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.280
 Many events there are still something very 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.020
 monotonous and all essentially disposable 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.090
 nonetheless I cannot say that it is 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.970
 right very bad in my opinion 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.890
 options let it be level 90 paid 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.900
 why not someone it is useful but 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.130
 if you feel sorry for the money you can you 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.200
 get great pleasure from 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.860
 quests you can pass them yourself well and 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.770
 of course 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.470
 honorbuddy has not been canceled and you can 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.470
 pump as if for free up to level 90 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.980
 almost no buttons like this 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.690
 opinion 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.440
 would like in the comments to you 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.170
 wrote for you or against and paid 90 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.959
 level well and in general such models in games 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.060
 when the level is, well, then our 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.400
 waste time can and buy for money 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.410
 thanks for listening for watching 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.410
 if you can per view and good luck
