00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:16.060 

okay<00:01:09.770> now<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.220> start<00:01:11.430> him<00:01:12.500> I'm<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.860> start

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
okay now to start him I'm going to start

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
okay now to start him I'm going to start
right<00:01:17.070> I'm<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.030> start<00:01:18.540> by<00:01:19.049> making<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
right I'm going to start by making the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.130 
right I'm going to start by making the
disc<00:01:21.090> come<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.689> focus

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
disc come on focus

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.469 
disc come on focus
oh<00:01:25.490> okay<00:01:28.340> okay<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:30.000> gonna<00:01:30.150> start<00:01:30.360> by<00:01:30.450> making

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
oh okay okay I'm gonna start by making

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.039 
oh okay okay I'm gonna start by making
the<00:01:30.750> disc<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.460> take<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> weird<00:01:32.790> piece<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.570> told

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the disc you take the weird piece I told

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.050 
the disc you take the weird piece I told
you<00:01:34.170> about<00:01:34.259> earlier<00:01:34.460> hold<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.520> camera<00:01:35.759> focus

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
you about earlier hold the camera focus

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.170 
you about earlier hold the camera focus
zoom<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> little

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
zoom in a little

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.569 
zoom in a little
okay<00:01:39.829> by<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.860> way<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.220> trick<00:01:41.430> if<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
okay by the way that's a trick if you

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.789 
okay by the way that's a trick if you
can't<00:01:41.880> focus<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.720> zoom<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.530> little

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
can't focus you zoom in a little

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.410 
can't focus you zoom in a little
and<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.220> zoom<00:01:44.399> back<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.909> it'll<00:01:45.060> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and then you zoom back out and it'll and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.630 
and then you zoom back out and it'll and
it<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.960> probably<00:01:46.259> gonna<00:01:46.439> focus<00:01:46.710> all<00:01:47.070> right

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
it is probably gonna focus all right

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.359 
it is probably gonna focus all right
then<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.329> take<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.740> take<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.070> clear

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
then you take a so you take this clear

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.929 
then you take a so you take this clear
blue<00:01:50.579> stud<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.710> take<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.250> disc<00:01:53.520> like

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
blue stud and you take the disc like

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.090 
blue stud and you take the disc like
piece<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.540> has<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> curve<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:57.180> then<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> put

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
piece that has a curve and then you put

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.450 
piece that has a curve and then you put
the<00:01:59.100> stud<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.820> top<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:01.430> so<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the stud on top of it like this so you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.959 
the stud on top of it like this so you
have<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.860> then<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.399> take<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> thing

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
have that and then you take the thing

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.770 
have that and then you take the thing
that<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.479> go<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.810> their<00:02:06.990> backs<00:02:08.030> then<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.209> put

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
that can go on their backs then you put

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.580 
that can go on their backs then you put
it<00:02:09.869> there<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.330> that

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.240 

they<00:02:16.590> set<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.860> aside<00:02:16.980> now<00:02:17.250> for<00:02:17.520> um<00:02:17.790> Sam<00:02:18.660> Flynn
