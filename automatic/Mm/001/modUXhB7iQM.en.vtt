00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.640
 just in 2012 motorola revived the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.740
 successful resort brand with new 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.690
 smartphones and since then it has 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.910
 exploited the fame of said brand to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.710
 his new equipment one of the last 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.140
 equipment presented in Mexico is the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.330
 resort of three a mid-range team 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.980
 that without being pretentious takes advantage of 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.870
 beautiful design lines of the resort there 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.940
 the first computer with intel processor 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.820
 for the creation of a team for the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.010
 masses the resort of 3 has a 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.620
 1.2- gigabyte dual- core processor 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.140
 hertz allegedly a texas instruments 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.540
 although it is not a confirmed data has a 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.430
 gigabyte of ram memory and has 4 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.979
 gigabytes of internal memory available 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.420
 with little more than 3 for the user 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.790
 his memory is expandable through 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.159
 microsd up to 32 gigabytes in 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.970
 connectivity the resort of 3 is a team 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.430
 gsm with hs de pepe to 3.5 g wifi with 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.409
 support for wifi direct and function of 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.500
 wifi hotspot we also find 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.210
 bluetooth 4.0 with lr as well as the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.090
 presence of nfc 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.030
 its multitouch t ft screen is 4 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.430
 inches and has a resolution of 480 x 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.360
 800 pixels with a pixel density 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.520
 per square inch of 233 pp and is 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.740
 protected by corning gorilla glass and 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.990
 has pretty good viewing angles 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.330
 besides that the colors look great 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.790
 above what was expected in a team 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.369
 of its category the resort of 3 account 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.950
 with gps accelerometer sensor 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.050
 proximity and magnetometer also without 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.869
 against less FM radio in the package 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.520
 designed entirely in plastic its 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.860
 physical appearance does not look as bad as 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.680
 we had initially thought and has a 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.769
 good weight of 120 grams that reaffirms that 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.900
 General feeling of solidity your camera 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.760
 back is 8 megapixels has 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.470
 autofocus that works on what 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.380
 expected and the sensor has 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.050
 bs technology whose initials mean 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.150
 pacsa illumination that refers to 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.040
 a backlit sensor with which 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.350
 we can better capture the light in 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.690
 poorly lit environments in addition to having 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.490
 integrated hdr capture function 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.830
 like most of the 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.390
 interface in the resort 3 interface 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.880
 of your camera is practically that of 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.040
 stock in android pure healing so 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.140
 we can see the effort of motorola 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.790
 adapt to the google guidelines and 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.640
 Avoid as much as possible including options 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.560
 extra in the usual this does not end of 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.960
 three of having basic options like 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.180
 scene capture modes control 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.790
 white balance as well as the classic ones 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.470
 options to handle the flash in the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.660
 team we also found the menu to 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.250
 switch to video capture mode like this 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.380
 as the panorama mode that we have already seen 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.060
 on computers with android stock as in the 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.620
 nexus 4 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.960
 the photographs captured by the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.570
 three are definitely not the best 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.220
 but considering its price range the 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.840
 capacity of this smartphone in question 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.700
 of image capture is more than 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.860
 enough although it is what 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.100
 they continually take pictures perhaps 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.600
 you are interested in trying other options given 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.060
 that google acquired the division of 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.460
 motorola smartphones the razer of 3 is 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.770
 almost a computer with android stock and the 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.870
 modifications to the interface from the 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.550
 times in which motoblur was the norm 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.160
 have been left behind 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.470
 in this team we just see some widgets 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.850
 as well as some screens that are the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.160
 last trace of what ever 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.190
 tried to create motorola as an interface 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.830
 on top of android with the menu occurs what 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.690
 same and the last trace of motoblur is 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.370
 the shape of some virtual suites 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.220
 to turn on or off some options 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.560
 but for the most part it shows a lot that 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.270
 google and motorola have worked very 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.880
 the hand in creating software the 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.460
 of three the other aspect that is also 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.920
 A residue of motoblur is the application 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.840
 of smart actions with which motorola 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.670
 pretended at some point to create a 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.500
 intelligent system that could regulate 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.260
 the functions of the smartphone so 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.790
 automatic or semi-automatic function 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.060
 of needs and individual use 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.930
 that each user gave to the teams 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.150
 considered that this movement is 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.790
 daring and helps google to maintain 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.710
 Android as clean as possible today 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.080
 the interfaces have advanced 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.840
 enormously and with them the experience 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.640
 of user but that is still appreciated 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.740
 more in teams with power of 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.930
 relatively limited processing 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.360
 as it is the case of the 3 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.460
 frankly this range smartphone 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.560
 average behaves very well its 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.509
 performance is good and the experience of 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.100
 user in general is positive without 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.740
 major repairs of freezing 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.660
 sudden still and as usual 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.770
 we decided to test the reviewer of 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.460
 three with the performance tests 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.690
 using and to to be smart and quadrant 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.460
 applications that compare performance 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.990
 of the equipment with respect to the 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.850
 qualification obtained by others 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.529
 smartphones and they show us so 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.229
 graph the result 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.329
 the one of 3 obtains a score in the benchmark 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.539
 of almost half of what we would get 

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:26.149
 in an annex 7 or in a galaxy no 1 with 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:29.659
 almost 8,000 points while framing 

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:31.209
 we get about 3500 points what 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.739
 positions the motorola team 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:36.979
 slightly above the score of the 

00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:39.259
 samsung galaxy nexus the first contact 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.569
 I had with the reviewer of 3 was the day 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.429
 of its launch in Mexico and that day 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.409
 I had enough time to appreciate 

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:48.079
 the details of the equipment to the point that 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:49.789
 honestly I was not very satisfied 

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:51.829
 fact is that appearances deceive and 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.179
 behind that plastic body or in 

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:55.399
 We are really facing a good team 

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:57.889
 although I also think that it could 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:59.869
 cost a few pesos less with a 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.759
 approximate price of 3 thousand 500 pesos 

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:04.729
 Mexicans the team is located in the 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.409
 middle segment the resort of 3 is not bad 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.749
 but neither is it the first option of 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:10.429
 many users so we'll see how 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:12.799
 is going to Motorola by the end of this year 

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:14.659
 Meanwhile, I invite you to subscribe 

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:19.269
 to the channel and to like this analysis 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:19.269
 they have liked this is mobile passion
