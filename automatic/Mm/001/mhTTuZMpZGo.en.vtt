00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello everybody is luca di davos platz e 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:11.610
 this is the presentation of the shoe 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:13.139
 nike zoom that of seven in this 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.269
 presentation in particular we start 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.070
 immediately from the materials of the for and 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.890
 the main innovation of this 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.869
 shoe in fact we have the part 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.880
 back of the upper which is 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.500
 completely in composite or ai 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.430
 intentions that practically the same 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.130
 thing 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.189
 while the front of the shoe f 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
 It is made of a very very similar mesh 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.610
 to the prev 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.530
 among other things we leave you the link of 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.670
 presentation below in the box of 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.899
 description of the video 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.969
 only with respect to the hyper rap a linz 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.090
 league then the internal padding 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.190
 of the shoe under the mesh layer e 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.350
 in addition also a slight diffuse state 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.020
 then of plastic material that gives more 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.820
 support to the upper then to the shoe 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.469
 regarding the amortization 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.199
 here too we have an innovation 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.390
 compared to what six since we have 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.670
 always zoom then air inserted 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.520
 in the solo but in the part 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.250
 back and where we actually had the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 air max we have this zoom visible 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.970
 then this unit 180 one and you zoom 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.040
 very very big it is very reactive yes 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.259
 immediately feels the shoe as soon as you try 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.200
 while in the front we have 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.939
 always the zoom inserted to own 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.380
 just at the level of the midsole like 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.600
 in that of six 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.880
 even here, however, it is a little easier to 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.560
 feel when you wear the shoe for 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.540
 what about a thing that I have 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.049
 forgotten for the materials of the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.170
 this tear in fact return it 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.630
 containment tear we can say 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.939
 because because he also liked it very much 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.380
 in fact the scec also told us 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.680
 then the designer 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.630
 the nike who studied this one 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.189
 shoe in the video presentation of 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.170
 nike that we also leave you in the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.409
 description box because it is very much 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.200
 interesting and because it asks precisely love 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.899
 this tear loves to feel contained a 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.860
 level of the central part of the foot 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.209
 as for the support we have 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.090
 composite in the back that there 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.120
 stabilize lateral movements while 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.970
 we also have the sheikh plate that it is 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.000
 in fact it is different from the usual 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.000
 from these separate plastic pieces that 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.160
 want to mimic and metatarsal bones 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.200
 since precisely also here kevin durant 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.360
 with a very very light shoe 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.690
 dynamic does not want a shunt leto a 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.930
 anti-torsion plate giving too much 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.390
 tow stability in sex too little 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.680
 flexibility to the shoe as far as 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.569
 it's about the fit we're at 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.819
 forget the best crew shoe tu sais 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.890
 therefore of the same size of the same size 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.110
 with which we regularly go just that 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.540
 a narrow nib at plant level 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.310
 but in any case the composite is modeled with 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.310
 the heat therefore with the best use 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.709
 as final considerations on this 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.780
 shoe you have certainly noticed that one 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.670
 very very light shoe as I have you 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.579
 said it is very responsive thanks also to the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.379
 zoom in at the back 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.989
 has a good stability given by this 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.049
 composite hyper posit and tear a 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.939
 level of the central part of the foot e 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.920
 has before I forget that it is the 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.180
 the fourth time we record this is the 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.579
 coloration 26 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.739
 so I also wanted to remind you that in 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.840
 in kate shoes in a and chi pointed 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.389
 much about the colorations on the cure in the 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.090
 design the details within this 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.669
 tear have always put the usual names 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.109
 you ask wants to remember in all 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:50.290
 his shoes then the names of his 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.269
 in short, his brothers have family members 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.930
 also put in the sole in this 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.969
 pattern that among other things should go 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.250
 very very well also outdoor because 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:03.010
 very often they also added in 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.319
 in the back the state of the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.959
 mariner that can be seen under the 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.449
 traction pattern that is exactly where it is 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.120
 state where he was born and raised that of and 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:15.970
 regarding the roles in which he can 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.120
 can also be used here can cover already 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.310
 from play to great even maybe 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.169
 a long and need 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.990
 stability but still want to hear the 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.270
 nice free back will come out 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.870
 also many colors of this than of 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.419
 one among others is 35 thousand degrees 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.270
 the bright I officially leave that will come out 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.880
 on July 12th and which we will have in store 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.639
 so I invite you to keep an eye on the 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.500
 our facebook page and as always 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.659
 we finished this presentation 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.330
 I remember following our accounts 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:51.610
 facebook twitter and instagram is ours 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.620
 youtube channel double clutch where 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.539
 we have the web black box series 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.020
 thank you very much for the support and the 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.020
