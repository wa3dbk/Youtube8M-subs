00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.050
 we write the year 50 v 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.560
 All of Gallia is from the Romans 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.210
 occupy all of gallia no one of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.660
 indomitable Gallic populated village 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.790
 will not weary resistance to afford 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.550
 Julius Caesar is boiling with anger but he has 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.290
 a plan is the Roman way of life 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.920
 for the sake of the relentless gallia 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.080
 break 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.210
 the emperor leaves one next to the village 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.699
 luxurious urbanization for rich and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.970
 pleasure-loving Romans build that 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.830
 land of gods can be our Gallic 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.720
 friends to the Roman prosperity and the 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.670
 will resist the enticement 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.920
 fortified village from now on only the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.850
 Resort for Romans asterix and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.400
 decide obelix 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.119
 Doing everything around Caesar's cunning 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.119
 plans to thwart 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.060
 everything is beautiful and everything new when I do that 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.820
 first heard that asterix now in 3d 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.880
 I had to come to the cinemas again 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.260
 really bad foreboding is synonymous but 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.000
 somewhere justified if you look 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.610
 looks at what with the new bee maja 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.409
 or metal was made 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.270
 I also want to be absolutely horrible 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.579
 to say that I the realverfilmung 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.049
 Never really liked and therefore always too 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.689
 the cartoon versions 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.399
 In the middle of January I was able to enter 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.770
 make picture of asterix and I have to 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.049
 say I was really surprised and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.429
 while in positive 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.140
 the movie is based on the comic's 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.820
 trbantenstadt and is the total 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.609
 ninth animation or 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.109
 cartoon clearly one recognizes 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.969
 clear that this movie is not 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.579
 is drawn but still forgets 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.810
 one that already after a short time and 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.560
 You can therefore relax 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.539
 recline 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.189
 The filmmakers are particularly successful 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.039
 in my opinion the little idea fix 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.079
 and also the wild boars, there I am 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.330
 old asterix movies all but asterix 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.880
 and the vikings know and all 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.230
 amusing I can only say asterix 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.170
 In the land of gods is a successful one 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.700
 Continuation also very successful 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.950
 I find the choice of votes for 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.970
 our hero asterix is ​​from milan 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.970
 Peschel spoken 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.530
 obelix by charly pretty miraculix 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.840
 His voice was borrowed from Thomas Rough 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.830
 get and caesar gets from martin 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.780
 umbach spoken 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.670
 Wortwitze is not so close 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.120
 And of course the Latin can not 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.090
 absence 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.800
 therefore one can only say who won over 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.210
 Caesar asterix with the British or 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.400
 Operation Hinkelstein 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.350
 as I found really good asterix should 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.990
 give a chance in the land of gods 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.570
 but definitely saves you the 3 d 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.610
 you do not really need that here 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.340
 the new asterix gets six of them 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.840
 eight hinkelstein and I am 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.610
 curious if it on the blu-ray times 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.970
 again there will be a soundtrack with one 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.970
 dialect 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.160
 the invincible power of roms like that 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.950
 She has a whole lot of people stealing a hawk 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.050
 continents just does not consume anything 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.000
 stay where a handful 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.280
 indomitable gallia is was im 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.890
 to defy imperial eagle rom 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.930
 yes to her face soon but soon you 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.640
 protective because magnificent buildings 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.350
 make way for your village just one more 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.750
 insignificant on the spot he is 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.640
 you adapt or disappear, you know 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:45.130
 already called this glorious city 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:46.690
 let the land of gods we should do 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.180
 their colleague now comes the 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.790
 civilization 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.570
 I would know something but that will 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.570
 you did not like it 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.470
 We should give the Romans a rubdown 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.110
 that was also my idea 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.110
 now all of the potion 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.110
 No 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.210
 civilians we have to come up with something 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.690
 how we can get rid of them without them 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.880
 to build 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.799
 I understood you in terms of 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.440
 what's so general I have you 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.390
 understood what cost the nature 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.780
 less than in Rome special price for the 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.010
 Römerstadt 40 storyteller time everything 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.170
 become awake body 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.160
 We were already weak minded before the 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:35.820
 Romans had come what invited nc sa to do so 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.490
 say if he hears that at the 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.190
 We also make the village in Vienna 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:50.310
 the ground floor was the whole work 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:52.880
 for anna out of the world but to be positive 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.630
 To see the motivation is unbroken 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.630
 and that's great 

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:05.649
 now the soup will salt me
