00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
full of what's called casein protein

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.350 
full of what's called casein protein
casein<00:01:16.920> protein<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> complete<00:01:18.119> protein

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
casein protein is a complete protein

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.330

that contains all the essential amino

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.520 
that contains all the essential amino
acids<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.210> muscle<00:01:21.509> building<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.900> some

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
acids for muscle building and some

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.590 
acids for muscle building and some
non-essential<00:01:22.860> ones<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.820> also<00:01:23.939> very<00:01:24.210> slow

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
non-essential ones it's also very slow

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.440 
non-essential ones it's also very slow
digesting<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:26.340> sunflower<00:01:26.820> seeds<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
digesting the sunflower seeds are a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.200 
digesting the sunflower seeds are a
healthy<00:01:28.049> fat<00:01:28.350> they're<00:01:29.040> also<00:01:29.220> slow<00:01:29.640> digesting

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
healthy fat they're also slow digesting

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.149 
healthy fat they're also slow digesting
so<00:01:30.390> what<00:01:30.600> what<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.439> going<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.040> if

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
so what what this is going to do is if

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.380 
so what what this is going to do is if
we<00:01:32.280> mix<00:01:32.460> these<00:01:32.640> together<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.030> eat<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.299> right

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
we mix these together and eat it right

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.140 
we mix these together and eat it right
before<00:01:33.600> bed<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.799> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> slowly<00:01:35.490> keep<00:01:36.030> our

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
before bed it's going to slowly keep our

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.990 
before bed it's going to slowly keep our
metabolism<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.530> night<00:01:38.310> long<00:01:38.579> which

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
metabolism going all night long which

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.660 
metabolism going all night long which
helps<00:01:39.210> burn<00:01:39.659> fat<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.290> build<00:01:40.460> muscle<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
helps burn fat and build muscle and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.960 
helps burn fat and build muscle and
repair<00:01:42.329> muscle<00:01:42.689> instead<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.700> bed<00:01:44.909> on

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
repair muscle instead of going to bed on

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.300 
repair muscle instead of going to bed on
an<00:01:45.149> empty<00:01:45.270> stomach<00:01:45.659> which<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.799> may<00:01:46.950> wake<00:01:47.159> up

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
an empty stomach which you may wake up

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.889 
an empty stomach which you may wake up
in<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> middle<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> night<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> raid<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
in the middle of the night and raid the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.740 
in the middle of the night and raid the
fridge<00:01:49.200> or<00:01:49.640> we<00:01:50.640> may<00:01:50.820> go<00:01:50.970> into<00:01:51.119> starvation<00:01:51.420> mode

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
fridge or we may go into starvation mode

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.389 
fridge or we may go into starvation mode
in<00:01:52.020> our<00:01:52.110> body<00:01:52.290> will<00:01:52.439> actually<00:01:52.740> shut<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:53.159> and

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
in our body will actually shut down and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.340 
in our body will actually shut down and
not<00:01:53.430> burn<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.939> fat<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.659> let's<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.200> this

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
not burn the fat so let's just do this

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.219 
not burn the fat so let's just do this
up<00:01:55.560> real<00:01:55.799> quick<00:01:55.979> here<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.060> have<00:01:57.390> sunflower

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.200 
up real quick here so I have sunflower
seeds<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.860> i'm<00:01:59.399> going<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> count<00:01:59.759> these<00:02:00.000> as<00:02:00.180> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
seeds and i'm going to count these as a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.109 
seeds and i'm going to count these as a
fat<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.500> usually<00:02:01.979> save<00:02:02.189> my<00:02:02.399> fat<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.909> end

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
fat so I usually save my fat to the end

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.399 
fat so I usually save my fat to the end
or<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.719> meal<00:02:03.930> still

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
or this meal still

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.929
