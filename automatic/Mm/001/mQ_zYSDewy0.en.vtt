00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:09.000
 let's play a little sniper 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.520
 game mode of group games 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.520
 silenced everyone first essential 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.010
 I have never used in the game in the online 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.940
 still that is 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.940
 I do not know how it will be 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.520
 well nothing good you know here frank 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.410
 entity in what it consists of if it is not an 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.890
 Weapons rotation you know that each 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.989
 armor a certain time 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.290
 I do not know the truth how long 55 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.290
 seconds 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.220
 so the new rotating 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.850
 and they are going out to the most randomly 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.780
 and forgiveness to the letters 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.890
 the azkar and I would not like it to come out 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.730
 that would be some shot in the head with 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.730
 she would count 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.129
 well that goes the mind to the light ones of the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.790
 topic 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.790
 I have been told 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.220
 of this restaurant 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.220
 OK 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.680
 ok ok we 'll see again 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.590
 I would be pricking 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.470
 we beat him we recharged 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.900
 as they have killed are sending 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.460
 advantages and all in one by two 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.729
 where the tips are multiplied by 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.970
 two and dead and it goes to 30 numbers and I 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:53.200
 do not 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.200
 Well, that's better than doing 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.390
 while you piece the letter the sandpaper of this 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.390
 game 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.110
 is that they do not let me leave when I come to 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.110
 looks at it but appears in the other 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.840
 there is a network 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.440
 what a pity 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.710
 We will not leave 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.710
 s 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.150
 do not 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.549
 oh what a shame 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.930
 must get the multiplier not this 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.930
 it will not be in automatic 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.620
 it is not in automatic 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.300
 we are going to try to finish the game well 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.680
 apart from winning it of course 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.680
 and there is a camp 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.140
 good 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.360
 the one who has launches here with this 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.280
 if I do not want to use spear kikos if I do not 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.630
 I go because no 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.630
 but it's worth doing 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.640
 I was not going to change my weapon 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.540
 to which he is accustomed 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.200
 good 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.200
 I knew how to play with this then 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.629
 well a bullet does not kill me I think 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.850
 vindictive and donating how much is left 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.850
 a few minutes 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.840
 do not 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.080
 for less 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.890
 Turn around 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.890
 with two points 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.220
 he left 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.220
 let's not for god 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.640
 Diamond 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.500
 I said I have to win with this 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.610
 kill me boys 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.420
 I crack this that is not stop here not 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.420
 nothing happens if you cracked apparently 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.729
 already came a macho 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.940
 good civility in strips of the head and 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.940
 all 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.140
 we go 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:53.130
 well you will see now now the 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.130
 show really 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:03.750
 the pulse does not come to the pure one 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.750
 then the time 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.350
 do not 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.240
 do not run like I did not know 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.130
 he has moved 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.800
 I think I win if I win 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.520
 yes yes yes yes yes you have to do six 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.520
 low 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.740
 one 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:37.559
 come on we made the kit camps 38 11 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:40.809

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:45.090
 look what camps this is the best click 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:46.840
 where I am knife shift 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.050
 with it 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.100
 oh yes, my mother the truth is that the 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.540
 first time I play this mode of 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.610
 sniper game but hey he's 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.020
 pretty good I've done enough dreadlocks 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.400
 with the light inputs and so on 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.900
 nothing that they liked that they vote it and 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.500
 your favorites and we see in the next 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.070

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.070
 goodbye
