00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.120

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.600
 from a more digital point of view 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.800
 come on he has asked me for the laptop more than 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.420
 I do not know what he wants to do with him 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.580

 they knew each other so we're going to have a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.170
 ip video before those that both you 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.940
 like with the games that have been 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.230
 announced for the first time in someone with 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.610

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.290
 gent with the games that have appeared in 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.120
 general in the gent with that I know that these 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.500
 We love videos, we go with the 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.790
 games with the després citing with the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.860
 videos reviews to see what we have for 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.140
 here we do not have the darmon that depends on 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.610
 whether I play it or not the video review of which 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.950
 yes to watch videos and assured from the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.930
 mystery this is the Polish version is going to 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.600
 see video review also of the dragon that 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.190
 he takes it out in a few days is in Spanish 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 also one night the werewolf and 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.890
 also of discovery is that as you see 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.000
 here I do not know if it looks good but it's 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.649
 without unsealing I just arrived 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.360
 triggered so you will also have your 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.040
 unsealing and your video review and if 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.720
 you're missing a game 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.070
 because I do not have here the imperial sun 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.860
 well it's the other way around but you make a 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.510
 idea the imperial are of course going to 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.340
 have your video review and also going to 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.540
 have a starting video playing at 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.350
 game so you can see it a bit in 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.910
 this is broadly like this 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.440
 always enter some games will come out 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.350
 some of them here I put them a little 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.510
 and to type and as such but 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.610
 you know in the end all the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.930
 what is behind here apart from this I 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.840
 like to start making video reviews 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.160
 of not so recent games is true that 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.750
 I always go a little bit to the novelty because 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.460
 it is in the end what interests you the most 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.690
 know how new games work but 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.660
 there are many games a little bit more 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.970
 classics that I want to review 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.650
 I want to see what they look like and 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.390
 there are many great games that I 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.370
 I would like some that good are very 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.690
 known to make them known and others that 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.070
 I love them and they are very well known and I 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.660
 I want to make a video review so 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.980
 surely this month also starts to 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.900
 make these video game reviews not 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.400
 so so new apart from this we will have 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.840

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.010
 months we will also have some video 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.290
