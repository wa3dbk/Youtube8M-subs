we<00:03:18.040> go<00:03:18.069> we<00:03:18.280> got<00:03:18.310> data<00:03:18.699> model<00:03:19.090> detection<00:03:19.510> will

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
we go we got data model detection will

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.599 
we go we got data model detection will
start<00:03:19.810> off<00:03:19.870> with<00:03:19.989> data<00:03:20.199> first<00:03:20.470> there's<00:03:21.430> gonna

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
start off with data first there's gonna

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.619 
start off with data first there's gonna
be<00:03:21.729> a<00:03:21.760> lot<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:23.250> lot<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.549> images<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:25.329> we'll<00:03:25.479> go

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
be a lot of a lot of images so we'll go

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.119 
be a lot of a lot of images so we'll go
and<00:03:25.780> start<00:03:26.049> with<00:03:26.139> the<00:03:26.229> row<00:03:26.379> textures<00:03:26.859> first

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
and start with the row textures first

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.920 
and start with the row textures first
you're<00:03:27.370> gonna<00:03:27.489> want<00:03:27.729> to<00:03:27.819> go<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:27.970> data

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
you're gonna want to go to data

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.759 
you're gonna want to go to data
I<00:03:29.579> forgot<00:03:30.579> my<00:03:30.729> path<00:03:30.939> data<00:03:31.599> see<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:31.959> images<00:03:32.530> and

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
I forgot my path data see the images and

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.429 
I forgot my path data see the images and
then<00:03:33.489> that's<00:03:33.760> where<00:03:34.030> your<00:03:34.269> road<00:03:34.750> textures<00:03:35.229> go

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
then that's where your road textures go

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:36.659 
then that's where your road textures go
so<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.709> can't<00:03:35.919> even<00:03:36.040> replace<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:36.459> into

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
so you can't even replace that into

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.050 
so you can't even replace that into
there<00:03:36.849> like<00:03:37.859> that<00:03:38.859> I'm<00:03:39.280> not<00:03:39.549> gonna<00:03:39.699> do<00:03:39.939> it

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
there like that I'm not gonna do it

downloading it again I know it's for

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.900 
downloading it again I know it's for
gigabyte<00:04:42.979> download<00:04:43.340> but<00:04:43.550> it's<00:04:43.699> definitely

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
gigabyte download but it's definitely

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.999 
gigabyte download but it's definitely
worth<00:04:44.300> having<00:04:44.330> all<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.050> pieces<00:04:45.320> instead<00:04:45.860> of

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
worth having all the pieces instead of

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
are covered in snow I would recommend to

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.719

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
not put this in if you want to put this

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.659 
not put this in if you want to put this
or<00:05:24.800> use<00:05:24.949> it<00:05:25.130> at<00:05:25.220> all<00:05:25.310> to<00:05:26.060> fuse<00:05:26.479> your<00:05:27.370> image<00:05:28.370> pack

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.820 
or use it at all to fuse your image pack
with<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.060> one<00:05:29.210> that<00:05:29.360> he<00:05:30.020> gave<00:05:30.229> you<00:05:30.380> right<00:05:30.590> here

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
with the one that he gave you right here

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.379 
with the one that he gave you right here
that's<00:05:31.039> by<00:05:31.190> taking<00:05:31.580> your<00:05:31.669> vehicles<00:05:32.180> and

that's by taking your vehicles and

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.330 
that's by taking your vehicles and
singly<00:05:32.990> and<00:05:33.050> placing<00:05:33.470> them<00:05:33.560> into<00:05:33.740> his<00:05:34.010> image

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
singly and placing them into his image

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.279 
singly and placing them into his image
file<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:35.000> then<00:05:35.479> you'd<00:05:35.599> have<00:05:35.659> a<00:05:35.750> pretty<00:05:35.960> cool<00:05:36.260> a

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
wanted the textures it's just simple as

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.490 
wanted the textures it's just simple as
pc<00:05:55.400> textures<00:05:56.210> and<00:05:56.509> you<00:05:56.599> take<00:05:56.840> all<00:05:57.080> this<00:05:57.289> you

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
pc textures and you take all this you

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.260 
pc textures and you take all this you
can<00:05:57.800> take<00:05:58.070> the<00:05:58.220> loading<00:05:58.520> screens<00:05:58.820> it<00:05:59.030> just

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
can take the loading screens it just

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.430 
can take the loading screens it just
changes<00:05:59.659> the<00:05:59.900> normal<00:06:00.229> loading<00:06:00.500> screens<00:06:00.800> into

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
changes the normal loading screens into

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.320 
changes the normal loading screens into
snow-covered<00:06:03.580> loading<00:06:04.580> screens<00:06:04.909> I<00:06:05.030> guess<00:06:05.210> you

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
snow-covered loading screens I guess you

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.610 
snow-covered loading screens I guess you
could<00:06:05.449> say<00:06:05.630> they're<00:06:05.930> not<00:06:06.050> really<00:06:06.320> that<00:06:06.440> good

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
could say they're not really that good

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.110 
could say they're not really that good
and<00:06:06.860> I'm<00:06:06.949> not<00:06:07.099> sure<00:06:07.250> if<00:06:07.310> it's<00:06:07.430> gonna<00:06:07.580> affect<00:06:07.699> or

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
and I'm not sure if it's gonna affect or

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.760 
and I'm not sure if it's gonna affect or
slow<00:06:08.360> down<00:06:08.509> your<00:06:08.659> game<00:06:08.780> at<00:06:08.930> all<00:06:09.050> so<00:06:09.289> I<00:06:09.320> kept

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
slow down your game at all so I kept

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.710 
slow down your game at all so I kept
them<00:06:09.919> out<00:06:10.099> due<00:06:10.729> to<00:06:10.759> the<00:06:10.940> fact<00:06:11.120> you<00:06:11.210> only<00:06:11.479> need

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
them out due to the fact you only need

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.360 
them out due to the fact you only need
what<00:06:11.900> you<00:06:11.990> really<00:06:12.229> need<00:06:12.380> in<00:06:12.500> there<00:06:12.740> and<00:06:13.250> that

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
what you really need in there and that

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.219 
what you really need in there and that
would<00:06:13.490> be<00:06:13.610> F<00:06:13.789> X<00:06:14.030> underscore<00:06:14.270> rain<00:06:14.720> and<00:06:14.900> FX

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
would be F X underscore rain and FX

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.620 
would be F X underscore rain and FX
projectiles<00:06:15.889> take<00:06:16.580> those<00:06:16.849> and<00:06:17.210> you<00:06:17.240> put<00:06:17.509> them

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
projectiles take those and you put them

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.240 
projectiles take those and you put them
in<00:06:17.810> copy<00:06:18.080> and<00:06:18.259> replaced<00:06:18.590> and<00:06:18.919> you<00:06:19.070> are

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
in copy and replaced and you are

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.750 
in copy and replaced and you are
successfully<00:06:20.260> done<00:06:21.260> with<00:06:21.740> installing<00:06:22.250> the
