dream<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.420> an<00:00:57.420> important<00:00:57.840> thing<00:00:57.930> about<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
dream and an important thing about this

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.779 
dream and an important thing about this
is<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.890> needs<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.539> in<00:01:00.739> front<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:02.070> or<00:01:02.399> ahead

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
is it needs to be in front of or ahead

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.270 
is it needs to be in front of or ahead
of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.239> p-trap<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.680> would<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> end

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
of the p-trap so this would be the end

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.609 
of the p-trap so this would be the end
where<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> sink<00:01:05.850> drains<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.659> then<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
where the sink drains in and then it

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.289 
where the sink drains in and then it
comes<00:01:07.830> drains<00:01:08.369> down<00:01:08.580> through<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.180> out

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
comes drains down through here and out

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.390 
comes drains down through here and out
and<00:01:09.570> into<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> sewer<00:01:10.260> okay<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.130> it's

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and into the sewer okay so it's

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.100 
and into the sewer okay so it's
important<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.390> end<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.900> you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
important that it's on this end if you

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.010 
important that it's on this end if you
put<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.830> end<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.400> head<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.450> before

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
put it on this end a head like before

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.170 
put it on this end a head like before
the<00:01:16.229> p-trap<00:01:17.040> has<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> chance<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> stop<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the p-trap has a chance to stop the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.450 
the p-trap has a chance to stop the
gasses<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.259> get<00:01:19.380> sewer<00:01:19.619> gas<00:01:19.920> coming<00:01:20.369> into

got another stub of a BS in there then

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.600 
got another stub of a BS in there then
we've<00:02:00.270> got<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.630> fitting<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.110> top<00:02:01.399> so<00:02:02.399> that's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
we've got this fitting up top so that's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.060 
we've got this fitting up top so that's
that<00:02:03.299> looks<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.229> what<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.829> is

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that looks like this and what that is is

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.059 
that looks like this and what that is is
the<00:02:05.759> drain<00:02:06.420> stub<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.649> bottom<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.009> your

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the drain stub on the bottom of your

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.240 
the drain stub on the bottom of your
sink<00:02:08.340> fits<00:02:09.149> down<00:02:09.390> into<00:02:09.750> there

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
sink fits down into there

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.650 
sink fits down into there
and<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.520> makes<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:10.970> connection<00:02:11.150> there<00:02:11.630> so

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
and that makes that connection there so

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.020 
and that makes that connection there so
your<00:02:11.990> drain<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.500> your<00:02:12.560> sink<00:02:13.130> could<00:02:13.340> be<00:02:13.460> copper

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
your drain on your sink could be copper

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.420 
your drain on your sink could be copper
it<00:02:14.240> could<00:02:14.420> be<00:02:14.570> plastic<00:02:15.380> doesn't<00:02:16.220> really

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
it could be plastic doesn't really

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.070 
it could be plastic doesn't really
matter<00:02:16.670> as<00:02:16.850> long<00:02:17.000> as<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.240> fits<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.660> fitting

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
matter as long as it fits this fitting

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.410 
matter as long as it fits this fitting
this<00:02:18.740> fitting<00:02:20.710> basically<00:02:21.730> how<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.880> works<00:02:22.910> is

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
this fitting basically how it works is

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.740 
this fitting basically how it works is
this<00:02:24.670> if<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:26.420> is<00:02:26.480> your<00:02:26.750> sink<00:02:27.020> stub<00:02:28.750> threaded

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
this if this is your sink stub threaded

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.280 
this if this is your sink stub threaded
on<00:02:29.870> part<00:02:30.170> goes<00:02:30.380> on<00:02:30.590> then<00:02:31.160> you've<00:02:31.370> got<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.580> washer

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
on part goes on then you've got a washer

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.420 
on part goes on then you've got a washer
looking<00:02:33.290> kind<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.560> fitting<00:02:33.830> like<00:02:33.980> this<00:02:34.190> that's

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
looking kind of fitting like this that's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.110 
looking kind of fitting like this that's
tapered<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.930> want<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.200> taper<00:02:36.560> down<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.940> would

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
tapered you want the taper down it would

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.510 
tapered you want the taper down it would
slide<00:02:38.360> up<00:02:38.420> on<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:38.900> pipe<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.470> then<00:02:40.310> what

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
slide up on that pipe and then what

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.880 
slide up on that pipe and then what
happens<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.240> as<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.780> lower<00:02:41.990> this<00:02:42.230> down<00:02:42.290> onto

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
happens is as you lower this down onto

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.640 
happens is as you lower this down onto
that<00:02:43.000> tapered<00:02:44.000> fitting<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.720> thread<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.440> on<00:02:45.560> to

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
that tapered fitting and thread it on to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.560 
that tapered fitting and thread it on to
here<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.610> just<00:02:46.760> tightens<00:02:47.060> everything

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
here it just tightens everything

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.810 
here it just tightens everything
together<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.200> makes<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.709> seal<00:02:49.010> around<00:02:49.520> here

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
together and makes a seal around here

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.730 
together and makes a seal around here
that<00:02:49.970> wedge<00:02:50.270> just<00:02:50.300> fits<00:02:50.930> right<00:02:51.110> inside<00:02:51.350> this

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
that wedge just fits right inside this

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.340 
that wedge just fits right inside this
tapered<00:02:52.160> edge<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.580> pipe<00:02:52.790> as<00:02:53.030> well<00:02:53.290> okay<00:02:54.290> so

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
tapered edge of the pipe as well okay so

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.090 
tapered edge of the pipe as well okay so
that's<00:02:54.709> how<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:54.920> works<00:02:55.330> so<00:02:56.330> that's<00:02:56.540> a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
that's how that works so that's a

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.760 
that's how that works so that's a
another<00:02:58.100> item<00:02:58.400> that<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.760> might<00:02:58.940> need<00:02:59.590> this<00:03:00.590> is

just try to make a square and straight
of<00:03:42.290> cuts<00:03:42.470> as<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:42.739> can<00:03:42.950> all<00:03:43.610> these<00:03:44.120> pieces<00:03:44.420> are

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
of cuts as you can all these pieces are

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.520 
of cuts as you can all these pieces are
glued<00:03:45.830> together<00:03:46.010> with<00:03:46.430> some<00:03:47.110> some<00:03:48.110> ABS

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.699 
glued together with some some ABS
solvent<00:03:49.010> cement<00:03:49.390> so<00:03:50.390> let's<00:03:50.570> it's<00:03:51.290> usually

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
solvent cement so let's it's usually

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.410 
solvent cement so let's it's usually
yellow<00:03:52.070> I<00:03:52.100> think<00:03:52.430> there<00:03:52.580> is<00:03:52.610> a<00:03:52.730> kind<00:03:53.209> of<00:03:53.330> a

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
yellow I think there is a kind of a

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.150 
yellow I think there is a kind of a
white<00:03:53.600> clear<00:03:53.989> color<00:03:54.290> out<00:03:54.470> there<00:03:54.680> so<00:03:54.860> it's<00:03:54.980> just

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
white clear color out there so it's just

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.570 
white clear color out there so it's just
some<00:03:55.540> basically<00:03:56.540> glue<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:57.019> what<00:03:57.200> it<00:03:57.320> is<00:03:57.519> now<00:03:58.519> we

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
some basically glue is what it is now we

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.570 
some basically glue is what it is now we
do<00:03:58.820> have<00:03:58.850> another<00:03:59.000> video<00:03:59.450> on<00:04:00.280> working<00:04:01.280> with

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
do have another video on working with

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.990 
do have another video on working with
ABS<00:04:02.030> pipes<00:04:02.959> so<00:04:03.350> you<00:04:04.130> know<00:04:04.220> to<00:04:04.310> see<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.519> actual

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
ABS pipes so you know to see the actual

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.789 
ABS pipes so you know to see the actual
cutting<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.720> gluing<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:06.470> fitting

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
cutting and gluing and fitting

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:07.630 
cutting and gluing and fitting
everything<00:04:07.010> together

you're going to need for the for the
sink<00:04:12.980> drain<00:04:13.180> okay<00:04:14.180> so<00:04:14.360> we've<00:04:14.630> got<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.989> got<00:04:15.650> the

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
sink drain okay so we've got the got the

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.740 
sink drain okay so we've got the got the
parts<00:04:16.100> we've<00:04:16.640> actually<00:04:16.880> this<00:04:17.390> has<00:04:17.570> all<00:04:17.720> been

parts we've actually this has all been
made<00:04:18.049> up<00:04:18.260> ready<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.070> fit<00:04:19.250> on<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.459> sink<00:04:19.729> so

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
made up ready to fit on the sink so

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.740 
made up ready to fit on the sink so
we're<00:04:20.090> going<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.239> change<00:04:20.930> the

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
we're going to change the

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.170 
we're going to change the
anger<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.140> angle<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.890> camera<00:04:23.150> so<00:04:24.150> that

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
anger the angle of the camera so that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.490 
anger the angle of the camera so that
you<00:04:24.360> can<00:04:24.540> see<00:04:24.750> underneath<00:04:25.020> there<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.440> I'll

you can see underneath there and I'll
actually<00:04:25.740> install<00:04:26.310> this<00:04:26.490> underneath<00:04:27.240> and

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
actually install this underneath and

is going to thread on to there and and
this<00:04:48.420> is<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.750> tail<00:04:48.930> piece<00:04:49.170> that<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.410> was

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
this is the tail piece that I was

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.050 
this is the tail piece that I was
showing<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:49.830> in<00:04:49.980> this<00:04:50.100> case<00:04:50.340> it's<00:04:50.550> plastic

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
showing you in this case it's plastic

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.960 
showing you in this case it's plastic
unless<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:52.140> slip<00:04:52.410> on<00:04:52.560> over<00:04:52.590> there<00:04:52.980> so<00:04:53.700> what<00:04:53.850> we

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
unless you slip on over there so what we

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.790 
unless you slip on over there so what we
what<00:04:54.390> we<00:04:54.510> did<00:04:54.660> is<00:04:54.780> we<00:04:54.930> took<00:04:55.080> off<00:04:55.290> these<00:04:55.560> two

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
what we did is we took off these two

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.220 
what we did is we took off these two
pieces<00:04:55.980> off<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.340> top<00:04:56.669> of<00:04:56.700> here<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:58.050> I'll<00:04:58.200> just

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
pieces off the top of here and I'll just

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.270 
pieces off the top of here and I'll just
insert<00:04:59.160> them<00:04:59.750> onto<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.870> tail<00:05:01.050> piece<00:05:01.290> so

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
insert them onto the tail piece so

insert them onto the tail piece so
there's<00:05:02.490> our<00:05:02.640> black<00:05:02.940> threaded<00:05:03.450> piece<00:05:03.830> here's

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
there's our black threaded piece here's

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.350 
there's our black threaded piece here's
our<00:05:05.010> wedge<00:05:05.250> shape<00:05:06.290> gasket<00:05:07.290> right<00:05:07.440> there<00:05:08.360> okay

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
our wedge shape gasket right there okay

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.420 
our wedge shape gasket right there okay
so<00:05:10.050> when<00:05:10.470> you're<00:05:10.590> doing<00:05:10.830> this<00:05:10.950> you<00:05:11.130> would<00:05:11.250> kind

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
so when you're doing this you would kind

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.790 
so when you're doing this you would kind
of<00:05:11.460> dry<00:05:11.669> fit<00:05:11.940> all<00:05:12.030> your<00:05:12.180> pieces<00:05:12.360> as<00:05:13.110> you<00:05:13.380> go<00:05:13.560> to

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
of dry fit all your pieces as you go to

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.530 
of dry fit all your pieces as you go to
make<00:05:13.890> sure<00:05:13.950> it<00:05:14.220> works<00:05:14.430> we've<00:05:15.330> obviously

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
make sure it works we've obviously

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.909 
make sure it works we've obviously
already<00:05:15.960> done<00:05:16.230> that<00:05:16.380> and<00:05:16.440> glued<00:05:16.770> everything

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
already done that and glued everything

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.220 
already done that and glued everything
up<00:05:17.280> so<00:05:17.580> I<00:05:17.790> know<00:05:18.600> what's<00:05:18.810> going<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:18.990> fit<00:05:19.080> on

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
up so I know what's going to fit on

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.750 
up so I know what's going to fit on
there<00:05:20.090> so<00:05:21.090> we<00:05:21.240> just<00:05:21.419> need<00:05:21.570> to<00:05:21.630> slide<00:05:22.760> slide
