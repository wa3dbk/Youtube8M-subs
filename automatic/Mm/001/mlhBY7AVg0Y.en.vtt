00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.500
 it was supposed to be the last 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.629
 unpacking but 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.420
 I come, it means my stall well in which 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.929
 buy cards well I say how much I 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.650
 I only need to blow 2 and one shoots with 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.619
 shop windows can even be seen 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.289
 since only two boosters it won't be 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.789
 last unpacking 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.990
 why unpacking is not all 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:31.560
 ends because I already said 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.950
 that it is not profitable for me to buy them in the booster 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.380
 it turns out so that comes across from not 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.710
 repetitions don't do this so now 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.700
 quickly open these two boosters which 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.100
 I bought and still again I will buy a little 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.039
 more in the islands and uncover and in 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.530
 the last time and there we will already think that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.559
 most likely I am going to do it 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.920
 collect the entire collection on the exchange 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.120
 of course now there will be some repetitions 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.900
 forward although one or two 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:11.100
 which card we do not have 63 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.210
 stockmann there is no north but although 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.509
 Someone why should we send her anything 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.810
 scary let him send in 2 so 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.810
 monkey eat leonardo eat 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.579
 iron head no and by the way thats 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:33.549
 the man who wanted to change with me 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.659
 on the splinter and 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.490
 shredder here offered me the way these 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.959
 cards but still with him 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.630
 exchanged once offered times promised so and 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.969
 5 card I have see in one 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:54.259
 door shot allover card 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:57.530
 it's very cool here also will be something not 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:03.860
 so bad and when 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:10.069
 we have this norman there is no all 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.510
 ok I do not know it is like wasp 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:20.359
 we have no such 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:24.140
 justin is here tagir club 117 now 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:30.430
 I will quickly look at my internet 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:36.230
 China perhaps yes there is 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:40.819
 someone needs to have a repeat ask and 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:47.799
 Krang 88 now, too, looked all so 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.799
 no, don't remember green star inc 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.300
 to the brim there is a night today we have 2 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.630
 boosters with only three cards 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.300
 new three cards is also great judging 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.080
 because it happens even in one of 3 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:13.480
 all duplicate cards that person 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:16.030
 who ordered well how to share 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.580
 with me on these cards here 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.620
 wants from me 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.950
 Splinter and shredders do not worry to 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.370
 I change the times I promised everything until August 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.320
 it's not the fault of it all the boats 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:35.560
 which ended the cards blame him 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:38.590
 someone is also interested in not only me 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:44.800
 will soon be the last final 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:47.670
 unpacking bought r5 boosters and quiet 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.670
