00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
I missed my first attempt hopefully I

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.260 
I missed my first attempt hopefully I
get<00:00:59.590> it<00:00:59.710> early<00:00:59.950> as<00:01:00.010> possible<00:01:00.610> but<00:01:00.760> you<00:01:00.970> walk

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
get it early as possible but you walk

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.140 
get it early as possible but you walk
like<00:01:01.510> that<00:01:01.720> and<00:01:02.170> then<00:01:02.650> so<00:01:03.550> basically<00:01:03.820> we<00:01:03.970> want

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
like that and then so basically we want

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.210 
like that and then so basically we want
to<00:01:04.269> do<00:01:04.449> is<00:01:04.659> you<00:01:04.809> basically<00:01:05.019> get<00:01:05.440> speed<00:01:05.890> like

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
to do is you basically get speed like

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.430 
to do is you basically get speed like
you're<00:01:06.400> jumping<00:01:06.850> out<00:01:06.940> of<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.150> vehicle<00:01:07.360> but<00:01:08.320> you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
lean up against a wall so then when you

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.219 
railing so I leaned up against it I
thought<00:01:52.030> if<00:01:52.240> I<00:01:52.420> jumped<00:01:52.840> out<00:01:52.930> leaned<00:01:53.200> up

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
thought if I jumped out leaned up

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.480 
thought if I jumped out leaned up
against<00:01:53.560> it<00:01:53.650> would<00:01:53.740> kill<00:01:53.979> me<00:01:54.190> but<00:01:54.430> I

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
against it would kill me but I

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.219 
against it would kill me but I
eventually<00:01:55.030> figured<00:01:55.420> out<00:01:55.720> I<00:01:55.750> went<00:01:56.020> through

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
eventually figured out I went through

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.469 
eventually figured out I went through
the<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.830> went<00:01:57.340> through<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.700> fence<00:01:57.909> so<00:01:58.240> I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
the I went through the fence so I

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.450 
the I went through the fence so I
thought<00:01:59.320> about<00:01:59.439> it<00:01:59.680> I<00:01:59.740> thought<00:01:59.770> if<00:02:00.159> you<00:02:00.280> do

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
thought about it I thought if you do

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.560 
thought about it I thought if you do
that<00:02:00.580> my<00:02:00.729> friends<00:02:01.090> would<00:02:01.150> be<00:02:01.240> able<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.390> do<00:02:01.479> it

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
that my friends would be able to do it

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.880 
that my friends would be able to do it
when<00:02:01.689> to<00:02:01.720> building<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.350> that<00:02:02.380> I<00:02:02.560> tried<00:02:02.860> my

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
when to building so that I tried my

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.210 
when to building so that I tried my
first<00:02:03.310> building<00:02:03.670> and

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
first building and

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.360 
first building and
correct<00:02:04.400> and<00:02:05.680> after<00:02:06.680> I<00:02:06.740> did<00:02:06.860> on<00:02:07.010> my<00:02:07.040> first

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
correct and after I did on my first

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.430 
correct and after I did on my first
building<00:02:07.940> then<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.360> try<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.660> have<00:02:08.899> multiple

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
building then I try to have multiple

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.890 
building then I try to have multiple
other<00:02:09.649> buildings<00:02:10.040> in<00:02:10.310> like<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.240> lot<00:02:11.540> of<00:02:11.660> them<00:02:11.780> it

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
other buildings in like a lot of them it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.810 
other buildings in like a lot of them it
didn't<00:02:12.140> work<00:02:12.350> but<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.680> lot<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:12.950> them<00:02:13.250> if<00:02:13.490> you<00:02:13.610> go

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
didn't work but a lot of them if you go

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.550 
didn't work but a lot of them if you go
through<00:02:14.060> me<00:02:14.360> just<00:02:14.510> fall<00:02:14.750> down<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:15.380> like
