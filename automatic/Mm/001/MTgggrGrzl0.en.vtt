00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.179
 presented by colgate optic white today 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.000
 I'm very happy to sit down and talk to 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.430
 you internal that ask me a lot and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.640
 the blog on social networks sent and 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.640
 is this question do when going to go 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.590
 to classes and since the link back is 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.410
 around the corner it seemed like a 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.869
 perfect topic and give my uncles my 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.000
 recommendations so that they not only look 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.399
 well but feel good and bring a 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.500
 very bright smile like 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.660
 you all year 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.239
 first let's talk about fashion 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.460
 that although we all look for comfort I 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.000
 I recommend you try not to use 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.160
 Exercise clothes or clothes extremely 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.400
 comfortable for me for college or 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.680
 for school because sometimes when 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.519
 we feel good we are going to be more 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.460
 productive 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.610
 for example the chips we all love the 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.710
 chips we all have 20010 in the cross 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.990
 but the problem when it comes to 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.710
 college of the university is that we 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.270
 we make very monotonous and we uniformed 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.040
 we ended up using 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.259
 a pair of jeans with the same 10 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.920
 shirts in rotations I recommend you 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:24.580
 play with blazers with chiquititas this 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.610
 vest and overalls there are so many options for 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.880
 dress your jeans a little bit that is not 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.720
 excuse there are also colorful pants 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.200
 with prints the other thing that asks me 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.380
 a lot if they can wear dresses skirts 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.619
 or shorts for level 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.899
 I say yes they can use them 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.450
 totally while the length of this the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.789
 both the sun with the dress and the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.399
 appropriate skirt the ideal is that it is 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.880
 uncomfortable then for this I say that 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.700
 look for dresses or skirts that are who 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.939
 and those that are at the waist but you 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.420
 they open a little bit and as for the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.399
 accessories I say that you avoid the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.410
 very eye-catching necklaces with earrings 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.840
 very big 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.970
 on the contrary you can use that if in the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.980
 boat you do not know many bracelets only 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.720
 prevents them from being the ones that tend to 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.310
 but to distract others and before a 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.710
 teacher or you distract yourself 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.870
 while you are writing to go to the 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.070
 university I recommend you not 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.080
 use or high heels and shoes 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.500
 that will only be uncomfortable 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.210
 you can use today time or sports 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.980
 super cool rubber shoes do not have to 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.680
 do the typical restrictions about 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.730
 super cool models you can use the 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.430
 ballerinas you can use this booties 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.110
 of course it's not about portfolios you 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.940
 I recommend that you avoid the portfolios 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.540
 chiquiticas that if they are fashionable are 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.330
 good I love them but look for a 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.510
 erase a backpack a lump as you 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.350
 say in your country that I have a mob that 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.980
 it can be a large portfolio 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.860
 where your laptop fits your tablet 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.750
 swim if they use this university 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.900
 notebooks books 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.670
 the pencils and other markers everything 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.880
 what do you need 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.430
 the reason why you should have a 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.069
 Largest bulge is to put a kit inside 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.739
 of makeup a little bag of 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.660
 makeup not for you to make up the 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.400
 Ring in college or college is 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.590
 what suddenly does not come after 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.530
 classes you and your friends want to go to 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.200
 cinema or have an appointment later in class 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.600
 or what do I know then you already have that sec and 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.760
 after retouching 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.430
 since I started talking about the clip 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.410
 let's talk about beauty the most 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.240
 important is that it is your skin breathe and 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.640
 use the least amount of makeup 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.160
 possible but it does not matter what you are 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.890
 using the most important thing is to bring 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.860
 a very bright smile 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.960
 healthy white for this I recommend you 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.510
 the products or the old cat is the 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.970
 toothpaste and the toothbrush that 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.980
 has in the whitening feather 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.080
 you can take that wherever I am 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.030
 what I do is that I always have a 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.090
 traveling version of the toothpaste 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.190
 in my makeup kit so what I do 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.800
 is that if I can not brush after 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.720
 have lunch at the university or if I was 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.300
 in a restaurant I always feel 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.190
 fresh and ready to continue the rest 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.990
 of the day I recommend you use a 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.480
 little concealer to cover the dark circles 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.200
 and suddenly some granite that has come out 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.230
 that's why I should not go out 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.090
 more curious 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.180
 I also recommend the products 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.010
 multipurpose like zinc that include 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.500
 way that not only covers you a little bit 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:49.139
 the imperfections but also you 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.599
 moisturizes and has sun protection 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.580
 instead of doing contour and all that 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.289
 makeup is so heavy you can add 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.800
 just a little bit of blush to see you 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:01.430
 little bit more more healthy is the word 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.760
 but yes 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.580
 can use a little mask to 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.080
 that your eyes look more open and you 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.690
 you look more awake 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.060
 If you are blonde, I recommend you use a 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.370
 mask of brown color so that it is not 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.950
 so precocious so that the contrast between 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.620
 the hair and you and your eyelashes are a 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.830
 little bit more natural 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.229
 finally just add a little bit of 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.500
 lip gloss forget about the 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:33.070
 Very dark red tones use a pink 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.760
 sure then that's basically my 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.290
 essential for returning to school 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.380
 tell me you had to use to 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.080
 need or by the school tell us 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.240
 how do you put your hands on top and 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.930
 comment on what kind of videos you want 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.940
 see and if you share all tips like 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:56.830
 will throw is closer and at smile 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:59.400
 colgate I send you a big hug 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.400
 bye
