00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
door is kind of a tricky thing to get

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.670 
door is kind of a tricky thing to get
the<00:00:38.719> fit<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:39.050> we<00:00:39.109> got<00:00:39.230> to<00:00:39.320> write<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.530> first

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
the fit and we got to write the first

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.700 
the fit and we got to write the first
time<00:00:39.920> well<00:00:40.340> we<00:00:40.609> did<00:00:40.879> my<00:00:41.539> dad<00:00:41.780> let's<00:00:42.469> light<00:00:42.680> it

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
time well we did my dad let's light it

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.860 
time well we did my dad let's light it
up<00:00:42.920> here<00:00:43.219> so<00:00:43.520> there's<00:00:43.789> a<00:00:43.879> lot<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.329> it<00:00:44.359> we<00:00:44.600> got<00:00:44.780> to

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
up here so there's a lot to it we got to

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.979 
up here so there's a lot to it we got to
make<00:00:44.989> these<00:00:45.170> curved<00:00:45.559> sides<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:46.850> do<00:00:47.210> grooves

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
make these curved sides and do grooves

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.810 
make these curved sides and do grooves
in<00:00:48.289> there<00:00:48.469> and<00:00:48.769> everything<00:00:49.100> kind<00:00:49.519> of<00:00:49.550> needs<00:00:49.730> to

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
in there and everything kind of needs to

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.880 
in there and everything kind of needs to
match<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:50.780> we're<00:00:50.899> using<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.199> template<00:00:51.559> for<00:00:51.710> both

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
match so we're using a template for both

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.770 
match so we're using a template for both
of<00:00:52.070> those<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:52.579> get<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.850> nice<00:00:53.090> smooth<00:00:53.629> even

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
of those and get a nice smooth even

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.959 
of those and get a nice smooth even
curve<00:00:54.140> well<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:54.949> then<00:00:55.129> there's<00:00:55.309> a<00:00:55.370> secret

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
curve well and then there's a secret

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.450 
curve well and then there's a secret
behind<00:00:56.179> this<00:00:56.719> whole<00:00:56.960> Tambor<00:00:57.500> how<00:00:57.920> all<00:00:58.280> these

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
behind this whole Tambor how all these

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.970 
behind this whole Tambor how all these
trips<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:58.910> stay<00:00:59.390> together<00:00:59.600> right<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:00.559> they

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
trips that stay together right and they

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.560 
trips that stay together right and they
follow<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.550> curve<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.059> it<00:01:02.149> has<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:02.449> be

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
follow the curve so it has to be

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.720 
follow the curve so it has to be
flexible<00:01:02.839> but<00:01:03.500> they<00:01:03.620> all<00:01:03.769> have<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.129> be<00:01:04.460> in

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
flexible but they all have to be in

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.000 
flexible but they all have to be in
there<00:01:05.300> so<00:01:05.630> this<00:01:05.900> is<00:01:06.110> going<00:01:06.260> to<00:01:06.320> be<00:01:06.470> a<00:01:06.500> cool
