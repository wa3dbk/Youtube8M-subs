we should be happy that we are having
such<00:00:24.060> good<00:00:24.210> developers<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.230> what<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.650> kernel

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
such good developers so what this kernel

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.650 
such good developers so what this kernel
is<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.430> will<00:00:26.609> help<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.119> increase<00:00:27.390> your

and you can decide yourself if you want
to<00:00:56.879> try<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.120> kernel<00:00:57.660> or<00:00:57.870> not<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.010> let's<00:00:59.550> get

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
to try this kernel or not so let's get

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.279 
to try this kernel or not so let's get
started<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.210> first<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:00.809> make<00:01:00.989> sure<00:01:01.050> that

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
started so first of all make sure that

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.779 
started so first of all make sure that
you<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.530> already<00:01:01.680> rooted<00:01:02.190> your<00:01:02.280> device<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
you have already rooted your device and

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.420 
you have already rooted your device and
make<00:01:03.510> sure<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.559> custom

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
make sure that you have a custom

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.460 
make sure that you have a custom
recovery<00:01:05.549> installed<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.330> I'm<00:01:06.420> using<00:01:06.659> TW<00:01:07.170> RP

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
recovery installed so I'm using TW RP

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.490 
recovery installed so I'm using TW RP
recovery<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.210> that<00:01:09.210> works<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.659> me<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.350> then

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
recovery and that works for me so then

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.170 
recovery and that works for me so then
again<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.130> hold<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.240> power<00:01:12.479> key<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:14.180> so

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
again just hold the power key and so

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
again just hold the power key and so
basically<00:01:15.600> make<00:01:15.869> sure<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.500> enable

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
basically make sure that you have enable

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.620 
basically make sure that you have enable
advanced<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.430> boot<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.180> developer

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
advanced to boot in the developer

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.200 
advanced to boot in the developer
settings<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.159> you'll<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:21.000> this

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
settings and if you have you'll get this

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.179 
settings and if you have you'll get this
option<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.080> boot<00:01:22.290> into<00:01:22.500> recovery

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
option of the boot into recovery

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:31.289 
option of the boot into recovery
just<00:01:23.939> select<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.630> recovery<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.320> hit<00:01:25.500> OK

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.870 

so<00:01:32.299> now<00:01:32.479> what<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:32.869> need<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.049> do<00:01:33.320> is<00:01:33.590> just<00:01:34.280> go<00:01:34.850> to

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
so now what you need to do is just go to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.749 
so now what you need to do is just go to
install<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:36.130> make<00:01:37.130> sure<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.670> have

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
install and make sure that you have

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.880 
install and make sure that you have
copied<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.600> thunders<00:01:39.020> app<00:01:39.200> colonel<00:01:39.619> in<00:01:39.859> the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
copied the thunders app colonel in the

the<00:02:06.920> flash<00:02:08.019> and<00:02:10.060> we<00:02:11.060> have<00:02:11.150> successfully

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
the flash and we have successfully

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.280 
the flash and we have successfully
flashed<00:02:12.019> now<00:02:12.470> just<00:02:12.769> just<00:02:13.579> wipe<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.660> cache<00:02:14.989> and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
flashed now just just wipe the cache and

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:35.330 
flashed now just just wipe the cache and
dalvik<00:02:16.299> and<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:19.280> reboot<00:02:20.030> your<00:02:20.239> phone

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.750 

first<00:02:36.000> Oh<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.500> as<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.830> phone<00:02:38.010> has<00:02:38.250> booted<00:02:38.489> up

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
first Oh so as the phone has booted up

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.380 
first Oh so as the phone has booted up
so<00:02:39.530> let's<00:02:40.530> see<00:02:40.800> if<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.910> successfully

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
so let's see if we have successfully

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.440 
so let's see if we have successfully
flashed<00:02:42.870> e<00:02:43.200> :<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.489> let<00:02:44.730> me<00:02:44.760> go<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.420> settings

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
flashed e : so let me go to the settings

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.280 
flashed e : so let me go to the settings
so<00:02:48.450> let<00:02:48.599> me<00:02:48.690> just<00:02:48.870> check<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.709> about<00:02:49.980> phone<00:02:50.610> and

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.000 

as<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:56.220> can<00:02:56.370> see<00:02:56.870> your<00:02:57.870> kernel<00:02:58.230> has<00:02:58.379> is

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
as you can see your kernel has is

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.360 
as you can see your kernel has is
changed<00:02:59.670> so<00:02:59.879> its<00:03:00.420> turn<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.870> up<00:03:00.989> 2.0<00:03:01.590> from<00:03:01.830> 1<00:03:02.099> to

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
changed so its turn is up 2.0 from 1 to

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.789 
changed so its turn is up 2.0 from 1 to
3<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:03.269> basically<00:03:03.930> we<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.260> successfully

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
3 so basically we have successfully

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.640 
3 so basically we have successfully
installed<00:03:04.890> e<00:03:05.310> kernel<00:03:06.019> so<00:03:07.019> now<00:03:07.170> what<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.500> guys

settings go to secure security sorry and
just<00:03:56.940> check<00:03:57.060> unknown<00:03:57.569> sources<00:03:59.030> now<00:04:00.030> just<00:04:00.420> you

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
just check unknown sources now just you

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.530 
just check unknown sources now just you
can<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.380> can<00:04:01.560> just<00:04:01.590> install<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.280> apk<00:04:02.790> like

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
can you can just install the apk like

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.509 
can you can just install the apk like
you<00:04:03.720> normally<00:04:03.959> do<00:04:05.000> just<00:04:06.000> open<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.450> up<00:04:06.599> and<00:04:07.519> just

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
you normally do just open it up and just

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.360 
you normally do just open it up and just
grant<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.269> root<00:04:09.510> access<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.260> as<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.280> can

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
grant it the root access and as you can

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.390 
grant it the root access and as you can
see<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:12.090> shows<00:04:12.120> some<00:04:12.690> system<00:04:13.349> stats<00:04:13.769> the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
see it shows some system stats the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.890 
see it shows some system stats the
battery<00:04:14.760> temperature<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.569> CPU

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
battery temperature and the CPU

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.159 
battery temperature and the CPU
temperature<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:17.010> let<00:04:17.310> me<00:04:17.459> just<00:04:17.669> see<00:04:18.450> what<00:04:18.989> all

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
temperature so let me just see what all

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.170 
temperature so let me just see what all
we<00:04:19.200> can<00:04:19.530> do<00:04:19.769> with<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:20.579> so<00:04:20.910> you<00:04:20.970> can<00:04:21.150> actually

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
we can do with this so you can actually

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.620 
we can do with this so you can actually
edit<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.840> can<00:04:21.989> address<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.710> CPU<00:04:23.010> cluster

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.570 

you<00:04:27.630> also<00:04:27.810> have<00:04:28.050> this<00:04:28.229> a<00:04:28.440> GPO<00:04:28.950> governor

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.700 

and<00:04:31.670> basically<00:04:32.540> I<00:04:32.750> don't<00:04:33.140> really<00:04:33.350> know<00:04:33.530> much

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
and basically I don't really know much

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.290 
and basically I don't really know much
about<00:04:33.770> these<00:04:34.190> things<00:04:34.490> because<00:04:34.700> I'm<00:04:35.060> not<00:04:35.270> a

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
about these things because I'm not a

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.730 
about these things because I'm not a
developer<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.200> have<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:36.500> try<00:04:36.680> these

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
developer and I have to try these

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.990 
developer and I have to try these
options<00:04:37.180> but<00:04:38.180> as<00:04:39.110> you<00:04:39.650> see<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:40.100> do<00:04:40.310> have<00:04:40.490> some

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
options but as you see you do have some

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.410 
options but as you see you do have some
quite<00:04:41.420> a<00:04:41.450> lot<00:04:41.660> of<00:04:41.780> tweaks<00:04:42.140> so<00:04:42.830> here<00:04:43.430> is<00:04:43.670> a<00:04:43.700> thing

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
quite a lot of tweaks so here is a thing

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.490 
quite a lot of tweaks so here is a thing
which<00:04:44.600> I<00:04:44.720> wanted<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.020> show<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.320> you<00:04:45.440> guys

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
which I wanted to show to you guys

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.740 
which I wanted to show to you guys
basically<00:04:46.490> you<00:04:47.030> can<00:04:47.650> actually<00:04:48.650> enable<00:04:49.750> custom

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
basically you can actually enable custom

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.930 
basically you can actually enable custom
gestures<00:04:51.200> for<00:04:51.470> your<00:04:51.650> phones<00:04:51.860> so<00:04:52.580> basically

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
gestures for your phones so basically

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.360 
gestures for your phones so basically
what<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:53.390> you<00:04:53.780> can<00:04:53.960> actually<00:04:54.110> make<00:04:54.710> control

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
what this you can actually make control

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.310 
what this you can actually make control
you<00:04:55.850> can<00:04:56.030> change<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.420> wakeup<00:04:56.750> contour<00:04:57.050> as<00:04:57.170> you

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
you can change the wakeup contour as you

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.060 
you can change the wakeup contour as you
know<00:04:57.470> DoubleTap<00:04:57.950> is<00:04:58.160> already<00:04:58.640> enabled<00:04:58.940> uh

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
know DoubleTap is already enabled uh

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.070 
know DoubleTap is already enabled uh
even<00:05:01.070> without<00:05:01.340> this<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:02.210> what<00:05:02.390> you<00:05:02.480> can<00:05:02.660> do<00:05:02.840> is

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
even without this so what you can do is

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.700 
even without this so what you can do is
you<00:05:03.560> can<00:05:03.800> just<00:05:04.160> like<00:05:04.460> draw<00:05:04.790> an<00:05:04.940> o'<00:05:05.170> and<00:05:08.710> that

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
you can just like draw an o' and that

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.950 
you can just like draw an o' and that
will<00:05:09.920> make<00:05:10.070> you<00:05:10.250> phone<00:05:10.520> as<00:05:10.670> well<00:05:10.850> so<00:05:11.510> this<00:05:11.900> is

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
will make you phone as well so this is

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.170 
will make you phone as well so this is
where<00:05:12.230> the<00:05:12.350> curve<00:05:12.530> this<00:05:12.740> is<00:05:12.860> why<00:05:13.010> I<00:05:13.040> wanted<00:05:14.000> to

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
where the curve this is why I wanted to

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.900 
where the curve this is why I wanted to
try<00:05:14.570> this<00:05:14.630> kernel<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.260> it's<00:05:16.130> it's<00:05:16.580> really

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
try this kernel and it's it's really

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.870 
try this kernel and it's it's really
nice<00:05:17.180> I<00:05:17.860> don't<00:05:18.860> know<00:05:19.010> if<00:05:19.070> you<00:05:19.220> can<00:05:19.370> customize

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
nice I don't know if you can customize

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
nice I don't know if you can customize
this<00:05:20.860> but<00:05:21.860> here<00:05:22.460> as<00:05:23.030> we<00:05:23.330> see<00:05:23.480> it<00:05:23.630> is<00:05:23.750> the

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
this but here as we see it is the

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.310 
this but here as we see it is the
Thunderer<00:05:24.200> charge<00:05:24.500> control<00:05:25.100> and<00:05:26.200> here<00:05:27.200> you

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
Thunderer charge control and here you

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.620 
Thunderer charge control and here you
can<00:05:27.470> set<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.980> custom<00:05:28.490> current<00:05:29.060> for<00:05:29.420> the

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
can set the custom current for the

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.090 
can set the custom current for the
charge<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.140> you<00:05:30.440> can<00:05:30.590> also<00:05:30.710> change<00:05:30.950> the

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
charge and you can also change the

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.280 
charge and you can also change the
vibration<00:05:31.310> of<00:05:32.180> your<00:05:32.240> device<00:05:32.690> so<00:05:33.080> that's

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
vibration of your device so that's

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:41.650 
vibration of your device so that's
really<00:05:33.500> nice<00:05:33.740> so<00:05:35.860> so<00:05:37.660> so<00:05:38.660> it<00:05:39.050> does<00:05:39.760> ok<00:05:40.760> it

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
really nice so so so it does ok it

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.400 
really nice so so so it does ok it
didn't<00:05:41.960> it<00:05:42.140> didn't<00:05:42.320> work<00:05:42.640> but<00:05:43.640> anyways<00:05:44.410> is

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
didn't it didn't work but anyways is

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:53.110 
didn't it didn't work but anyways is
quite<00:05:45.770> a<00:05:45.800> lot<00:05:45.980> of<00:05:46.390> stuff<00:05:50.980> but<00:05:51.980> all<00:05:52.460> these<00:05:52.730> can

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
quite a lot of stuff but all these can

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.910 
quite a lot of stuff but all these can
be<00:05:53.300> adjusted<00:05:53.750> for<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:54.050> bake<00:05:54.230> control<00:05:54.650> so<00:05:54.800> in

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
be adjusted for the bake control so in

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.670 
be adjusted for the bake control so in
case<00:05:55.100> you<00:05:55.220> don't<00:05:55.460> want<00:05:55.550> DoubleTap<00:05:56.210> you<00:05:56.420> can

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
case you don't want DoubleTap you can

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.090 
case you don't want DoubleTap you can
you<00:05:57.680> can<00:05:57.890> choose<00:05:58.340> something<00:05:58.700> else<00:05:58.970> from<00:05:59.360> here

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
you can choose something else from here

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.910 
you can choose something else from here
so<00:06:01.100> in<00:06:01.790> that<00:06:02.150> was<00:06:02.360> pretty<00:06:02.570> much<00:06:02.750> a<00:06:02.900> hit<00:06:03.710> with

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
so in that was pretty much a hit with

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.950 
so in that was pretty much a hit with
this<00:06:04.070> installation<00:06:04.460> video<00:06:04.820> I'll<00:06:05.450> be<00:06:05.510> coming

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
this installation video I'll be coming

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.480 
this installation video I'll be coming
out<00:06:06.080> with<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.260> review<00:06:06.530> of<00:06:06.620> this<00:06:06.800> kernel<00:06:07.220> I'll<00:06:07.370> be

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
out with a review of this kernel I'll be

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.890 
out with a review of this kernel I'll be
telling<00:06:07.610> you<00:06:07.730> guys<00:06:07.910> water<00:06:08.180> you<00:06:08.480> can<00:06:08.720> actually

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
telling you guys water you can actually

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.510 
telling you guys water you can actually
do<00:06:09.320> with<00:06:09.350> this<00:06:09.590> kernel<00:06:09.950> and<00:06:10.160> what<00:06:10.310> are<00:06:10.430> the

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
do with this kernel and what are the

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.000 
do with this kernel and what are the
benefits<00:06:10.700> of<00:06:11.120> actually<00:06:11.630> flashing<00:06:12.290> it<00:06:12.440> power

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
benefits of actually flashing it power

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.800 
benefits of actually flashing it power
and<00:06:13.340> rather<00:06:13.610> than<00:06:13.850> these<00:06:14.060> custom<00:06:14.420> gestures

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
and rather than these custom gestures

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.890 
and rather than these custom gestures
and<00:06:15.110> how<00:06:15.170> to<00:06:15.320> actually<00:06:15.920> increase<00:06:16.130> the

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
and how to actually increase the

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.100 
and how to actually increase the
charging<00:06:17.900> speeds<00:06:18.260> but<00:06:19.070> anyways<00:06:19.400> you<00:06:19.550> guys<00:06:19.700> can

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
charging speeds but anyways you guys can

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.810 
charging speeds but anyways you guys can
also<00:06:21.110> refer<00:06:21.620> the<00:06:21.860> forum's<00:06:22.340> which<00:06:22.550> have<00:06:22.700> been
