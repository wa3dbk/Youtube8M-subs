made me take Mandarin and it was the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.440 
made me take Mandarin and it was the
most<00:02:17.070> hard<00:02:17.550> thing<00:02:17.820> ever<00:02:18.000> because<00:02:18.180> all<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
most hard thing ever because all the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.510 
most hard thing ever because all the
words<00:02:18.660> are<00:02:18.990> in<00:02:19.020> characters<00:02:19.710> so<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.160> super
