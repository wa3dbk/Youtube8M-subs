 apple infinite in almost all universities 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.200
 Ukraine is now a vacation and I decided 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.840

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.539

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.220
 I play but I knew that I had a poppy but 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.200
 I decided to click on this link by 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.360
 which previously were installation tutorials 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.520
 much to my surprise in the opened 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.470
 the window was already ready launcher which 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.420
 you could just download and install 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.429
 when I downloaded the game I installed 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.620
 say it's finally first 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:37.899
 high-quality non- lagging port of the game under 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.179
 the mapquest platform I can stand with 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.819
 yourself and everything works fine before 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.589
 I read the news that from January 5 to 15 

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:46.749
 each tank will be able to try its 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.489
 forces in a special game mode winter 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:49.479
 the battle is classic 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.609
 eight - bit style 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.510
 new tanks unique battle card 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.129
 reward tasks 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.289
 what else do you need for a great mood 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.909
 so say the developers of the world 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.229
 tanks suggest running the game and 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.739
 see what they are for us 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.780
 prepared tanks done cool not 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.640
 what a cool graphics we are not talking but in 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.680
 this is the whole juice of the game tanchiki 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.210
 there are over 30 years old and she 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.159
 underwent a sufficient amount 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.289
 change but that's it in the game world of 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.119
 tanks stop we are the most advanced cool 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.789
 version of the real battle fighting vehicles a 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.920
 This is an old favorite 8-bit game. 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.630
 eightieth year only wednesday 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.390
 management instead of spheres 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.219
 actually fight time 7 minutes format 10 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.049
 10 players mode random battle 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.149
 or New Year's vaults of five people 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.560
 while the stars play only against 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.450
 platoons victory conditions 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.399
 will destroy this enemy technique or 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.380
 grab a single base by analogy 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.810
 with game mode head-on out 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.590
 we have 8-bit machines analogs 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.299
 one with 0 and 5 mx 50 under and ltb 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.189
 each of the three tanks has its own 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.740
 specialization conditionally they can be divided 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.409
 into three obvious types of soldiers heavy 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.359
 tank sniper pts aux caught light tank 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.490
 need the title of 8-bit analogs 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.710
 the developers are clearly sticking 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.140
 tanks are called here as raider mammoth 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.030
 and berserk moving from technic to map 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.130
 let's see what's interesting 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.119
 the card is very small each but with 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.250
 your jokes 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.620
 red brick walls and allowed 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.180
 from the gray world and the foliage zones in which 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.220
 you can safely hide 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.989
 also for me was an unexpected soup 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:38.440
 you can sink not large tanks 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:40.600
 near the bar playing in winter battle mode 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.610
 when calculating the reward for battle experience loans 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.739
 availability of a premium player will be taken into account 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.510
 account all make money on the tank experience 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.580
 after disabling game mode winter 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.610
 the battle will move on to the next tanks with 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.080
 heavy on p1 from lung to ms-1 spd 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.120
 sauna renat ft 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.950
 actually on the first level tank with 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.660
 which novices usually start playing 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.819
 what i want to say at the end in effect 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.799
 wargaming is different 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.230
 its qualities and approach to development 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.420
 games all their projects cover the whole world and 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.790
 captivates with its beauty exciting 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.200
 fighting so their new 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.570
 8-bit mode just couldn't not 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.910
 like us all and i will say that this 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.109
 cool and they did so find 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.359
 tanks can be well earn 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.579
