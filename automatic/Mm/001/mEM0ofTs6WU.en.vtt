00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
and so we took their very favorite

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.330 
and so we took their very favorite
pictures<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.850> framed<00:01:46.600> them<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.979> turned<00:01:48.250> them

pictures and framed them and turned them
into<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.610> gallery<00:01:48.910> so<00:01:49.690> that's<00:01:49.900> one<00:01:50.140> idea<00:01:50.320> for

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
into a gallery so that's one idea for

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.190 
into a gallery so that's one idea for
artwork<00:01:51.460> in<00:01:51.760> those<00:01:51.940> kinds<00:01:52.360> of<00:01:52.420> items<00:01:52.540> the

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
artwork in those kinds of items the

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.740 
artwork in those kinds of items the
other<00:01:53.470> idea<00:01:53.950> for<00:01:54.700> kids<00:01:55.090> as<00:01:55.240> they<00:01:55.390> get<00:01:55.570> into

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
other idea for kids as they get into

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.660 
other idea for kids as they get into
school<00:01:56.140> teaching<00:01:56.979> them<00:01:57.160> to<00:01:57.190> have<00:01:57.460> their<00:01:57.610> own

school teaching them to have their own
home<00:01:58.210> office<00:01:58.750> system<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.710> that<00:01:59.740> they<00:02:00.010> don't

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
home office system so that they don't

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.130 
home office system so that they don't
have<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.580> carry<00:02:00.880> around<00:02:01.020> everything<00:02:02.020> that
