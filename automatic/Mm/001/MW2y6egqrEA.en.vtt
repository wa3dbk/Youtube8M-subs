00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
so when I begin with a half log I'm

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.089 
so when I begin with a half log I'm
trimming<00:01:34.869> it<00:01:34.959> out<00:01:35.109> with<00:01:35.349> a<00:01:35.380> chainsaw

just<00:01:36.429> to<00:01:36.549> give<00:01:36.729> me<00:01:36.909> a<00:01:36.969> rough<00:01:37.299> blank<00:01:37.689> that<00:01:37.959> I<00:01:38.109> can

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
just to give me a rough blank that I can

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.770 
just to give me a rough blank that I can
then<00:01:38.560> take<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.159> lathe<00:01:39.459> which<00:01:40.329> I<00:01:40.539> would

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
then take to the lathe which I would

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.279 
then take to the lathe which I would
then<00:01:41.109> on<00:01:42.099> the<00:01:42.459> lathe<00:01:42.640> shape<00:01:43.359> out<00:01:43.569> trim<00:01:44.049> it<00:01:44.170> out

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
then on the lathe shape out trim it out

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.339 
then on the lathe shape out trim it out
rough<00:01:45.039> it<00:01:45.219> down<00:01:45.429> to<00:01:45.759> a<00:01:45.789> basic<00:01:46.179> form<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:47.020> a<00:01:47.140> bowl

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 
rough it down to a basic form of a bowl

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:50.580 
rough it down to a basic form of a bowl
then<00:01:48.039> attach<00:01:48.489> it<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.060> lathe<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.899> refine

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
then attach it to the lathe and refine

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
gouge as I'm working and I let my

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.710 
gouge as I'm working and I let my
movements<00:02:02.439> of<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:02.770> particular<00:02:03.459> day

particular time meld with the material

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.340 
particular time meld with the material
as<00:02:10.810> I'm<00:02:11.230> developing<00:02:11.380> on<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.190> shoes<00:02:12.900> it's<00:02:13.900> very

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
as I'm developing on the shoes it's very

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.950 
as I'm developing on the shoes it's very
spontaneous<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.850> quite<00:02:16.120> exciting<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.810> I'd

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
spontaneous it's quite exciting and I'd

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.660 
spontaneous it's quite exciting and I'd
obviously<00:02:17.200> don't<00:02:17.710> know<00:02:18.100> what<00:02:18.340> I'm<00:02:18.460> going<00:02:18.610> to

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
obviously don't know what I'm going to

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.190 
obviously don't know what I'm going to
come<00:02:18.820> up<00:02:18.970> with<00:02:19.120> each<00:02:19.300> time<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:22.330> last<00:02:22.570> stage<00:02:22.900> is

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
come up with each time the last stage is

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.450 
come up with each time the last stage is
to<00:02:23.350> turn<00:02:23.380> these<00:02:23.650> backwards

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
to turn these backwards

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.420 
to turn these backwards
shape<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.000> foot

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
shape the foot

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.750 
shape the foot
and<00:02:26.610> my<00:02:26.819> fundamental<00:02:27.569> shell<00:02:28.159> from<00:02:29.159> that<00:02:29.370> point

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
and my fundamental shell from that point

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.380 
and my fundamental shell from that point
I<00:02:30.150> let<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.840> dry<00:02:30.870> out<00:02:31.319> would<00:02:32.040> send<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.519> up<00:02:32.670> put<00:02:33.360> a

there's<00:03:18.599> not<00:03:18.780> one<00:03:19.019> work<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.470> their<00:03:19.620> collection

that<00:03:20.489> would<00:03:20.670> begin<00:03:20.909> to<00:03:21.389> approach<00:03:21.859> an

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
that would begin to approach an

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.849 
that would begin to approach an
outrageous<00:03:23.670> exorbitant<00:03:24.120> price<00:03:25.049> there<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
outrageous exorbitant price there the

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.270 
outrageous exorbitant price there the
work<00:03:26.069> is<00:03:26.480> it's<00:03:27.480> very<00:03:27.840> not<00:03:28.409> just<00:03:28.620> approachable

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
work is it's very not just approachable

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.580 
work is it's very not just approachable
but<00:03:29.519> it<00:03:29.639> is<00:03:29.760> what<00:03:29.939> it<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.239> it's<00:03:30.720> turned<00:03:31.230> wood

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
but it is what it is it's turned wood

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.030 
but it is what it is it's turned wood
and<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:33.000> think<00:03:33.269> it's<00:03:33.389> easily<00:03:33.840> understood<00:03:34.379> once

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
and I think it's easily understood once

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.580 
and I think it's easily understood once
you<00:03:35.310> give<00:03:35.879> into<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.810> become<00:03:37.079> a<00:03:37.109> part<00:03:37.169> of<00:03:37.470> it

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
you give into it and become a part of it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.580 
you give into it and become a part of it
I've<00:03:38.519> run<00:03:38.760> out<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:38.970> space<00:03:39.389> my<00:03:39.750> husband<00:03:40.199> said<00:03:40.440> he

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
I've run out of space my husband said he

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.830 
I've run out of space my husband said he
feels<00:03:41.099> that<00:03:41.310> we're<00:03:41.519> living<00:03:41.819> in<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.030> museum<00:03:42.239> and

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
feels that we're living in a museum and

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.390 
feels that we're living in a museum and
that<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.079> really<00:03:43.470> ought<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.650> cease<00:03:43.949> and<00:03:44.159> desist

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
that I really ought to cease and desist

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.909 
that I really ought to cease and desist
and<00:03:44.879> so<00:03:45.150> what<00:03:45.329> I<00:03:45.359> do<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:46.019> buy<00:03:46.230> very<00:03:46.530> small

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
and so what I do is I buy very small

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.839 
and so what I do is I buy very small
pieces<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:49.739> takes<00:03:50.040> him<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.280> while<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.489> find

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
pieces and it takes him a while to find

tops off the cases and picked the pieces
up<00:05:02.039> what<00:05:02.760> we're<00:05:02.970> actually<00:05:03.180> saying<00:05:03.720> is<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.320> a

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
up what we're actually saying is that a
