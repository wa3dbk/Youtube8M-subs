00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.550
 she binds books 4000 an hour 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.220
 Before each delivery they test here if everything works with this 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.109
 Bookbinding machine 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.569
 almost 15 working steps are complete 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.089
 one does not understand at first glance Pfaffinger everything seemed to come 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.090
 a book cover is cut anyway and glued 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.360
 the company Kolbus still does everything itself let the items assembly and taff 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.560
 the machines 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.560
 the Ostwestfalen are world market leaders 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.300
 more new ones 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.170
 Markets are 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.950
 certainly South America with Brazil at the top but also Eastern Europe 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.690
 which has been dynamically building a new graphic arts industry since 2000 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.370
 and then there's the big unknown against everybody 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.650
 with a huge potential that only unfolds gradually 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.360
 1875 finals with in the evening again 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.009
 in the old building 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:12.980
 is still today 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.980
 the the procedures 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.740
 the company still gives the machine parts itself 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.740
 like in the old days 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.020
 the region here was very poor 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.920
 of sands and affected so also family Volvos a son of the family 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.760
 had to 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.850
 Klaus is opposite the city of Lingen 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.460
 wherever a mechanical engineering company in Kentucky learns in the USA 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.439
 and as far as we know has been persuaded by a similar machine 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.200
 back to Westphalia 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200
 another production facility for machinery 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.539
 Today the machines are so hard to build 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.539
 that only a few ferryman ever can 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.340
 the company has developed its own patents 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.720
 this machine helps to be even more effective 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.670
 The employee can see what goes where through a screen 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.699
 now only one screw may be in the wrong place 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.799
 can break a huge bookbinding machine 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.869
 and that would cost money and time in production 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.369
 After all, you have to go up to fine Scammer 5 for such a book street 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.369
 Million francs numbers 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.049
 that's how it will sell 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.109
 The company has found a new market niche 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.559
 through the Internet 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:48.869
 20 percent of their sales make them the digital photo Big Joe with machines 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:52.179
 tie 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:54.190
 they look just like the others 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.190
 but create completely new perspectives for the company 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.840
 Just imagine that the user a positive development of 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:02.829
 Have forests 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.949
 that will have the few billion more people with their digital camera 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:11.809
 we do not hope to document a pleasant life and then get in shape 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.849
 of photo books 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.059
 this house will have been working for the next 30 years 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:20.890
 but what takes months 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.289
 until the machine is finished 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:25.859
 it can be delivered
