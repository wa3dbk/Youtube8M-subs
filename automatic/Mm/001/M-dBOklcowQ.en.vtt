00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
thing about the new Amla legend relaxer

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.840 
thing about the new Amla legend relaxer
is<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.270> fact<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:28.080> do<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.460> mix

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
is the fact that you do not have to mix

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.990 
is the fact that you do not have to mix
the<00:01:31.100> relaxer<00:01:32.100> together<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.700> don't<00:01:32.850> have

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the relaxer together so you don't have

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.069 
the relaxer together so you don't have
to<00:01:33.119> mix<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.509> think<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.810> called<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
to mix it I think it's called the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.530 
to mix it I think it's called the
applicator<00:01:34.799> or<00:01:35.250> whatever<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> liquid<00:01:36.420> is

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
applicator or whatever the liquid is

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.999 
applicator or whatever the liquid is
that<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> mix<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> cream<00:01:37.710> you

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
that you have to mix with the cream you

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.310 
that you have to mix with the cream you
don't<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.210> anymore<00:01:39.479> which<00:01:39.990> is

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
don't have to do that anymore which is

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.289 
don't have to do that anymore which is
the<00:01:40.680> coq10<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.430> amazing<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.090> they

I<00:01:45.000> always<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:46.170> triple<00:01:47.009> checking<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
I always was triple checking that to

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.700 
I always was triple checking that to
make<00:01:48.149> sure<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.780> didn't<00:01:49.140> mix<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> wrong

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
make sure that I didn't mix the wrong

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
make sure that I didn't mix the wrong
thing<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.220> there<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> mixed<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
thing in there and then I mixed the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.200 
thing in there and then I mixed the
cream<00:01:52.020> forever<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> we<00:01:53.909> know<00:01:54.060> was

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
cream forever because I we know was

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.940 
cream forever because I we know was
afraid<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.780> didn't<00:01:55.079> mix<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.439> enough<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
afraid that I didn't mix it enough and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.390 
afraid that I didn't mix it enough and
it

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
it

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.910 
it
that's<00:01:56.580> a<00:01:56.730> relaxer<00:01:57.330> so<00:01:57.600> not<00:01:58.320> having<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:58.740> worry

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that's a relaxer so not having to worry

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.230 
that's a relaxer so not having to worry
about<00:01:59.190> that<00:01:59.400> that<00:02:00.770> saves<00:02:01.770> me<00:02:02.460> loads<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.030> time

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240

and<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:04.050> really<00:02:04.410> appreciate<00:02:05.010> it<00:02:05.220> not<00:02:05.550> having<00:02:05.730> to

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and I really appreciate it not having to

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.880 
and I really appreciate it not having to
