00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
war if I was to be using it one target

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.310 
war if I was to be using it one target
at<00:04:01.829> a<00:04:01.859> time<00:04:02.160> not<00:04:02.430> multiple<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:03.090> one<00:04:03.320> causes

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
at a time not multiple just one causes

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.470 
at a time not multiple just one causes
all<00:04:04.530> damage<00:04:04.950> taken<00:04:05.190> by<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.519> target<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.299> be

all damage taken by that target to be

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.900 
all damage taken by that target to be
taken<00:04:06.900> as<00:04:07.079> mini<00:04:07.440> crits<00:04:07.709> there's<00:04:08.430> also<00:04:08.670> a

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
taken as mini crits there's also a

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.660

very good timing with how to work in the
critic<00:04:30.750> cola<00:04:30.960> with<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.680> soda<00:04:31.890> popper<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.640> have

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
critic cola with the soda popper to have

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.880 
critic cola with the soda popper to have
an<00:04:33.030> overlap<00:04:33.660> at<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:33.960> maximum<00:04:34.500> potential

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
an overlap at the maximum potential

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.970 
an overlap at the maximum potential
that's<00:04:35.670> some<00:04:35.850> pretty<00:04:36.060> strong<00:04:36.600> or<00:04:36.930> deep<00:04:37.200> team

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
that's some pretty strong or deep team

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
it's interesting you really got to pay

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.500 
it's interesting you really got to pay
attention<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:46.740> where<00:04:47.670> you're<00:04:47.700> at<00:04:48.030> on<00:04:48.180> your

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
attention to where you're at on your

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.780 
attention to where you're at on your
heads<00:04:48.720> up<00:04:48.840> display<00:04:49.200> and<00:04:49.470> be<00:04:50.370> aware<00:04:50.610> your

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
heads up display and be aware your

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.670 
heads up display and be aware your
surroundings<00:04:51.360> what<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.140> can<00:04:52.290> handle<00:04:52.500> what

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
surroundings what you can handle what

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.550 
surroundings what you can handle what
you<00:04:52.800> can't<00:04:52.890> so<00:04:53.820> I<00:04:54.090> guess<00:04:54.360> it's<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.900> interesting

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
you can't so I guess it's a interesting

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.490 
you can't so I guess it's a interesting
loadout<00:04:56.070> really<00:04:56.760> is<00:04:56.940> I<00:04:57.180> wouldn't<00:04:57.810> suggest<00:04:58.020> it

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
loadout really is I wouldn't suggest it

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.710 
loadout really is I wouldn't suggest it
but<00:04:58.890> you<00:04:59.280> can<00:04:59.430> try<00:04:59.580> it<00:04:59.640> one<00:05:00.270> thing<00:05:00.420> a<00:05:00.510> lot<00:05:00.600> of

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
but you can try it one thing a lot of

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.060 
but you can try it one thing a lot of
people<00:05:00.960> don't<00:05:01.200> know<00:05:01.350> about<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.650> fan<00:05:01.830> of<00:05:01.950> war
