students to one teacher the ratio so I'm

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.500

and<00:01:35.680> as<00:01:35.950> I've<00:01:36.100> said<00:01:36.310> before<00:01:36.369> it's<00:01:36.910> all<00:01:37.240> about

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
and as I've said before it's all about

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.170 
and as I've said before it's all about
balance<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.350> I<00:01:39.130> think<00:01:39.460> that's<00:01:39.640> what<00:01:39.790> makes<00:01:40.030> it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
balance and I think that's what makes it

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.660 
balance and I think that's what makes it
a<00:01:40.300> core<00:01:40.479> school<00:01:40.780> tick<00:01:41.229> it's<00:01:41.590> different<00:01:42.190> first

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
a core school tick it's different first
