gene<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.250> look<00:00:17.400> for<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.029> genes<00:00:18.240> I'm

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
gene to look for the genes I'm

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:28.310 
gene to look for the genes I'm
interested<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:23.180> okay<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.359> find<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.779> easily<00:00:27.320> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
interested in okay we find it easily and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.200 
interested in okay we find it easily and
now<00:00:28.439> inside<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.039> transgene<00:00:29.490> I'm<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.910> to

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
now inside the transgene I'm going to

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.660 
now inside the transgene I'm going to
find<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:32.009> protein<00:00:32.610> ID<00:00:33.440> just<00:00:34.440> scroll<00:00:35.070> down<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
find that protein ID just scroll down a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.590 
find that protein ID just scroll down a
little<00:00:35.790> bit

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.470 

there<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.899> press<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.450> protein<00:00:44.480> then

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
there it is press on the protein then

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.229 
there it is press on the protein then
you<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.750> see<00:00:45.930> all<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.370> protein<00:00:47.370> data<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.000> we

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
you can see all the protein data but we

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.420 
you can see all the protein data but we
just<00:00:48.450> need<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> sequence<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.920> faster

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
just need the sequence so it's faster

00:00:50.430 --> 00:01:00.369 
just need the sequence so it's faster
and<00:00:51.079> copy<00:00:52.079> all<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.829> protein<00:00:53.489> sequence<00:00:58.190> nice

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
and copy all the protein sequence nice

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.929 
and copy all the protein sequence nice
now<00:01:01.379> you're<00:01:01.530> opening<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.250> new<00:01:02.520> tab<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:04.939> looking

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
now you're opening a new tab and looking

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:17.780 
now you're opening a new tab and looking
for<00:01:07.250> NCBI<00:01:08.250> blast<00:01:14.930> in<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.170> blast<00:01:16.470> website<00:01:17.100> I'm

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
for NCBI blast in the blast website I'm

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.090 
for NCBI blast in the blast website I'm
going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.780> use<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.590> protein<00:01:20.310> blast<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:25.100> paste

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
going to use the protein blast and paste

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.980 
going to use the protein blast and paste
the<00:01:26.820> sequence<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.840> copied<00:01:28.170> before<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.890> choose

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
the sequence I copied before and choose

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.300 
the sequence I copied before and choose

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.590 
the tillow plot in the organism to look
for<00:01:37.820> okay<00:01:38.820> hit<00:01:39.119> last<00:01:40.490> now<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.360> wait

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
for okay hit last now we have to wait

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.160 
for okay hit last now we have to wait
few<00:01:43.380> minutes<00:01:43.829> until<00:01:44.490> their<00:01:45.149> blood<00:01:45.509> finishes

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
few minutes until their blood finishes

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:57.679 
few minutes until their blood finishes
searches

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.820 

okay<00:01:58.689> now<00:01:59.259> scroll<00:01:59.650> down<00:02:01.470> through<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.619> long

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
okay now scroll down through the long

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.779 
okay now scroll down through the long
list<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.400> their<00:02:03.640> blood<00:02:03.939> hit<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:09.399> let's<00:02:09.580> look

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
list of their blood hit and let's look

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.240 
list of their blood hit and let's look
for<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.239> first<00:02:10.810> protein<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:11.739> cleave<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.040> plot

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
for the first protein and cleave a plot

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:20.790 
for the first protein and cleave a plot
that<00:02:12.489> might<00:02:13.270> be<00:02:13.600> Auto<00:02:13.810> log<00:02:14.110> -<00:02:14.350> human<00:02:14.680> gene<00:02:19.800> okay

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
that might be Auto log - human gene okay

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.660 
that might be Auto log - human gene okay
let's<00:02:21.040> see<00:02:21.250> if<00:02:21.370> we<00:02:21.520> can<00:02:21.730> find<00:02:22.239> it<00:02:22.510> in<00:02:22.810> our<00:02:23.670> new

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
let's see if we can find it in our new

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.340 
let's see if we can find it in our new
blood<00:02:24.970> search<00:02:26.250> against<00:02:27.250> human<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:29.080> can<00:02:29.200> see

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
blood search against human you can see

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.320 
blood search against human you can see
we<00:02:29.500> added<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.890> shortcut<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.580> there<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.269> the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
we added a shortcut in there to the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.780 
we added a shortcut in there to the
right<00:02:31.510> as<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.350> can<00:02:32.530> press<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.580> press

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
right as you can press this and press

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.670 
right as you can press this and press
just<00:02:34.120> press<00:02:34.540> run<00:02:35.080> blast<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.170> organism

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
just press run blast and in the organism

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.170 
just press run blast and in the organism
field<00:02:41.980> we<00:02:42.220> still<00:02:42.550> now<00:02:42.730> form<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.180> step<00:02:43.420> in<00:02:48.180> need

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
field we still now form a step in need

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:58.770 
field we still now form a step in need
but<00:02:49.420> again<00:02:51.090> let's<00:02:52.090> wait<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.360> few<00:02:52.660> minutes<00:02:57.780> need

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
but again let's wait a few minutes need

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.809 
but again let's wait a few minutes need
to<00:02:58.900> consider<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.470> protein<00:02:59.950> in<00:03:00.069> only<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> second

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
to consider a protein in only the second

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:07.289 
to consider a protein in only the second
one<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:04.440> talked<00:03:05.440> about<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.890> in<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.220> in<00:03:06.370> our<00:03:06.579> next

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299
