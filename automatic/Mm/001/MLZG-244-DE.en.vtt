00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.720
 Jo hello people welcome to 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.330
 my very first video on the channel 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:16.020
 assess and yes I am one 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.550
 photographer's small camera and yes me 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.320
 have recently for my seven 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.859
 months new lens granted that here 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.529
 from tamron 1 18 to 200 millimeters 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.000
 Objectively I say so bought 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.309
 because it can read so well here 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.670
 It has a very good autofocus 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.530
 Camera on macro use goes 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.899
 but not as good as I am going to one 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.489
 few example pictures show but for 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.760
 the market for recordings is smaller 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.100
 In any case, yes and has one more 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.809
 small loco bar is there for when 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.980
 I it would have in here then that would 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.670
 Here in the chamber in there 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.789
 that would be so easy 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.890
 go out 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.550
 that's pretty easy, especially 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.870
 there are many lenses in here 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.460
 and the press that all the time 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.050
 Of course, then he is telling himself 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.790
 below 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.590
 that's why we had this blog switch 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.390
 then it does not happen 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.950
 at the beginning quite annoying with the still lures 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.690
 switches are not needed, yes, but also 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.950
 so it's a relative one 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.870
 fast autofocus here manual focus 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.760
 Manual focus ring is here in front 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.660
 By the way, he is mechanically sealed off 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.100
 So not by engine as well as that can 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.640
 Objective probably now had on it 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.290
 By the way, 18 55 kit lens is quite 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.610
 good for filming like I already have 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:43.140
 see and jo mechanically april this means 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.000
 if you're focusing on autofocus now 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.330
 that I do not move the ring here 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.490
 can 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.650
 there will only be moved if it is 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.870
 if you have to grow new ones 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.610
 Can I stand this normal and 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.060
 even if I do not harm the camera 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.630
 I could theoretically do this objectively 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.130
 as by glass use so save power 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.810
 is writing then makes 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.980
 probably not, I've 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.500
 a few times it becomes very convenient 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.780
 I visited the bikers at the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.770
 But the film is objective 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.290
 of course, only fifties I focal 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.270
 I'll probably do it objectively 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.890
 now he always has it on the 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:29.400
 camera because it's a very good thing 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.720
 is just for the people who stop sooner 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.830
 nature photographers are the stop 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.490
 the objective much better 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.970
 image stabilizer is incidentally also 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.860
 here 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.140
 vc that is operation compensation of 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.820
 tamron is developing very very good 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.950
 image stabilizer 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.630
 So I have at the next 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.090
 made side photos 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.430
 I would never have done that with one 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.200
 others said there is certainly still 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.300
 but have a good image stabilizer 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.360
 which is really far more to the 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.740
 distance the best meant camera I have 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.930
 can not do any wild with it 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.240
 First, no optical image stabilizer 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.840
 but only digital digital 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.980
 Image stabilizer means that the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.600
 picture is cropped 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.180
 in a certain radius and the 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.730
 Camera then about the movements of the picture 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.760
 Of course, this also compensates 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:34.300
 a little bit of breath but you had to 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:38.640
 not to have an objective for the 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.640
 canon dfs at the end 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.550
 focus on manual focus because of me 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.500
 now slowly going on here I find the 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.209
 Do not ring so I'll show you now 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.530
 a few example pictures i made 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.180
 have now that I have now been 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.160
 saturday the lens today is monday 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.780
 pretty enthusiastic so far and yes me 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.519
 will you now times compared one hears 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.110
 the outside focus of the lens is not 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.239
 I 'll make a few movies 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:15.239
 with this objective here I will turn 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:16.260
 hang on and then see you right away 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.329
 again, now I have that 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.459
 objective then fantas as we see 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.389
 and we can hear I do not know if 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:27.150
 it is loud but usually should 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.930
 he a bit I hear so 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.270
 sometimes quite ran just once on 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.930
 Something I have full focal length 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.889
 now I can go here yes times and the 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.889
 leave here to focus 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.870
 By the way, the autofocus is very very much 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.110
 accurate for video footage on everyone 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.419
 case suitable but I have to say 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.450
 at autofocus I'm a few 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.190
 things are not so sure and that's what 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.500
 That's when I'm here here 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.289
 Rear photographer photographed focused 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.400
 on the tree 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.400
 there goes sometimes in the other direction 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:10.080
 so that's part of the team 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.020
 Full focal cameras actually only 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.669
 renounce forgive forgive 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.409
 it is undecided that something 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.449
 you have to decide if you are 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.469
 the objective you initially but as for 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.520
 the roundabouts 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.900
 First of all, it is actually quite good 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.639
 focus so that can actually 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.279
 always it was now creates sets 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.919
 should or should not do it here 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.529
 Zoom out a bit again 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.110
 maybe she's the sharp one 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:40.710
 could judge from the objective if 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.120
 I now talk later I focused 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.229
 make the video a bit lighter 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.509
 It's nothing at all, that's it 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.729
 really top and especially people if 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:55.889
 you think about it right now 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:58.860
 to buy the camera with the super now 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.449
 the pictures could do you everywhere 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.650
 can take with you everywhere buy 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.870
 Definitely a first month because 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.449
 the middle class can do that and if 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.189
 I'm the best for the road and the 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.509
 of course have very very internet 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:15.060
 criticism we can see 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:20.759
 an example then we had too 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.599
 Well seen and I hope you have that 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.819
 video liked 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:30.860
 By the way, that was objectively too 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:35.930
 so ne says pose 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:40.319
 Damn my hand does not say manual 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:46.289
 not actively dining here 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:49.680
 these these these thesis dazzle those 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:51.899
 protection adventure lens hood is 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.060
 now the sun visor doing it 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:55.710
 not everywhere I am on everyone 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.529
 cool case this is it is the has here 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.310
 even in here is your truck has 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:00.719
 you probably see that now 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:04.529
 pretty bad you can see it 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:06.240
 I do not think it's light 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:09.409
 that there are lens spots gives lenses 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.409
 marks means 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:17.099
 if you make a picture but from above 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:19.650
 then you have mostly lenses 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:23.460
 stains drinne the city from the Sun 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.409
 as if the sunbeams should be so 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.729
 is sometimes quite undesirable because of that 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:28.680
 is there a lens hood the 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:31.229
 sprinkle the light a bit so that 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.150
 it's not on the sensor chip so that 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:34.770
 it was also from my first video 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.629
 i hope i like it soon i will 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.029
 by the way, also an additional microphone 

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:40.979
 has this camera so I have a better one 

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:42.569
 I have microphone quality because I have to 

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:45.870
 always watch out that I'm in the microphone 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:47.430
 talk talk and therefore then 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.939
 Thank you for watching it 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.939
 next time bye
