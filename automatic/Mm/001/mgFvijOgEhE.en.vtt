00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hello youtube this is the backflow

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.840 
hello youtube this is the backflow
master<00:00:02.669> with<00:00:03.240> part<00:00:03.629> three<00:00:04.110> in<00:00:04.380> how<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.100> make<00:00:05.580> a

fully<00:00:06.690> functional<00:00:07.319> -<00:00:07.589> bye<00:00:07.740> -<00:00:07.799> bye<00:00:08.130> for<00:00:08.490> now<00:00:09.080> you

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
fully functional - bye - bye for now you

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.189 
fully functional - bye - bye for now you
should<00:00:10.530> have<00:00:10.800> made<00:00:12.049> eight<00:00:13.370> corner<00:00:14.370> pieces<00:00:14.580> and

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
should have made eight corner pieces and

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.980 
should have made eight corner pieces and
eight<00:00:16.199> edges<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.730> next<00:00:18.060> step<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.600> assemble

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
eight edges the next step is to assemble

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.970 
eight edges the next step is to assemble
it<00:00:19.430> so<00:00:20.720> assembling<00:00:22.460> you<00:00:23.460> need<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:24.980> you

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
it so assembling you need to have you

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.650 
it so assembling you need to have you
know<00:00:27.019> four<00:00:28.019> corner<00:00:28.980> pieces<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.460> top<00:00:29.699> four

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
know four corner pieces on top four

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.690 
know four corner pieces on top four
corner<00:00:30.990> pieces<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.160> bottom<00:00:32.489> and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
corner pieces on but on the bottom and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.790 
corner pieces on but on the bottom and
the<00:00:33.300> edges<00:00:33.690> filling<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:35.730> sides<00:00:38.870> so<00:00:39.870> what

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the edges filling then the sides so what

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.030 
the edges filling then the sides so what
I<00:00:40.829> did<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.250> assemble<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.180> unscrewed<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
I did to assemble is I unscrewed one of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.400 
I did to assemble is I unscrewed one of
the<00:00:44.160> center<00:00:44.489> pieces<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.690> could<00:00:46.020> fit<00:00:46.260> in

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the center pieces so that I could fit in

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.520 
the center pieces so that I could fit in
the<00:00:46.950> edge<00:00:47.160> pieces<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.870> yeah<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.350> if<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
the edge pieces so yeah so if you

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.010 
the edge pieces so yeah so if you
unscrew<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.399> centerpiece<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.239> fit<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
unscrew or centerpiece you can fit the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.439 
unscrew or centerpiece you can fit the
pieces<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.829> assemble<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.449> okay

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
pieces in so now just assemble it okay

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.270 
pieces in so now just assemble it okay
so<00:00:57.510> now<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.050> should<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:58.680> two<00:00:59.070> by<00:00:59.219> two

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
so now you should have your two by two

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.240 
so now you should have your two by two
by<00:00:59.579> four<00:00:59.820> assembled<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.289> after<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> have

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
by four assembled and after you have

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.270 
by four assembled and after you have
assembled<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:03.030> um<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.519> turn<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:07.500> when

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
assembled it um you can turn it but when

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.910 
assembled it um you can turn it but when
you're<00:01:08.460> turning<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.360> halves<00:01:09.689> only<00:01:10.500> turn<00:01:10.740> it

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you're turning it in halves only turn it

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.200 
you're turning it in halves only turn it
twice<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:12.420> was<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.960> accidentally<00:01:14.210> rambled

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
twice it was like I accidentally rambled

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.840 
twice it was like I accidentally rambled
it<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.770> usually<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:17.009> there's<00:01:17.280> no<00:01:17.430> stickers

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
it and usually when there's no stickers

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.240 
it and usually when there's no stickers
on<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:19.140> bad<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.680> scramble<00:01:20.189> it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
on it it's not bad if you scramble it

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.149 
on it it's not bad if you scramble it
but<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.689> will<00:01:21.960> not<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.860> help<00:01:23.070> you

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
but then you will not have a to help you

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.980 
but then you will not have a to help you
buy<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.970> piece<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.390> will<00:01:24.689> be<00:01:24.840> all

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
buy for the piece that will be all

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.870 
buy for the piece that will be all
scrambled<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:26.700> when<00:01:27.119> you're<00:01:28.520> just<00:01:29.520> turning

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
scrambled so when you're just turning

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.270 
scrambled so when you're just turning
the<00:01:29.939> middle<00:01:30.180> layer<00:01:30.380> turn<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> twice<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
the middle layer turn it twice and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.520 
the middle layer turn it twice and
you'll<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.790> fine<00:01:33.380> as<00:01:34.380> long<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.090> turn

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
you'll be fine as long as you can turn

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.280 
you'll be fine as long as you can turn
four<00:01:37.530> layers<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.509> four<00:01:39.509> sides<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.110> you're

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
four layers on four sides and you're

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.969 
four layers on four sides and you're
fine

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
fine

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.620 
fine
so<00:01:42.920> my<00:01:43.920> huge<00:01:44.399> isn't<00:01:44.759> turning<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.329> well

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
so my huge isn't turning that well

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.460 
so my huge isn't turning that well
especially<00:01:46.079> these<00:01:46.500> metal<00:01:47.460> layers<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.479> it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
especially these metal layers so it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.639 
especially these metal layers so it
definitely<00:01:49.740> needs<00:01:50.220> some<00:01:50.340> motivation<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.689> you

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
definitely needs some motivation so you

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.560 
definitely needs some motivation so you
should<00:01:52.829> lubricate<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.549> I'm<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.479> be

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
should lubricate it I'm going to be

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.990 
should lubricate it I'm going to be
using<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.020> cheetah<00:01:55.259> loop<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:58.670> lubricating<00:01:59.670> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
using a cheetah loop so lubricating you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.980 
using a cheetah loop so lubricating you
basically<00:02:00.420> want<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:01.820> get<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:03.090> crack

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
basically want to get a little crack

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.160 
basically want to get a little crack
there<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> middle<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.869> can't

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
there in the middle and if you can't

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.830 
there in the middle and if you can't
then<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.469> could<00:02:08.099> open<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.030> spray<00:02:09.720> it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
then you could open it up and spray it

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.800 
then you could open it up and spray it
in<00:02:09.959> there

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
in there

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.720 
in there

make<00:05:55.320> it<00:05:55.380> a<00:05:55.650> little<00:05:55.919> smaller<00:05:56.910> so<00:05:57.330> once<00:05:58.230> you

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
make it a little smaller so once you

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.920 
make it a little smaller so once you
have<00:05:58.470> your<00:05:58.620> drawing<00:05:58.890> laid<00:05:59.190> out<00:05:59.370> I<00:05:59.640> made<00:06:00.360> it<00:06:00.540> 2

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
have your drawing laid out I made it 2

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.110 
have your drawing laid out I made it 2
millimeters<00:06:01.620> smaller<00:06:02.540> than<00:06:03.980> 3<00:06:05.120> centimeters

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
millimeters smaller than 3 centimeters

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.450 
millimeters smaller than 3 centimeters
by<00:06:06.690> 3<00:06:06.900> centimeters<00:06:07.350> so<00:06:07.530> it's<00:06:07.680> now<00:06:07.830> two<00:06:07.890> point

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
by 3 centimeters so it's now two point

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.180 
by 3 centimeters so it's now two point
nine<00:06:08.700> centimeters<00:06:09.330> by<00:06:09.510> two<00:06:09.570> point<00:06:10.020> nine<00:06:10.200> seven

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
nine centimeters by two point nine seven

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.070 
nine centimeters by two point nine seven
so<00:06:12.190> that<00:06:12.550> should<00:06:12.850> be<00:06:12.880> a<00:06:13.000> good<00:06:13.210> measurement<00:06:13.630> if

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
so that should be a good measurement if

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.540 
so that should be a good measurement if
you're<00:06:14.350> using<00:06:14.530> a<00:06:14.800> rubix<00:06:15.490> for<00:06:15.880> back<00:06:16.030> on<00:06:17.070> so<00:06:18.070> now

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
you're using a rubix for back on so now

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.100 
you're using a rubix for back on so now
what<00:06:18.760> you<00:06:18.880> want<00:06:19.060> to<00:06:19.150> do<00:06:19.270> is<00:06:19.419> you<00:06:19.660> just<00:06:19.690> want<00:06:19.930> to

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
what you want to do is you just want to

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.070 
what you want to do is you just want to
cut<00:06:20.350> along<00:06:20.470> this<00:06:20.889> line<00:06:21.630> so<00:06:22.630> now<00:06:22.810> you<00:06:22.870> should

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
cut along this line so now you should

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.590 
cut along this line so now you should
have<00:06:23.110> your<00:06:23.350> guideline<00:06:24.040> for<00:06:24.820> what<00:06:25.030> your

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
have your guideline for what your

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.780 
have your guideline for what your
sticker<00:06:26.139> will<00:06:26.410> be<00:06:27.750> um<00:06:28.750> for<00:06:29.290> the<00:06:29.380> top<00:06:29.650> layer

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.570 

it's<00:06:33.790> pretty<00:06:34.120> good<00:06:34.330> size<00:06:35.160> might<00:06:36.160> be<00:06:36.340> a<00:06:36.370> little

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
it's pretty good size might be a little

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.230 
it's pretty good size might be a little
big<00:06:36.880> but<00:06:37.210> I<00:06:37.710> think<00:06:38.710> that'll<00:06:38.919> work<00:06:39.130> so<00:06:39.940> now<00:06:40.090> you

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
big but I think that'll work so now you

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.659 
big but I think that'll work so now you
want<00:06:40.419> to<00:06:40.480> do<00:06:40.630> the<00:06:40.750> same<00:06:41.080> thing<00:06:41.410> for<00:06:42.190> this<00:06:42.340> one

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
a 1 by 2 guideline what you can do is

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.990 
a 1 by 2 guideline what you can do is
you<00:07:01.480> could<00:07:01.780> just<00:07:01.840> cut<00:07:02.680> this<00:07:02.890> in<00:07:02.950> half<00:07:03.130> but<00:07:03.640> I'm

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 
you could just cut this in half but I'm

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.180 
you could just cut this in half but I'm
just<00:07:04.330> going<00:07:04.570> to<00:07:04.660> measure<00:07:04.900> this<00:07:05.200> and<00:07:05.530> make<00:07:06.160> sure

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
just going to measure this and make sure

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.550 
just going to measure this and make sure
it's<00:07:06.370> the<00:07:06.640> right<00:07:06.760> size

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
it's the right size

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.260 
it's the right size
alright<00:07:08.560> so<00:07:08.770> now<00:07:08.919> you<00:07:09.220> have<00:07:09.639> your<00:07:10.560> 4<00:07:11.560> and<00:07:12.270> just

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270 
alright so now you have your 4 and just

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.880 
alright so now you have your 4 and just
have<00:07:13.479> the<00:07:13.750> 2x2<00:07:14.350> outline<00:07:14.860> and<00:07:16.500> the<00:07:17.500> 1<00:07:17.680> by<00:07:17.860> 2

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:17.890 
have the 2x2 outline and the 1 by 2

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.469 
have the 2x2 outline and the 1 by 2
outline<00:07:18.900> now<00:07:19.900> it<00:07:20.110> should<00:07:20.350> be<00:07:20.500> about<00:07:21.120> 1/2<00:07:22.120> a

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 
outline now it should be about 1/2 a

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:25.440 
outline now it should be about 1/2 a
little<00:07:22.720> actually<00:07:23.590> less<00:07:23.919> than<00:07:24.160> 1/2<00:07:24.450> listen

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.450 
little actually less than 1/2 listen

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:31.670 
little actually less than 1/2 listen
half<00:07:25.630> it<00:07:25.780> was<00:07:25.870> a<00:07:25.900> good<00:07:26.110> fit<00:07:26.440> and<00:07:27.930> what<00:07:28.930> I<00:07:28.990> did<00:07:29.260> is

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:38.640 

for<00:07:32.680> this<00:07:32.860> one<00:07:33.130> it<00:07:33.460> was<00:07:35.100> 2.9<00:07:37.020> or<00:07:38.020> a<00:07:38.050> two<00:07:38.380> point

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:38.650 
for this one it was 2.9 or a two point

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:48.270 
for this one it was 2.9 or a two point
eight<00:07:39.900> centimeters<00:07:42.000> by<00:07:44.310> 1.3<00:07:45.310> centimeters<00:07:47.280> yes

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 
eight centimeters by 1.3 centimeters yes

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.960 
eight centimeters by 1.3 centimeters yes
so<00:07:48.580> that's<00:07:48.850> a<00:07:49.180> pretty<00:07:49.450> good<00:07:49.690> size<00:07:50.520> so<00:07:51.520> you<00:07:51.580> will

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:51.970 
so that's a pretty good size so you will

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.529 
so that's a pretty good size so you will
use<00:07:52.240> these<00:07:52.510> to<00:07:52.900> make<00:07:52.930> your<00:07:54.120> stickers<00:07:55.120> and

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:55.539
