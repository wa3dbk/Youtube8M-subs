00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
itself X it feels like a rock in terms

see right here but you'll notice that

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.110 
see right here but you'll notice that
that<00:03:04.290> came<00:03:04.650> up<00:03:04.739> pretty<00:03:05.189> simple<00:03:05.549> because<00:03:05.730> I

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
that came up pretty simple because I

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.209 
that came up pretty simple because I
found<00:03:06.689> that<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.290> tolerance<00:03:07.590> here<00:03:08.040> at<00:03:08.129> the

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
found that the tolerance here at the

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.240 
found that the tolerance here at the
wrist<00:03:08.370> joint<00:03:08.519> is<00:03:08.699> pretty<00:03:09.150> weak<00:03:09.419> and<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.980> can't

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
wrist joint is pretty weak and it can't

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.280 
wrist joint is pretty weak and it can't
really<00:03:11.370> support<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:11.879> much<00:03:12.030> weight<00:03:12.299> the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
really support that much weight the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.339 
really support that much weight the
torso<00:03:14.040> has<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.310> single<00:03:14.909> way<00:03:15.359> swivel<00:03:15.780> that's<00:03:15.989> it

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
torso has a single way swivel that's it

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.659 
torso has a single way swivel that's it
there's<00:03:16.560> no<00:03:16.709> AB<00:03:16.889> crunch<00:03:17.219> there's<00:03:17.549> no

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
there's no AB crunch there's no

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.249 
there's no AB crunch there's no
side-to-side<00:03:18.060> it's<00:03:18.449> just<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.689> waist<00:03:18.900> oval<00:03:19.169> so

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:19.259 
side-to-side it's just a waist oval so

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:21.439 
side-to-side it's just a waist oval so
that's<00:03:19.409> a<00:03:19.530> little<00:03:19.859> disappointing<00:03:20.310> in<00:03:20.819> my

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
that's a little disappointing in my

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.249 
that's a little disappointing in my
opinion<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.829> hips<00:03:23.040> are<00:03:23.250> connected<00:03:23.699> on<00:03:23.849> a

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:24.259 
opinion the hips are connected on a

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:26.929 
opinion the hips are connected on a
straight<00:03:25.259> rod<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.680> goes<00:03:25.709> through<00:03:25.939> the

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
straight rod that goes through the

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.449 
straight rod that goes through the
crotch<00:03:27.569> so<00:03:27.599> they<00:03:27.989> can<00:03:28.169> go<00:03:28.259> up<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:28.680> down

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
crotch so they can go up in down

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.170 
crotch so they can go up in down
together<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.829> hips<00:03:32.009> themselves<00:03:32.459> have<00:03:32.639> a<00:03:32.849> good

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
together the hips themselves have a good

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.729 
together the hips themselves have a good
forward<00:03:34.049> movement<00:03:34.379> and<00:03:34.470> you'll<00:03:34.560> notice

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
forward movement and you'll notice

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.409 
forward movement and you'll notice
there's<00:03:35.009> independent<00:03:35.549> skirts<00:03:35.819> that<00:03:35.939> go<00:03:36.150> and

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
there's independent skirts that go and

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.929 
there's independent skirts that go and
get<00:03:36.659> out<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.900> way<00:03:37.019> but<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.009> side<00:03:38.400> movement

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 
get out of the way but the side movement

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.960 
get out of the way but the side movement
is<00:03:39.090> limited<00:03:39.509> to<00:03:39.629> about<00:03:39.720> 5<00:03:39.989> 9<00:03:40.500> 45<00:03:41.189> degrees<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:41.759> I

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
is limited to about 5 9 45 degrees so I

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.030 
is limited to about 5 9 45 degrees so I
wish<00:03:42.659> income<00:03:43.019> it<00:03:43.259> could<00:03:43.530> come<00:03:43.680> out<00:03:43.769> all<00:03:43.949> the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
wish income it could come out all the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.979 
wish income it could come out all the
way<00:03:44.129> but<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.400> can't<00:03:44.639> little<00:03:45.479> disappointing

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
way but it can't little disappointing

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.449 
way but it can't little disappointing
there's<00:03:46.169> a<00:03:46.229> thigh<00:03:46.470> swivel<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:47.040> only<00:03:47.220> problem

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
there's a thigh swivel the only problem

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.309 
there's a thigh swivel the only problem
of<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.579> thigh<00:03:47.759> swivel<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.329> that<00:03:48.509> because<00:03:49.199> the

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
of the thigh swivel is that because the

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.920 
of the thigh swivel is that because the
armor<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.799> molded<00:03:50.159> around<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.939> the<00:03:51.569> circle

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
armor is molded around the the circle

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.539 
armor is molded around the the circle
circular<00:03:52.319> hip<00:03:52.680> when<00:03:52.889> you<00:03:52.979> use<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.370> thigh

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
circular hip when you use the thigh

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.629 
circular hip when you use the thigh
swivel<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.269> kind<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.930> loosens<00:03:55.739> up<00:03:55.889> and<00:03:56.099> moves

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
swivel it kind of loosens up and moves

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.249 
swivel it kind of loosens up and moves
down<00:03:56.909> a<00:03:56.939> little<00:03:57.180> bit<00:03:57.329> just<00:03:57.569> to<00:03:57.659> get<00:03:57.840> around<00:03:58.109> it

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:58.259 
down a little bit just to get around it

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:59.780 
down a little bit just to get around it
so<00:03:58.409> that<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.590> don't<00:03:58.709> know<00:03:58.919> why<00:03:59.129> that<00:03:59.459> happens

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
so that I don't know why that happens

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.390 
so that I don't know why that happens
but<00:03:59.879> it<00:04:00.060> does<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:01.349> back<00:04:01.500> skirts<00:04:01.769> cannot<00:04:02.219> move

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
but it does the back skirts cannot move

but it does the back skirts cannot move

pretty<00:04:30.910> decent<00:04:31.330> articulation<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.230> do<00:04:32.590> wish

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
pretty decent articulation I do wish

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.460 
pretty decent articulation I do wish
there<00:04:33.130> was<00:04:33.280> more<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.760> do<00:04:33.910> within<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.990> torso

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
there was more to do within the torso

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.820 
there was more to do within the torso
and<00:04:35.820> I<00:04:36.820> do<00:04:36.880> wish<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.510> hips<00:04:38.170> could<00:04:38.440> go<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.560> little

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
and I do wish the hips could go a little

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.280 
and I do wish the hips could go a little
bit<00:04:39.010> more<00:04:39.160> but<00:04:39.400> so<00:04:39.670> far<00:04:39.910> it's<00:04:40.210> pretty<00:04:40.330> decent<00:04:41.080> I

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
bit more but so far it's pretty decent I

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.840 
bit more but so far it's pretty decent I
think<00:04:41.950> the<00:04:42.040> most<00:04:42.160> surprising<00:04:42.280> thing<00:04:42.820> about

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
think the most surprising thing about

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.200 
think the most surprising thing about
this<00:04:43.240> kit<00:04:43.450> is<00:04:43.480> just<00:04:43.870> its<00:04:44.080> sheer<00:04:44.440> solidity<00:04:45.340> and

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
this kit is just its sheer solidity and
