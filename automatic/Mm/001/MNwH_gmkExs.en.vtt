number 56 drill a zero eighty plug tap

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.720 
number 56 drill a zero eighty plug tap
it's<00:00:35.780> got<00:00:36.019> a<00:00:36.050> couple<00:00:36.350> of<00:00:36.590> tapered<00:00:37.220> threads<00:00:37.250> on

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
it's got a couple of tapered threads on

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.310 
it's got a couple of tapered threads on
it<00:00:39.040> the<00:00:40.040> homemade<00:00:40.399> punch<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:41.540> a<00:00:42.440> ride<00:00:42.620> mount

it the homemade punch and a ride mount

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.780 
it the homemade punch and a ride mount
so<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.469> first<00:00:45.680> thing<00:00:45.890> I'm<00:00:46.040> going<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:46.250> do<00:00:46.460> is

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
so the first thing I'm going to do is

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.240 
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm<00:00:47.329> going<00:00:47.360> to<00:00:47.540> put<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:49.390> key<00:00:50.390> in<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.809> vise<00:00:51.250> so

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
I'm going to put the key in the vise so

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.540 
I'm going to put the key in the vise so
it<00:00:52.430> holds<00:00:52.640> it<00:00:52.879> squarely<00:00:53.860> this<00:00:54.860> is<00:00:55.039> just<00:00:55.399> a

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
it holds it squarely this is just a

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:04.320 
it holds it squarely this is just a
little<00:00:57.250> inexpensive<00:00:58.250> machinist<00:01:00.850> vise<00:01:02.559> and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
little inexpensive machinist vise and

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.640 
little inexpensive machinist vise and
the<00:01:05.330> idea<00:01:05.720> is<00:01:06.020> to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:21.450 

get<00:01:12.650> it<00:01:12.800> so<00:01:13.159> that<00:01:14.440> screw<00:01:15.440> hole<00:01:16.930> is<00:01:17.930> nice<00:01:18.830> and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.870 

parallel<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:22.910> surface<00:01:23.510> of<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:25.520> the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
parallel to the surface of the of the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.080 
parallel to the surface of the of the
key<00:01:26.320> so<00:01:27.320> I<00:01:27.740> got<00:01:28.160> it<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.430> there<00:01:28.610> straight<00:01:28.880> and

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
key so I got it in there straight and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.380 
key so I got it in there straight and
tighten<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:29.570> up<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:30.700> so<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.820> first<00:01:32.000> thing<00:01:32.150> I'm

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
tighten it up and so the first thing I'm

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.100 
tighten it up and so the first thing I'm
going<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.570> do<00:01:32.810> is<00:01:34.119> punch<00:01:35.119> a<00:01:35.390> hole<00:01:35.660> with<00:01:36.080> my

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
going to do is punch a hole with my

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.219 
going to do is punch a hole with my
little<00:01:37.000> only<00:01:38.000> punch<00:01:38.360> where<00:01:38.720> I<00:01:38.750> want<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.110> new

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
little only punch where I want the new

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.140 
little only punch where I want the new
screw<00:01:39.500> hole<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.860> be<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.670> I'm<00:01:40.759> going<00:01:40.910> to<00:01:40.970> use

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
screw hole to be so I'm going to use

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.620 
screw hole to be so I'm going to use
this<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:43.100> line<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:43.460> up<00:01:43.759> where<00:01:44.119> I<00:01:44.210> want<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.509> new

this and line it up where I want the new

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.270 
this and line it up where I want the new
hole<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:45.080> be<00:01:45.399> and<00:01:46.399> I'm<00:01:46.550> going<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:46.789> go<00:01:48.039> on<00:01:49.039> the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
hole to be and I'm going to go on the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.060 
hole to be and I'm going to go on the
other<00:01:49.369> side<00:01:49.759> of<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:50.060> existing<00:01:50.360> hole<00:01:51.070> the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
other side of the existing hole the

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.450 
other side of the existing hole the
reason<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:52.490> punch<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.850> hole<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.479> so<00:01:54.050> that<00:01:57.460> so

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
reason to punch a hole is so that so

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.600 
reason to punch a hole is so that so
that<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:58.820> get<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.300> place<00:01:59.750> for<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.740> drill<00:02:01.009> to

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
that you get a place for the drill to

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.029 
that you get a place for the drill to
start<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:02.149> not<00:02:02.509> wander<00:02:03.020> it's<00:02:03.470> off<00:02:03.680> a<00:02:03.710> little

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
start and not wander it's off a little

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.219 
start and not wander it's off a little
bit<00:02:04.190> I'm<00:02:04.700> going<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.970> punch<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.360> one<00:02:05.810> more<00:02:06.020> time

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
bit I'm going to punch it one more time

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.419 
bit I'm going to punch it one more time
a<00:02:06.289> little<00:02:06.560> bit<00:02:07.119> off<00:02:08.119> from<00:02:08.330> where<00:02:08.570> it<00:02:08.660> was<00:02:09.429> and

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
a little bit off from where it was and

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.310 
a little bit off from where it was and
that<00:02:11.030> looks<00:02:11.209> good<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.610> other<00:02:13.640> thing<00:02:14.000> that

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
that looks good and the other thing that

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.570 
that looks good and the other thing that
punching<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.440> hole<00:02:15.620> does<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.160> creates<00:02:16.489> a

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
punching the hole does is creates a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.880 
punching the hole does is creates a
little<00:02:16.730> deformed<00:02:17.209> area<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:18.320> won't<00:02:18.650> be<00:02:18.769> able

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
little deformed area you won't be able

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.220 
little deformed area you won't be able
to<00:02:18.950> see<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.310> on<00:02:19.459> this<00:02:19.820> video<00:02:20.720> but<00:02:20.959> it's<00:02:21.140> a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
to see it on this video but it's a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.570 
to see it on this video but it's a
little<00:02:21.380> raised<00:02:21.620> section<00:02:22.100> so<00:02:22.220> what<00:02:22.340> I'm<00:02:22.430> going

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
little raised section so what I'm going

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.789 
little raised section so what I'm going
to<00:02:22.610> do<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:23.870> take<00:02:24.080> my<00:02:24.790> file<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.799> just

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
to do is just take my file and just

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.360 
to do is just take my file and just
gently<00:02:28.930> file<00:02:29.930> off<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.320> Ray<00:02:30.470> section<00:02:31.070> and

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
gently file off the Ray section and

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.310 
gently file off the Ray section and
that's<00:02:31.640> really<00:02:31.910> just<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.269> keep<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.780> drill

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
that's really just to keep the drill

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.710 
that's really just to keep the drill
from<00:02:33.410> wandering<00:02:33.860> I<00:02:34.130> can<00:02:34.610> see<00:02:34.820> from<00:02:35.060> punching

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
from wandering I can see from punching

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.229 
from wandering I can see from punching
that<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.110> made<00:02:36.410> this<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.590> little<00:02:36.739> crooked<00:02:37.239> so

this<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.740> zero<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:01.410> three<00:03:02.410> eighths<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:05.190> what

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
this is a zero to three eighths and what

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.260 
this is a zero to three eighths and what
I<00:03:06.220> normally<00:03:06.340> do<00:03:06.880> is<00:03:07.090> turn<00:03:07.330> it<00:03:07.450> on

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
I normally do is turn it on

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.190 
I normally do is turn it on
just<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.360> make<00:03:10.510> sure<00:03:10.570> it's<00:03:10.900> spinning<00:03:11.380> straight

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
just to make sure it's spinning straight

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.530 
just to make sure it's spinning straight
and<00:03:14.200> I'm<00:03:14.590> going<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.180> drill<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.209> little<00:03:16.390> bit

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
and I'm going to drill a little bit

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.370 
and I'm going to drill a little bit
beyond<00:03:17.260> where<00:03:18.070> I<00:03:18.100> want<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:19.020> depth<00:03:20.020> of<00:03:20.260> the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
beyond where I want the depth of the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.850 
beyond where I want the depth of the
flat<00:03:20.830> Springs<00:03:21.160> go<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.940> I<00:03:22.420> can<00:03:22.900> get<00:03:23.650> enough

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
flat Springs go so I I can get enough

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:46.199 
flat Springs go so I I can get enough
threads<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.400> it

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
drilled and the next step you can do in

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:04.530 
drilled and the next step you can do in
a<00:03:56.980> in<00:03:57.780> a<00:04:01.709> tap<00:04:02.709> holder<00:04:03.099> like<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.340> what<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.180> like

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
to tap a few holes of few threads just

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.749 
to tap a few holes of few threads just
by<00:04:29.650> turning<00:04:29.979> it<00:04:30.099> by<00:04:30.220> hand<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.789> then<00:04:31.979> carefully

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.260 
by hand doing it by hand gives you a
little<00:04:54.580> bit<00:04:54.729> more<00:04:56.490> sensitive<00:04:57.490> feel<00:04:58.349> for<00:04:59.349> how

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
little bit more sensitive feel for how

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.689 
little bit more sensitive feel for how
how<00:05:01.270> your<00:05:01.539> threads<00:05:01.900> are<00:05:02.080> cutting<00:05:02.470> so<00:05:03.190> I'm

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
how your threads are cutting so I'm

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.230 
how your threads are cutting so I'm
cutting<00:05:04.240> breaking<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:05.229> chip<00:05:05.440> off<00:05:05.680> in<00:05:06.240> a

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
cutting breaking the chip off in a

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.399 
cutting breaking the chip off in a
couple<00:05:07.659> of<00:05:07.720> turns<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:10.210> feels<00:05:11.050> like<00:05:11.139> I've

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
couple of turns and it feels like I've

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.920 
couple of turns and it feels like I've
got<00:05:11.440> enough<00:05:11.770> threads<00:05:12.099> in<00:05:12.280> there<00:05:12.720> so<00:05:13.720> I'm<00:05:13.810> going

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
got enough threads in there so I'm going

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:25.710 
got enough threads in there so I'm going
to<00:05:14.020> undo<00:05:14.289> this

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.720 

and<00:05:26.350> there's<00:05:26.770> my<00:05:27.120> old<00:05:28.120> one<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:29.560> new<00:05:29.740> one<00:05:32.730> get

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
and there's my old one the new one get

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:44.170 
and there's my old one the new one get
it<00:05:33.820> started

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:06:08.679 

the

00:06:08.679 --> 00:06:08.689 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:11.909 

there<00:06:09.289> and<00:06:09.969> get<00:06:10.969> it<00:06:11.089> started

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
there and get it started

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:29.810 
there and get it started
threads<00:06:12.919> right<00:06:13.129> in<00:06:16.629> and<00:06:17.769> there<00:06:18.769> it<00:06:18.919> is
