00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.220
 channel today i want to show you how 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.950
 to make such very beautiful ones 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.990
 delicious juicy orange slices 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.630
 of which I made a bracelet and a pendant to me 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.390
 will need orange translucent 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.390
 polymer clay white and orange 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.980
 rolled from translucent villina 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.140
 small cylinder and white example ljubljana 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.390
 I rolled on the post machine thick 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.290
 about 2 millimeters now 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.590
 wrapping white clay orange 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.600
 cut off all superfluous and good 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.829
 I pinch the shock so that everything is exactly and 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.539
 neatly rolled on paper 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.469
 I pull out a little sausage so that she 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.879
 has become thinner and now to me from this 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.210
 sausages need to form a triangle 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.829
 good shrink 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.019
 I attach the paper to the edges were all 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.270
 smooth and pull up to that size 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.979
 which i need i need and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.979
 long narrow lobules 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.850
 Now I cut this sausage into pieces 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.220
 about 3 millimeters thick 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.159
 try to make the pieces the same 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.909
 thickness so your only will look 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.119
 neater and cute if you are too 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.440
 soft clay can be a little bit 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.259
 freeze the sausage to make it easier 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.640
 chop and now from these chuck me share 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:51.250
 you need to make a circle of faith one by one 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.860
 I put the slices right on a piece of paper 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.539
 so I have these pieces stuck and 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.909
 it was easier for me to work 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.720
 some pieces turned out a little 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.750
 crooked 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.130
 correcting them with fingers if you need me 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.799
 a little slimming 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.289
 how to keep the center I got 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.030
 hole and I do specifically as his yes 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.580
 we cut a piece 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.799
 orange it turns out that in the center 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.810
 a small hole forms 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.150
 I pull down and all the slices 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.910
 pretty suddenly a friend pressing to 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.579
 they held tight and in the end our 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.390
 the daughter has not broken up and not 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.390
 fell apart 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.620
 left last . now I'm using 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.500
 with a stack we press these blocks a little 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.310
 Friend and smoother edge to do in 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.180
 we had a circle fairly smooth and 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.670
 neat now need to do 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.659
 white flesh that is in the light between 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.400
 orange pulp and skinned itself 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:43.579
 rolled out a thin strip of thickness 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.099
 about the same in the 2 meter and finger 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:49.629
 right gently press the white 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.629
 striped cut off all unnecessary 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.950
 I put a good ball on the ball 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:04.939
 white stripes to daughters to our filling 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.329
 all voids by this color and by 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:11.470
 this cruelly give texture 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.250
 we need to make a light air and 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.690
 porous texture 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.570
 like a real orange you can take 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.880
 the toothbrush that I did in the end 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.699
 so that we have a smaller texture 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.669
 well going more porous 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.740
 completely around the circle and also 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.139
 a little brushing through a toothbrush 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.970
 inside what are you there too manifest to this 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.570
 interesting texture so that it is not all 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.570
 smooth and even 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.810
 well, it's time to peel for 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.680
 our orange slices I took 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.229
 bright orange color just like 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.229
 real orange this color is very 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.370
 juicy beautiful finger pressed too 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.570
 good 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:01.229
 and cutter cut off all the excess again I take 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.620
 stack with a ball and start on the edge where u 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.280
 us 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.080
 orange it touches white 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.820
 good 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:14.820
 about you nod all small ball 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:17.789
 took something with a small ball and good 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.370
 cuddle me about you nod 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:25.110
 way to give texture also with us 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:27.150
 turns on airy and porous on 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.220
 skins better do it 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.320
 small stack there were look 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.000
 better after good 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:39.449
 attached the peel of white porous 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.580
 the surface i'm already starting completely by 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.830
 whole skin create texture first 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.520
 also this little stack ball and 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.620
 now a toothbrush around the edges with us 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.599
 also on the reverse side should be 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.870
 texture as we have orange peel 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:57.510
 very porous now need to do 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.919
 texture on themselves and only had aspen 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.250
 ruined sky 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.800
 and start drawing fibers i just 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.210
 doing it 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.000
 stripes a little slotting 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.979
 scratching the surface orange 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.289
 translucent clay and so 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:17.280
 we get a texture like this 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:19.800
 fibers on and it turns out such as 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.710
 droplets and serifs as you present 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.810
 an orange can be made as small 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.410
 so and long scratches so will 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.880
 look much more interesting and them 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.789
 naturalistic after i did 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.699
 all sorts of strict send your baked 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:38.729
 daughter for a temperature of 110 degrees on 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.030
 half an hour from this big lobule can 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:43.490
 to make 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:47.210
 suspension pendant need to add also looking 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:50.960
 shallow half house and make 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:53.389
 beautiful necklace I made small 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.110
 daughters who cut in half and 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:07:00.050
 interconnected with pins 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:04.220
 with loops as a bracelet will hold 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:07.520
 better and you will be taken out more natural 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.259
 and the slices themselves will be bristled and here 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.979
 I have such beautiful slices 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:12.069
 have turned out 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:13.819
