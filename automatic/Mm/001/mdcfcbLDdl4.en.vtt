00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
been contacted over the years several

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.190 
been contacted over the years several
times<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:55.399> appear<00:00:55.610> on<00:00:55.730> television<00:00:56.079> and<00:00:57.079> to

whereas most people fixate on trying to
you<00:01:04.670> know<00:01:05.110> make<00:01:06.110> judgments<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.100> ask<00:01:08.030> the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
you know make judgments and to ask the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.300 
you know make judgments and to ask the
same<00:01:08.420> old<00:01:08.630> tired<00:01:08.810> questions<00:01:09.350> like<00:01:09.590> is<00:01:10.100> it

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310
