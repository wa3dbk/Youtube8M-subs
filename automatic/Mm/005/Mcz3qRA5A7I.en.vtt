00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.869
 adjusted so that they can 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.640
 lay your feet flat on the ground so 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.470
 to be stable second thing 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.230
 the small cushion must be placed 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.790
 slightly below the sternum or 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.040
 so as not to crush the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.129
 chest third thing because he has to 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.770
 to be straight head to back 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.750
 buttocks well aligned at the level of 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.530
 movement as she will come to grab the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.780

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.030
 near the coast 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.370
 he inspires in the climb and he blows 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.320
 in the descent bringing back the handles 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.630
 almost their starting position 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.820
 we inspire we fire and we breathe 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.479
 back to the level of the instructions of 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.490
 security 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.990
 because will be careful when they shoot 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.150
 not this make you cambrai 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.670
 also be careful in the climb to not 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.619
 not ride your shoulders to the ears so 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.320
 not to create unnecessary tensions in the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.909
 level of trapezes on the contrary you 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.280
 will have low shoulders and well 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.009
 released in the descent 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.310
 be careful not to take off the buttocks 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.170
 and neither to round the back 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.979
 throughout the exercise because the rest 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.820
 and quite right as well in the climb 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.610
 only in the descent 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.740
 little trick to have a little bit 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.619
 more sensations at the top of the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.920
 back and shoulder blades sought to open a 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.840
 little bit shoulders back to the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.520
 level of dosage and load 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.040
 if you are a beginner it is better 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.170
 privilege long series with a 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.180
 low charge in order to develop your 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.129
 muscular endurance 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.679

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.420
 little heavier with longer series 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.209
 short in order to develop your mass 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.700
 muscle this exercise is for the back 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.600
