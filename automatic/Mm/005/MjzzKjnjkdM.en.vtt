00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 what a hectic and dramatic in the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.180
 replay time of the part of the tsv 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.730
 Buchbach in red against the tsv rain am 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.980
 lech the guests threw at the booth of 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.500
 23 from her sight and a free kick 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.059
 everything caught up front both 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.490
 in the other half was once captain 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.170
 max loaded his big buck and runs with 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.080
 the retired treuter kevin maschke 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.109
 then alex petrovic on fall brings clear 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.789
 thing elfmeter and red card the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.740
 Substitute Thomas turned thomas 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.529
 hamberger against field player ugur yilmaz 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.250
 who put in the gate to 4 2 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.649
 final score 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.480
 immediately afterwards the final whistle and some 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.559
 boulders that since the house of men 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.450
 my shoulders fell 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.760
 indeed this is so, for example, after the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.629
 bavaria game where you played very well 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.530
 but have today only 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.670
 defend in quotation marks 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.680
 under today lack somewhere 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.010
 last percent and that's what you have right now 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.059
 teaches for the first time the battles was not 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.859
 all denied 100 percent and then 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.730
 you are not really in the game and in there 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.769
 then in time quite against the perpetrator 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.600
 buchbacher haushoher favorite before 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.549
 Partie table sixth against last 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.380
 an advantage and in addition the great 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.600
 Rally last at the small over 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.360
 the swabians, on the other hand, only join in on bavaria 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.490
 eight counts from 25 games and three 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.740
 however, mostly short pauses after 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.720
 the winter break still sets 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.939
 Surprisingly, the guests the first 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.150
 accents in this lot of over 700 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.979
 Fans in the sap arena phenomenon in the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.960
 Soccer 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.759
 I'm sure if I say now 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.119
 One wants to win every game says 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.470
 clear 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.570
 Last week a great one 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.549
 attitude shown against bavaria and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.100
 then you might go that way a bit 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.420
 a bit willisau the driver but there 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.820
 you go maybe a two percent 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.930
 fewer 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.790
 Maybe we thought tsv rain 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.500
 and then the bayernliga bavaria is strong 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.210
 but you can also fall against bahrain 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.130
 the guests in the first half hour 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.070
 with some good scenes due to 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.570
 many buchbacher negligence 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.380
 to write down a lot in this phase for 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.299
 tsv coach anton bobenstetter 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.070
 then, however, almost from nothing that 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.560
 1 0 for the homeowners and this 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.170
 hit proven why so far below 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.480
 can there is woltmann benjamin located 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.819
 of it - typically nibble and inside 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.709
 no one stands with thomas breu something with it 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.069
 luck to bring the ball to the mask 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.720
 to guide in the 31 minute as 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.700
 buchbach then seven minutes later to 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.220
 2 0 seemed to be the matter 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.530
 actually already by very fine the 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.910
 combination about broistedt and 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.370
 stephan think that with much overview 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.370
 marked his tenth goal of the season 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.700
 immediately after the break even the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.560
 third prank brew with his second 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.680
 gate of the evening again completely uncovered 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.660
 in the 47 minute instead but now the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.370
 play easy and relaxed towards the end 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.700
 play host switched maybe 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.299
 Going back too much, it may be fine 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.630
 his 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.120
 I do not know, so I can say 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.970
 that I always take care of the fourth 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.739
 but we want to go as we are 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.780
 sixth table of the last one 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.250
 maybe just a meter 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.680
 do not do it and then come as such 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.660
 out because in the 64 minute were the 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.489
 guests suddenly again there floor error 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.410
 by uli fries and in december of 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.480
 bayernliga south top rider aichach 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.700
 come marius skor is known for 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.459
 his excellent shooting technique only 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.560
 three to one and gratefully 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.480
 great trembling set in as the second 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.910
 winter new arrival from aichach scorer 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.700
 sebastian kinzel in the 84 minute den 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.500
 second guest hit marked correctly 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.569
 However, there was not much danger 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.310
 for the housing of daniel mau out and 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.109
 so stayed thanks to the beginning 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.720
 final scene the three dots at the end 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.549
 But in Buchbach, however, a victory 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.139
 after not just like that 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.410
 agenda will pass 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.870
 there are many points of criticism and the 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.639
 analyze worms in the table 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.590
 underpins buchbach with the victory 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.329
 platzecks should the two games the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.310
 one is still in competition with the competition 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.349
 Hinterhand has successfully designed 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.769
 it would even be the jump up 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.769
 fourth place
