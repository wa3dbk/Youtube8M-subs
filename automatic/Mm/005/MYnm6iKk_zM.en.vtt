00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.650
 water flour salt yeast this 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.139
 week we talk about food pizza 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.390
 known throughout the world and proposed in 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.730
 its most different versions 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.470
 but sometimes the choice of pizza 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.980
 ready in a store 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.099
 it is not easy and today we have just come 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.250
 to offer you a pizza of absolute quality 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:33.599
 we are in the mountains where there is indeed 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.599
 cereal establishment 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.020
 when it comes to pizza I get it 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.489
 mind sophia loren and are not sofia 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.190
 loren of course but what is 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.949
 happening here a little in practice is really 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.920
 sophia loren's hands creating 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.199
 the dough is certain but this is the stage 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.050
 of kneading of raw materials 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.610
 used to make pizza in the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.320
 our company the technology of 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.180
 bread production has been transferred 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.670
 also to pizzas and therefore not 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.399
 in the final dough we use a biga 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.410
 that to a reshuffle of at least 24 hours that 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.350
 it is left in the storage cells 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.000
 and then used the next day 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.950
 this allows us to reduce the 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.660
 amount of used yeast 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.619
 then in the final dough 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.690
 we commit flour water yeast the chariot 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.300
 in variable percentage in relation 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.159
 possibly the salt to the recipe 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.080
 the big oil and obviously are 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.850
 different relation to the type of product 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.890
 that we must carry out after this 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.350
 operation that happens 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.300
 the dough is lowered we say al 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.670
 floor below where there is the area of 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.830
 forming then the are formed 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.630
 balls of different weight in relation 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.000
 to the product they go to the cell of 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.369
 rising slightly later 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.899
 rolled and then rolled by hand as it is 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.099
 the other characteristic phase of ours 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.099
 productive process 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.150
 at the beginning of our interview 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.840
 we summoned sophia loren and his 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.280
 pizza a little sophia loren you feel no 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.800
 absolutely 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.800
 but you got as many revenge 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.810
 pizzas fi per day around 4,000 4400 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.780
 home shifts you want to eat one 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.730

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.730
 thanks to the two 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.060
 and after twenty years of top form arrives 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.520
 also the time of the first interview 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.740
 with a mask because we have 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.270
 the mask here because here we are in 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.470
 clean room that has a room 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.600
 controlled from the point of view 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.710
 microbiological and therefore the operators 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.090
 they must have a certain type of 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.520
 clothing to preserve the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.530
 wholesomeness of the product and that is where it is 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.920
 happening here we are doing ours 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.030
 pizzas then the mozzarella was put 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.920
 then the filling will be placed 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.750
 ending that may be the sport 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.160
 try the salami and all the others 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.890
 fillings that characterize ours 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.050
 pizzas the pizzas then go into the batter 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.870
 then a mechanical fridge and they will come out 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.730
 refrigerated to 0 4 degrees after which 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.300
 they are packaged in the atmosphere 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.510
 protective start come in points 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.489
 sale after how many days you have to 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.730
 consume the rent within ten days 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.770
 it must be kept in the fridge and then 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.780
 after seeing the preparation here and 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.150
 instead we have the finished product 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.430
 it seems to me that the choice is rather 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.890
 ample yes the choice is very wide 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.690

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.790
 found for sale in three parts for free 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.549
 bakery service for frozen foods 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.500
 the lines are different from each other a 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.780
 that of the bakery is very wide yes 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.940
 arrives at 12 references and goes to 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.430
 touch the top of the range then fillings 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.080
 large rich distinct ranging 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.140
 even with the free service season 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.730
 a simpler, more streamlined line while 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.890
 to frozen foods we have recently entered 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.709
 three new quality references really 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.010
 high denominated by the gran toscano brand 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.950
 I know I'm on the bridge is at the door 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.930
 also some offers be then ai 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.550
 frozen foods in the first fortnight of 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.310
 October there will be the three pizzas and in 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.750
 offer while in November the first 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.460
 fifteen to all the pizzas of the 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.450
 bakery will be on special offer for 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.729
 the partners then there is a little secret to 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.160
 to be able to taste these even better 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.870
 both the oven and cooking pizzas is 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.910
 It is important that these pizzas are cota 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.729
 in a ventilated oven never absolutely 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.830
 use the microwave never use an oven and 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.780
 put more pizzas in at a time 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.460
 because otherwise we can not pull 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.720
 outside the crunchiness of the pasta is the 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.930
 added value of this type of 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.930
 products
