00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
and now let me show you the base yeah I

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.660 
and now let me show you the base yeah I
always<00:00:31.599> thought<00:00:32.349> this<00:00:32.650> would<00:00:32.800> happen<00:00:33.010> like

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
always thought this would happen like

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.820 
always thought this would happen like
the<00:00:34.030> base<00:00:34.240> wasn't<00:00:34.510> completely<00:00:35.110> raped<00:00:35.500> proof

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
the base wasn't completely raped proof

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.340 
the base wasn't completely raped proof
but<00:00:36.820> unfortunately<00:00:37.660> someone<00:00:37.870> claimed<00:00:38.230> the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
but unfortunately someone claimed the

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.950 
but unfortunately someone claimed the
land<00:00:38.530> while<00:00:39.460> we<00:00:39.700> had<00:00:39.850> less<00:00:40.090> less<00:00:40.660> power<00:00:40.900> than

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
land while we had less less power than

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.520 
land while we had less less power than
land<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:43.000> really<00:00:43.750> thought<00:00:43.930> it<00:00:43.989> would

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
land and I really thought it would

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.130 
land and I really thought it would
happen<00:00:44.680> like<00:00:45.329> not<00:00:46.329> much<00:00:46.510> you<00:00:46.540> can<00:00:46.750> do<00:00:46.870> about<00:00:46.990> it

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
happen like not much you can do about it

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.220 
happen like not much you can do about it
if<00:00:47.770> you<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:49.120> you<00:00:49.270> aren't<00:00:49.480> online<00:00:49.630> for<00:00:50.020> quite<00:00:50.200> a

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
if you if you aren't online for quite a

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.830 
if you if you aren't online for quite a
while<00:00:50.490> so<00:00:51.490> whether<00:00:51.640> did<00:00:51.940> just<00:00:52.300> claim<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.690> land

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
while so whether did just claim the land

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.420 
while so whether did just claim the land
and<00:00:53.050> broke<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:54.090> broke<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.210> cobblestone<00:00:55.780> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
and broke the broke the cobblestone and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.340 
and broke the broke the cobblestone and
just<00:00:57.430> play<00:00:57.670> some<00:00:57.880> TMT<00:00:58.210> I<00:00:58.240> guess<00:00:58.540> or<00:00:58.840> like<00:00:59.020> get

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
and now we're slowly going to make a

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.099 
and now we're slowly going to make a
base<00:01:41.259> with<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.159> which<00:01:43.119> yeah<00:01:43.389> which<00:01:43.810> will<00:01:44.020> be

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
base with that which yeah which will be

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.399 
base with that which yeah which will be
quite<00:01:44.319> quite<00:01:44.740> good<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.569> now<00:01:46.569> we'll<00:01:47.380> just

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
quite quite good and now we'll just

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.349 
quite quite good and now we'll just
start<00:01:47.710> over<00:01:48.039> there's<00:01:48.429> nothing<00:01:48.549> we<00:01:48.819> can<00:01:49.030> do

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
start over there's nothing we can do

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.719 
start over there's nothing we can do
about<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.630> really<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.979> you<00:01:51.189> can<00:01:51.310> rage<00:01:51.520> about

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
about it really like you can rage about

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.330 
about it really like you can rage about
it<00:01:52.060> but<00:01:52.210> it's<00:01:52.359> not<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:53.710> doesn't<00:01:53.770> really<00:01:54.130> matter

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
it but it's not it doesn't really matter

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.629 
it but it's not it doesn't really matter
just<00:01:54.670> game<00:01:54.999> and<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:56.159> building<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.249> base<00:01:57.429> is

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:57.639 
just game and that building the base is

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:00.209 
just game and that building the base is
one<00:01:57.819> of<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.289> one<00:01:59.289> of<00:01:59.319> the<00:01:59.499> cool<00:01:59.740> things<00:01:59.770> i

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
one of the one of the cool things i

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.819 
one of the one of the cool things i
guess<00:02:00.399> to<00:02:00.579> do<00:02:00.759> too<00:02:01.090> especially<00:02:01.990> if<00:02:02.499> you<00:02:02.619> can

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
guess to do too especially if you can

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.099 
guess to do too especially if you can
start<00:02:03.729> over<00:02:03.819> with<00:02:04.119> a<00:02:04.149> whole<00:02:04.329> fresh<00:02:04.659> design

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
start over with a whole fresh design

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.169 
start over with a whole fresh design
which<00:02:05.799> is<00:02:05.950> quite<00:02:06.100> like<00:02:06.340> ah<00:02:08.340> yeah<00:02:09.340> so<00:02:10.000> that's

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
which is quite like ah yeah so that's

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.360 
which is quite like ah yeah so that's
what<00:02:10.360> happened<00:02:10.720> like<00:02:10.959> and<00:02:11.380> clamps<00:02:12.069> on<00:02:12.160> land

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
what happened like and clamps on land

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.600 
what happened like and clamps on land
right<00:02:12.550> now<00:02:12.730> we<00:02:13.000> don't<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.270> much<00:02:13.540> power

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
right now we don't have much power

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.960 
right now we don't have much power
across<00:02:15.610> my<00:02:15.819> eyes<00:02:15.940> would<00:02:16.120> be<00:02:16.209> online<00:02:16.390> at<00:02:16.660> ages

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
across my eyes would be online at ages

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.090 
across my eyes would be online at ages
one<00:02:18.970> power<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.540> those<00:02:19.660> other<00:02:19.870> counts<00:02:20.290> too<00:02:20.590> so

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
one power and those other counts too so

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.760 
one power and those other counts too so
that's<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.550> problem<00:02:21.790> also

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
that's the problem also

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710

will<00:03:27.040> start<00:03:27.220> making<00:03:27.520> videos<00:03:27.550> again<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.680> I'm

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
will start making videos again and I'm

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.170 
will start making videos again and I'm
probably<00:03:29.800> going<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.190> make<00:03:30.310> another<00:03:30.520> series<00:03:30.970> on

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
probably going to make another series on

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.710 
probably going to make another series on
the<00:03:31.300> mcpvp<00:03:32.080> elite<00:03:32.709> server<00:03:33.270> also<00:03:34.270> in<00:03:34.480> here<00:03:34.660> I

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
the mcpvp elite server also in here I

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.430 
the mcpvp elite server also in here I
think<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:37.420> thats<00:03:37.600> makes<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.990> hard<00:03:38.200> core

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
think and so thats makes the hard core

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.710 
think and so thats makes the hard core
server<00:03:38.770> and<00:03:39.070> then<00:03:39.310> what<00:03:40.060> they<00:03:40.209> do<00:03:40.270> is<00:03:40.450> they

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
server and then what they do is they

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.420 
server and then what they do is they
remove<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.050> audience<00:03:41.350> chants<00:03:41.620> from<00:03:41.980> swords

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
remove the audience chants from swords

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.820 
remove the audience chants from swords
and<00:03:42.550> armor<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.690> which<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.200> she's<00:03:44.530> really

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
and armor so which is it she's really

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.130 
and armor so which is it she's really
good<00:03:45.040> because<00:03:45.430> sharp<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.300> fees<00:03:46.540> are<00:03:46.720> terrible

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
good because sharp I fees are terrible

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.980 
good because sharp I fees are terrible
in<00:03:47.950> 1.3<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:51.190> they<00:03:51.850> like<00:03:52.150> change<00:03:52.750> some
