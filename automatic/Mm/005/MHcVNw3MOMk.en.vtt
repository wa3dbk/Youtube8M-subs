thanks<00:00:21.109> to<00:00:21.230> n<00:00:21.380> light<00:00:21.650> laser

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.530 
thanks to n light laser

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.790 
thanks to n light laser
you

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.760 

okay<00:00:28.610> so<00:00:28.670> this<00:00:28.850> is<00:00:29.000> step<00:00:29.210> one<00:00:29.500> there's<00:00:30.500> anybody

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
okay so this is step one there's anybody

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:38.950 
okay so this is step one there's anybody
clearly<00:00:31.400> of<00:00:31.520> scared<00:00:36.910> yeah<00:00:37.910> I<00:00:38.270> can<00:00:38.630> feel<00:00:38.810> the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
clearly of scared yeah I can feel the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.170 
clearly of scared yeah I can feel the
tingle<00:00:39.380> but<00:00:40.010> can<00:00:40.310> imagine<00:00:40.640> that's<00:00:40.760> the

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
tingle but can imagine that's the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.930 
tingle but can imagine that's the
cleansing<00:00:41.900> process<00:00:42.110> taking<00:00:42.710> effect<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.550> acid

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
cleansing process taking effect the acid

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.549 
cleansing process taking effect the acid
is<00:00:44.059> penetrating<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.809> skin<00:00:45.080> and<00:00:45.230> pinching

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
is penetrating the skin and pinching

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:52.389 
is penetrating the skin and pinching
your<00:00:45.710> dermis<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:46.489> that's<00:00:46.900> how<00:00:47.900> you<00:00:47.960> know<00:00:48.580> what

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.549 

this<00:00:53.000> is<00:00:53.149> quite<00:00:53.329> mild<00:00:53.510> answers<00:00:54.020> people<00:00:54.230> have

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
this is quite mild answers people have

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.560 
this is quite mild answers people have
had<00:00:54.680> regular<00:00:54.920> treatments<00:00:55.640> or<00:00:55.760> maintain<00:00:56.329> their

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
had regular treatments or maintain their

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.880 
had regular treatments or maintain their
skin<00:00:56.870> after<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.350> treatment

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
skin after a treatment

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.490 
skin after a treatment
we'll<00:00:58.250> use<00:00:58.280> these<00:00:59.030> products<00:00:59.510> on<00:00:59.960> a<00:01:00.019> regular

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
we'll use these products on a regular

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.079 
we'll use these products on a regular
basis<00:01:00.860> and<00:01:01.010> they'll<00:01:01.129> find<00:01:01.430> after<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.790> while<00:01:01.910> the

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
basis and they'll find after a while the

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.610 
basis and they'll find after a while the
lower<00:01:02.239> strengths<00:01:02.750> don't<00:01:02.930> tingle<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:03.530> then

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
lower strengths don't tingle and then

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.730 
lower strengths don't tingle and then
move<00:01:03.769> up<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:04.070> higher<00:01:04.100> strength<00:01:05.229> provider<00:01:06.229> of

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
move up to higher strength provider of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.649 
move up to higher strength provider of

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.760 

now<00:01:55.130> one<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.490> benefits<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:56.180> this<00:01:56.330> laser

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
now one of the benefits of this laser

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.040 
now one of the benefits of this laser
apart<00:01:57.770> from<00:01:57.950> killing<00:01:58.159> bacteria<00:01:58.840> is<00:01:59.840> it

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
apart from killing bacteria is it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.690 
apart from killing bacteria is it
stimulates<00:02:00.320> collagen<00:02:00.860> production<00:02:01.220> in<00:02:01.610> your

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
stimulates collagen production in your

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.390 
stimulates collagen production in your
skin<00:02:02.260> so<00:02:03.260> we<00:02:03.440> do<00:02:03.620> this<00:02:03.800> as<00:02:03.979> an<00:02:04.070> anti-aging

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
skin so we do this as an anti-aging

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.300 
skin so we do this as an anti-aging
treatment<00:02:05.270> as<00:02:05.840> well<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:06.890> you're<00:02:07.010> getting<00:02:07.250> a

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
treatment as well so you're getting a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.719

spots and with stimulating some collagen

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.130 
spots and with stimulating some collagen
protection<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.120> not<00:02:14.300> dangerous<00:02:14.570> for<00:02:15.080> the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
protection so it's not dangerous for the

of treating acne is we make your
collagen<00:02:20.780> factor<00:02:21.200> which<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> benefit<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.630> I

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
collagen factor which is a benefit and I

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.630 
collagen factor which is a benefit and I
tend<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.140> get<00:02:24.290> very<00:02:24.350> systematically<00:02:25.280> across

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
tend to get very systematically across

tend to get very systematically across
the<00:02:25.820> face<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.270> rows<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:26.750> we<00:02:26.840> get<00:02:27.020> full<00:02:27.230> coverage

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
the face in rows so we get full coverage

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.190 
the face in rows so we get full coverage
and<00:02:28.670> because<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.239> does<00:02:29.450> stimulate<00:02:29.989> collagen

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200
