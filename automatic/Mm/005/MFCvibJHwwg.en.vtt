00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.489
 a way of centering at the level of 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.230
 the size of qom center 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.809

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.030
 new resonance

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.299
 they mark a few things 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.000
 that's because you have to listen to this rhythm 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.240
 he worked of course as always 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.380

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:28.130
 slow to say like that it's enough especially 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.600
 regular like the fate of a very good 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:36.450
 here stop the train he can integrate 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.220
 little by little movement a lot of 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.080
 wrist but a little bit of their soul 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.250
 BarÃ§a it's pretty difficult explained it 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.930

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.410

 [Music] 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.690
 it's not energy, you have to 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.060
 right middle and that's where it's the most 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.920
 hard tried to force to repeat it at 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.870
 brain of the EU at the beginnings of formations 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.370

 folk but when there are two three 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.540
