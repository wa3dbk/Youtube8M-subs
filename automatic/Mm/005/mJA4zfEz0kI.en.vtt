little cage the stars not showing up but
it's<00:00:57.120> down<00:00:57.270> there<00:00:58.309> hopefully<00:00:59.309> that'd<00:01:00.270> be

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
it's down there hopefully that'd be

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.670 
it's down there hopefully that'd be
really<00:01:00.539> awkward<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.140> got<00:01:01.289> down<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
really awkward if I got down there and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.579 
really awkward if I got down there and
it<00:01:01.829> wasn't<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.250> I'm<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:03.409> positive<00:01:04.409> that's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
it wasn't but I'm like positive that's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.800 
it wasn't but I'm like positive that's
where<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.979> because<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.240> only<00:01:06.510> reason<00:01:06.630> why

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
where it is because the only reason why

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.620 
where it is because the only reason why
would<00:01:07.049> be<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.350> here<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:07.710> me<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.510> don't<00:01:09.510> really

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
would be in here with me I don't really

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.940 
would be in here with me I don't really
have<00:01:09.750> an<00:01:09.840> explanation<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.439> why<00:01:10.560> wouldn't<00:01:10.890> be

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
have an explanation for why wouldn't be

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.359 
have an explanation for why wouldn't be
in<00:01:11.040> there<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:12.020> yeah<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.770> guess<00:01:13.979> we'll<00:01:14.130> find

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
could definitely get enough to fight

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.840 
could definitely get enough to fight
Bowser<00:01:32.270> both<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:33.800> know<00:01:33.890> all<00:01:34.040> three<00:01:34.399> times<00:01:34.640> or
