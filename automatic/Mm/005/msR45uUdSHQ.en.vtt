00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
to cut too far in so you can see about

to cut too far in so you can see about
how<00:05:53.830> far<00:05:54.099> in<00:05:54.250> my<00:05:54.400> knifes<00:05:54.610> gone<00:05:54.970> there<00:05:55.240> if<00:05:55.449> you

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
cut too far in you do risk taking his

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.879 
cut too far in you do risk taking his
head<00:05:58.479> off<00:05:58.599> and<00:05:58.630> we<00:05:58.900> do<00:05:59.110> not<00:05:59.229> want<00:05:59.470> to<00:05:59.590> do<00:05:59.710> that

head off and we do not want to do that

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.339 
head off and we do not want to do that
so<00:06:00.880> now<00:06:01.030> I'm<00:06:01.150> just<00:06:01.240> going<00:06:01.449> to<00:06:01.570> I'm<00:06:01.870> squeezing

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
so now I'm just going to I'm squeezing

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.050 
so now I'm just going to I'm squeezing
the<00:06:02.620> sides<00:06:02.830> of<00:06:03.099> it<00:06:03.220> you<00:06:03.310> can<00:06:03.430> see<00:06:03.580> when<00:06:03.699> I<00:06:03.729> don't

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
the sides of it you can see when I don't

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.120 
the sides of it you can see when I don't
squeeze<00:06:04.449> and<00:06:04.780> then<00:06:05.169> when<00:06:05.259> I<00:06:05.289> do<00:06:05.530> squeeze<00:06:05.889> his

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
squeeze and then when I do squeeze his

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.159 
squeeze and then when I do squeeze his
mouth<00:06:06.310> opens<00:06:06.699> up<00:06:06.820> just<00:06:07.030> a<00:06:07.120> little<00:06:07.150> bit<00:06:07.360> so<00:06:08.110> I'm

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
mouth opens up just a little bit so I'm

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.550 
mouth opens up just a little bit so I'm
going<00:06:08.349> to<00:06:08.440> slide<00:06:08.860> in<00:06:09.810> his<00:06:10.810> little<00:06:11.020> mouth<00:06:11.229> and

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
going to slide in his little mouth and

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.230 
going to slide in his little mouth and
leave<00:06:11.650> it<00:06:11.800> poking<00:06:12.130> out<00:06:12.250> just<00:06:12.669> a<00:06:12.940> little<00:06:12.970> bit

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
leave it poking out just a little bit

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.279 
leave it poking out just a little bit
there<00:06:14.340> now<00:06:15.340> next<00:06:15.729> up<00:06:15.909> is<00:06:16.090> the<00:06:16.240> nose<00:06:16.419> so<00:06:17.020> this<00:06:17.169> is

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
there now next up is the nose so this is

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.310 
there now next up is the nose so this is
where<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:17.680> fondant<00:06:18.099> comes<00:06:18.310> in<00:06:19.050> if<00:06:20.050> you're

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
where the fondant comes in if you're

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.899 
where the fondant comes in if you're
going<00:06:20.470> to<00:06:20.560> be<00:06:20.650> making<00:06:20.949> several<00:06:21.190> of<00:06:21.400> these<00:06:21.610> I

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:21.909 
going to be making several of these I

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.670 
going to be making several of these I
would<00:06:22.210> make<00:06:22.479> all<00:06:22.659> of<00:06:22.690> the<00:06:22.930> noses<00:06:23.259> in<00:06:23.349> advance

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
would make all of the noses in advance

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.830 
would make all of the noses in advance
because<00:06:24.099> you<00:06:24.250> want<00:06:24.460> to<00:06:24.520> the<00:06:24.940> noses<00:06:25.180> to<00:06:25.539> all<00:06:25.690> be

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
because you want to the noses to all be

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.460 
because you want to the noses to all be
roughly<00:06:26.169> the<00:06:26.259> same<00:06:26.380> size<00:06:27.479> so<00:06:28.479> take<00:06:28.720> a<00:06:28.750> ball<00:06:29.289> of

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
roughly the same size so take a ball of

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.260 
roughly the same size so take a ball of
fondant

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.620 

I<00:06:33.640> guess<00:06:34.640> it's<00:06:34.790> a<00:06:34.850> little<00:06:35.060> bit<00:06:35.180> bigger<00:06:35.360> than<00:06:35.540> a

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
I guess it's a little bit bigger than a

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.230 
I guess it's a little bit bigger than a
peanut<00:06:35.960> M&amp;M<00:06:36.380> perhaps<00:06:36.740> and<00:06:37.100> I'm<00:06:37.880> just<00:06:38.090> going<00:06:38.210> to

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
peanut M&amp;M perhaps and I'm just going to

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.820 
peanut M&amp;M perhaps and I'm just going to
roll<00:06:38.450> it<00:06:38.480> into<00:06:38.660> a<00:06:38.840> tear<00:06:39.140> drop<00:06:39.290> so<00:06:39.470> you<00:06:39.560> can<00:06:39.680> see

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
roll it into a tear drop so you can see

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.080 
roll it into a tear drop so you can see
I'm<00:06:39.920> just<00:06:40.100> rolling<00:06:40.400> it<00:06:40.490> in<00:06:40.580> the<00:06:40.640> palm<00:06:40.790> of<00:06:40.820> my

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
I'm just rolling it in the palm of my

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.300 
I'm just rolling it in the palm of my
hand<00:06:41.390> and<00:06:41.600> then<00:06:42.140> I'm<00:06:42.260> just<00:06:42.380> going<00:06:42.590> to<00:06:42.710> just

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
hand and then I'm just going to just

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.780 
hand and then I'm just going to just
tape<00:06:43.610> it<00:06:43.790> off<00:06:43.910> into<00:06:44.090> a<00:06:44.210> nice<00:06:44.390> teardrop<00:06:44.690> shape

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
tape it off into a nice teardrop shape

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.060 
tape it off into a nice teardrop shape
that's<00:06:46.790> going<00:06:47.090> to<00:06:47.180> go<00:06:47.300> on<00:06:47.450> as<00:06:47.570> his<00:06:47.720> nose<00:06:48.070> don't

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070 
that's going to go on as his nose don't

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.710 
that's going to go on as his nose don't
wait<00:06:49.340> too<00:06:49.610> long<00:06:49.790> to<00:06:49.850> stick<00:06:50.210> that<00:06:50.330> on<00:06:50.390> because

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
wait too long to stick that on because

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.000 
wait too long to stick that on because
you<00:06:50.810> do<00:06:50.930> want<00:06:51.050> to<00:06:51.170> be<00:06:51.230> able<00:06:51.290> to<00:06:51.470> push<00:06:51.650> that<00:06:51.830> into

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
you do want to be able to push that into

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.710 
you do want to be able to push that into
the<00:06:52.100> frosting<00:06:52.550> while<00:06:52.700> it's<00:06:52.880> quite<00:06:53.120> damp<00:06:53.420> and

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
the frosting while it's quite damp and

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.100 
the frosting while it's quite damp and
then<00:06:54.560> finally<00:06:55.130> we've<00:06:55.280> got<00:06:55.310> the<00:06:55.700> eyes<00:06:56.110> now

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
then finally we've got the eyes now

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.750 
then finally we've got the eyes now
