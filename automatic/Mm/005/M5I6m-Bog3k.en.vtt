00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.420 
playing I think that's the one we should
all<00:03:33.269> follow<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.780> on<00:03:33.930> halo<00:03:34.560> 3<00:03:34.889> a<00:03:34.919> lot<00:03:35.099> of<00:03:35.190> people

what they don't realize is that the MLG
settings<00:03:38.190> which<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.209> what<00:03:39.359> we<00:03:39.480> use

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
settings which is what we use

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.750 
settings which is what we use
competitively<00:03:40.410> are<00:03:40.799> completely<00:03:41.400> different
