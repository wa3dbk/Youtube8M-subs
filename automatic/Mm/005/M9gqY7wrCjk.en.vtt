00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
detail and effort was put into making it

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.829 
detail and effort was put into making it
look<00:00:30.039> as<00:00:30.160> convincing<00:00:30.640> as<00:00:30.699> possible<00:00:31.179> now<00:00:31.330> this

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
look as convincing as possible now this

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.389 
look as convincing as possible now this
is<00:00:31.990> not<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.169> face<00:00:32.410> that<00:00:32.529> comes<00:00:32.680> with<00:00:32.829> a<00:00:32.860> mod<00:00:33.129> in

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
is not the face that comes with a mod in

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.639 
is not the face that comes with a mod in
fact<00:00:34.270> this<00:00:34.480> is<00:00:34.539> the<00:00:34.660> face<00:00:35.110> that<00:00:35.140> comes<00:00:35.469> with<00:00:35.620> it

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
fact this is the face that comes with it

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.799 
fact this is the face that comes with it
but<00:00:35.920> I<00:00:36.160> didn't<00:00:36.460> think<00:00:36.489> it<00:00:36.760> was<00:00:36.879> as<00:00:37.180> appealing

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
but I didn't think it was as appealing

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.790 
but I didn't think it was as appealing
so<00:00:38.350> I<00:00:38.649> went<00:00:39.309> ahead<00:00:39.430> and<00:00:39.579> put<00:00:39.879> in<00:00:40.000> my<00:00:40.180> own<00:00:40.800> using

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
so I went ahead and put in my own using

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.590 
so I went ahead and put in my own using
some<00:00:42.010> other<00:00:42.100> mods<00:00:42.430> however<00:00:43.120> with<00:00:43.329> the<00:00:43.360> head

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
some other mods however with the head

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.029 
some other mods however with the head
that<00:00:43.719> I<00:00:43.809> use<00:00:44.110> it's<00:00:44.500> not<00:00:44.680> been<00:00:44.859> prepared

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
that I use it's not been prepared

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:46.920 
that I use it's not been prepared
properly<00:00:45.399> so<00:00:45.940> there's<00:00:46.120> a<00:00:46.180> lot<00:00:46.329> of<00:00:46.359> next<00:00:46.719> seems

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
properly so there's a lot of next seems

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.389 
properly so there's a lot of next seems
still<00:00:47.230> showing<00:00:47.469> i<00:00:47.680> can<00:00:47.829> probably<00:00:48.010> ask<00:00:48.280> the

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
still showing i can probably ask the

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.520 
still showing i can probably ask the
road<00:00:48.550> stroker<00:00:48.879> to<00:00:49.000> get<00:00:49.149> rid<00:00:49.300> of<00:00:49.329> those<00:00:49.570> if<00:00:50.320> he

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
road stroker to get rid of those if he

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.009 
road stroker to get rid of those if he
so<00:00:50.710> chooses<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:52.030> it<00:00:52.180> says<00:00:52.359> mod<00:00:52.570> after<00:00:52.840> all

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
so chooses because it says mod after all

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.900 
so chooses because it says mod after all
now<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.500> way<00:00:53.649> you<00:00:53.680> get<00:00:53.949> there<00:00:54.219> is<00:00:54.399> that<00:00:54.609> you<00:00:54.760> go

sad relieved and shots side etc and to
me<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:37.899> looks<00:01:38.079> kind<00:01:38.290> of<00:01:38.320> awkward<00:01:38.680> so<00:01:38.890> that's

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
me it looks kind of awkward so that's

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.370 
me it looks kind of awkward so that's
why<00:01:39.250> I<00:01:39.280> chose<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.850> go<00:01:40.000> in<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.869> face<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.320> I

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
why I chose to go in the face that I

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.530 
why I chose to go in the face that I
used<00:01:41.680> there's<00:01:42.460> also<00:01:42.549> dirty<00:01:42.880> versions<00:01:43.360> and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
used there's also dirty versions and

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.069 
used there's also dirty versions and
also<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.020> get<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.590> winter<00:01:45.040> jacket<00:01:45.250> which<00:01:45.579> also

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
also you get a winter jacket which also

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.190 
also you get a winter jacket which also
personally<00:01:47.079> I<00:01:47.110> find<00:01:47.439> awkward-looking

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
personally I find awkward-looking

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.780 
personally I find awkward-looking
because<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.500> don't<00:01:50.740> recall<00:01:51.009> her<00:01:51.369> having<00:01:51.430> a
