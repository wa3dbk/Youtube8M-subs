we can get this thing started let's see

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.630 
we can get this thing started let's see
what<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.580> engine<00:01:54.970> is<00:01:56.310> here<00:01:57.310> we<00:01:57.400> have<00:01:57.490> the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
what the engine is here we have the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.930 
what the engine is here we have the
engine<00:01:57.790> it's<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.690> six<00:01:58.990> cylinder<00:01:59.550> had<00:02:00.550> it<00:02:00.700> on<00:02:00.820> the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
engine it's a six cylinder had it on the

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.840 
engine it's a six cylinder had it on the
charger<00:02:01.270> all<00:02:01.600> morning<00:02:02.370> things<00:02:03.370> been<00:02:03.520> sitting

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
charger all morning things been sitting

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.790 
charger all morning things been sitting
here<00:02:03.880> for<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.180> long<00:02:04.240> time<00:02:04.750> because<00:02:04.930> nobody<00:02:05.350> will

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
here for a long time because nobody will

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.330 
here for a long time because nobody will
drive<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.280> because<00:02:06.580> how<00:02:06.760> nasty<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.600> is<00:02:07.870> inside

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
drive it because how nasty it is inside

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.770 
drive it because how nasty it is inside
it<00:02:09.340> would<00:02:09.460> cost<00:02:09.670> more<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.149> replace<00:02:10.450> the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
it would cost more to replace the

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.600 
it would cost more to replace the
interior<00:02:11.410> than<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.800> trucks<00:02:12.100> whereas<00:02:12.490> we

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
interior than the trucks whereas we

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.890 
interior than the trucks whereas we
could<00:02:12.760> buy<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.940> whole<00:02:13.090> another<00:02:13.330> one<00:02:13.570> so<00:02:13.780> this

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
could buy a whole another one so this

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.120 
could buy a whole another one so this
it's<00:02:14.140> got<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:15.460> know<00:02:15.750> leaves<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.260> branches<00:02:17.620> on

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
it's got you know leaves and branches on

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.740 
it's got you know leaves and branches on
it<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.620> look<00:02:20.830> at<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:22.630> like

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
it on it and look at this it's like

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.370 
it on it and look at this it's like
we're<00:02:22.900> storing<00:02:23.230> them<00:02:23.440> or<00:02:23.590> something<00:02:24.030> alright

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
we're storing them or something alright

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.230 
we're storing them or something alright
but<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:27.040> looks<00:02:27.280> like<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.550> same<00:02:27.760> engine

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
but this this looks like the same engine

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.740 
but this this looks like the same engine
as<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.420> male<00:02:28.690> Jeep<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.240> little<00:02:31.450> newer

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
as the male Jeep so a little newer

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.500 
as the male Jeep so a little newer
though<00:02:32.050> it's<00:02:32.410> got<00:02:32.709> fuel<00:02:33.670> injection

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.880 

ah<00:02:36.709> yes<00:02:37.709> fuel<00:02:38.310> injection<00:02:39.170> look<00:02:40.170> at<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.440> fuel

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
ah yes fuel injection look at that fuel
