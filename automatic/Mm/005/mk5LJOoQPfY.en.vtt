00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
iron work smarter not harder using the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.280 
iron work smarter not harder using the
bigger<00:01:08.820> piece<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.240> fabric<00:01:09.479> you're<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
bigger piece of fabric you're going to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.219 
bigger piece of fabric you're going to
fold<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.189> width<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.030> fabric<00:01:12.229> about

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
fold on the width of the fabric about

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.310 
fold on the width of the fabric about
two<00:01:13.860> centimeters<00:01:14.790> long<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:15.720> straighten<00:01:16.229> it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
two centimeters long then straighten it

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.200 
two centimeters long then straighten it
so<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.619> gets<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.860> nice<00:01:17.250> crease<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.090> you're

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
so it gets that nice crease and you're

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.969

gonna do it to the other side and you're

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.100 
gonna do it to the other side and you're
gonna<00:01:20.070> end<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.810> gonna<00:01:21.930> look
