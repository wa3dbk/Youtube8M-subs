00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
up and the main thing is to make a wheel

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.689 
up and the main thing is to make a wheel
not<00:02:47.780> too<00:02:48.079> back<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:48.980> forth<00:02:49.189> but<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.430> spin

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:49.699 
not too back and forth but to spin

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.670 
not too back and forth but to spin
freely<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:50.810> that's<00:02:50.959> what<00:02:51.109> you<00:02:51.230> want<00:02:51.379> you<00:02:51.590> don't

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
freely so that's what you want you don't

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.800 
freely so that's what you want you don't
want<00:02:51.889> too<00:02:52.069> much<00:02:52.219> motion<00:02:52.579> in<00:02:52.969> in<00:02:53.419> the<00:02:53.540> wheel<00:02:53.689> but

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
want too much motion in in the wheel but

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.970 
want too much motion in in the wheel but
you<00:02:53.900> don't<00:02:54.049> want<00:02:54.199> it<00:02:54.260> too<00:02:54.379> tight<00:02:54.409> either<00:02:54.799> and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
you don't want it too tight either and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.830 
you don't want it too tight either and
that's<00:02:55.099> what<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.340> want<00:02:55.549> and<00:02:55.760> that's<00:02:55.909> yeah<00:02:56.389> so

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
there are different colored wheels down

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.399 
there are different colored wheels down
here<00:02:59.299> what's<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.629> difference<00:02:59.930> between<00:03:00.169> a

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
here what's the difference between a

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.439 
here what's the difference between a
white<00:03:00.949> wheel<00:03:01.129> and<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.430> colored<00:03:01.699> wheel<00:03:01.849> there's

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:02.449 
white wheel and a colored wheel there's

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.119 
white wheel and a colored wheel there's
clear<00:03:03.079> wheels<00:03:03.349> there's<00:03:03.620> white<00:03:03.769> wheels<00:03:03.980> with

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
clear wheels there's white wheels with

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.470 
clear wheels there's white wheels with
black<00:03:04.340> wheels<00:03:04.519> these<00:03:04.909> are<00:03:04.969> a<00:03:05.150> regular

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
black wheels these are a regular

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.670 
black wheels these are a regular
skateboard<00:03:05.870> wheel<00:03:06.049> these<00:03:06.319> are<00:03:06.469> what<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.620> call

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
skateboard wheel these are what you call

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.259 
skateboard wheel these are what you call
a<00:03:06.859> cruise<00:03:07.129> or<00:03:07.159> a<00:03:07.340> longboard<00:03:07.730> wheel<00:03:07.969> and<00:03:08.180> what

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
a cruise or a longboard wheel and what

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.869 
a cruise or a longboard wheel and what
this<00:03:08.419> is<00:03:08.599> is<00:03:08.780> just<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:09.049> softer<00:03:09.530> wheel<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:10.579> go<00:03:10.699> on

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
this is is just a softer wheel to go on

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.879 
this is is just a softer wheel to go on
a<00:03:10.909> board<00:03:11.180> that's<00:03:11.389> gonna<00:03:11.510> be<00:03:11.750> sort<00:03:12.199> of<00:03:12.290> more<00:03:12.469> all

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
a board that's gonna be sort of more all

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.920 
a board that's gonna be sort of more all
terrains<00:03:13.370> can<00:03:13.609> be<00:03:13.669> on<00:03:13.760> rougher<00:03:14.090> streets<00:03:14.750> or

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
terrains can be on rougher streets or

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.899 
terrains can be on rougher streets or
all<00:03:15.079> kinds<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.620> yeah<00:03:15.919> terrain<00:03:16.519> so<00:03:16.669> that's<00:03:16.819> what

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
all kinds of yeah terrain so that's what

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.999 
all kinds of yeah terrain so that's what
we've<00:03:17.030> got<00:03:17.180> there<00:03:17.419> as<00:03:17.540> well<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.930> set<00:03:18.769> out<00:03:18.799> a

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:19.009 
we've got there as well you set out a

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:20.499 
we've got there as well you set out a
couple<00:03:19.220> of<00:03:19.370> different<00:03:19.489> types<00:03:19.909> here<00:03:20.180> what<00:03:20.359> are

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:20.509 
couple of different types here what are

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.199 
couple of different types here what are
they<00:03:21.009> well<00:03:22.009> this<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.400> longboard<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:23.000> drop

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
they well this is a longboard to drop

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.619 
they well this is a longboard to drop
through<00:03:23.479> construction<00:03:24.109> which<00:03:24.290> pretty<00:03:25.129> much

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
through construction which pretty much

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.949 
through construction which pretty much
the<00:03:26.629> board<00:03:26.900> drops<00:03:27.290> through<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:28.129> actual<00:03:28.959> deck

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
the board drops through the actual deck

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.319 
the board drops through the actual deck
and<00:03:30.349> it<00:03:30.799> lowers<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.430> center<00:03:31.639> of<00:03:31.849> gravity<00:03:32.180> of

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
and it lowers the center of gravity of

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.030 
and it lowers the center of gravity of
the<00:03:32.359> board<00:03:32.720> which<00:03:32.900> gives<00:03:33.139> it<00:03:33.290> quicker<00:03:33.590> turning

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
the board which gives it quicker turning

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.439 
the board which gives it quicker turning
radius<00:03:34.340> almost<00:03:34.609> like<00:03:34.699> being<00:03:34.819> in<00:03:34.939> a<00:03:35.000> go-cart

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
radius almost like being in a go-cart

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.999 
radius almost like being in a go-cart
and<00:03:35.750> you<00:03:35.930> turn<00:03:36.139> the<00:03:36.290> steering<00:03:36.349> you<00:03:36.650> how<00:03:36.769> quick

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:37.009 
and you turn the steering you how quick

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.979 
and you turn the steering you how quick
the<00:03:37.129> corner<00:03:37.579> that's<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.419> same<00:03:38.629> thing<00:03:38.870> you're

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
the corner that's the same thing you're

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.420 
the corner that's the same thing you're
down<00:03:39.139> low<00:03:39.349> to<00:03:39.409> the<00:03:39.500> ground<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:40.009> this<00:03:40.189> this

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
down low to the ground and this this

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.920 
down low to the ground and this this
gets<00:03:40.549> you<00:03:40.699> from<00:03:40.819> A<00:03:40.939> to<00:03:40.970> B<00:03:41.120> now<00:03:41.389> this<00:03:41.540> is<00:03:41.689> just

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
gets you from A to B now this is just

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.219 
gets you from A to B now this is just
what<00:03:42.049> this<00:03:42.139> is<00:03:42.319> the<00:03:42.470> retro<00:03:42.919> 70s<00:03:43.579> version<00:03:44.389> of<00:03:44.629> it

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:45.229 
what this is the retro 70s version of it

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.289 
what this is the retro 70s version of it
and<00:03:45.439> it's<00:03:45.919> what<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:46.459> boards<00:03:46.699> were<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:47.120> deck

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
and it's what the boards were the deck

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.819 
and it's what the boards were the deck
hasn't<00:03:47.569> changed<00:03:47.810> from<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.019> 70s<00:03:48.439> the<00:03:48.590> trucks

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
hasn't changed from the 70s the trucks

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.170 
hasn't changed from the 70s the trucks
wheels<00:03:49.069> and<00:03:49.280> bearings<00:03:49.400> have<00:03:49.699> they're<00:03:50.030> like

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
wheels and bearings have they're like

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.300 
wheels and bearings have they're like
mini<00:03:50.479> versions<00:03:50.870> of<00:03:50.989> these<00:03:51.079> now<00:03:51.349> yeah

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
mini versions of these now yeah

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.249 
mini versions of these now yeah
which<00:03:52.639> really<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.509> can<00:03:53.870> put<00:03:53.989> this<00:03:54.049> in<00:03:54.169> the

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:54.259 
which really you can put this in the

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.679 
which really you can put this in the
backpack<00:03:54.680> go<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.400> school<00:03:55.729> you<00:03:56.389> know<00:03:56.419> wherever

backpack go to school you know wherever

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.449 
backpack go to school you know wherever
you<00:03:56.840> want<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.049> do<00:03:57.169> go<00:03:57.349> to<00:03:57.379> work<00:03:57.650> on<00:03:57.889> it<00:03:58.040> but<00:03:58.280> yet

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
you want to do go to work on it but yet

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.159 
you want to do go to work on it but yet
you<00:03:58.549> can<00:03:58.729> you<00:03:58.969> know<00:03:59.090> tuck<00:03:59.599> it<00:03:59.719> away<00:03:59.840> it's<00:04:00.109> a

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
you can you know tuck it away it's a

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.830 
you can you know tuck it away it's a
little<00:04:00.379> easier<00:04:00.709> to<00:04:01.269> tow<00:04:02.269> it<00:04:02.329> around<00:04:02.419> than<00:04:02.719> this

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
little easier to tow it around than this

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.909 
little easier to tow it around than this
one<00:04:03.019> here<00:04:03.199> so<00:04:03.409> that's<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.739> difference

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
one here so that's the difference

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.740 
one here so that's the difference
between<00:04:04.069> those<00:04:04.430> are<00:04:04.549> these<00:04:04.729> are<00:04:04.819> Cruiser<00:04:05.120> mini

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
between those are these are Cruiser mini

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.539 
between those are these are Cruiser mini
cruisers<00:04:06.199> and<00:04:06.409> what<00:04:07.009> this<00:04:07.129> is<00:04:07.310> where

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
cruisers and what this is where

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:08.740 
cruisers and what this is where
skateboarding<00:04:07.909> sort<00:04:08.060> of<00:04:08.120> started<00:04:08.539> and<00:04:08.629> they

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
skateboarding sort of started and they

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.569 
skateboarding sort of started and they
made<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:08.930> ball<00:04:09.199> through<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.769> this<00:04:09.949> yeah<00:04:10.189> so

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
made a ball through to this yeah so

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.279 
made a ball through to this yeah so
we've<00:04:11.120> been<00:04:11.239> talking<00:04:11.569> about<00:04:11.629> the<00:04:11.870> skateboard

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:12.289 
we've been talking about the skateboard

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:14.289 
we've been talking about the skateboard
camp<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:13.099> you're<00:04:13.219> offering<00:04:13.400> throughout<00:04:13.879> the

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
camp that you're offering throughout the

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.410 
camp that you're offering throughout the
summer<00:04:14.509> and<00:04:14.840> the

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
summer and the

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.970 
summer and the
on<00:04:15.540> one<00:04:15.750> lesson<00:04:15.990> and<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.590> mentioned<00:04:16.859> that<00:04:16.889> you

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
on one lesson and you mentioned that you

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.800 
on one lesson and you mentioned that you
get<00:04:17.160> people<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.549> come<00:04:17.609> in<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.269> they<00:04:18.480> need<00:04:18.690> to

get people that come in and they need to

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.319 
get people that come in and they need to
be<00:04:18.930> set<00:04:19.350> up<00:04:19.500> is<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.370> affordable<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.910> start<00:04:21.239> with

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
us we've pretty much eliminated the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.470 
us we've pretty much eliminated the
garbage<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.160> bars<00:04:26.700> that<00:04:26.760> do<00:04:27.030> not<00:04:27.210> function
