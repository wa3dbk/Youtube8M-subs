00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.530 
to and I don't know if they're trying to
make<00:01:34.530> more<00:01:34.740> realistic<00:01:35.150> or<00:01:36.150> what<00:01:36.360> their

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
make more realistic or what their

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.670 
make more realistic or what their
thought<00:01:36.810> process<00:01:37.380> was<00:01:37.619> behind<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.540> but<00:01:39.680> yeah

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
thought process was behind this but yeah

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.880 
thought process was behind this but yeah
that<00:01:40.799> was<00:01:40.920> almost<00:01:41.009> another<00:01:41.369> triple<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:43.530> I'm

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that was almost another triple and I'm

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.410 
that was almost another triple and I'm
telling<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.460> guns<00:01:44.700> not<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.180> good<00:01:45.390> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
telling you this guns not that good I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.940 
telling you this guns not that good I
just<00:01:45.540> happen<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.740> lucky

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
just happen to be really really lucky

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.010 
just happen to be really really lucky
and<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:49.140> guns<00:01:49.649> pretty<00:01:50.100> solid<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.180> an<00:01:51.570> extent

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and the guns pretty solid to an extent

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.109 
and the guns pretty solid to an extent
but<00:01:52.380> almost<00:01:52.890> every<00:01:53.159> other<00:01:53.250> gun<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.909> game

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
but almost every other gun in this game

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.590 
but almost every other gun in this game
is<00:01:54.390> stronger<00:01:54.840> than<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.570> I

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
is stronger than it and it you know I

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.670 
is stronger than it and it you know I
just<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.110> use<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.350> because<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.619> is

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
just like to use it because this is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.020 
just like to use it because this is
shotgun<00:01:59.100> something<00:01:59.369> rewarding<00:01:59.850> about

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
shotgun something rewarding about

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.700 
shotgun something rewarding about
killing<00:02:00.329> somebody<00:02:00.479> with<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.350> obviously

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
killing somebody with it but obviously

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.780 
killing somebody with it but obviously
when<00:02:01.829> you're<00:02:01.890> aimed<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.219> sight<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.670> see

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
when you're aimed on sight you can see

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.090 
when you're aimed on sight you can see
exactly<00:02:03.060> how<00:02:03.450> long<00:02:03.840> between<00:02:04.380> shots<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.070> have

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
exactly how long between shots you have

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.219 
exactly how long between shots you have
to<00:02:05.340> shoot<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.729> shotgun<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.420> even<00:02:06.689> when

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
to shoot with the shotgun so even when

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.630 
to shoot with the shotgun so even when
you<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:07.469> those<00:02:07.590> close<00:02:07.890> range<00:02:08.190> kills<00:02:08.429> where

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
you have those close range kills where

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.190 
you have those close range kills where
you<00:02:08.729> shoot<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.970> guy<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.420> don't<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:10.170> know

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
you shoot a guy and you don't you know

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.350 
you shoot a guy and you don't you know
you<00:02:10.349> know<00:02:10.590> if<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.099> doesn't<00:02:11.280> kill<00:02:11.670> him<00:02:11.910> you're

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
you know if it doesn't kill him you're

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.640 
you know if it doesn't kill him you're
basically<00:02:12.750> dead<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.379> have

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
basically dead so you have

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.190 
basically dead so you have
to<00:02:13.829> make<00:02:13.980> every<00:02:14.310> shot<00:02:14.579> count<00:02:14.640> if<00:02:15.599> you<00:02:15.959> don't

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
to make every shot count if you don't

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.110 
to make every shot count if you don't
you're<00:02:16.709> screwed<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.489> don't<00:02:17.700> like<00:02:17.879> that<00:02:18.060> I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
you're screwed and I don't like that I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.580 
you're screwed and I don't like that I
think<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.450> needs<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:18.720> have<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> better<00:02:19.140> rate<00:02:19.439> of

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
think it needs to have a better rate of

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.860 
think it needs to have a better rate of
fire<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.849> I<00:02:20.879> don't<00:02:21.060> think<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.299> damage<00:02:21.689> really

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
fire so I don't think the damage really

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.630 
fire so I don't think the damage really
needs<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.290> buffed<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.430> think<00:02:23.549> they

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
needs to be buffed I just think they

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.890 
needs to be buffed I just think they
could<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:23.879> something<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.329> make<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.540> shoot<00:02:24.870> a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
could do something to make it shoot a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.899 
could do something to make it shoot a
little<00:02:25.260> faster<00:02:25.680> because<00:02:25.860> basically<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.640> shot

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
little faster because basically a shot

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.410 
little faster because basically a shot
every<00:02:27.209> two<00:02:27.930> seconds<00:02:28.439> is<00:02:28.829> not<00:02:29.730> sufficient<00:02:30.269> and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
every two seconds is not sufficient and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.979 
every two seconds is not sufficient and
it's<00:02:30.599> hipfire<00:02:31.079> spread<00:02:31.109> is<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:32.220> abysmal<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
it's hipfire spread is is abysmal so the

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.899 
it's hipfire spread is is abysmal so the
guns<00:02:34.170> not<00:02:34.349> bad<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:35.459> that's<00:02:35.579> basically

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
guns not bad but that's basically

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.429 
guns not bad but that's basically
because<00:02:36.209> this<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.689> Killzone<00:02:37.109> you've<00:02:37.290> got

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
because this is Killzone you've got

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.470 
because this is Killzone you've got
close<00:02:37.680> quarters<00:02:38.159> it's<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.849> standard<00:02:39.209> Arena

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
close quarters it's a standard Arena

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.229 
close quarters it's a standard Arena
type<00:02:39.720> FPS<00:02:40.170> visually<00:02:41.069> enhanced<00:02:41.549> beautiful

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
favorite weapon even beyond the fact

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.160 
favorite weapon even beyond the fact
that<00:02:56.639> it's<00:02:56.819> not<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.030> best<00:02:57.450> it's<00:02:57.720> really<00:02:58.049> not

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
that it's not the best it's really not

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.479 
that it's not the best it's really not
that<00:02:58.230> good<00:02:58.560> at<00:02:58.650> all<00:02:58.829> but<00:02:59.189> there's<00:02:59.340> always

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
that good at all but there's always

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.699 
that good at all but there's always
something<00:02:59.909> fun<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.389> rewarding<00:03:00.599> behind<00:03:01.349> using

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
something fun and rewarding behind using

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.789 
something fun and rewarding behind using
a<00:03:02.180> pump-action<00:03:03.180> shotgun<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.019> every<00:03:04.349> game<00:03:04.560> is

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
a pump-action shotgun and every game is

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.580 
a pump-action shotgun and every game is
just<00:03:04.980> something<00:03:05.370> appealing<00:03:05.700> about<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.590> but

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
just something appealing about it but

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.800 
just something appealing about it but
anyways<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.159> gun<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.459> pretty<00:03:08.700> solid<00:03:08.909> to<00:03:09.689> an

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
anyways the gun is pretty solid to an

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.599 
anyways the gun is pretty solid to an
extent<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.439> have<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.769> be<00:03:10.859> in<00:03:10.950> close<00:03:11.159> quarters

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
extent you have to be in close quarters

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.099 
extent you have to be in close quarters
and<00:03:11.730> there<00:03:11.819> are<00:03:11.970> some<00:03:12.180> medium-range<00:03:12.750> maps

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
and there are some medium-range maps

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.780 
and there are some medium-range maps
where<00:03:13.349> this<00:03:13.500> gun<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.889> just<00:03:14.099> pretty<00:03:14.280> much<00:03:14.519> not

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
where this gun is just pretty much not

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.750 
where this gun is just pretty much not
even<00:03:14.819> worth<00:03:15.209> using<00:03:16.099> what<00:03:17.099> I<00:03:17.129> do<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.459> equipped

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
even worth using what I do have equipped

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.189 
even worth using what I do have equipped
on<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.030> though<00:03:18.120> because<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.419> am<00:03:18.720> in<00:03:19.019> the

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
on it though because I am in the

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.650 
on it though because I am in the
category<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.799> do<00:03:19.949> have<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.669> ability<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.120> revive

teammates spawning on right now we have

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.240

people look at this game like wow that's

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.210 
people look at this game like wow that's
not<00:03:48.840> right<00:03:49.019> because<00:03:49.079> technically<00:03:49.949> we<00:03:50.069> have

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
not right because technically we have

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.890 
not right because technically we have
them<00:03:50.370> spawn<00:03:50.669> locked<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.510> one<00:03:51.659> thing<00:03:51.840> about

them spawn locked the one thing about

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.960 
them spawn locked the one thing about
Killzone<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:52.829> this<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.340> something<00:03:53.549> that<00:03:53.669> many

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
Killzone and this is something that many

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.599 
Killzone and this is something that many
other<00:03:54.239> games<00:03:54.569> do<00:03:54.870> not<00:03:55.169> do<00:03:56.010> properly

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
other games do not do properly

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.580 
other games do not do properly
there<00:03:57.060> are<00:03:57.180> turrets<00:03:57.540> for<00:03:57.720> people<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.109> extend

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
there are turrets for people that extend

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.289 
there are turrets for people that extend
too<00:03:58.769> close<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.340> base<00:03:59.489> which<00:03:59.760> kills<00:04:00.060> people

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
too close to the base which kills people

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.420 
too close to the base which kills people
which<00:04:00.989> means<00:04:01.290> that's<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.650> no-no<00:04:01.829> don't<00:04:02.190> go<00:04:02.310> in

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
which means that's a no-no don't go in

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.439 
which means that's a no-no don't go in
there<00:04:02.549> unless<00:04:02.699> you<00:04:02.819> want<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.000> die<00:04:03.180> if<00:04:03.359> you're

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
there unless you want to die if you're

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:04.670 
there unless you want to die if you're
into<00:04:03.659> that<00:04:03.750> kind<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:04.049> stuff<00:04:04.260> yeah<00:04:04.440> we<00:04:04.560> got

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
into that kind of stuff yeah we got

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.430 
into that kind of stuff yeah we got
turrets<00:04:04.889> for<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.690> but<00:04:06.690> seriously<00:04:07.199> get

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
turrets for you but seriously get

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.599

revived buddy

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.180 
revived buddy
but<00:04:09.449> the<00:04:09.569> real<00:04:10.079> situation<00:04:10.260> is<00:04:10.799> there<00:04:10.979> are<00:04:11.069> also

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
but the real situation is there are also

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.149 
but the real situation is there are also
barriers<00:04:11.849> where<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.769> teammate<00:04:14.069> that's

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
barriers where the the teammate that's

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.349 
barriers where the the teammate that's
pushing<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.549> their<00:04:14.669> spawn<00:04:14.879> can<00:04:15.060> shoot<00:04:15.209> out<00:04:15.329> of

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
pushing in their spawn can shoot out of

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.839 
pushing in their spawn can shoot out of
but<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.320> aggressors<00:04:16.769> cannot<00:04:17.250> shoot

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
but the the aggressors cannot shoot

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.219 
but the the aggressors cannot shoot
through<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.299> so<00:04:18.419> they're<00:04:18.630> just<00:04:18.810> technically

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
through it so they're just technically

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.779 
through it so they're just technically
vulnerable<00:04:19.829> to<00:04:19.949> if<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.159> get<00:04:20.340> too<00:04:20.519> close

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
vulnerable to if you get too close

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:21.830 
vulnerable to if you get too close
you're<00:04:20.940> gonna<00:04:21.030> be<00:04:21.209> able<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.419> get<00:04:21.510> killed<00:04:21.719> while

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
you're gonna be able to get killed while

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.240 
you're gonna be able to get killed while
they<00:04:21.989> can't<00:04:22.200> die<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:22.620> that<00:04:22.710> makes<00:04:22.860> them<00:04:23.010> safe

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
they can't die and that makes them safe

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.890 
they can't die and that makes them safe
on<00:04:23.490> top<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.150> having<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.510> turrets<00:04:24.810> is

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
on top of that having the turrets is

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.019 
on top of that having the turrets is
extra<00:04:25.139> defense<00:04:25.469> you<00:04:26.279> can<00:04:26.310> spoil<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:26.909> trap

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:27.029 
extra defense you can spoil and trap

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.560 
extra defense you can spoil and trap
people<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.360> can

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
people you can

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.510 
people you can
kind<00:04:27.690> of<00:04:27.780> locked<00:04:28.260> down<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.710> fight<00:04:28.920> in<00:04:29.130> one

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
kind of locked down the fight in one

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.660 
kind of locked down the fight in one
general<00:04:29.970> area<00:04:30.380> but<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.590> be<00:04:31.740> fair<00:04:32.010> about<00:04:32.280> it

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
general area but to be fair about it

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.070 
general area but to be fair about it
look<00:04:33.120> at<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.330> game<00:04:33.480> right<00:04:33.660> now<00:04:33.690> we've<00:04:33.930> had
