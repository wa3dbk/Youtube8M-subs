00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello I'm marco gerace and welcome to this new lesson of the course 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.879
 modern guitar multimedia 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.419
 in this lesson I want to talk about the major agreements open position 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.720
 and open position agreements are agreements that can be executed 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.429
 eheim first handle on the guitar ie in the first part 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.159
 from the keyboard on the first keys 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:32.039
 it is composed of the use of so much and empty cor so some notes come 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.220
 pressed for me only left hand 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.220
 and other notes instead are performed using the empty strings 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.120
 omnia these chords can be played only in the position in which 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.410
 we will learn unlike instead of other agreements &amp; amp 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.949
 of which we will deal in one of the upcoming elections 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.260
 so-called mobile position agreements as these other agreements precisely 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.920
 they do not require the use of empty ropes can be freely 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.260
 move away 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.890
 along the handle 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.270
 but let us dedicate ourselves to agreements in the open position 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.570
 let's not start with the first agreement 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.750
 of the five impossible agreements that you can perform open position on 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.490
 guitar 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.210
 the first agreement we make and the major 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.210
 the fingering to perform this chord is this 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.470
 as we can see then the court followed allowed 3d as much the finger 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.700
 number 2 number three is number one 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.110
 and by means of three ropes to empty that is the sixth 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.510
 the second 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.620
 it is the first hahaha 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.880
 you will notice that the chord at the bottom of this chord is its own night 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.240
 In fact, the sixth string of the empty guitar is a low mix 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.109
 milano this because all the agreements we will study 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.999
 you won't notice it let's say as we go 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:48.060
 him to understand 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.630
 it is a cloth on the bottom the same note that is beautiful but the agreement is the so-called note 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.990
 fundamental 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.110
 hernia then I will go on to study the next agreement 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.700
 away in the agreement of the greater the fingering people this agreement for 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 this 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.589
 in this case instead the fingers being used are finger number one number 2 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:18.049
 number 3 I remember that the fingers are numbered from the index to the little finger 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.189
 the one is the index the middle duel 3 annular 4 the little finger 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.719
 we said then the number one finger number 2 number 3 is used on the 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.569
 fourth third second string in this case instead vacuum are used 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.509
 last the fifth p 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:33.699
 and the track 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:37.399
 the fifth as it was. for me it is precisely the fundamental note of the 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:39.480
 agreement in fact that is a note of life 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.629
 immunity 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.629
 ok let's go ahead and study the major king agreement 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.619
 the major king's agreement to these fingering i 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.430
 in this case the fingers are 1 2 3 answers at first for rope 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.530
 and we will have as a note at the bottom the empty record there is the fourth for the fourth string 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.959
 guitar rating 123 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.399
 a note to say 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:12.209
 we have hahaha see the agreement report that the agreement of C major la 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.209
 fingering and this 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.919
 this the first chord that has the fundamental note comes out the note that beautiful but 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.919
 the agreement no longer to vote but pressed in the keyboard this note is in fact the 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.539
 doping and are there 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.479
 on the fourth alter-rescue string 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.289
 however after that credit number 2 is used on the fourth string is 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:37.320
 son of number 1 on the second coast 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.249
 third 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:40.860
 to unload a rope - play empty 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.749
 the 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:47.189
 eh you will notice from the graph my left that the sixth chord a x in the diagram 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.359
 just put the nut just before 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.430
 these meste indicate that that rope does not have to be 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.999
 played 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:59.680
 in fact that agreement we say no one used to form the agreement 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.889
 therefore in the execution of the agreement we should leave 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.730
 elda the fifth string ca. note how nice but the agreement tim giugliano 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.319
 we study the last agreement with the greater access liberalization la 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.319
 fingering this 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.340
 also in this case fundamental note e 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.140
 presentasti was a bandit number 3 is on the sixth string on the third fret 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.099
 and the fingers involved in the deal are the trail 2 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:32.710
 eeeh the 4 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.710
 and the other weight ropes are pressed had 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.389
 ok, I would only like to hear about the election 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.880
 make an observation regarding the way of disks to position the left hand 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.770
 on the handle on the keyboard 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.389
 as you may have noticed 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.139
 the fingers of the left hand are always position years 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.250
 perpendicular to the keys 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.189
 if they come from above 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:04.929
 eh go to hit the strings with the last phalanx arranged in brusson way 

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:09.550
 perpendicularly this because to me because the position of the hand de 

00:05:09.549 --> 00:05:13.710
 dios must allow to be able to play even the strings that are below 

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:14.860
 a rope that comes 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.009
 when pressed on the keyboard the central do major is affected mojito 3 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:20.089
 perpendicular 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:23.999
 grandmother would be possible to play the string number four a key back 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.460
 because finger 3 would prevent it. the vibration of the rope 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.860
 to do this then the thumb must be placed 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.600
 slightly back on the handle 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.900
 let's say in the higher back 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.100
 of the edict handle accordingly must. go and hit the ropes so 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.129
 perpendicular 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.509
 for this lesson we will deal with everything in the next lesson 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.630
 of the first notions of rhythmic pennate 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.560
 % of quarter-octave combinations to execute the chords precisely for 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.779
 middle of the right hand 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.569
 I then give the approximation appointment thanks for having 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:03.810
 watched this video 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.740
 has the next one
