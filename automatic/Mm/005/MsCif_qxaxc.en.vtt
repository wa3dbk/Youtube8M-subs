that boss I thought there is nothing
more<00:00:09.719> annoying<00:00:09.900> than<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.469> cows<00:00:10.679> elemental

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
more annoying than the cows elemental

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.580 
more annoying than the cows elemental
but<00:00:11.519> apparently<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.139> thing<00:00:13.440> is

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
but apparently that is and that thing is

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.060 
but apparently that is and that thing is
Jan<00:00:13.830> mole<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:15.080> after<00:00:16.080> switching<00:00:16.440> different

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
Jan mole and after switching different

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.820 
Jan mole and after switching different
kind<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.400> gears<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:18.119> realized<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.869> using<00:00:19.560> full

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
kind of gears I realized that using full

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.250 
kind of gears I realized that using full
day<00:00:20.039> doc<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.880> best<00:00:21.060> option<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.660> kill<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
day doc is the best option to kill the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.439 
day doc is the best option to kill the
giant<00:00:22.529> mole<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.340> got<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> full<00:00:23.850> day<00:00:24.000> dog

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
giant mole so I got the full day dog

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.960 
giant mole so I got the full day dog
I<00:00:24.480> got<00:00:24.990> also<00:00:25.380> my<00:00:25.500> abyssal<00:00:25.920> whip<00:00:26.130> because<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
I got also my abyssal whip because you

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.480 
I got also my abyssal whip because you
have<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.300> get<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.170> health<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.800> it's

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
have to get it to have health and it's

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.370 
have to get it to have health and it's
more<00:00:29.699> efficient<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> Bissell

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
more efficient to do it with a Bissell

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.709 
more efficient to do it with a Bissell
whip<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.769> then<00:00:31.920> after<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.969> use<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
whip and then after that you use the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.420 
whip and then after that you use the
data<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.760> I<00:00:35.960> don't<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:37.200> how<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:38.219> is

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
data and I don't know how this is

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.280 
data and I don't know how this is
sometimes<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.329> happens<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> don't

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
sometimes that happens that I don't

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.619 
sometimes that happens that I don't
realize<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.980> something<00:00:41.399> happened<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.120> he

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
realize that something happened like he

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.650 
realize that something happened like he
hit<00:00:42.840> me<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.379> had<00:00:43.559> 15<00:00:43.980> health<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:45.270> did<00:00:45.450> not

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
hit me and I had 15 health and I did not

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.590 
hit me and I had 15 health and I did not
realize<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.980> chased<00:00:47.550> him<00:00:47.879> then<00:00:48.480> I

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
realize that and I chased him then I

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.830 
realize that and I chased him then I
found<00:00:48.780> him<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.340> he<00:00:50.340> basically<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:51.360> hit<00:00:51.570> me

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
found him and he basically one hit me

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.130 
found him and he basically one hit me
and<00:00:52.190> at<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.250> point<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.030> started<00:00:54.270> panicking<00:00:54.629> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
and at that point I started panicking it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.420 
and at that point I started panicking it

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
but then i realized it's not enough time

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.330 
but then i realized it's not enough time
because<00:01:29.640> when<00:01:29.820> i'm<00:01:29.970> recording<00:01:30.299> i<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.380> you

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
because when i'm recording i can see you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.819 
because when i'm recording i can see you
know<00:01:32.490> time<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.479> i<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.290> over<00:01:34.470> one

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
know time so i know that it's over one

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.010 
know time so i know that it's over one
minute<00:01:35.009> already<00:01:35.369> passed<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.210> i<00:01:36.600> don't<00:01:36.869> have

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
minute already passed so i don't have

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.440 
minute already passed so i don't have
much<00:01:37.200> time<00:01:37.409> left<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.610> thought<00:01:39.060> okay<00:01:39.390> I'll

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
much time left so I thought okay I'll

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
much time left so I thought okay I'll
