Cabbage is the delicious, nutritious king of cool-weather crops in North Carolina.
00:00:07.42,00:00:01.56 
It may seem quite common.
00:00:08.98,00:00:03.74 
But it joins the rank of nutrition royalty when it comes
00:00:12.72,00:00:02.78 
to its crowning achievement as a cancer inhibitor.
00:00:15.50,00:00:02.39

00:00:17.89,00:00:05.59 
Let me share useful and interesting information about this hearty, ancient vegetable.
00:00:23.48,00:00:06.25 
Because cabbage grows best in cool climates, stores well and provides a high yield per acre,
00:00:29.73,00:00:03.49 
it has a history of being a major, staple crop.
00:00:33.22,00:00:07.10 
Cabbage has been cultivated for over 4,000 years and is traditionally associated with the Irish.
00:00:40.32,00:00:05.41 
French navigators introduced cabbage to America in the 1500s.
00:00:45.73,00:00:03.96 
Cabbage is one of the richest foods when it comes to protective vitamins.
00:00:49.69,00:00:04.81 
Hailed as a cancer inhibitor, particularly colon cancer,
00:00:54.50,00:00:05.32 
cabbage also stimulates the immune system, kills harmful bacteria,
00:00:59.82,00:00:03.51 
soothes ulcers and improves circulation.
00:01:03.33,00:00:04.93 
The outer leaves are a good source of vitamin E, making it good for the complexion.
00:01:08.26,00:00:07.19 
It is also rich in vitamin C. Raw cabbage contains as much vitamin C as orange juice.
00:01:15.45,00:00:05.66 
All these benefits are yours at only 24 calories per 3.5 ounces.
00:01:21.11,00:00:04.05 
Varieties of cabbage include many kinds of green cabbage.
00:01:25.16,00:00:03.82 
Red cabbage is often chosen for the color variation.
00:01:28.98,00:00:04.28 
Savoy cabbage, originally from Italy, is used more for salads
00:01:33.26,00:00:02.48 
because of the looser, crinkly leaves.
00:01:35.74,00:00:02.83 
It will keep for only a few days.
00:01:38.57,00:00:04.07 
A fresh head of green or red cabbage should be compact,
00:01:42.64,00:00:04.00 
with outer leaves still firmly attached to the stem.
00:01:46.64,00:00:04.83 
Cabbage fresh from the field will last at least two weeks in the refrigerator.
00:01:51.47,00:00:03.94 
Cabbage will lose freshness rapidly once the head is chopped,
00:01:55.41,00:00:02.74 
so plan on using it within a day.
00:01:58.15,00:00:04.43 
If you only need half a head, place the remaining half in a plastic bag
00:02:02.58,00:00:03.48 
and shake a few drops of water onto the cut side.
00:02:06.06,00:00:02.27 
Close the bag and refrigerate.
00:02:08.33,00:00:04.98 
The cut half should last another few days if it was fresh when you cut it.
00:02:13.31,00:00:03.18 
Always wash cabbage good before using.
00:02:16.49,00:00:03.44 
Tear off outer leaves that look less desirable.
00:02:19.93,00:00:05.99 
Most cooks prefer to trim away the bitter white core of the cabbage before shredding or cooking.
00:02:25.92,00:00:03.29 
Cabbage can be cooked in many ways-steamed, stuffed,
00:02:29.21,00:00:03.61 
microwaved, sauted-- to name just a few.
00:02:32.82,00:00:03.80 
Boiled cooked cabbage often has a bad reputation.
00:02:36.62,00:00:04.54 
The objectionable odors are sulfur compounds being released into the air.
00:02:41.16,00:00:03.81 
But you can get rid of this problem by using this tip.
00:02:44.97,00:00:04.34 
For a three-quart pot, add 1 tablespoon of vinegar to the water.
00:02:49.31,00:00:02.79 
But why would you want to boil cabbage anyway?
00:02:52.10,00:00:05.18 
It is much sweeter and pleasant, retaining more nutrients, when lightly cooked.
00:02:57.28,00:00:04.91 
If you need the leaves whole to stuff, you&amp;apos;ll find it easier to separate them
00:03:02.19,00:00:04.42 
if you core the cabbage and plunge into boiling water for one minute.
00:03:06.61,00:00:04.31 
Drain well, blot dry and proceed to separate the leaves.
00:03:10.92,00:00:03.51
