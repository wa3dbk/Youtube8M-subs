00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.299
 Good day to all 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.520
 and still will not go about victorinox swiss 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.050
 scart-scart classic 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.080
 Swiss company card 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.000
 victorinox such and manicure marching 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.470
 set for girls some man too 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.090
 enjoy but most of course 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.270
 preferring royal knives 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.230
 as a gift for some holiday like 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.360
 small accessory 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.309
 quite physical things let's talk a 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.489
 we will not tell more in detail that on 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.629
 represents how much it costs and where to buy 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.210
 accordingly, it looks like this 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.400
 the box is quite interesting for harder 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.260
 than the knives, that is, you can see the card itself 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.839
 she is not falling out here from here 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.850
 the number of tools is drawn at the back 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.780
 which is a given map and they are all 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.339
 signed in eight world languages 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.739
 consequently I have a classic edge card 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.350
 the simple version is strong again 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.750
 difference from my card is in stock 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.240
 a flashlight and a small Phillips screwdriver 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.430
 and flat but it seems to me not girls 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.380
 especially interesting is the presence of these things map 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.510
 from this I took exactly this version 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.090
 this card 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.580
 when you open that's how it looks 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.190
 the founder is drawn on this side 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.240
 the victorinox company carl is there any left 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.630
 it is written that he founded the company in 1884 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.610
 year 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.710
 of course then started called 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.080
 Victorianx she was called Carl 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.170
 or snow is already after the expiration 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.230
 time she was renamed but so 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.670
 it looks pretty interesting from behind 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.770
 drawn how to use scissors 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.290
 if someone guesses right away 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.770
 let 's talk about the map in more detail 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.860
 such a transparent card used to be 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.090
 the version is just gray but now 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.040
 came on the production of cops and 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.320
 transparent version of the people can see for themselves 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.450
 tools even sugar is much more convenient 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.840
 easier to navigate especially at first 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.020
 in the map tools, let's start with the ruler 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.530
 top here here here comes centimeter 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.850
 ruler on the other hand in inches 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.310
 maybe someone will be comfortable that only 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.560
 to draw then go scissors scissors as in 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.480
 little blades of a quiz player that is 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.459
 small nail clippers you 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.459
 of course they are still cutting well 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.000
 paper 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.800
 fine fabric with them of course everything in 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.080
 okay 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.410
 then night comes if you can 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.500
 call too cut off because it 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.860
 letter fine thread cut like a knife 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.459
 made of the same steel as the usual 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:53.100
 Viktorinoksa of course sharpened in 2-ku 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:58.980
 I think this is not worth it soon 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.980
 knife and then go tweezers 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:09.670
 toothpick thin to handle handle 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.760
 Sorry to write and not as convenient as 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:18.099
 I would like but still sure that 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:22.269
 bath tweet before badly needed can this 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:24.879
 hooks and only for nails 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.099
 only for nails there is a way out 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.219
 on a small screwdriver twist something 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.750
 possible to pick up 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:35.019
 perhaps it will be conveniently small 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:39.010
 this file was the last tool 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.510
 for this pin is on the edge after all 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.939
 actually before the article is pretty 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.019
 problematic especially at first here 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:51.730
 here he is at the very edge 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:54.549
 a small pin pierce something and so 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.200
 This is all that is functional pretty 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.650
 simple but you need a situation with much help 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.650
 of course such cards 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.260
 positioned on girls and maybe 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.209
 such a gift will come in handy 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.169
 small holiday or additions to 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.010
 great gift 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:14.769
 the card costs about 800 to 1200 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.169
 rubles in this configuration in the version with 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.729
 a flashlight with a screwdriver even more I 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.789
 Of course I recommend to buy you this 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.590

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.979
