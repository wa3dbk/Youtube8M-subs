go<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:39.480> and<00:01:39.810> when<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.080> kick<00:01:40.260> releases<00:01:40.770> it's

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
go out and when the kick releases it's

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.800 
go out and when the kick releases it's
gonna<00:01:41.250> pull<00:01:41.580> out<00:01:41.760> and<00:01:41.970> create<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.510> kind<00:01:42.690> of

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
gonna pull out and create this kind of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.660 
gonna pull out and create this kind of
pull<00:01:43.020> sound<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.680> pulsing<00:01:44.190> sound<00:01:44.370> that<00:01:44.580> you

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.350 
down to my lead synth and I'm gonna put
a<00:02:10.260> compressor<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.130> on<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.490> track<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.180> no

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
a compressor in on the track so no

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.640 
a compressor in on the track so no
dynamics<00:02:12.950> compressor<00:02:13.950> bring<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.650> what

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
I will post this setting online on my

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.060 
I will post this setting online on my
muse<00:02:21.660> mode<00:02:21.840> calm<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.260> download<00:02:22.560> section<00:02:22.709> so

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
muse mode calm the download section so

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.800 
muse mode calm the download section so
you<00:02:23.160> could<00:02:23.280> download<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:23.670> preset<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.360> you

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
you could download this preset and you

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.090 
you could download this preset and you
can<00:02:24.930> go<00:02:25.050> from<00:02:25.200> there<00:02:25.350> change<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> presets<00:02:26.010> as

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
can go from there change the presets as

can go from there change the presets as
you<00:02:26.190> like<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.790> anyways<00:02:27.090> I'm<00:02:27.300> sending<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.900> bus

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
you like but anyways I'm sending the bus

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.900 
you like but anyways I'm sending the bus
one<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.620> synth<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.040> I'm<00:02:29.520> gonna<00:02:29.640> bring<00:02:29.850> it

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
one to the synth and I'm gonna bring it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.400 
one to the synth and I'm gonna bring it
into<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.239> sidechain<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.900> compressor

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
into the sidechain of the compressor

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.220 
into the sidechain of the compressor
what<00:02:32.160> sidechain<00:02:32.640> means<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.230> the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
what sidechain means is that the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.810 
what sidechain means is that the
compressor<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.739> gonna<00:02:34.890> listen<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.550> sound

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
compressor is gonna listen to the sound

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.490 
compressor is gonna listen to the sound
that<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.030> coming<00:02:36.090> out<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.510> bus<00:02:36.690> one<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.230> it

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
that is coming out of bus one and it

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.979 
that is coming out of bus one and it
will<00:02:37.590> react<00:02:37.920> accordingly<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:38.730> my<00:02:39.600> sidechain

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
will react accordingly so my sidechain

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.570 
will react accordingly so my sidechain
I'm<00:02:40.080> gonna<00:02:40.230> bring<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.590> in<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.920> listen<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.370> bus

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
I'm gonna bring it in to listen to bus

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.660 
I'm gonna bring it in to listen to bus
one<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.680> I'm<00:02:43.680> gonna<00:02:43.800> go<00:02:43.980> ahead<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.190> start

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
one and I'm gonna go ahead and start

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.100 
one and I'm gonna go ahead and start
pressing<00:02:45.000> play<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.840> will<00:02:45.930> hear<00:02:46.050> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
pressing play and you will hear the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.360 
pressing play and you will hear the
difference<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.770> sound<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.100> I'm<00:02:47.220> going

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
difference in the sound that I'm going

00:02:47.370 --> 00:03:38.660 
difference in the sound that I'm going
to<00:02:47.430> be<00:02:47.520> creating<00:02:48.209> right<00:02:48.330> now

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.530 

all<00:03:39.670> right<00:03:39.849> so<00:03:39.910> I'm<00:03:39.970> going<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.180> go<00:03:40.300> through<00:03:40.510> a

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
all right so I'm going to go through a

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.940 
all right so I'm going to go through a
couple<00:03:40.810> of<00:03:40.870> things<00:03:40.959> that<00:03:41.140> I<00:03:41.200> changed<00:03:41.500> here<00:03:41.709> on

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
couple of things that I changed here on

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.290 
couple of things that I changed here on
my<00:03:42.069> compressor<00:03:42.520> to<00:03:42.610> get<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:42.849> pulsating

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
my compressor to get that pulsating

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.820 
my compressor to get that pulsating
sound<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:44.020> main<00:03:44.170> thing<00:03:44.349> that<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.560> want<00:03:44.739> to

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
sound the main thing that you want to

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.460 
sound the main thing that you want to
have<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.340> very<00:03:45.760> fast<00:03:46.090> attack<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.900> very<00:03:47.200> fast

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
have is a very fast attack a very fast

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.100 
have is a very fast attack a very fast
attack<00:03:47.739> will<00:03:47.890> allow<00:03:48.040> you<00:03:48.099> to<00:03:48.630> hit<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.660> synth

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
attack will allow you to hit that synth

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.229 
attack will allow you to hit that synth
as<00:03:50.230> soon<00:03:50.410> as<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.709> bus<00:03:51.280> one<00:03:51.520> comes<00:03:51.910> in<00:03:52.060> with<00:03:52.209> a

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
as soon as the bus one comes in with a

sound as soon as that signal hits it's

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.610 
sound as soon as that signal hits it's
gonna<00:03:54.069> drop<00:03:54.280> in<00:03:54.550> volume<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.870> synthesize

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
gonna drop in volume on the synthesize

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.350 
gonna drop in volume on the synthesize
so<00:03:56.860> to<00:03:57.040> create<00:03:57.160> that<00:03:57.280> pulsating<00:03:57.880> sound<00:03:58.120> so<00:03:58.300> you

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
so to create that pulsating sound so you

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.750 
so to create that pulsating sound so you
want<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:58.720> very<00:03:59.260> very<00:03:59.530> fast<00:03:59.770> attack<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.520> want<00:04:00.640> a

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
want a very very fast attack you want a

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.520 
want a very very fast attack you want a
kind<00:04:01.060> of<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.239> medium<00:04:01.510> like<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.780> release<00:04:02.020> you

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
kind of a medium like the release you

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.809 
kind of a medium like the release you
could<00:04:02.680> play<00:04:02.830> around<00:04:02.860> thing<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.370> see<00:04:03.489> how<00:04:03.640> much

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
could play around thing and see how much

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.240 
could play around thing and see how much
you<00:04:03.940> want<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.269> synth<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.630> go<00:04:04.780> for<00:04:05.019> and<00:04:05.250> the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
you want the synth to go for and the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.370 
you want the synth to go for and the
ratio<00:04:06.610> you<00:04:06.910> always<00:04:07.599> want<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:07.900> have<00:04:08.110> a<00:04:08.140> very

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
ratio you always want to have a very

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.860 
ratio you always want to have a very
high<00:04:08.680> ratio<00:04:08.970> because<00:04:09.970> I'll<00:04:10.540> show<00:04:10.660> you<00:04:10.750> right

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
high ratio because I'll show you right

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.059 
high ratio because I'll show you right
now<00:04:10.989> if<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:11.200> do<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.410> one<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.769> one<00:04:11.920> ratio

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
now if you do the one to one ratio

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:28.140 
now if you do the one to one ratio
nothing<00:04:13.060> will<00:04:13.180> happen

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.340 

all<00:04:29.150> right<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.420> as<00:04:29.840> you<00:04:29.990> can<00:04:30.110> see<00:04:30.200> there

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
all right so you as you can see there

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.230 
all right so you as you can see there
you<00:04:30.470> want<00:04:30.620> a<00:04:30.680> very<00:04:30.800> high<00:04:31.040> ratio<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.670> your

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
you want a very high ratio and your

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.690 
you want a very high ratio and your
compressor<00:04:32.750> compressor<00:04:33.530> threshold<00:04:34.130> should

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
compressor compressor threshold should

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.070 
compressor compressor threshold should
be<00:04:34.790> also<00:04:35.000> very<00:04:35.360> low<00:04:35.570> you<00:04:35.630> should<00:04:35.720> lower<00:04:35.960> it

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
be also very low you should lower it

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.190 
be also very low you should lower it
because<00:04:36.890> well<00:04:37.520> if<00:04:37.730> it's<00:04:37.880> high<00:04:38.030> again<00:04:38.810> nothing

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
because well if it's high again nothing

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:49.890 
because well if it's high again nothing
will<00:04:39.350> really<00:04:39.500> happen<00:04:39.680> to<00:04:40.130> it

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.029 

so<00:04:50.900> you<00:04:50.990> want<00:04:51.139> that<00:04:51.259> definitely<00:04:51.680> lower<00:04:51.830> the

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
so you want that definitely lower the

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.070 
so you want that definitely lower the
gain<00:04:52.219> over<00:04:52.460> here<00:04:52.729> well<00:04:52.909> kind<00:04:53.539> of<00:04:53.629> mix<00:04:53.749> it<00:04:53.839> into

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
gain over here well kind of mix it into

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.450 
gain over here well kind of mix it into
what<00:04:54.289> your<00:04:54.439> track<00:04:54.650> is<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:54.979> what<00:04:55.069> you<00:04:55.159> feel<00:04:55.339> is

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
what your track is and what you feel is

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.769 
what your track is and what you feel is
right<00:04:55.490> there<00:04:55.819> as<00:04:55.999> well<00:04:56.389> as<00:04:56.449> the<00:04:56.479> limiter

00:04:56.769 --> 00:04:56.779 
right there as well as the limiter

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:58.749 
right there as well as the limiter
threshold<00:04:57.110> kind<00:04:57.319> of<00:04:57.379> mix<00:04:57.529> into<00:04:57.740> what<00:04:57.979> you<00:04:58.520> feel

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
threshold kind of mix into what you feel

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.110 
threshold kind of mix into what you feel
should<00:04:58.939> be<00:04:58.999> the<00:04:59.150> right<00:04:59.270> level<00:05:00.050> for<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:01.120> for

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
should be the right level for the for

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.309 
should be the right level for the for
your<00:05:02.210> sound<00:05:02.389> which<00:05:02.539> aren't<00:05:02.689> trying<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.050> get<00:05:03.169> at

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
your sound which aren't trying to get at

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.230 
your sound which aren't trying to get at
and<00:05:03.499> over<00:05:04.309> here<00:05:04.460> on<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.639> circuit<00:05:04.939> type<00:05:05.089> I

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
and over here on the circuit type I

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.459 
and over here on the circuit type I
encourage<00:05:05.509> you<00:05:05.599> a<00:05:05.629> lot<00:05:05.839> of<00:05:05.930> you<00:05:05.990> guys<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.289> play

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:06.469 
encourage you a lot of you guys to play

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:08.290 
encourage you a lot of you guys to play
through<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.680> circuit<00:05:06.949> types<00:05:07.129> and<00:05:07.370> when<00:05:08.180> I<00:05:08.210> do

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
through the circuit types and when I do

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.610 
through the circuit types and when I do
the<00:05:08.479> pulsating<00:05:08.809> synth<00:05:09.139> I<00:05:09.229> kind<00:05:09.409> of<00:05:09.469> like<00:05:09.589> to

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
the pulsating synth I kind of like to

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.100 
the pulsating synth I kind of like to
use<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:09.889> class<00:05:10.069> au<00:05:10.339> circuit<00:05:10.969> type<00:05:11.120> each

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
use the class au circuit type each

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.600 
use the class au circuit type each
circuit<00:05:12.469> type<00:05:12.620> will<00:05:12.800> have<00:05:12.830> a<00:05:13.039> different<00:05:13.400> sound

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
circuit type will have a different sound

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.459 
circuit type will have a different sound
so<00:05:13.879> let's<00:05:14.059> go<00:05:14.180> through<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.479> now<00:05:14.629> and<00:05:14.870> maybe

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:15.469 
so let's go through that now and maybe

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:16.689 
so let's go through that now and maybe
you'll<00:05:15.650> like<00:05:15.800> another<00:05:16.039> one<00:05:16.219> and<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.580> could

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
you'll like another one and you could

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:17.860 
you'll like another one and you could
play<00:05:16.849> around<00:05:16.939> with<00:05:17.089> it<00:05:17.180> later<00:05:17.360> but<00:05:17.569> I'll<00:05:17.719> show

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
play around with it later but I'll show

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.389 
play around with it later but I'll show
you<00:05:17.900> right<00:05:18.050> now<00:05:18.110> how<00:05:18.680> each<00:05:18.889> one<00:05:19.039> sounds

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:19.399 
you right now how each one sounds

00:05:19.399 --> 00:06:04.170 
you right now how each one sounds
differently

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.980 

all<00:06:05.180> right<00:06:05.300> so<00:06:05.420> those<00:06:05.540> are<00:06:05.660> the<00:06:05.720> different

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
all right so those are the different

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.690 
all right so those are the different
circuit<00:06:06.230> types<00:06:06.380> that<00:06:06.590> you<00:06:07.370> can<00:06:07.490> play<00:06:07.670> around

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
circuit types that you can play around

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
circuit types that you can play around
with<00:06:07.910> and<00:06:08.120> see<00:06:08.210> which<00:06:08.330> ones<00:06:08.480> he<00:06:08.540> likes

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
with and see which ones he likes

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.930 
with and see which ones he likes
actually<00:06:09.050> on<00:06:09.320> this<00:06:09.800> synth<00:06:10.070> the<00:06:10.220> actual<00:06:10.580> opto

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
actually on this synth the actual opto

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.500 
actually on this synth the actual opto
sound<00:06:11.180> actually<00:06:11.450> pretty<00:06:11.630> nice<00:06:11.720> as<00:06:11.900> well<00:06:13.510> so

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
sound actually pretty nice as well so

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.550 
sound actually pretty nice as well so
again<00:06:14.750> I'll<00:06:14.960> take<00:06:15.110> you<00:06:15.170> through<00:06:15.230> it<00:06:15.350> very

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
again I'll take you through it very

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.160 
again I'll take you through it very
quickly<00:06:15.860> again<00:06:16.330> first<00:06:17.330> step<00:06:17.600> you<00:06:17.720> gotta<00:06:17.840> do<00:06:17.990> is

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.170 
quickly again first step you gotta do is

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.200 
quickly again first step you gotta do is
select<00:06:18.380> the<00:06:18.740> sound<00:06:19.310> that<00:06:19.640> you<00:06:19.760> want<00:06:19.790> to

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
select the sound that you want to

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.520 
select the sound that you want to
control<00:06:20.660> the<00:06:20.870> sin<00:06:21.050> that<00:06:21.080> you're<00:06:21.320> trying<00:06:21.470> to

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
control the sin that you're trying to

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.230 
control the sin that you're trying to
pulse<00:06:21.740> so<00:06:22.250> in<00:06:22.400> this<00:06:22.490> case<00:06:22.700> it<00:06:22.820> was<00:06:22.910> my<00:06:23.000> kick

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
pulse so in this case it was my kick

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.910 
pulse so in this case it was my kick
nine<00:06:23.720> times<00:06:23.930> that<00:06:24.020> 10<00:06:24.230> it<00:06:24.350> will<00:06:24.440> be<00:06:24.590> your<00:06:24.710> kick

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
nine times that 10 it will be your kick

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.190
