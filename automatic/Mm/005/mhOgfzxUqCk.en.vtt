randomly in the show needs to be like
some<00:01:54.630> good<00:01:54.840> run<00:01:55.049> away<00:01:55.259> music<00:01:56.270> yeah<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.509> is

some good run away music yeah this is

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.940 
some good run away music yeah this is
like<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> kind<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.259> song<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.439> would<00:01:58.710> come<00:01:58.920> on
