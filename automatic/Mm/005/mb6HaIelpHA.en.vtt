00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.690
 Tennis player Karolina Wozniak was facing a little bit of criticism because 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.559
 From a video delayed by one on the Internet let's take a look 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.449
 Caroline White and Serena Williams even adapt but after all the gel 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.619
 The activation of Max again is the Pol Pot regions number of the world previously but this 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.020
 After the full impression Williams with us spread the church and some 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.220
 But the improvements excuse one of the players fate on our w_t_ however 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.430
 She has a great sat sat be impressive and sometimes brassy brasana 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.010
 I even wonder how good parents were still so fast now that great 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.040
 The question being asked is why racism is that I'm gonna go ahead 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.330
 say 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.049
 And you do not have it deepened after closing it would be racist if uh ... 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:51.569
 AT belongs to only African women of other black women 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:52.170
 But 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.440
 Such as the Caucasus and Impressionism have quantities of rack which is the amount of seat 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.329
 Which is given to prevent 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.760
 Uh ... acting like that would be a deep review 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.049
 As well as 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.709
 This is the largest manufacturer conference here every time the biggest in terms of 

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:13.070
 From 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.090
 Made entirely added Mike erase this would work 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.200
 So okay but this really was not the body in a lot of people know what 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.060
 Take a look 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.010
 To achieve this they were rates 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.830
 The crew so you can ever make it and they go out 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.570
 In the face of black and on the same thing 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.250
 The object that would image 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.140
 But I think this is a verb but there 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.770
 Can I stop after our Miramax to see we had pardon 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.429
 Kind of like some 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.040
 Exhibition about the position of 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.859
 Live CD 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.840
 Or from where it appeared she had done something like that before in 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.050
 Uh ... past and 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.570
 I just wanted to let me personally do not want to draw attention to my 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.210
 Uh ... bets my lady you know he has like 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.380
 Let's not do it if it's comfortable with it, then this is OK and I know you are 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.680
 What I think is to draw attention to the fact that Serena Williams is a brick 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.920
 House oh ... it's my own technology 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.829
 No 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:13.059
 they 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:14.629
 for every 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.990
 It should not be part of the questions that no person is that you know 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.049
 Stream in defense because I think they get a lot of 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.329
 Chris is early because of this real monitoring his entry into the receipt 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.999
 For he wins 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.720
 India Policy in Demand References Even Utilities 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.279
 Be good day care so it is 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.900
 Let's be honest yet is whether it's blue but there is always considered to be 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.769
 To be of African origin 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.859
 The feature is really to have a use of words like a big problem which 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.599
 This is outside of the truth I think it was a huge air which came in with a vague 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.059
 Than you refer you get upset 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:55.849
 She carefully sister that attacked the newspapers the serum black men said 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.329
 Can not be delivered 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.089
 And along with yourself do you mean it to be men 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.879
 pale 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.640
 I think the blog president let them get ridiculed for this 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.150
 Their natural characteristics I think it comes from jealousy to be quite honest 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.990
 With you because there is nothing more sexual than one minute and one agile 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.350
 That's why my whole passion is on the map because of our prayers 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.560
 So we can look at it we have not noticed a situation like I'm more than that 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.489
 Milan looks so right at me 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.689
 This is the kind of body that is really declared though you know a lot clearly 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.159
 People prefer that 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.060
 So I think there's a year for me so it's not like it's clearly negative 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.780
 But what I'm sensing of our progress from India is that it is not 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.239
 Arms development is necessarily so easy 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.149
 There is much better than imminent death and some say from their friends 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:47.439
 Wherever I mean the slides 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.409
 Bus if you know it was not even an agreement 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.819
 This is something that we did not know them may surprise you but 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.639
 Time to send these to reach the moon 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.469
 Because there is no background of that given people 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:59.929
 Confessed issues 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:03.549
 Enemy Attack This is the only thing they were a Mexican American correspondent 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.869
 I reversed 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:08.550
 No I'm not I do not know your unit 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.019
 Of things that 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.239
 This was reversed after a non-racist response 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.249
 Even though 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:16.449
 Point 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.370
 Conduct a discussion about being after the Chilean ten attack that Serena works 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.629
 Something I do not know is Serena Williams uh ... uh ... take on this 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.949
 If you feel offended you do not know I will pull our side Carolina aside from 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.990
 Like what this is the beginning of this task 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.550
 From her lack of response to this kinda I get this and that's their reality 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.020
 Kinda friends I get the sense that it just suggests a kind of funny misery 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.070
 They enjoyed the look if someone came here to follow me 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.729
 And such like 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.870
 The liquid should be with his government but take great action 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.569
 President of my dear friend and I do not think I will but I can see that 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.090
 But it does not make it right 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.179
 So 

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:58.039
 Oh ... Pardon
