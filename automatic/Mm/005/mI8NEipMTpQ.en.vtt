00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
wheat farm I designed it myself and it

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.920 
wheat farm I designed it myself and it
works<00:00:14.519> very<00:00:14.700> well<00:00:17.060> so<00:00:18.060> what<00:00:18.600> you're<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:18.869> to

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
start doing is just making 88 across for

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.169 
start doing is just making 88 across for
your<00:00:27.480> wheat<00:00:27.660> eight<00:00:28.380> across<00:00:28.970> you're<00:00:29.970> going<00:00:30.090> to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
your wheat eight across you're going to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.979 
your wheat eight across you're going to
go<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:31.910> for<00:00:32.910> each<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.600> then<00:00:33.630> you're<00:00:33.899> going

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
go to for each one and then you're going

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.229 
go to for each one and then you're going
to<00:00:34.050> put<00:00:34.200> water<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:36.390> sides<00:00:37.670> by<00:00:38.670> digging<00:00:38.879> one

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
to put water on the sides by digging one

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.950 
to put water on the sides by digging one
down<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:41.480> you're<00:00:42.480> going<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:44.960> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
down and you're going to do that for a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.360 
down and you're going to do that for a
TRO<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.890> 1<00:00:47.160> 2<00:00:47.460> 3<00:00:47.820> 4<00:00:48.379> 5<00:00:49.379> 6<00:00:49.739> 7<00:00:49.980> 8<00:00:50.730> rows<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.949> pasta

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
TRO so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 rows so the pasta

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.939 
TRO so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 rows so the pasta
and<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> long<00:00:55.320> any<00:00:55.710> blocks

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and it's going to be a long any blocks

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.080 
and it's going to be a long any blocks
long<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.750> so<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.859> bet<00:00:59.070> at<00:00:59.460> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
long and so you can get a bet at the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.900 
long and so you can get a bet at the
possibility<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.590> get<00:01:01.770> for<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
possibility of you can get for the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.590 
possibility of you can get for the
amount<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.270> wheat<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:05.210> 64<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.479> get<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
amount of wheat is 64 you can get a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.440 
amount of wheat is 64 you can get a
whole<00:01:06.810> stack<00:01:07.080> 64<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.400> sometimes<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.150> doesn't

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
whole stack 64 but sometimes it doesn't

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.789 
whole stack 64 but sometimes it doesn't
always<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.850> but<00:01:12.140> it<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
always do that but it there is

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.450 
always do that but it there is
possibility<00:01:14.250> though<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.990> you're<00:01:16.200> basically

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
possibility though so you're basically

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.620 
possibility though so you're basically
maximizing<00:01:17.460> your<00:01:17.580> output<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.240> make<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
maximizing your output you can make it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.160 
maximizing your output you can make it
even<00:01:18.780> more<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.009> wanted<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.640> um<00:01:21.170> make

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
even more if you wanted you can um make

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.350 
even more if you wanted you can um make
it<00:01:22.290> longer<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.860> wanted<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.729> more<00:01:23.970> weed<00:01:25.070> um

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
it longer if you wanted get more weed um

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.819 
it longer if you wanted get more weed um
okay<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.630> once<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.590> put

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
okay so once you do that you can put

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.710 
okay so once you do that you can put
glass<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.700> want<00:01:33.380> on<00:01:35.090> over<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> water<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
glass if you want on over the water and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.859 
glass if you want on over the water and
stuff<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:38.970> made<00:01:39.119> stairs<00:01:39.509> up

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
stuff and then I just made stairs up

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.170 
stuff and then I just made stairs up
here<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.610> easier<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.939> plant

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
here because then it's easier to plant

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.149 
here because then it's easier to plant
the<00:01:42.299> wheat<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:45.320> you<00:01:46.320> want<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.619> put<00:01:46.799> many

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the wheat and you want to put many

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.969 
the wheat and you want to put many
torches<00:01:47.610> around<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.270> i<00:01:48.479> did<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.710> i<00:01:49.740> just

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
torches around it like i did so i just

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.420 
torches around it like i did so i just
did<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.369> torch<00:01:51.060> there<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.570> there<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.220> i<00:01:53.220> put

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
did like torch there and there and i put

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.359 
did like torch there and there and i put
many<00:01:53.670> torches<00:01:54.030> down<00:01:54.240> here<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:56.070> glass

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
many torches down here and the glass

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.410 
many torches down here and the glass
helps<00:01:56.969> because<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:59.070> torch<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.790> like<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.329> go

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
helps because the torch is like and go

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.109 
helps because the torch is like and go
through<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> glass<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.700> because<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.850> torch

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
through the glass and because the torch

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.899 
through the glass and because the torch
is<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.380> grow<00:02:04.560> at<00:02:04.710> night<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.219> which

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
is the we can grow at night to which

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.520 
is the we can grow at night to which
maximizes<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.170> your<00:02:07.560> growth<00:02:07.860> rate

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.630 

and<00:02:12.230> if<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.350> want<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.740> can<00:02:13.830> use<00:02:13.890> bone<00:02:14.310> meal

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and if you want you can use bone meal

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.030 
and if you want you can use bone meal
just<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.720> make<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.650> grow<00:02:18.590> then<00:02:19.590> what<00:02:19.920> you're

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
just the make it grow then what you're

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.680 
just the make it grow then what you're
allowed<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.400> do<00:02:20.490> is<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:20.670> put<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.330> lever

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
allowed to do is just put like a lever

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.730 
allowed to do is just put like a lever
here<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:23.490> then<00:02:23.930> makes<00:02:24.930> put<00:02:25.290> some<00:02:25.470> redstone

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
here and then makes put some redstone

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.699 
here and then makes put some redstone
leading<00:02:26.550> up<00:02:26.700> put<00:02:27.690> about<00:02:27.840> some<00:02:28.080> beat<00:02:28.290> repeater

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
leading up put about some beat repeater

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.080 
leading up put about some beat repeater
here<00:02:28.800> because<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:31.760> restaurant<00:02:32.760> repeaters

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
here because that restaurant repeaters

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.710 
here because that restaurant repeaters
um<00:02:34.760> gave<00:02:35.760> like<00:02:36.209> 15<00:02:36.870> Pat<00:02:37.470> Blair<00:02:37.890> give<00:02:38.720> block

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
um gave like 15 Pat Blair give block

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.699 
um gave like 15 Pat Blair give block
power<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.350> 15<00:02:40.770> blocks<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:44.360> this<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.390> about<00:02:45.720> like

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
power to 15 blocks so this is about like

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.060 
power to 15 blocks so this is about like
14<00:02:47.130> or<00:02:47.400> 13<00:02:47.640> blocks<00:02:48.300> right<00:02:48.630> here<00:02:49.019> at<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.920> red

14 or 13 blocks right here at the red

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.220 
14 or 13 blocks right here at the red
stone<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.790> delivers<00:02:51.209> powering<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.870> this

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
stone that delivers powering the this

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.300 
stone that delivers powering the this
redstone<00:02:52.530> right<00:02:52.739> here<00:02:53.000> powers<00:02:54.000> up<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.269> here

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
redstone right here powers up to here

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.680 
redstone right here powers up to here
then<00:02:56.310> put<00:02:56.550> another<00:02:56.580> one<00:02:56.910> power<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.510> rest

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
then put another one power of the rest

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.880 
then put another one power of the rest
of<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:57.989> write-up<00:02:58.380> back<00:02:58.680> here<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:01.860> just

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
of this write-up back here and I just

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.610 
of this write-up back here and I just
did<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.220> circle<00:03:02.730> instead<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.930> circle<00:03:04.380> around

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
did a circle instead of circle around

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.190 
did a circle instead of circle around
just<00:03:04.950> because<00:03:05.390> swan<00:03:06.390> or<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:06.930> do<00:03:07.050> with

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
just because swan or to you can do with

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.830 
just because swan or to you can do with
just<00:03:07.230> one<00:03:07.590> side<00:03:07.860> if<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.130> wanted<00:03:08.660> save<00:03:09.660> some

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
just one side if you wanted save some

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.680 
just one side if you wanted save some
room<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.290> redstone<00:03:10.590> i<00:03:10.980> guess<00:03:11.510> but<00:03:12.510> you're

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
room and redstone i guess but you're

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.360 
room and redstone i guess but you're
probably<00:03:12.870> might<00:03:13.230> need<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.560> use<00:03:13.650> another

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
probably might need to use another

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.330 
probably might need to use another
repeater<00:03:14.810> somewhere<00:03:15.810> power<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.739> rest<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.220> the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
repeater somewhere power the rest of the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.960 
repeater somewhere power the rest of the
blocks<00:03:18.980> but<00:03:19.980> uh<00:03:21.110> then<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.140> put<00:03:22.620> Pistons<00:03:23.519> facing

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
blocks but uh then I put Pistons facing

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.140 
blocks but uh then I put Pistons facing
this<00:03:24.120> way<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:25.110> above<00:03:25.380> right<00:03:25.739> here<00:03:25.950> one<00:03:26.790> two

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
this way just above right here one two

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.960 
this way just above right here one two
three<00:03:27.630> blocks<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.470> above<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:30.690> can<00:03:31.170> put<00:03:31.739> it

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
three blocks of above you can put it

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.750 
three blocks of above you can put it
like<00:03:32.970> right<00:03:33.000> on<00:03:33.329> that<00:03:33.750> block<00:03:33.959> right<00:03:34.230> there<00:03:34.760> but

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
like right on that block right there but

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.530 
like right on that block right there but
I<00:03:36.620> don't<00:03:37.620> know<00:03:37.709> if<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:38.040> can<00:03:38.250> but<00:03:38.549> I<00:03:38.820> think<00:03:39.450> it

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
I don't know if you can but I think it

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.319 
I don't know if you can but I think it
still<00:03:39.810> grows<00:03:40.260> like<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.680> as<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.160> can<00:03:41.280> see<00:03:41.519> i'm

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
still grows like that as you can see i'm

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.259 
still grows like that as you can see i'm
not<00:03:42.510> quite<00:03:43.010> positive<00:03:44.010> on<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:44.880> just

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
not quite positive on that so I just

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.810 
not quite positive on that so I just
split<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.750> bow<00:03:45.930> just<00:03:46.320> in<00:03:46.500> case<00:03:46.709> but<00:03:48.709> then<00:03:49.820> you're

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
split a bow just in case but then you're

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.259 
split a bow just in case but then you're
gonna<00:03:51.000> wanna<00:03:52.700> then<00:03:53.700> you're<00:03:53.910> going<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.120> put<00:03:54.239> a

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
gonna wanna then you're going to put a

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.479 
gonna wanna then you're going to put a
piston<00:03:54.720> um<00:03:54.989> right<00:03:55.200> below<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:56.070> one<00:03:56.280> right

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
piston um right below this one right

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.970 
piston um right below this one right
here<00:03:57.380> because<00:03:59.120> it's<00:04:00.120> just<00:04:00.420> easier<00:04:00.840> your<00:04:01.709> save

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
here because it's just easier your save

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.590 
here because it's just easier your save
room<00:04:02.250> it's<00:04:02.430> just<00:04:02.549> easier<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.120> then<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.329> put

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
room it's just easier and then you put

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.449 
room it's just easier and then you put
this<00:04:03.870> piston<00:04:04.320> so<00:04:04.560> it's<00:04:04.709> just<00:04:04.859> like<00:04:05.010> one<00:04:05.190> level

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
this piston so it's just like one level

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.910 
this piston so it's just like one level
lower<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:06.420> way<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.660> Pistons<00:04:07.079> can<00:04:07.440> go<00:04:07.590> on<00:04:07.799> the

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
lower that way the Pistons can go on the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.830 
lower that way the Pistons can go on the
same<00:04:08.190> like<00:04:09.350> block<00:04:11.269> the<00:04:12.269> same<00:04:12.510> height

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
same like block the same height

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.360 
same like block the same height
so<00:04:14.230> they<00:04:14.319> can<00:04:14.470> all<00:04:14.560> pour<00:04:14.860> down<00:04:15.040> right<00:04:15.340> over

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
so they can all pour down right over

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.460 
so they can all pour down right over
here<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:15.879> you're<00:04:16.030> going<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.750> keep<00:04:16.989> doing<00:04:17.019> that

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
here and you're going to keep doing that

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.430 
here and you're going to keep doing that
same<00:04:17.889> thing<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:18.810> for<00:04:19.810> these<00:04:19.930> repeaters

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
same thing and for these repeaters

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.230 
same thing and for these repeaters
you're<00:04:20.769> going<00:04:20.889> to<00:04:20.980> want<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.250> put<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.459> block<00:04:21.880> that

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
you're going to want to put a block that

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.510 
you're going to want to put a block that
way<00:04:23.199> this<00:04:23.560> repeater<00:04:23.919> is<00:04:23.979> right<00:04:24.220> in<00:04:24.370> between

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
way this repeater is right in between

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.469 
way this repeater is right in between
these<00:04:25.360> two<00:04:25.600> pistons<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.639> it<00:04:27.639> powers<00:04:27.790> both<00:04:28.240> of

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
these two pistons and it powers both of

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.379 
these two pistons and it powers both of
them<00:04:28.660> at<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.050> same<00:04:29.139> time<00:04:30.030> so<00:04:31.030> that<00:04:31.210> really

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
them at the same time so that really

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.689 
them at the same time so that really
helps<00:04:31.720> too<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.889> then<00:04:33.040> you're<00:04:33.250> going<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.460> want

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
helps too and then you're going to want

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.719 
helps too and then you're going to want
to<00:04:33.880> turn<00:04:34.630> them<00:04:34.750> on<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.350> build<00:04:36.010> like<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.400> little

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
to turn them on and build like a little

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.850 
to turn them on and build like a little
case<00:04:37.600> you<00:04:37.960> don't<00:04:38.110> have<00:04:38.139> to<00:04:38.290> use<00:04:38.410> glass<00:04:38.620> but<00:04:38.800> i'm

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
case you don't have to use glass but i'm

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.000 
case you don't have to use glass but i'm
using<00:04:39.220> class<00:04:39.840> just<00:04:40.840> so<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.139> sunlight<00:04:41.800> can

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
using class just so the sunlight can

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.520 
using class just so the sunlight can
shine<00:04:42.280> through<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.030> hope<00:04:43.360> that<00:04:43.510> we<00:04:43.570> grow

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.260 

but<00:04:47.530> then<00:04:47.979> once<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.520> do<00:04:48.639> that<00:04:48.669> you're<00:04:48.970> in<00:04:49.090> put

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
but then once you do that you're in put

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:57.110 
but then once you do that you're in put
water<00:04:49.570> in<00:04:49.780> each<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:50.110> these<00:04:50.200> like<00:04:51.190> that<00:04:54.090> and

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.750 

then<00:04:58.120> once<00:04:59.110> you're<00:04:59.290> done<00:04:59.440> with<00:04:59.650> that<00:04:59.760> you're

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
then once you're done with that you're

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.570 
then once you're done with that you're
going<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.090> want<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.479> make<00:05:01.720> a<00:05:02.280> where<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:03.400> can

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
going to want to make a where you can

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:10.560 
going to want to make a where you can
gather<00:05:03.790> everything<00:05:05.460> you're<00:05:06.460> gonna<00:05:09.330> dig<00:05:10.330> it

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
gather everything you're gonna dig it

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.920 
gather everything you're gonna dig it
down<00:05:10.840> one<00:05:12.120> deep<00:05:13.120> from<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.660> wheat<00:05:13.930> blocks<00:05:14.680> and

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
down one deep from the wheat blocks and

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.950 
down one deep from the wheat blocks and
you're<00:05:16.930> going<00:05:17.080> to<00:05:17.169> just<00:05:17.410> copy<00:05:17.740> this<00:05:18.960> four

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
you're going to just copy this four

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.310 
you're going to just copy this four
blocks<00:05:20.380> right<00:05:20.770> here<00:05:21.900> and<00:05:22.900> then<00:05:23.050> you're<00:05:23.200> going

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
blocks right here and then you're going

to go down and around and down and then
you're<00:05:27.700> going<00:05:27.820> to<00:05:27.910> drop<00:05:28.210> one<00:05:28.800> then<00:05:29.800> you're

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
you're going to drop one then you're

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.850 
you're going to drop one then you're
gonna<00:05:30.990> just<00:05:31.990> make<00:05:32.200> it<00:05:32.260> go<00:05:32.530> down<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:33.220> there<00:05:33.690> and

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
gonna just make it go down to there and

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.640 
gonna just make it go down to there and
the<00:05:35.860> same<00:05:36.070> thing<00:05:36.310> for<00:05:36.550> this<00:05:36.810> except<00:05:37.810> this<00:05:38.410> one

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
the same thing for this except this one

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.659 
the same thing for this except this one
goes<00:05:38.860> that<00:05:39.160> way<00:05:40.500> that<00:05:41.500> way<00:05:41.560> they<00:05:41.830> connect<00:05:42.310> and

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
goes that way that way they connect and

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
you're going to want to do is put the

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.820 
you're going to want to do is put the
water<00:05:47.169> right<00:05:47.410> there<00:05:47.820> right<00:05:48.820> there<00:05:49.090> right

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
water right there right there right

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.120 
water right there right there right
there<00:05:50.830> and<00:05:51.250> right<00:05:51.280> there<00:05:51.970> and<00:05:52.620> as<00:05:53.620> you<00:05:53.889> can<00:05:54.099> see

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
there and right there and as you can see

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.180 
there and right there and as you can see
the<00:05:54.460> water<00:05:54.669> will<00:05:54.910> flow<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:55.950> everything<00:05:56.950> will

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
the water will flow and everything will

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.170 
the water will flow and everything will
collect<00:05:57.550> to<00:05:57.729> write<00:05:57.940> this<00:05:58.419> space<00:05:58.690> right<00:05:58.930> here

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
collect to write this space right here

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.589 
collect to write this space right here
so<00:06:01.180> that's<00:06:02.169> what<00:06:02.349> you're<00:06:02.470> going<00:06:02.620> to<00:06:02.680> do<00:06:02.860> and

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
so that's what you're going to do and

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.690 
so that's what you're going to do and
another<00:06:04.599> thing<00:06:04.720> is<00:06:05.139> you<00:06:05.889> might<00:06:06.070> want<00:06:06.250> to<00:06:06.340> fence

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
another thing is you might want to fence

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.930 
another thing is you might want to fence
in<00:06:06.970> your<00:06:07.539> area<00:06:07.960> so<00:06:08.460> blocks

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.210 

fence<00:06:14.930> in<00:06:15.080> your<00:06:15.170> area<00:06:15.410> so<00:06:15.620> your<00:06:15.800> weed<00:06:15.980> doesn't

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
fence in your area so your weed doesn't

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.830 
fence in your area so your weed doesn't
get<00:06:16.430> trampled<00:06:16.970> by<00:06:17.230> mobs<00:06:18.230> or<00:06:18.530> animals<00:06:19.840> pretty

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
get trampled by mobs or animals pretty

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.560 
get trampled by mobs or animals pretty
sure<00:06:21.230> that<00:06:21.650> there<00:06:22.490> is<00:06:22.700> might<00:06:23.000> be<00:06:23.210> an<00:06:23.300> update

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
sure that there is might be an update

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.940 
sure that there is might be an update
that<00:06:24.140> will<00:06:24.890> fix<00:06:25.190> that<00:06:25.340> so<00:06:26.470> animals<00:06:27.470> and<00:06:27.740> mobs

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
that will fix that so animals and mobs

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.850 
that will fix that so animals and mobs
won't<00:06:28.250> trample<00:06:28.670> your<00:06:28.940> wheat<00:06:29.500> when<00:06:30.500> they<00:06:30.620> walk

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
won't trample your wheat when they walk

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.430 
won't trample your wheat when they walk
on<00:06:31.100> it<00:06:32.380> so<00:06:33.380> that<00:06:33.410> would<00:06:33.650> be<00:06:33.680> nice<00:06:33.920> too<00:06:35.080> but<00:06:36.080> just

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
on it so that would be nice too but just

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.690 
on it so that would be nice too but just
so<00:06:36.560> you<00:06:36.680> know<00:06:36.800> you<00:06:36.950> might<00:06:37.070> want<00:06:37.220> to<00:06:37.280> fence<00:06:37.490> in

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
so you know you might want to fence in

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.150 
so you know you might want to fence in
your<00:06:38.120> area<00:06:38.560> if<00:06:39.560> you<00:06:39.710> want<00:06:39.860> to<00:06:39.920> put<00:06:40.070> this

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
your area if you want to put this

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.950 
your area if you want to put this
underground<00:06:40.700> you<00:06:40.910> can<00:06:41.150> you<00:06:41.300> just<00:06:41.480> have<00:06:41.630> to<00:06:41.750> put

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
underground you can you just have to put

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.440 
underground you can you just have to put
glass<00:06:42.260> on<00:06:42.530> above<00:06:43.460> it<00:06:43.640> so<00:06:43.670> this<00:06:43.940> is<00:06:44.090> something<00:06:44.330> I

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
glass on above it so this is something I

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.360 
glass on above it so this is something I
can<00:06:44.600> shine<00:06:44.810> through<00:06:46.690> then<00:06:47.980> when<00:06:48.980> your<00:06:49.190> weights

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
can shine through then when your weights

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.840 
can shine through then when your weights
down<00:06:49.610> growing<00:06:50.060> you<00:06:50.210> just<00:06:50.390> hit<00:06:50.570> the<00:06:50.750> lever<00:06:50.930> the

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
down growing you just hit the lever the

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.990 
down growing you just hit the lever the
waterfalls<00:06:52.850> and<00:06:53.300> the<00:06:53.780> week<00:06:53.960> starts<00:06:54.410> to<00:06:54.620> come

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
waterfalls and the week starts to come

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.710 
waterfalls and the week starts to come
and<00:06:57.160> it's<00:06:58.160> really<00:06:58.400> nice<00:06:58.970> because<00:06:59.360> there's

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
and it's really nice because there's

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.400 
and it's really nice because there's
seeds<00:07:00.230> that<00:07:00.440> also<00:07:00.770> pop<00:07:01.010> out<00:07:01.220> you<00:07:01.490> have<00:07:01.610> like<00:07:01.820> a

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
seeds that also pop out you have like a

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.840 
seeds that also pop out you have like a
zero<00:07:03.410> or<00:07:04.900> either<00:07:05.900> zero<00:07:06.530> to<00:07:06.830> four<00:07:07.100> C's<00:07:07.430> I<00:07:07.640> think

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.850 
zero or either zero to four C's I think

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.160 
zero or either zero to four C's I think
are<00:07:07.970> zero<00:07:08.210> to<00:07:08.330> three<00:07:08.570> seeds<00:07:08.840> up<00:07:09.260> out<00:07:09.470> of<00:07:09.500> each

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.170 
are zero to three seeds up out of each

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.580 
are zero to three seeds up out of each
block<00:07:12.170> of<00:07:12.350> wheat<00:07:13.570> but<00:07:14.570> once<00:07:15.110> everything<00:07:15.560> is

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
block of wheat but once everything is

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.970 
block of wheat but once everything is
done<00:07:15.860> you<00:07:16.250> just<00:07:16.640> fold<00:07:16.820> up<00:07:17.500> so<00:07:18.500> you<00:07:18.590> can<00:07:18.710> see<00:07:18.950> how

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 
done you just fold up so you can see how

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:26.740 
done you just fold up so you can see how
much<00:07:19.370> i<00:07:19.550> get<00:07:22.270> about<00:07:23.270> 56<00:07:24.050> and<00:07:24.910> 60<00:07:25.910> for<00:07:26.180> CS<00:07:26.450> maybe

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:26.750 
much i get about 56 and 60 for CS maybe

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.420 
much i get about 56 and 60 for CS maybe
even<00:07:27.050> more<00:07:27.320> seeds<00:07:27.910> let's<00:07:28.910> check<00:07:29.240> I<00:07:29.890> yep<00:07:30.890> 29

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:31.430 
even more seeds let's check I yep 29

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.750 
even more seeds let's check I yep 29
more<00:07:31.610> seeds<00:07:32.290> that's<00:07:33.290> a<00:07:33.410> lot<00:07:33.530> of<00:07:33.560> seeds<00:07:33.919> so<00:07:34.669> you

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:34.760 
more seeds that's a lot of seeds so you

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.600 
more seeds that's a lot of seeds so you
can<00:07:34.910> just<00:07:34.940> keep<00:07:35.180> replanting<00:07:35.720> and<00:07:36.970> planning

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:39.610 
can just keep replanting and planning

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.570 
can just keep replanting and planning
like<00:07:40.610> this<00:07:40.850> you<00:07:41.210> can<00:07:41.360> just<00:07:41.570> keep<00:07:41.780> planning

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.580 
like this you can just keep planning

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:49.000 
like this you can just keep planning
hold<00:07:43.580> up<00:07:43.760> that's<00:07:44.510> one<00:07:44.750> thing<00:07:44.780> I<00:07:45.020> mad<00:07:47.080> and<00:07:48.080> ya

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.010 
hold up that's one thing I mad and ya

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.150 
hold up that's one thing I mad and ya
can<00:07:49.460> just<00:07:49.580> do<00:07:49.760> that<00:07:50.590> walk<00:07:51.590> on<00:07:51.770> this<00:07:51.950> little

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 
can just do that walk on this little
