00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.550
 Hello railroad fans maybe you know 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.860
 if you build a kit of 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.250
 a house for example von Vollmer 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.289
 stay pretty much 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.550
 window frame doors left there I thought 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.910
 I'm sorry 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.590
 you could use that and then 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.110
 I've got a house out of cardboard 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.820
 built from it 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.900
 more precisely in transformers tower 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.650
 just as a sample small and simple 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:47.940
 as entry I have the walls 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:49.199
 all out of cardboard the window the door and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.710
 the gutters are from one 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.590
 Kit left over 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:01:00.690
 yes I stuck everything together 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:03.690
 then filleted and yes and then 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.979
 I have still painted from corrugated cardboard 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.729
 under the roof and built this 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.280
 I have power connections from wire 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.020
 also bent with a drop of glue 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.869
 then these little bobs made too 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.000
 Everything was painted and it was done 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.250
 I'm also pretty good at that 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.390
 I liked and thought every job site 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.479
 a little more 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.330
 then I have some first 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:32.789
 Power poles built for the Transformers 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.560
 pontoon out of skewer came up so 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.069
 holes are installed then wire 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.250
 threaded through this too 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.310
 white things painted and are here so 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.899
 become like electricity pylon and rust 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.940
 transformers tom and electricity pylons 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.259
 next , I should go to what 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.200
 larger try a farmhouse 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.479
 I also built again from cardboard 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.590
 he is here you can see the turn also 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.660
 I still play up here 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.879
 be glued in lighting comes that 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:13.620
 better illuminates everything from cardboard 

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:16.620
 makes and the curtains from tempo or 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.140
 get out of paper, too 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.879
 everything painted then thought 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.730
 I when you come in interior lighting 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.769
 So yes the windows the window frames 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.830
 to demand the door 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.310
 around 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.590
 power connections from Vollmer and the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.800
 gutters of a h0 kit and 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.500
 This fireplace roof also from a house 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.400
 von Vollmer was probably still left 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.350
 then I thought if one 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.900
 Indoor lighting should come in 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.790
 yes, more interior design have seen 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.900
 I also made out of cardboard with 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:57.580
 polar painted the walls painted everything 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.440
 with felt-tip pens from topic the 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.980
 Japanese goal donors really let 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.050
 Great on cardboard, yes, and yes 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.840
 then i still wanted to have more doors 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.850
 Cut out the opened and then 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.380
 I started because I thought 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.820
 Now I'm already trying 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.950
 to make a facility 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:22.390
 with style a track 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.580
 pictures on the wall kitchen sink still 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.130
 toilet and sink here too 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.800
 again a small mirror foil here 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.410
 then comes the interior lighting purely yes 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.230
 everything made out of cardboard and painted on 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.380
 cut out stuck in traces 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.600
 heinz zu 160 was a bit proud 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.580
 I have to be his face is so good 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.959
 got my second house so well 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.400
 then the third house built 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:56.590
 is it for contender cottage 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.660
 also the antenna fireplace roof window and 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.850
 doors are again fullmer in it 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.739
 from a mister mouse as the gutter 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.280
 I did not have any left over 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:09.000
 wire bent and then again in 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.709
 made device 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.300
 with only a small office was from the basler 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.180

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.700

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:26.380
 Sixties and back here again 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.770

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.419
 interior lighting in 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:36.629
 That's how I built three houses 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.949
 to which I find all three quite well 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:38.840
