before i got into nursing school i

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.209 
before i got into nursing school i
thought<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.170> was<00:00:13.259> going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.500> kick<00:00:13.830> me<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
butt hard but in my opinion it's

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.410 
butt hard but in my opinion it's
actually<00:00:18.449> more<00:00:18.600> time<00:00:18.960> consuming<00:00:19.260> than<00:00:19.710> hard

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
actually more time consuming than hard

i<00:00:44.430> was<00:00:44.610> thinking<00:00:44.670> when<00:00:45.149> my<00:00:45.270> instructor<00:00:45.780> said

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
i was thinking when my instructor said

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.650 
i was thinking when my instructor said
okay<00:00:46.890> class<00:00:47.190> today<00:00:47.940> we're<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> learn

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
okay class today we're going to learn

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.959 
okay class today we're going to learn
how<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.989> give<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> patient<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.710> bed<00:00:49.890> bath<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.489> was

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
how to give a patient a bed bath I was

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.540 
how to give a patient a bed bath I was
thinking<00:00:52.370> yes<00:00:53.370> nursing<00:00:54.210> school<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.719> easy<00:00:55.550> but

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
thinking yes nursing school is easy but

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.310 
thinking yes nursing school is easy but
it's<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.789> lot<00:00:56.910> more<00:00:56.969> complex<00:00:57.600> when<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> patient

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it's a lot more complex when the patient

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.430 
it's a lot more complex when the patient
is<00:00:58.520> like<00:00:59.520> bed<00:00:59.789> bound<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.600> you're<00:01:00.809> trying<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
is like bed bound and you're trying to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.170 
is like bed bound and you're trying to
flip<00:01:02.010> them<00:01:02.129> around<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.820> make<00:01:02.969> them<00:01:03.059> do

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
flip them around and make them do

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
flip them around and make them do
somersaults<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.840> bed<00:01:04.080> all<00:01:04.619> while<00:01:04.949> you're

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
somersaults in bed all while you're

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.859 
somersaults in bed all while you're
trying<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.400> give<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> bed<00:01:05.820> bath<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.330> change<00:01:06.360> his

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
trying to give a bed bath and change his

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.020 
trying to give a bed bath and change his
sheets<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> more<00:01:08.220> complex<00:01:08.700> part

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
sheets so that's the more complex part

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.840 
sheets so that's the more complex part
of<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:09.869> hard<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:11.340> guess<00:01:11.640> it's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
of it it's not hard but I guess it's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.370 
of it it's not hard but I guess it's
something<00:01:12.330> really<00:01:12.600> important<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.200> need

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
something really important that you need

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.469 
something really important that you need
to<00:01:13.500> learn<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.040> nursing<00:01:14.369> school<00:01:14.400> or<00:01:14.909> for

have<00:01:18.030> aids<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> lot<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.979> times

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
have aids for that but a lot of times

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.070 
have aids for that but a lot of times
we'll<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.640> patients<00:01:21.210> without<00:01:21.330> nursing

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
we'll have patients without nursing

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.950 
we'll have patients without nursing
aides<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.330> sometimes<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> nursing<00:01:24.810> aides

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960

aides and sometimes the nursing aides
need<00:01:25.229> help<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.250> help<00:01:26.400> them<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
need help so we have to help them and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.749 
need help so we have to help them and
