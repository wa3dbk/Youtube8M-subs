00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.650
 a hat this time as a last video for 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.110
 today but we start again in the 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.259
 this is a sun hat this summer 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.869
 relatively easy and in the back 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.520
 with this protection for the summer of 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.750
 hopefully we get that there is nothing 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.880
 happened you did you can do the hat too 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.369
 as if you're good you have to go back later 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.460
 greiner theory through here are like that 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.440
 thought that all of us totally once 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.440
 made of fabric and the brim is twice 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.309
 all will support double here 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:45.610
 sewed together two if we could 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.190
 are very thin fabric could you do that 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.110
 ironing most yes I think it is 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.000
 also very good if she wants to get down 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.229
 besides, it should not be me either 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.479
 now here a gift ribbon 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.939
 terrible tie sewn inside 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.129
 because if we now the limit for this 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:06.320
 that will lessen that later 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.900
 here thus the Roman out must times 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.220
 I thought I was feeling pretty good, though 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.450
 what I want to show right now 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.930
 is 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.039
 again this top good part off 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.659
 these six are the same and I share 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.979
 always so together the first one I have 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.110
 now times completely to talk 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.130
 two pieces now but I show machine 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.950
 right back the 600 because of that here 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.530
 above everything in a visually simple point 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.079
 expires then take that in online 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.030
 it completely finished I take it 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:52.099
 here from this two share put now 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:57.649
 right to each other right and important 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:02:02.539
 I always like that with me 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:05.149
 centimeter seam addition part good after 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.569
 the easiest way so i can see here now 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.349
 it's already here, that's where i put it 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.420
 me a bit 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.280
 apart the almost gift I can in 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.660
 the direction plates in the direction me 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.829
 would probably supply it now 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.250
 I can because then a bit too 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:21.620
 a lot for me so I put the seam on it 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.340
 and yes I feel here where these times 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.340
 on each other 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.739
 Now notice the time to 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:39.670
 of contracts if I profit this to me 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.090
 and lo and behold the Scottish band too 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.180
 bad now I'll take the next one 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.390
 part 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.110
 so here too 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.450
 I nee that the seam here on the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.670
 active from down here 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.670
 here is also a detailed cut but 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.080
 But I can also be here if I am now 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.690
 I lay here my seam again 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.340
 this point up there and then see 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.239
 I already from grid does not fit then 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.790
 I could be here a bit now 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.700
 Europe can do more 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.880
 stuck in your arm that you get the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.959
 then the whole thing marks the point 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.280
 is actually quite good then 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.660
 let's do this 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.150
 there and then watch that too 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.010
 it really works because it is wonderful 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.580
 I see then you already have them 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.580
 fixed 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:10.390
 so wonderful that looks good too 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:11.190
 and now I can make here 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.989
 yes, also sense 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:19.060
 sometimes there is the needle here 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.890
 that's how it's always been from the bottom up 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.890
 could have gone through now 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:30.670
 if it's good to be clean from here 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:36.100
 yes always in front of uncertain then you have to 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:46.570
 to hire even if they now times 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:52.060
 millimeter not 100 percent is to the emergency 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:54.490
 and well, we are already there 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.870
 times very pleased with the results so 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.700
 that could be me here now, of course 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.660
 everything you should do again 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.760
 Douglas is sitting on every chair 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.770
 right from the sewing machine must be me 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.900
 always so now I have the limit there 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.180
 I have the band i once already 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.030
 sewed on that's why I want now too 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.410
 sewing in the seam with rich 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:26.380
 middle seating so good that I accept it and 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:27.900
 now exactly on the wheel around 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.960
 from 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.729
 so now I turn it on 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.650
 but now, as it were, to look at how 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:39.930
 nice that this ruffled top of the 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.570
 Russian bank here elastic mission 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.180
 land does not shock the boys like that 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.960
 to recommend you could for guys but 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.430
 for example now so it will be 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.199
 Logically, then leave here 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.669
 announced theme beautiful oblique band 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.050
 home home na those are all 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:06:00.630
 possibilities given 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.400
 now the top part can do that 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.960
 bundled wuppertal what you here for 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.600
 a must and if you tie now 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.600
 bender you want to have to go 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:21.720
 So to speak, insert here now and that 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:25.410
 so that the would then run down 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:28.259
 a wall if we accept that now 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.150
 must that bondman of sum kronshage 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.380
 It has to be considered as it will be later 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.550
 have down 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.990
 so it would now so one is 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.460
 in the meantime, it's actually taken 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.960
 are passed between when you then 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.130
 again, if I could understand 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.260
 not exactly 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.000
 so if I have to do it this way now 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.870
 I tie the band so completely silent 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.880
 For rhine I would now be that 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.010
 Whole may now and in rouven 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.479
 Thies between summarize so therefore now is 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.780
 the thing still there sewn here and 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:07:00.300
 it already finished the nas need us 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:04.919
 Now here we lie here 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:08.250
 on the name or 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:11.370
 it has to fit a bit, I suppose 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:15.419
 Now just do it around and down and 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:22.800
 then I hope so that is 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:29.310
 everything is so good now 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:36.509
 Right to right I imagine that 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:38.460
 not fixed now it has to fit the 

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:47.310
 already the first time on it and then 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:49.110
 I take it all the way through 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.430
 look already is this cute little hat 

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.090
 finished here one must still beautiful 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.870
 hanger 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:57.840
 there i should be the whole band they are 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.940
 but insert as it is called double 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.639

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.879
 we show how beautiful this is 

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:13.020
 if the hat man and then say yes 

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:15.770
