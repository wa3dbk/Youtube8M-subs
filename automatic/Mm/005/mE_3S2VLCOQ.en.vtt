here<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:10.679> have<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.980> 2015<00:00:11.759> raw<00:00:12.210> signal<00:00:12.389> circuit

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
here we have the 2015 raw signal circuit

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.020 
here we have the 2015 raw signal circuit
it's<00:00:13.349> an<00:00:13.410> all-mountain<00:00:13.710> freestyle<00:00:14.370> board<00:00:14.730> so

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
it's an all-mountain freestyle board so

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.550 
it's an all-mountain freestyle board so
if<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.210> right<00:00:15.480> into<00:00:15.690> riding<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.320> entire

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
if you right into riding the entire

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.200 
if you right into riding the entire
mountain<00:00:16.949> including<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.400> park<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.880> bit<00:00:18.150> of

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
mountain including the park a bit of

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.519 
mountain including the park a bit of
powder<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.720> ball<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.020> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.199> be<00:00:19.289> great

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
powder this ball is going to be great

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.060 
powder this ball is going to be great
for<00:00:19.710> you

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
for you

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.160 
for you
so<00:00:20.430> directional<00:00:20.939> shape<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.689> means<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.080> got

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
so directional shape just means it's got

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.599 
so directional shape just means it's got
a<00:00:22.199> slightly<00:00:22.470> longer<00:00:22.710> nose<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.279> gonna<00:00:23.369> be

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
a slightly longer nose so this gonna be

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.730 
a slightly longer nose so this gonna be
great<00:00:23.880> from<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> powder<00:00:24.990> just<00:00:25.320> keeping<00:00:25.560> nose

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
great from the powder just keeping nose

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.950 
great from the powder just keeping nose
out<00:00:25.980> has<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.640> medium<00:00:27.060> flex<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:27.869> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
out has a medium flex so it's going to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.540 
out has a medium flex so it's going to
be<00:00:28.050> hold<00:00:28.680> up<00:00:28.830> when<00:00:29.010> you're<00:00:29.099> going<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:29.369> fast

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
be hold up when you're going really fast

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.740 
be hold up when you're going really fast
down<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.789> mountain<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.179> still<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> bit

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
down the mountain but still have a bit

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.319 
down the mountain but still have a bit
of<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> playful<00:00:31.050> feel<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.759> features<00:00:33.149> that

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
of a playful feel to it it features that

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.139 
of a playful feel to it it features that
amptek<00:00:33.989> auto<00:00:34.170> turn<00:00:34.530> camber<00:00:35.040> profile<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.969> it's

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
amptek auto turn camber profile so it's

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.639 
amptek auto turn camber profile so it's
positive<00:00:36.420> camber<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> center<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
positive camber in the center of the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:37.970 
positive camber in the center of the
board

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
board

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.530 
board
then<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.640> rocker<00:00:38.820> out<00:00:39.030> from<00:00:39.210> under<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
then it's rocker out from under the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.780 
then it's rocker out from under the
bindings<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.950> eyes<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> tail

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
bindings to the eyes in the tail

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.060 
bindings to the eyes in the tail
this<00:00:42.030> does<00:00:42.239> get<00:00:42.899> bits<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.260> stability<00:00:43.440> from<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
this does get bits of stability from the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.529 
this does get bits of stability from the
positive<00:00:44.250> camber<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> center<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> board

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
positive camber in the center the board

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.500 
positive camber in the center the board
but<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> get<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> nice<00:00:46.379> catch<00:00:46.680> free<00:00:47.010> ride<00:00:47.969> from

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
but you get a nice catch free ride from

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.930 
but you get a nice catch free ride from
the<00:00:48.600> rocker<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:48.989> from<00:00:49.230> under<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.469> bindings

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
the rocker out from under the bindings

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
the rocker out from under the bindings
graphics<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.059> see<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> really<00:00:51.629> really<00:00:51.809> nice

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
graphics you see it really really nice

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.869 
graphics you see it really really nice
got<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> nice<00:00:52.770> black<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.070> red<00:00:53.370> effect<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.789> the

top sheet and the same on the base it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.660 
top sheet and the same on the base it
features<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.210> extruded<00:00:57.870> 1320<00:00:58.739> base<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.280> it's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
features that extruded 1320 base so it's

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.340 
features that extruded 1320 base so it's
as<00:00:59.789> fast<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.239> durable<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:01.079> really

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.410 
as fast and durable and really really
easy<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.770> repair<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:04.500> core<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> wood<00:01:05.420> 5620

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
easy to repair the core is a wood 5620

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.690 
easy to repair the core is a wood 5620
coarsest<00:01:06.900> as<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> single<00:01:07.500> laminar<00:01:07.950> vertically

coarsest as a single laminar vertically
aligned<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.600> does<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:09.900> gives<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
aligned what this does it just gives a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.710 
aligned what this does it just gives a
nice<00:01:10.439> consistent<00:01:11.250> flex<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.390> super

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
nice consistent flex and it's super

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.660 
nice consistent flex and it's super
super<00:01:12.960> easy<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.290> ride<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
super easy to ride and it's going to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.050 
super easy to ride and it's going to
last<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.030> ages<00:01:15.770> as<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> custom<00:01:17.430> glass<00:01:17.640> fiber

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
last you ages as a custom glass fiber

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
last you ages as a custom glass fiber
layout<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.080> unique<00:01:19.259> layup<00:01:19.830> which<00:01:20.220> just

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
layout so it's a unique layup which just

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.890 
layout so it's a unique layup which just
gives<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.759> increased<00:01:21.240> torsional<00:01:21.540> resistance

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
gives it increased torsional resistance

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.109 
gives it increased torsional resistance
which<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.159> adds<00:01:23.310> stability<00:01:23.520> when<00:01:24.000> you're

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
which just adds stability when you're

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.539 
which just adds stability when you're
riding<00:01:24.270> down<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.570> hill<00:01:24.869> we've<00:01:25.860> got<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.280> deep

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
riding down the hill we've got a deep

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.940 
riding down the hill we've got a deep
side<00:01:26.880> cut<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.170> side<00:01:28.380> cuts<00:01:28.619> slightly

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
side cut so the side cuts slightly

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.560 
side cut so the side cuts slightly
deeper<00:01:29.130> than<00:01:29.460> usual<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.030> makes<00:01:30.450> your

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
deeper than usual and this makes your

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.690 
deeper than usual and this makes your
turns<00:01:30.840> even<00:01:31.290> more<00:01:31.439> powerful<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.520> bomb

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
turns even more powerful so you can bomb

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.410 
turns even more powerful so you can bomb
it<00:01:32.820> down<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> hill<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.850> it'll<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> speed

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
it down the hill and it'll be the speed

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.370 
it down the hill and it'll be the speed
a<00:01:36.479> really<00:01:36.720> nice<00:01:36.869> smooth<00:01:37.140> ride

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
a really nice smooth ride
