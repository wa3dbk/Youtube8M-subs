00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.450
 guys do not say you do not want to 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.869
 that samsung show his next ship 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.330
 galaxy s 5 badge is not there 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:14.920
 whether we heed the rumors that 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.010
 they have been arriving in the last 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.320
 weeks specifically it seems that it would be 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.420
 end of January when sansÃ³n a mount 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.420
 your conference and let's see what we 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.700
 will surprise this time gathering the 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.650
 rumors the leaks and some 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.420
 tracks of the company itself we have 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.520
 wanted to make a list with five 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.370
 possible characteristics that the 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.890
 samsung galaxy s 5 surely not 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.550
 we hit on all but on most 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.870
 so we go there with the prediction 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.720
 there were rumors about the change of the 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.210
 plastic housing by a metal one without 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.250
 embargo for reasons of pure physics this 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.399
 Leather will end up being like 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.590
 used in the galaxy know 3 this is 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.960
 should its elastic property 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.340
 necessary for our point 2 the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.950
 curved and flexible screen 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.290
 with the samsung galaxy round we have seen 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.820
 the intentions of the Korean seems that 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.580
 the curvature on the screen and on the 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.290
 terminal itself is the new trend already 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.240
 some analysts predict that this 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.050
 particularity will be released in the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.300
 world market with the galaxy s 5 la 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.630
 last week a responsible of samsung 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.550
 confirmed the jump from 32 to 64 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.070
 bits in the new range terminals 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.320
 high of the company this will allow 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.930
 reduce battery consumption increase the 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.340
 performance and equip the galaxy s 5 with 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.560
 more than 3 gigs 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.990
 concretely we believe that they will be 4 gigas 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.680
 those who accompany the new chip of 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.110
 samsung the galaxy s 4 camera was already 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.000
 in itself quite good despite the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.009
 competition has done very well 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.080
 duties and now it's not exactly the 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.149
 better in this aspect 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.030
 we believe that samsung would include a new 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.039
 16 megapixel sensor with the expected 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.640
 optical stabilizer and recording 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.680
 full hd video at 60 frames it might seem 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.959
 A copy without samsung includes its 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.530
 new galaxy s 5 a fingerprint sensor 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.660
 fingerprints but 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.030
 reality is that it is an aspect that adds 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.280
 an extra value to the devices and to 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.680
 way in which we identify ourselves to the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.020
 time to buy home appliances 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.870
 us in pages and so on we think 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.550
 that this section will be included as well 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.910
 what guys that you think our 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.910
 predictions
