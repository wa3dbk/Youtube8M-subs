00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.360
 Hello everyone and we are with a new 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.910
 video 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.309
 this time I want to show you 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.870
 a piece in my collection very very 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.560
 special 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.030
 and I decided to do om boxing 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.790
 Of course 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.640
 with just the purchase from last year already 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.759
 I have bought it for more than a year 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.760
 and the reason why I have decided 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.710
 show it up to now is simple 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.350
 first of all I had not been able 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.540
 getting games for her is more 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.180
 I've even tried it for the same 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.520
 reason 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.850
 and the other reason is because I want to start 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.980
 to show different 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.589
 parts of my collection when I say 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:57.010
 parts I mean consoles and also 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:01:00.120
 accessories and then I think there's nothing 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.769
 better than starting with the super famicom 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.769
 the Japanese version of the super nintendo 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.490
 and also because I just bought two 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.490
 games for this console and they come from 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.750
 way directly from japan so 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:23.050
 before showing those games I wanted to 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:28.260
 make this video showing the console 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:32.200
 and talking a little about my decision 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.140
 personal to acquire it first that 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.580
 nothing we are going to remove the cover of the 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.530
 box as you can see it comes in its box 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.380
 is in very good condition in the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.930
 sense that it is complete 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.200
 it only has the cover I do not know if 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.579
 down I had another part of cardboard but 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.820
 when it came to me 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.520
 nothing else came to me like this is in the order 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.060
 from directly from Japan it took 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.060
 almost three months to arrive 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.170
 and when finally a very happy day arrived 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.020
 for me as this Japanese console will 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.319
 I had a lot of desire and finally I could 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.140
 win an auction on ebay at a price 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.750
 very comfortable normally this is sold to 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.140
 more than 100 dollars and one the purchase of 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.819
 once and the auctions is incredibly 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.819
 hard to beat him since there's a lot 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.940
 people auctioning 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.690
 and I was surprised when I won 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.790
 just pay for the console like 60 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.540
 dollars that included shipping 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.540
 from japan 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.030
 What surprised me most is that I won 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.020
 and then win a version as you can see 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.820
 complete 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.830
 there are many that are sold are the 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.380
 consoles but I was lucky enough to 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.430
 acquire it with its original box as 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.430
 You can see your manual 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.439
 contains this plastic bag that 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.439
 I think it's the original clear the 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.870
 console shows its age by showing this 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.590
 yellowish something very common even in the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.590
 American version 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.290
 and good as you can see it has a lot 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.800
 difference to the American one starting with 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.800
 design 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.810
 and in the controls we can see the 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.240
 difference of colors is the same 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.240
 style of the controls but what 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.880
 change are the color buttons this is 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.560
 also gray 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.930
 also this symbol 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.590
 the wolf better said 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.110
 and good 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.480
 the reason why I decided to acquire this 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.370
 console is because first of all the 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.310
 Super nintendo 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.620
 in my personal opinion was the console 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.709
 with which I had the most fun with the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.530
 what more amuse me in my childhood and is 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.910
 with which I keep perhaps the best 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.350
 memories like 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.650
 when nintendo and as neymar in general 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.810
 and then I used to look at the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.480
 program the famous nintendo program 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.380
 mania I heard they mentioned sometimes 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.380
 the super famicom 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.380
 and I did not know what that was, I knew that 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.650
 it was a video game system but not 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.510
 I really knew it was until 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.420
 when 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:33.740
 and I became a collector that is 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.020
 about 34 years ago I started 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.270
 find out more about the super famicom and 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.760
 it was when I realized that it was the 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.610
 Japanese edition of 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.960
 of super nintendo and when I realized 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:51.689
 of that then 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:55.729
 I decided that it would form a 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:59.340
 good piece in collection not only because 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:02.699
 that they put but because 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.699
 he also has some games that never 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:09.030
 they came to the American version of the 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:11.070
 which I want to acquire some and how 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.190
 I tell them already acquired and they come from 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.610
 way so when they come I have 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.810
 thought about making gameplays and well that was 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.810
 my little story 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.830
 and my little 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.250
 in opinion about this system and the by 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.699
 what he acquires so that as far as 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.080
 get the games 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:37.110
 probably make the combos kings and 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.260
 I want to show you gameplay to try 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.040
 that the console is in good condition and that 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:47.009
 it works so far I leave you and 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.059
 see you in another video 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.059
 and thanks for watching
