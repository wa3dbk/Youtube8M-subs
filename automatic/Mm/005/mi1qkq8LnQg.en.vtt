00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
1tb hard drive from my computer and I

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.120 
1tb hard drive from my computer and I
busted<00:00:22.289> up<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.980> case<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.890> not<00:00:25.890> that

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
busted up the case and it's not that

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.849 
busted up the case and it's not that
difficult<00:00:26.599> just<00:00:27.599> use<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> little<00:00:28.260> flat<00:00:28.500> head

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
difficult just use a little flat head

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.550 
difficult just use a little flat head
screwdriver<00:00:29.689> wedging<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> round<00:00:31.050> starting

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
screwdriver wedging it round starting

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.889 
screwdriver wedging it round starting
from<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:32.250> position<00:00:32.430> here<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.780> this

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
from this position here and this

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.410 
from this position here and this
actually<00:00:34.200> pops<00:00:34.440> straight<00:00:34.800> off<00:00:35.120> okay<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.180> that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
actually pops straight off okay so that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.420 
actually pops straight off okay so that
comes<00:00:36.660> off

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
comes off

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.380 
comes off
in<00:00:38.430> fact<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.670> think<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> bottom<00:00:39.300> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
in fact I think it was a bottom that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.869 
in fact I think it was a bottom that
popped<00:00:39.690> off<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.170> stuck<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> top

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
popped off and this stuck in in the top

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.740 
popped off and this stuck in in the top
that<00:00:43.190> anything<00:00:44.190> holding<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.910> bottom<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
that anything holding the bottom on to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.410 
that anything holding the bottom on to
the<00:00:45.870> drive<00:00:46.140> itself<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.770> little<00:00:47.039> wee

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
the drive itself as that little wee

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
the drive itself as that little wee
latch<00:00:48.530> okay<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.789> what's<00:00:50.940> inside<00:00:52.280> it's
