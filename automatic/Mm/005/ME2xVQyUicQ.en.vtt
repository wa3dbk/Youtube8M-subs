go<00:01:01.109> give<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.320> another<00:01:01.559> try<00:01:01.770> people<00:01:02.129> seem<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.340> be

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
go give it another try people seem to be

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.590 
go give it another try people seem to be
doing<00:01:02.640> somewhat<00:01:02.969> well<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.300> they<00:01:03.390> always

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
doing somewhat well that they always

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.950 
doing somewhat well that they always
kill<00:01:03.780> me<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.610> figured<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.840> way

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
kill me with it so I figured the way

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.940 
kill me with it so I figured the way
this<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.380> don't<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.590> how<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.830> gun

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
this if you don't know how this gun

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.280 
this if you don't know how this gun
works<00:01:08.360> basically<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.689> need<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.990> always<00:01:10.140> be

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
works basically you need to always be

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.080 
works basically you need to always be
aiming<00:01:10.590> down<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.740> sights<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.400> shotgun<00:01:11.729> in

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
aiming down the sights it's a shotgun in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.420 
aiming down the sights it's a shotgun in
this<00:01:12.240> game<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.570> fires<00:01:12.750> slugs<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.799> Call

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
this game that fires slugs and in Call

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.920 
this game that fires slugs and in Call
of<00:01:14.460> Duty<00:01:14.700> logic<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.210> basically<00:01:15.570> means<00:01:15.750> if

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
of Duty logic that basically means if

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.450 
of Duty logic that basically means if
you<00:01:16.020> hipfire<00:01:16.320> you're<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> be

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you hipfire you're not going to be

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.679 
you hipfire you're not going to be
hitting<00:01:17.610> anything<00:01:17.939> unless<00:01:18.240> you're<00:01:18.390> shoving

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
hitting anything unless you're shoving

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810 
hitting anything unless you're shoving
your<00:01:18.780> barrel<00:01:19.049> down<00:01:19.200> their<00:01:19.380> throat<00:01:19.820> it's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
your barrel down their throat it's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.780 
your barrel down their throat it's
pretty<00:01:21.000> much<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:22.009> minimum<00:01:23.009> range<00:01:23.340> sniper

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
pretty much like a minimum range sniper

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.310 
pretty much like a minimum range sniper
rifle<00:01:24.090> that's<00:01:24.180> how<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.450> reacts<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.110> game

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
rifle that's how it reacts in this game

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.350 
rifle that's how it reacts in this game
you<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.189> still<00:01:26.430> one-hit<00:01:26.759> kill<00:01:26.939> people<00:01:27.180> at

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you can still one-hit kill people at

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.880 
you can still one-hit kill people at
range<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> headshot

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
range but you have to get a headshot

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.580 
range but you have to get a headshot
basically<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.970> results<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.600> aiming

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
video I would have swarm equipped but I

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.229 
video I would have swarm equipped but I
don't<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:10.979> unlocked<00:02:11.310> after<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.610> prestiged

don't have it unlocked after I prestiged
so

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220

doesn't really happen in most a time so

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.760 
doesn't really happen in most a time so

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
most of time when you're using this gun

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.830 
most of time when you're using this gun
you<00:03:13.640> have<00:03:13.760> your<00:03:13.910> sights<00:03:14.150> right<00:03:14.630> over

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
you have your sights right over

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.170 
you have your sights right over
someone's<00:03:15.110> chest<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:16.430> pull<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.730> trigger<00:03:16.910> and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
you don't even get a damn hit marker

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.610 
you don't even get a damn hit marker
which<00:03:20.000> can<00:03:20.180> be<00:03:20.300> beyond<00:03:20.810> frustrating<00:03:21.470> because

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
which can be beyond frustrating because

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.010 
which can be beyond frustrating because
you<00:03:22.160> have<00:03:22.340> no<00:03:22.610> visual<00:03:23.030> way<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.330> see<00:03:23.780> what

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
you have no visual way to see what

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.900 
you have no visual way to see what
happened<00:03:24.470> there<00:03:24.620> what<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:25.220> looks<00:03:25.489> like<00:03:25.700> what's

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
happened there what it looks like what's

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.330 
happened there what it looks like what's
going<00:03:26.180> on<00:03:26.330> is<00:03:26.570> that<00:03:27.530> you're<00:03:27.739> shooting<00:03:27.890> fucking

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
going on is that you're shooting fucking

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.880 
going on is that you're shooting fucking
farts<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:28.850> it<00:03:29.570> looks<00:03:29.840> like<00:03:30.020> this<00:03:30.170> hunting<00:03:30.680> gun

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
farts and it looks like this hunting gun

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.590 
farts and it looks like this hunting gun
is<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.370> piece<00:03:31.610> of<00:03:31.640> shit<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.120> nothing's

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
is a piece of shit and nothing's

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.970 
is a piece of shit and nothing's
happening<00:03:32.989> that's<00:03:33.380> pretty<00:03:33.560> much<00:03:33.680> what<00:03:33.860> it

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
happening that's pretty much what it

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.229 
happening that's pretty much what it
feels<00:03:34.160> like<00:03:34.280> when<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.520> start<00:03:34.730> using<00:03:34.850> this<00:03:35.060> gun

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
feels like when you start using this gun

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.699 
feels like when you start using this gun
and<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.570> use<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.870> for<00:03:35.989> a<00:03:36.020> long<00:03:36.230> period<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.560> time

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
and you use it for a long period of time

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.440 
and you use it for a long period of time
and<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.010> can't<00:03:37.280> seem<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:37.670> have<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.820> good<00:03:38.120> game

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
and you can't seem to have a good game

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.790 
and you can't seem to have a good game
with<00:03:38.570> it<00:03:38.720> because<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:39.050> just<00:03:39.170> doesn't<00:03:39.440> seem<00:03:39.650> to

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
with it because it just doesn't seem to

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.550 
with it because it just doesn't seem to
want<00:03:39.980> to<00:03:40.070> work<00:03:40.810> but<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.930> misunderstanding

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
want to work but the misunderstanding

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.040 
want to work but the misunderstanding
there<00:03:42.680> is<00:03:42.800> that<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.340> gun<00:03:43.519> isn't<00:03:43.790> bad<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.870> game

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
there is that the gun isn't bad the game

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.710 
there is that the gun isn't bad the game
just<00:03:45.320> doesn't<00:03:45.470> work<00:03:45.800> like<00:03:45.950> it's<00:03:46.130> supposed<00:03:46.160> to

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
just doesn't work like it's supposed to

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.600 
just doesn't work like it's supposed to
so<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:48.860> know<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.010> can<00:03:49.190> understand<00:03:49.550> the

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
so you know you can understand the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.009 
so you know you can understand the
misunderstanding<00:03:50.209> out<00:03:50.269> there<00:03:50.450> but<00:03:50.600> I'd<00:03:50.750> like

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
misunderstanding out there but I'd like

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.050 
misunderstanding out there but I'd like
to<00:03:51.080> reiterate<00:03:51.410> this<00:03:51.739> is<00:03:51.950> actually<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.519> good<00:03:52.820> gun

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
to reiterate this is actually a good gun

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.520 
to reiterate this is actually a good gun
in<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.480> right<00:03:53.630> hands<00:03:53.870> this<00:03:54.080> thing<00:03:54.290> can<00:03:54.440> be

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
in the right hands this thing can be

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.410 
in the right hands this thing can be
incredibly<00:03:55.160> devastating<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.910> really

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
incredibly devastating and really

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.850 
incredibly devastating and really
effective<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:57.019> as<00:03:57.410> you're<00:03:57.560> seeing<00:03:57.709> I'm

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
effective and as you're seeing I'm

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.290 
effective and as you're seeing I'm
having<00:03:58.100> a<00:03:58.160> pretty<00:03:58.310> decent<00:03:58.700> game<00:03:58.820> this<00:03:59.060> isn't

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
having a pretty decent game this isn't

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.170 
having a pretty decent game this isn't
anything<00:03:59.570> really<00:04:00.530> overly<00:04:01.070> flashy<00:04:01.340> or<00:04:01.610> overly

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
anything really overly flashy or overly

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.630 
anything really overly flashy or overly
amazing<00:04:02.720> but<00:04:03.100> you<00:04:04.100> know<00:04:04.190> I'm<00:04:04.310> going<00:04:04.519> on<00:04:04.610> a

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
amazing but you know I'm going on a

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.979 
amazing but you know I'm going on a
little<00:04:04.940> bit<00:04:05.060> of<00:04:05.120> a<00:04:05.180> run<00:04:05.360> it's<00:04:05.600> been<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.780> while

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
little bit of a run it's been a while

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.970 
little bit of a run it's been a while
since<00:04:06.200> I've<00:04:06.350> died<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:08.120> it's<00:04:08.980> basically

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
since I've died and it's basically

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.770 
since I've died and it's basically
working<00:04:10.250> that's<00:04:11.090> all<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:11.209> really<00:04:11.390> need<00:04:11.600> to<00:04:11.630> say

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
working that's all I really need to say

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.470 
working that's all I really need to say
it's<00:04:12.019> working<00:04:12.230> like<00:04:12.470> it<00:04:12.650> should<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:13.820> don't<00:04:14.360> know

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
it's working like it should I don't know

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.199 
it's working like it should I don't know
if<00:04:14.630> I<00:04:14.690> was<00:04:14.810> hosting<00:04:15.140> this<00:04:15.290> game<00:04:15.640> not<00:04:16.640> sure<00:04:16.669> if<00:04:17.090> I

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
if I was hosting this game not sure if I

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.060 
if I was hosting this game not sure if I
checked<00:04:17.600> I<00:04:17.780> might<00:04:18.109> not<00:04:18.380> have<00:04:18.530> been<00:04:18.680> that's

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
checked I might not have been that's

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.229 
checked I might not have been that's
another<00:04:19.310> thing<00:04:19.489> I've<00:04:19.640> noticed<00:04:19.760> about<00:04:19.970> black

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
another thing I've noticed about black

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.550 
another thing I've noticed about black
ops<00:04:20.419> 2<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.600> don't<00:04:20.750> know<00:04:20.870> if<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.109> because<00:04:21.260> of<00:04:21.410> a

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
ops 2 I don't know if it's because of a

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.250 
ops 2 I don't know if it's because of a
recent<00:04:21.950> update<00:04:22.130> or<00:04:22.400> something<00:04:22.960> but<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.050> almost

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
recent update or something but it almost

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.320 
recent update or something but it almost
seems<00:04:24.530> like<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:25.039> have<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.190> host<00:04:25.430> disadvantage

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
seems like you have a host disadvantage

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.740 
seems like you have a host disadvantage
now

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
now

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.390 
now
it<00:04:26.990> only<00:04:27.140> seems<00:04:27.380> like<00:04:27.440> if<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.830> were<00:04:27.920> hosting

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
it only seems like if you were hosting

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.420 
it only seems like if you were hosting
there<00:04:29.330> will<00:04:29.420> be<00:04:29.450> a<00:04:29.540> millisecond<00:04:30.350> lag<00:04:30.560> I<00:04:30.950> don't

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
there will be a millisecond lag I don't

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.490 
there will be a millisecond lag I don't
understand<00:04:31.910> why<00:04:32.090> this<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.510> it's<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.230> complete

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
understand why this is it's the complete

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.140 
understand why this is it's the complete
opposite<00:04:33.860> as<00:04:34.010> it<00:04:34.160> was<00:04:34.310> in<00:04:34.520> previous<00:04:34.850> Call<00:04:35.120> of

opposite as it was in previous Call of

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.420 
opposite as it was in previous Call of
Duty<00:04:35.360> games<00:04:35.540> but<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:36.470> almost<00:04:36.620> seems<00:04:36.770> like<00:04:37.040> they

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
Duty games but it almost seems like they

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.010 
Duty games but it almost seems like they
knew<00:04:37.730> there<00:04:38.000> was<00:04:38.120> a<00:04:38.150> horrible<00:04:38.570> lag<00:04:38.780> issue

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
knew there was a horrible lag issue

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.780 
knew there was a horrible lag issue
which<00:04:39.290> how<00:04:39.830> can<00:04:40.040> they<00:04:40.160> not<00:04:40.370> everyone

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
which how can they not everyone

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.390 
which how can they not everyone
complains<00:04:41.180> about<00:04:41.300> it<00:04:41.540> and<00:04:42.070> instead<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.190> just

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
complains about it and instead of just

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.610 
complains about it and instead of just
fixing<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.480> network<00:04:44.780> code<00:04:45.020> or<00:04:45.230> making<00:04:45.530> it

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
fixing the network code or making it

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.500 
fixing the network code or making it
better<00:04:45.800> which<00:04:46.130> I'll<00:04:46.850> give<00:04:47.030> them<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.210> little<00:04:47.360> bit

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
better which I'll give them a little bit

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.300 
better which I'll give them a little bit
of<00:04:47.600> credit<00:04:47.900> they<00:04:48.530> definitely<00:04:48.680> do<00:04:48.980> have<00:04:49.280> a

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
of credit they definitely do have a

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.000 
of credit they definitely do have a
better<00:04:49.750> way<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.780> tell<00:04:51.110> who's<00:04:51.470> close<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:51.860> you

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
better way to tell who's close to you

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.170 
better way to tell who's close to you
and<00:04:52.160> who<00:04:52.220> isn't<00:04:52.400> they<00:04:52.580> definitely<00:04:52.760> do<00:04:52.970> have<00:04:53.120> a

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
and who isn't they definitely do have a

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.510 
and who isn't they definitely do have a
better<00:04:53.540> I<00:04:53.810> don't<00:04:54.680> know<00:04:54.800> they<00:04:54.950> didn't<00:04:55.190> entirely

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
better I don't know they didn't entirely

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.070 
better I don't know they didn't entirely
rewrite<00:04:56.180> it<00:04:56.300> it's<00:04:56.420> pretty<00:04:56.570> obvious<00:04:56.870> that<00:04:56.990> they

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
rewrite it it's pretty obvious that they

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.510 
rewrite it it's pretty obvious that they
didn't<00:04:57.290> rewrite<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.770> entire<00:04:57.890> networking

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
didn't rewrite the entire networking

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.310 
didn't rewrite the entire networking
code<00:04:58.640> but<00:04:59.150> it<00:04:59.240> does<00:04:59.390> seem<00:04:59.630> to<00:04:59.750> be<00:04:59.780> better<00:05:00.080> at

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
code but it does seem to be better at

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.990 
code but it does seem to be better at
region<00:05:00.710> locking<00:05:00.890> now<00:05:01.160> half<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.730> time<00:05:01.880> when

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
region locking now half the time when

I'm<00:05:02.090> in<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.480> game<00:05:02.720> I<00:05:03.020> start<00:05:03.710> seeing<00:05:03.890> the<00:05:04.040> 503

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
I'm in a game I start seeing the 503

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.250 
I'm in a game I start seeing the 503
codes<00:05:04.850> which<00:05:05.030> is<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.300> Portland<00:05:05.750> area<00:05:05.930> code

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
codes which is the Portland area code

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.460 
codes which is the Portland area code
start<00:05:07.190> seeing<00:05:07.430> stuff<00:05:07.760> about<00:05:08.200> PDX<00:05:09.200> such<00:05:09.350> as

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
start seeing stuff about PDX such as

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.510 
start seeing stuff about PDX such as
Portland's<00:05:09.800> Airport<00:05:10.100> and<00:05:10.190> start<00:05:10.340> seeing

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
Portland's Airport and start seeing

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.490 
Portland's Airport and start seeing
stuff<00:05:10.700> about<00:05:10.910> Seattle<00:05:11.480> so<00:05:11.900> it<00:05:12.290> does<00:05:12.410> a<00:05:12.440> much

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
stuff about Seattle so it does a much

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.960 
stuff about Seattle so it does a much
better<00:05:12.710> job<00:05:12.830> pairing<00:05:13.340> those<00:05:13.490> people<00:05:13.760> that<00:05:13.820> are

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
better job pairing those people that are

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:14.950 
better job pairing those people that are
close<00:05:14.150> to<00:05:14.300> you<00:05:14.360> they<00:05:14.450> have<00:05:14.570> a<00:05:14.600> good<00:05:14.750> connection

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
close to you they have a good connection

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.110 
close to you they have a good connection
to<00:05:15.200> you<00:05:15.430> but<00:05:16.430> it<00:05:16.520> almost<00:05:16.640> seems<00:05:16.790> like<00:05:16.940> they

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
to you but it almost seems like they

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.930 
to you but it almost seems like they
tried<00:05:17.390> to<00:05:17.419> overdo<00:05:18.410> the<00:05:18.650> lag<00:05:18.830> compensation<00:05:19.340> it

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
tried to overdo the lag compensation it

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.180 
tried to overdo the lag compensation it
almost<00:05:20.180> seems<00:05:20.390> like<00:05:20.480> they<00:05:21.320> knew<00:05:21.590> that<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:21.980> lag

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
almost seems like they knew that the lag

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.180 
almost seems like they knew that the lag
was<00:05:22.730> a<00:05:22.760> lot<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.330> just<00:05:23.660> a<00:05:23.750> very<00:05:23.930> big<00:05:24.080> issue<00:05:24.320> so

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
was a lot of just a very big issue so

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.150 
was a lot of just a very big issue so
instead<00:05:25.640> of<00:05:25.700> just<00:05:25.970> outright<00:05:26.419> fixing<00:05:26.900> it<00:05:27.160> they

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
instead of just outright fixing it they

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.430 
instead of just outright fixing it they
made<00:05:28.480> everyone<00:05:29.480> else<00:05:29.540> that<00:05:29.750> isn't<00:05:29.900> hosting

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
made everyone else that isn't hosting

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.030 
made everyone else that isn't hosting
have<00:05:31.150> it<00:05:32.150> just<00:05:32.470> ridiculously<00:05:33.470> just

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
have it just ridiculously just

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.710 
have it just ridiculously just
overcompensate<00:05:34.850> for<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.210> fact<00:05:35.419> that<00:05:35.600> they're

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
overcompensate for the fact that they're

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.260 
overcompensate for the fact that they're
not<00:05:35.840> hosting<00:05:36.370> because<00:05:37.370> of<00:05:37.610> when<00:05:37.700> I'm<00:05:37.850> hosting

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
not hosting because of when I'm hosting

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.810 
not hosting because of when I'm hosting
and<00:05:38.479> I<00:05:38.540> like<00:05:38.810> someone<00:05:39.169> up<00:05:39.290> and<00:05:39.620> then<00:05:40.490> I<00:05:40.520> turn<00:05:40.790> it

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
and I like someone up and then I turn it

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.610 
and I like someone up and then I turn it
on<00:05:41.090> their<00:05:41.330> screen<00:05:41.630> I'm<00:05:41.780> not<00:05:41.990> even<00:05:42.169> shooting<00:05:42.500> at

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
on their screen I'm not even shooting at

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.530 
on their screen I'm not even shooting at
them<00:05:42.770> it's<00:05:43.490> almost<00:05:43.729> like<00:05:43.970> they're<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.360> one

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
them it's almost like they're the one

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.300 
them it's almost like they're the one
hosting<00:05:44.930> it's<00:05:45.470> like<00:05:45.650> that's<00:05:45.830> how<00:05:45.979> it<00:05:46.130> feels

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
hosting it's like that's how it feels

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.950 
hosting it's like that's how it feels
which<00:05:46.790> is<00:05:46.910> a<00:05:46.940> little<00:05:47.210> annoying<00:05:47.419> cuz<00:05:47.720> I<00:05:47.780> have<00:05:47.870> my

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
which is a little annoying cuz I have my

decent internet I have standard t1 works
like<00:05:53.600> it's<00:05:53.750> supposed<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.169> I<00:05:54.200> have<00:05:54.410> overall<00:05:54.680> you

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
like it's supposed to I have overall you

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.159 
like it's supposed to I have overall you
know<00:05:55.550> the<00:05:55.700> ideal<00:05:56.210> setup<00:05:56.540> when<00:05:56.810> it<00:05:56.900> comes<00:05:57.050> to

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
know the ideal setup when it comes to

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.450 
know the ideal setup when it comes to
gaming<00:05:57.380> and<00:05:57.650> then<00:05:58.100> I<00:05:58.160> end<00:05:58.310> up<00:05:58.400> getting

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
gaming and then I end up getting

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.500 
gaming and then I end up getting
punished<00:05:58.880> for<00:05:58.940> it<00:05:59.120> so<00:05:59.210> it's<00:05:59.330> kind<00:05:59.479> of

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
punished for it so it's kind of

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.070 
punished for it so it's kind of
frustrating

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
frustrating

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.050 
frustrating

anyway as you saw there I want a little

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.490 
anyway as you saw there I want a little
bit<00:06:02.240> of<00:06:02.330> a<00:06:02.390> run<00:06:02.600> towards<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.050> end<00:06:03.169> of<00:06:03.260> the<00:06:03.320> game

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
bit of a run towards the end of the game

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.070 
bit of a run towards the end of the game
pretty<00:06:04.100> decent<00:06:04.490> game<00:06:04.610> only<00:06:05.450> that<00:06:05.690> a<00:06:05.720> few<00:06:06.050> times

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080
