 one night will be 25 thousand dollars 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.060
 it seems that the creators 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.500
 launched inside midas and forced him 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.970

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.680
 for us as for anyone passing by 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.959
 man’s street it looks like 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.769

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.239
 face theme to a one-way mirror 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.830
 really worked especially 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.360
 shy will have to choose more 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.540
 traditional ways of coping 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.549
 for example in the nearest restaurant but if 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.690
 you will see a giant silver box 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.790
 in a public place 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.400

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.530
 there are even toilets with games to choose from 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.209
 several but they all share one thing you 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.129
 You control your urine stream 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.660
 for example in the game graffiti raiser you 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.560
 wash graffiti off the walls with 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.690
 your urine 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.760

 parade match allows you to lift the skirt 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.920
 girls in this way the stronger pressure 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.450
 the more the skirt rises before 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.859

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.540
 located sensors using which 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.959
 target accuracy is determined blue 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.629
 label 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.220
 impact and jet pressure at the end of each 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.109
 games you must be told 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.180
 how many milliliters have you survived 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.700
 all your achievements can be reset to 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.130
 flash drive and then show it to friends so 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.769
 say to be measured by the street jets 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.169
 amsterdam toilets say that in the capital 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.130
 amsterdam netherlands very complacent 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.049
 and open people 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.400
 if someone thinks otherwise offer 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.349
 look at the open booths 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.660
 installed on the streets yes 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.040
 right this is a toilet and who said that 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.049
 in order to celebrate a little need 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.329
 man needs solitude 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.069
 let's leave prejudices like left them 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.319
 who installed similar toiletries 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.000
 booths in general is such an unexpected 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.769
 solution of one of the most ancient but 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.930
 urgent and recurring 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.760
 questions would be great for those who 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.739
 sometimes on the streets of our cities confuses 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.500
 house walls and pillars with a latrine 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.720
 let me and what makes houses look like 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.370
 the fact that the solution to this issue is 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.430
 is under development 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.289
 ice toilet what are the requirements which 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.389
 usually a person puts to the toilet 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.160
 unless of course the dream of your life 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.960
 is a golden toilet then all people 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.760
 less standard requirements for 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.099

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.400
 convenient and it would be nice to have any nearby 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.560
 turned out to be an interesting rag 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.509
 The time has passed, however, in this 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.610
 the toilet room fresh press you obviously 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.889
 not needed unless of course you want 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.770
 so that you can be torn off from your seat by 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.030
 playing it with a blowtorch 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.160

 which is built each year in one 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.639
 from the cities of Sweden the main charm 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.800
 of this toilet is that 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.419
 there are never any queues in front of him 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.630
 how hardly anyone will occupy him 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:08.860
 for a long time
