00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.569
 Hello, today I will show you how 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.580
 close the hinges 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.210
 evenly in the armhole this method can 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.760
 apply 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:22.560
 sex by the way loops in the shoulder is obtained 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:26.730
 such a smooth pelvis and that we put something about 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.330
 he has a right curve and know 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.480

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.980
 maybe they use the flood plain 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:42.110
 deceased vulture such seem years expressed 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.200
 the sample knitted one row 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:50.340
 almost to the end we need to reduce 5 loops 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.230
 according to the scheme for this on whether you need knitting 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.190
 leave not tied 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.059
 6 loops let us take naba leave 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.260
 one loop more better specially 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.860
 left needles 4 of them we you shoot on 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.880
 right 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:15.330
 do not knit steel 2 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.700
 far left throw on the previous one 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.270
 do not knit the loop then with the right 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.710
 knitting needles 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:30.200
 still remove one letter to the left knitting needle 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:33.200
 again we throw the leftmost on 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 previous 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:47.890
 following with the right spokes we throw 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:50.400
 Hollywood and it throws another extreme 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.400
 one 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.160
 [music] 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.560
 and last last remaining loop 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.880
 not knitted 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.880
 knit necessarily facial 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.180
 I got a pigtail 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.380
 Torah than nedelin 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.540
 nevezhin in the opposite direction 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:07.189
 [music] 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.050
 [music] 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:26.060
 so we have 6 left on the left needle 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:28.750
 loops 5 umbrella shell we are here already 4 loop 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.220
 we shoot on the grass 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.380
 [music] 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.230
 I mean, as I have said before, always 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.260
 become unbound on one 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:46.820
 loop more 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:51.560
 far left throw on the previous 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:58.970
 with the right knitting needle of the son, misch one to the left 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.970

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.960
 [music] 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:17.819
 [music] 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.260
 and this last loop tying 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:36.230
 even though it is on the wrong side of pages 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:43.040
 knitting facial and it turns out too 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:47.389
 smooth edge and so knit next facial 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.080
 the row is already in pattern we do not forget that 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:54.160
