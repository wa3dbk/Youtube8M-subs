disappointing<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:06.040> really<00:03:06.700> unfortunate

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
disappointing and really unfortunate

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.870 
disappointing and really unfortunate
especially<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:08.170> your<00:03:08.290> fans<00:03:08.620> because<00:03:09.250> you

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
especially to your fans because you

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.280 
especially to your fans because you
never<00:03:10.000> really<00:03:10.150> address<00:03:10.690> them<00:03:10.930> or<00:03:11.079> anything

never really address them or anything

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.789 
never really address them or anything
but<00:03:11.829> I<00:03:12.280> think<00:03:12.760> I've<00:03:12.850> read<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.239> about<00:03:13.360> that<00:03:13.799> bit

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
but I think I've read it about that bit

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.370 
but I think I've read it about that bit
too<00:03:15.100> much<00:03:15.400> very<00:03:16.209> few<00:03:16.480> wrestlers<00:03:16.930> can<00:03:17.140> touch

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
too much very few wrestlers can touch

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.069 
too much very few wrestlers can touch

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.119 
okay touched it yeah Sam Polk may have
been<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.780> reason<00:03:31.900> why<00:03:32.290> this<00:03:32.349> game<00:03:32.769> has<00:03:32.950> been

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
been the reason why this game has been

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.339 
been the reason why this game has been
delayed<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.760> that's<00:03:34.599> really<00:03:35.049> unfortunate

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
delayed and that's really unfortunate

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.399 
delayed and that's really unfortunate
like<00:03:35.799> one<00:03:36.099> person<00:03:36.700> makes<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.569> game<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:38.260> get

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
like one person makes a game to get

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.350 
like one person makes a game to get
delayed<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:38.950> not<00:03:39.040> only<00:03:39.159> that<00:03:39.610> but<00:03:40.030> he<00:03:40.209> was

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
delayed and not only that but he was

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.690 
delayed and not only that but he was
actually<00:03:40.569> a<00:03:40.810> big<00:03:41.049> part<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.620> game<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.250> it's

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
actually a big part of the game and it's

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.759 
actually a big part of the game and it's
funny<00:03:42.970> how<00:03:43.060> he<00:03:43.150> was<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.659> first<00:03:43.930> person<00:03:44.409> to<00:03:44.439> be

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
funny how he was the first person to be

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.479 
funny how he was the first person to be
revealed<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.609> 2k<00:03:46.120> showcase<00:03:46.659> against<00:03:47.109> Cena

not really because I'm hyped but at the
same<00:04:19.599> time<00:04:19.780> I'm<00:04:19.930> not<00:04:20.079> high<00:04:20.260> because<00:04:20.440> they've

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370
