00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.599
 a lot has already happened 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.860
 sportclub freiburg has five newcomers 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.349
 christian prank already on the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.480
 training grounds welcome with 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.510
 thanks and philipp two out of their own 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.150
 youth and with franz spit and rita is coming 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.750
 the experience of collected 3 187 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.510
 Bundesliga play to sc in addition to Roman 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.880
 Bürki swiss wm driver and competition 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.129
 for militia on the goalkeeper position the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.050
 basis for the new arrivals she agrees 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.079
 but the search is over 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.780
 reinforcements do not say away anymore 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.449
 I look for new entrances but only if 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.719
 It really fits everything for us mine 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.429
 that it really helps us too 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.140
 an affirmation is if not me then 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.739
 have young players who are talented 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.809
 and then with the race 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.229
 he has got to get in the sascha 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.659
 riether with maik franz and the boy 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.219
 do it really well they that one 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.160
 or make other progress correctly 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.410
 feed more there is a stupid thing entirely 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.850
 big pressure but this pressure could 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.680
 still come if namely the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.900
 new world champion matthias 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.880
 child has yet changed to bvb 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.520
 allegedly dortmund a final 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.940
 offer for the defensive all-rounder 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.800
 have submitted 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.440
 well that too little is yes this 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.070
 this media story yes finales 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.630
 offer 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.980
 you try to know that now 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.690
 to shoot the ball back and forth 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.310
 it is so that it is I have too 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.860
 said that if it freiburg for the sc 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.440
 there would be an offer where we then too 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.010
 economically reasonable to say 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.470
 on top of freiburg who are you are you 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.320
 but then it is not 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.920
 there and that is why it was also 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.380
 what the cellar has said 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.790
 it does not work but as I said if if 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.970
 if if anything happens 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.840
 should we be the last ones then 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.600
 unreasonable can last freiburg 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.310
 the future of ver 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.289
 this is still unclear 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.990
 Hannover probably has interest 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.620
 but only on loan a change would be 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.120
 probably the best for everyone involved 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:17.530
 then we have a dissatisfied 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.500
 player less in the squad and I hope 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.920
 that it is so lost at one 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.910
 other club would be satisfied namely 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.730
 would play and with and with with free 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.799
 Ghosts on the subject rangeht 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.170
 then it would certainly be there 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.400
 an optimal solution than at the moment here 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.709
 at the sc freiburg 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.390
 from a sporting point of view are the first 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.670
 training weeks went well 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.190
 There were four in the four test matches 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.260
 win the game against a stronger one 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.680
 eintracht freiburg was at the booth of 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.830
 15 0 because of heavy rain prematurely 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.769
 canceled 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.489
 it follows a 14 to 0 at fv tennenbronn 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.650
 the home club of christian günther 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.420
 the highest class opponent so far 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.870
 swiss second division fc winterthur 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.940
 was defeated in offenburg with 6 3 also 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.489
 thanks to a great free kick goal of 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.530
 new entry maik franz 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.299
 finally there was a 13 0 at the sv 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.010
 Ending where you are against the 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.450
 association leagues especially in half 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.549
 two hard did 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.100
 then it went into a week 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.950
 training break the preparation up 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.420
 now absolutely successful 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.239
 since I am very satisfied because we are very 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.890
 had little hurt because most of them 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.739
 full program and it could 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.840
 was very very hard break not you send 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:39.260
 few days at home but they have none 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.330
 break they have very very intense 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.470
 content with many sprints you 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.980
 complete 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.319
 of that I am satisfied with the 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.430
 what has happened so far on friday 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.370
 then for ten days in the training camp 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.470
 to austria in schruns above the team 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.959
 then missed the tactical finish 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.299
 in addition, there are test matches against goals 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.720
 st gallen and torpedo moscow on the 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.720
 program
