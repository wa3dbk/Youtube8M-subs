00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.839
 Hi everyone, I'm here to talk 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.700
 than do the review of the last song 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.540
 Nicolas Sparks 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:18.240
 I just read the book, I really liked it. 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:20.670
 and so the story of the book is that it is 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.680
 a story like that girl revolted 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.609
 that will bring happiness to her 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.429
 likes to spend time with the pac read and 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.040
 then suddenly the most beautiful boy 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.489
 rich but all good of the city and if 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480
 interested in it because nobody knows me 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.440
 smells 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.399
 just not because nicolas does it 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.000
 turn that into a story as well 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.190
 captivating a beautiful story that has 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.010
 A few surprises in the end I cried 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.770
 and I cried a lot that I 'm crying 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.910
 lot and not only in books but 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.840
 if you really focus on history 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.850
 Wow, there's no way you do not have it. 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.170
 our emotional 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.310
 finally it was a step reading that I went 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.040
 Very well. 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.340
 I love the passion the only books 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.420
 college and so if you do not like a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.390
 romance water with sugar did not read because it is 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.409
 well my own side is not sic 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.570
 but videos of Nicolas are generally 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.490
 probed but I know not what 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.430
 A little surprised I liked it a lot 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.530
 and I thought the story was not 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.890
 the story fit very well 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:46.829
 flowed very well it was very easy he 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:49.380
 book and there is one thing I really liked 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.829
 in this group that is thus 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.869
 it's a book made of books it's kind 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.869
 so each character has a style 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:09.569
 Marcos has rooney who is the main 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:11.819
 tour link is there 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.470
 and so I liked that because he's a 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:19.230
 book made from books what's cool 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.680
 Why are not you surprised at that? 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.519
 in that vision only the protagonist 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.940
 understood you read the other books 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:34.019
 and you have an overview of what she knows 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.790
 well cool this so for that reason 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.610
 not being a book takes a side as the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.299
 others that only write 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.209
 I love passion, and I'm going to give a note. 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.489
 5 for the last song I thought 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.519
 cool, I thought it was very, very cool 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.069
 then my book coffees I think 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.790
 all the books now come out with this cover 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:01.230
 the cover of the film is here has the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:05.010
 analyze them and that the lion receives the port 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.220
 so and he is what he did is in some 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.220
 schedules 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.760
 he then made of mercenaries 2 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.260
 I also went to find out if later when 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.780
 I was searching the internet and I do not 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.090
 I know if you know but the book he went to 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.590
 Pro done because the film 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.690
 contrary to the other books of the 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.780
 chute he did that there were books 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.480
 right and ended up being adapted to 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.690
 and this book was made for the purpose of 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:41.069
 to turn film because it's more saidinhos 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.470
 wanted to do some similar production 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.480
 with the diary of a passion and called 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.069
 to Nicolas holds all that 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.790
 story if you want to know 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.180
 story 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.870
 blog's review go to the blog see a 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.080
 review 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.390
 Legal'll leave at home down here i 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.569
 and that's it 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.640
 if you feel like reading the book and 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.220
 have not you seen the movie yet? 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.069
 I advise you to read the book before and 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.010
 watch the movie later because the first 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.829
 because it's cool for you to form our head. 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.019
 the characters before watching the movie 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.359
 you see the movie first after you 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.049
 thinks of the mother as the moroni is not 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.320
 cool because it 's not the same 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.150
 I'm sorry but it's true, is not it not me? 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.919
 I know how to paint the nail in purple hair 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.460
 But that is beside the point 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.930
 second because it does not spoil the 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.090
 surprise of the book is because at the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.190
 There's always that little surprise back 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.550
 and if you watch the movie 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.949
 First you end up asking for break, right? 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.800
 but if you have already seen the movie that is the book 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.020
 read this does not stop you even because it was the 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.690
 In my case I had seen the movie before 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.160
 in a book after and after I saw the 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.330
 movie because I could not remember 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.130
 Very well, but no problem 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.660
 none 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.200
 the ideal is the book where the film is seen 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.490
 after 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.800
 but if it was not the case, that's okay 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.050
 so like I said I saw the movie again 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.289
 after I finished reading the book I 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.110
 I understand why they did it but the 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:20.310
 There's a lot to do with me in the movie. 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.860
 so kind some some things that 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.870
 happened in the clear book that is a 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.699
 adaptation we understand that they 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.669
 modify some things to be more 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:33.330
 easy to understand or to shorten the 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.370
 story but the movie was written in the 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.560
 intent on making a movie 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.479
 so I understand why you did this right? 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.610
 signed up to make the film but 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.910
 a whole movie does not paint my hair 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.490
 girl a little thing she was not going to do 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.930
 much difference in recording but 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:54.919
 It would be cool to be able to hit 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:59.190
 character of the book but I finally liked it 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:01.380
 five stars in the evaluation as already 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.510
 had said for the fact 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.580
 the five stars are due to the fact 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.980
 without a good club really not evaluating the 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:12.120
 The film is also very good but not 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:15.120
 is as good as the obvious book and it is not 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.280
 so similar to this 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.620
 They have changed many things I thought of 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.430
 But I'm here for the best. 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.080
 then book five stars for the fact 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.300
 be divided into books 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.670
 which I really liked and was not very 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.680
 my use 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.530
 so this is it if you agree 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.660

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.750
