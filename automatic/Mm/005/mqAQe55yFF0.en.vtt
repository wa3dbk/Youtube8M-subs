before<00:01:08.700> spray-painting<00:01:09.390> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.550 

so<00:01:19.000> for<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.240> vanity<00:01:19.660> after<00:01:20.110> I<00:01:20.140> put<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.410> back

back<00:01:22.930> on<00:01:23.140> there<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:27.490> I<00:01:27.520> wanted<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:28.000> do

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
back on there then I wanted to do

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.340 
back on there then I wanted to do
something<00:01:28.480> a<00:01:28.570> little<00:01:28.600> different<00:01:29.229> from

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
something a little different from

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.070 
something a little different from
mirrors<00:01:29.830> so<00:01:30.160> I<00:01:30.370> got<00:01:30.880> these<00:01:31.060> at<00:01:31.360> Target<00:01:31.750> they

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
mirrors so I got these at Target they

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.350 
mirrors so I got these at Target they
were<00:01:32.140> super<00:01:32.560> inexpensive<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:34.150> took

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
were super inexpensive and I took

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.240 
were super inexpensive and I took
command<00:01:34.570> strips<00:01:35.080> you<00:01:35.350> just<00:01:35.619> stick<00:01:35.830> it<00:01:35.979> on<00:01:36.100> the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
command strips you just stick it on the

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.920 
command strips you just stick it on the
back<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.790> you<00:01:36.910> can<00:01:37.030> actually<00:01:37.180> just<00:01:37.570> stick<00:01:37.780> it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
back and you can actually just stick it

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.030 
back and you can actually just stick it
on<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.170> wall<00:01:38.200> so<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.590> can<00:01:38.650> do<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:38.890> yourself

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
on the wall so you can do it yourself

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.300 
on the wall so you can do it yourself
and<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:40.210> used<00:01:40.690> three<00:01:41.229> mirrors<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:42.010> created

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
and I used three mirrors and created

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.570 
and I used three mirrors and created
this<00:01:42.460> cool<00:01:42.729> shape<00:01:43.979> next<00:01:44.979> I<00:01:45.190> just<00:01:45.369> took<00:01:45.520> some

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
this cool shape next I just took some

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.790 
this cool shape next I just took some
expo<00:01:46.119> pens<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.720> wrote<00:01:46.960> right<00:01:47.170> on<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.470> mirror

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
expo pens and wrote right on the mirror

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.920 
expo pens and wrote right on the mirror
because<00:01:48.100> it's<00:01:48.399> really<00:01:48.790> easy<00:01:48.910> to<00:01:49.210> erase<00:01:49.600> just

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
because it's really easy to erase just

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.920 
because it's really easy to erase just
with<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.170> paper<00:01:50.530> towel<00:01:50.830> or<00:01:51.100> anything<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:52.300> I<00:01:52.630> made
