00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
but every tree is not the same so some

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.360 
but every tree is not the same so some
trees<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.290> tend<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:43.980> bit<00:00:44.190> more

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.000 
heard the expression before shake the
mulberry<00:01:46.820> tree<00:01:47.300> well<00:01:47.660> really<00:01:48.500> that's<00:01:48.740> all<00:01:48.860> you

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
mulberry tree well really that's all you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.770 
mulberry tree well really that's all you
have<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.310> do<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.580> I've<00:01:49.670> shake<00:01:49.940> shaking<00:01:50.510> the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
have to do and I've shake shaking the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.570 
have to do and I've shake shaking the
street<00:01:51.110> down<00:01:51.320> several<00:01:51.800> times<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.460> got

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
street down several times and got

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.880 
street down several times and got
several<00:01:52.910> more<00:01:53.060> bits<00:01:53.270> off<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:53.960> this<00:01:54.830> is

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
several more bits off of it so this is

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.350 
several more bits off of it so this is
probably<00:01:55.460> going<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.730> the<00:01:55.850> last<00:01:56.060> time<00:01:56.210> I'm

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
probably going to be the last time I'm

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.000 
probably going to be the last time I'm
going<00:01:56.480> to<00:01:56.570> harvest<00:01:56.840> off<00:01:57.080> of<00:01:57.290> it<00:01:57.440> maybe<00:01:57.740> but

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
going to harvest off of it maybe but

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.440 
going to harvest off of it maybe but
then<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.220> keeps<00:01:58.340> surprising<00:01:58.910> me<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.180> making

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
then it keeps surprising me and making

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.490 
then it keeps surprising me and making
more<00:01:59.600> and<00:01:59.660> more<00:01:59.750> and<00:01:59.960> more<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.170> more<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:00.410> more

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
more and more and more and more and more

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.870 
more and more and more and more and more
so<00:02:00.740> there<00:02:00.920> may<00:02:01.040> be<00:02:01.070> another<00:02:01.370> harvest<00:02:01.730> we

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
so there may be another harvest we

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.870 
so there may be another harvest we
noticed<00:02:02.590> but<00:02:03.590> there<00:02:03.800> is<00:02:03.920> some<00:02:04.130> rain<00:02:04.280> coming<00:02:04.670> so

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
noticed but there is some rain coming so

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.220 
noticed but there is some rain coming so
I<00:02:04.910> want<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.240> get<00:02:05.330> it<00:02:05.450> done<00:02:05.570> before<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.080> rain

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
I want to get it done before the rain

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.720 
I want to get it done before the rain
because<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.680> rain<00:02:06.830> will<00:02:07.010> definitely<00:02:07.490> knock<00:02:07.700> a

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
because the rain will definitely knock a

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.490 
because the rain will definitely knock a
lot<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.149> them<00:02:08.240> to<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.479> ground<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.930> once

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
lot of them to the ground and once

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.390 
lot of them to the ground and once
they're<00:02:09.770> off<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.810> tree<00:02:11.810> they<00:02:12.560> they<00:02:12.920> start<00:02:13.190> to

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
they're off the tree they they start to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.640 
they're off the tree they they start to
soften<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.970> rot<00:02:14.510> really<00:02:14.870> really<00:02:15.080> quickly<00:02:15.320> so

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
soften and rot really really quickly so

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.560 
soften and rot really really quickly so
you<00:02:16.040> want<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.310> pick<00:02:16.460> them<00:02:16.580> off<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.150> tree<00:02:17.330> don't

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
you want to pick them off the tree don't

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.970 
you want to pick them off the tree don't
really<00:02:17.840> too<00:02:18.020> much<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.320> want<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.530> pick<00:02:18.680> off<00:02:18.830> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
really too much you want to pick off the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.020 
really too much you want to pick off the
ground<00:02:19.220> because<00:02:19.310> they're<00:02:19.550> already<00:02:19.820> turned

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
ground because they're already turned

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.670 
ground because they're already turned
into<00:02:20.150> wine<00:02:25.900> everything<00:02:26.900> back<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.440> tree

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
into wine everything back to the tree

00:02:27.680 --> 00:03:05.300 
into wine everything back to the tree
and<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.950> lose<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.190> lot<00:02:28.430> on<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.640> ground

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.100 

like<00:03:05.610> this<00:03:05.850> you're<00:03:06.090> getting<00:03:06.240> only<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.900> right

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
like this you're getting only the right

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.890 
like this you're getting only the right
berries

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900

the red berries as you can see off of a

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.880 
the red berries as you can see off of a
branch<00:03:28.450> that's<00:03:28.629> been<00:03:28.840> harvested<00:03:29.109> many<00:03:29.650> many

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
many many many times already this this

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.349 
many many many times already this this
season<00:03:32.920> just<00:03:33.099> that<00:03:33.730> one<00:03:33.939> little<00:03:34.180> tiny<00:03:34.569> shaking

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
so even though their flavor is a little

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.390 
so even though their flavor is a little
bit<00:03:42.790> more<00:03:43.120> mild<00:03:43.450> than<00:03:43.780> say<00:03:44.290> wild<00:03:44.769> blackberry

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400
