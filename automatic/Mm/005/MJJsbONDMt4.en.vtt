00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 we 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.640
 closed today a new video of 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.300
 presentation video presentation of a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.750
 Graphic card 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.050
 in fact if it's a map it goes 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.079
 fit into a comparison between amd 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.089
 and nvidia then poor nvidia sim gtx 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.320
 560 ti that was held back she comes to us 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.070
 from pen y 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.719
 we will discover the map in more detail 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.109
 here is the card with his bundle then at 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.100
 bundle level two 6-pin adapters 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:53.969
 the card a dvi vga adapter manual 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.850
 dvd driver and code to have 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.530
 the panda extension 2 euros now 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.089
 we will linger on the map anyway 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.489
 which is more interesting so a 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:06.110
 it's easy to recognize with the signature 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.549
 golden on top of both connections 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.409
 6-pin needed for the operation of the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.399
 map 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:17.759
 the mini blue pcb with particularity that 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:20.820
 is common to gti 610 the end of the fairing 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.130
 which exceeds the pcv at the outputs 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.770
 between or two outputs dvi an output 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.189
 hdmi an output display port here we go 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.579
 to make you 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.240
 we are the map quietly then if 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.240
 discover it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.430
 and we will go to specifications 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.520
 techniques then the map 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.410
 she embeds a 915 billion gpu on 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.610
 the boost is 1,981 billion 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:02:00.180
 the memory is at 6008 mega hertz and the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.530
 board 2 GB of gddr5 interfaced 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.470
 in 192 bits 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.150
 so that's where she did the comparison and 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.150
 we wanted to deliver soon
