00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.360
 good morning then with this little one 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.589
 video we are going to dissipate some 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.039
 confusion that exists with this new one 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:16.830
 alarm that always give in stoves 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:19.619
 of the extra frame and could be 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.279
 confused with the old from file of 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:28.080
 stoves produced until around 2012 approximately 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.029
 it's actually another alarm 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.009
 let's see what we learn to distinguish 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.420
 one from the other then first of all 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.130
 this alarm and you can have it and then 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.600
 we say we solve it on life and if 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.940
 you have a pressure switch like this or 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.800
 you can find it in metal made like 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.450
 a flask to which a is connected 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.730
 silicone sheath that enters the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.430
 tank 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.750
 how this pressure switch works 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:02.460
 it works like this if the air passes by 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.530
 from the pellet tank through the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.170
 the couple's slide then the slide 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.390
 pellet descent and into the stove 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.250
 if everything works as it should work 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.010
 there is a continuous flow of air 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.680
 very poor the pellets inside the stove 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.720
 also the air falls we say the nos 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.240
 air pirate 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 if for some reason this flow 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.650
 air from the pellet tank 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.670
 inside the stove 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.290
 stops or even reverses 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.180
 that the most dangerous thing because the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.870
 flame can get even 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.930
 that tube you see the price been 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.920
 he notices it interrupts the fall of the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.140
 skin 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.820
 so it is this Celtic guide solves 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.969
 this problem when the stove does not have 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.549
 other problems or before doing 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:56.450
 this test you have to check that they are 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.219
 clean the chimney the pipes the stove 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.159
 inside that the frost you smoke from the stove to 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:04.069
 which there will be another brief guide if with 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.979
 all these things don't work 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.080
 you can do this thing to unplug the 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.780
 always check the tube from where it is 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.840
 unplug because then later you get confused and 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:20.780
 You do not know where to put it back dropped 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:25.459
 near boys to blow in and to 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.049
 put it back on or even unbalanced everything 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.069
 the price was however left to 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:35.019
 fruit in which the network pre soft or a 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:40.310
 coupling here now we put it up 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:43.519
 common it with difficult tomorrow because 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.799
 because this tube goes into the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.549
 cockerel tank 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:54.139
 if with time the signature blocks it 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:56.870
 c.da of alarm register of repeating 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:59.930
 in the def file for depp file you have to 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.790
 looking at the other guide another thing that 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.190
 we must can we do if 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:09.180
 of course as I said before it's all 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.590
 clean check that 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.830
 they did not form small ones 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.140
 fillings here otherwise called 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.870
 and you were successful with pellets it was 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.459
 stuck sideways and other talita but 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.760
 he did a little action tour then 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.000
 if necessary with the vacuum cleaner release each 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.209
 so much the descent of beauty 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.300
 last thing when blown into this 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.410
 always do it by mouth not with the 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.290
 compressor because if you were to take off 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.180
 that is castrated in here put it back up 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.250
 a grind 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.190
 therefore always in the mouth and controlled 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.459
 also that there are no eighth cracks vi 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.459
 greeting
