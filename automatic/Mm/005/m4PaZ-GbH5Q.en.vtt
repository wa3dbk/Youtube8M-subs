okay<00:00:00.890> guys<00:00:01.069> part<00:00:01.400> free<00:00:01.699> again<00:00:02.199> it's<00:00:03.199> not

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:03.709 
okay guys part free again it's not

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:07.059 
okay guys part free again it's not
scripted<00:00:04.509> unfortunately<00:00:05.509> so<00:00:06.440> just<00:00:06.859> bear<00:00:07.040> with

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
scripted unfortunately so just bear with

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.480 
scripted unfortunately so just bear with
me<00:00:07.420> so<00:00:08.420> you've<00:00:09.050> got<00:00:09.080> chemical<00:00:09.740> energy<00:00:09.890> up<00:00:10.250> here

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
me so you've got chemical energy up here

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.420 
me so you've got chemical energy up here
which<00:00:11.240> is<00:00:11.450> been<00:00:11.780> being<00:00:12.050> ignited<00:00:12.410> turned<00:00:13.100> into

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
which is been being ignited turned into

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.930 
which is been being ignited turned into
kinetic<00:00:13.910> energy<00:00:14.030> in<00:00:14.750> your<00:00:15.020> piston<00:00:15.940> pushed

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
kinetic energy in your piston pushed

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.720 
kinetic energy in your piston pushed
forcing<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:17.540> piston<00:00:17.870> down<00:00:18.050> into<00:00:18.860> a<00:00:18.890> rotate<00:00:19.550> a

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
forcing the piston down into a rotate a

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.350 
forcing the piston down into a rotate a
rotary<00:00:20.440> talk<00:00:21.440> yep<00:00:23.140> that<00:00:24.140> talk<00:00:24.500> then<00:00:25.400> is<00:00:25.789> driven

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
rotary talk yep that talk then is driven

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.529 
rotary talk yep that talk then is driven
into<00:00:26.750> the<00:00:26.960> clutch<00:00:27.530> okay<00:00:28.220> you<00:00:28.880> clutch<00:00:29.119> is<00:00:29.330> made

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
into the clutch okay you clutch is made

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.200 
into the clutch okay you clutch is made
up<00:00:29.750> of<00:00:29.930> these<00:00:30.530> friction<00:00:31.100> plates<00:00:31.369> and<00:00:31.730> the

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
up of these friction plates and the

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.290 
up of these friction plates and the
steel<00:00:32.450> plates<00:00:32.840> what<00:00:33.680> happens<00:00:34.010> is<00:00:34.220> when<00:00:35.060> you

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
steel plates what happens is when you

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.630 
steel plates what happens is when you
release<00:00:35.750> your<00:00:36.200> clutch<00:00:36.500> lever<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:38.540> springs

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
release your clutch lever the springs

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.190 
release your clutch lever the springs
force<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.880> friction<00:00:41.360> plates<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:41.960> steel

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
force the friction plates and the steel

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.299 
force the friction plates and the steel
plates<00:00:42.530> together<00:00:43.630> that<00:00:44.630> friction<00:00:45.380> is<00:00:45.590> then

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
plates together that friction is then

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.530 
plates together that friction is then
driven<00:00:46.790> you<00:00:47.600> see<00:00:47.809> here<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:48.489> how<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:50.149> drum

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
driven you see here and how the the drum

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.780 
driven you see here and how the the drum
and<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:51.399> basket<00:00:52.399> they<00:00:52.730> will<00:00:52.880> lock<00:00:53.149> into<00:00:53.390> place

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
and the basket they will lock into place

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.479 
and the basket they will lock into place
from<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:55.969> friction<00:00:56.510> of<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.750> plates<00:00:57.280> which<00:00:58.280> is

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
from the friction of the plates which is

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.209 
from the friction of the plates which is
then<00:00:58.670> driven<00:00:58.940> into<00:00:59.270> your<00:01:00.079> gears<00:01:00.379> you<00:01:00.770> gear

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
then driven into your gears you gear

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.139 
then driven into your gears you gear
wheels<00:01:01.520> here<00:01:02.530> when<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:03.710> click<00:01:04.039> up<00:01:04.609> and<00:01:04.939> down

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
wheels here when you click up and down

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.959 
wheels here when you click up and down
on<00:01:05.389> your<00:01:05.479> gear<00:01:05.840> selector<00:01:06.469> that<00:01:07.310> turns<00:01:07.670> these

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
on your gear selector that turns these

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.260 
on your gear selector that turns these
these<00:01:08.810> selectors<00:01:09.530> then<00:01:10.069> select<00:01:10.670> which<00:01:10.909> gear

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
these selectors then select which gear

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.260 
these selectors then select which gear
you're<00:01:11.659> going<00:01:12.049> into<00:01:12.429> because<00:01:13.429> of<00:01:13.579> the<00:01:13.700> size<00:01:13.999> of

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
you're going into because of the size of

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.840 
you're going into because of the size of
the<00:01:14.329> gears<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:15.560> rate<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:16.009> different<00:01:16.369> ratios

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
the gears the rate the different ratios

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.120 
the gears the rate the different ratios
of<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.119> gears<00:01:18.759> depicts<00:01:19.759> how<00:01:19.999> much<00:01:20.799> is<00:01:21.799> come

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
of the gears depicts how much is come

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.529 
of the gears depicts how much is come
how<00:01:22.459> much<00:01:22.929> and<00:01:24.429> what<00:01:25.429> speed<00:01:25.819> is<00:01:26.060> coming<00:01:26.389> out<00:01:26.509> of

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
how much and what speed is coming out of

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:33.580 
how much and what speed is coming out of
your<00:01:26.689> final<00:01:27.139> drive<00:01:27.459> okay<00:01:28.479> so<00:01:29.619> um<00:01:31.869> if<00:01:32.869> you<00:01:33.289> just

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
your final drive okay so um if you just

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.199 
your final drive okay so um if you just
drove<00:01:33.740> around<00:01:33.889> in<00:01:34.099> first<00:01:34.340> gear<00:01:34.639> all<00:01:34.849> the<00:01:34.999> time

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
drove around in first gear all the time

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.019 
drove around in first gear all the time
obviously<00:01:35.719> you'd<00:01:36.319> have<00:01:36.859> to<00:01:36.979> rev<00:01:37.310> very<00:01:37.700> high

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:38.029 
obviously you'd have to rev very high

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:41.169 
obviously you'd have to rev very high
and<00:01:38.359> you<00:01:39.020> wouldn't<00:01:39.289> get<00:01:40.009> as<00:01:40.159> much<00:01:40.399> speed<00:01:40.849> out

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
and you wouldn't get as much speed out

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.539 
and you wouldn't get as much speed out
of<00:01:41.209> that<00:01:41.450> final<00:01:41.659> drive<00:01:42.020> whereas<00:01:42.619> if<00:01:42.649> in<00:01:43.039> sixth

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
of that final drive whereas if in sixth

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.999 
of that final drive whereas if in sixth
gear<00:01:43.909> you<00:01:44.840> wouldn't<00:01:45.139> be<00:01:45.259> able<00:01:45.349> to<00:01:45.529> set<00:01:45.859> off

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
gear you wouldn't be able to set off

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.230 
gear you wouldn't be able to set off
very<00:01:46.340> quickly<00:01:46.479> because<00:01:47.479> of<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:49.789> way<00:01:50.060> the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
very quickly because of the way the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.169 
very quickly because of the way the
gearing<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:51.069> you<00:01:52.069> probably<00:01:52.669> wouldn't<00:01:52.880> even<00:01:52.969> be

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
gearing is you probably wouldn't even be

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.749 
gearing is you probably wouldn't even be
able<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.359> set<00:01:53.539> off<00:01:53.630> at<00:01:53.779> all<00:01:53.929> because<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:55.009> would

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
able to set off at all because you would

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.819 
able to set off at all because you would
it<00:01:55.999> would<00:01:56.149> be<00:01:56.389> revving<00:01:56.840> very<00:01:57.109> low<00:01:57.380> because<00:01:57.560> it

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
it would be revving very low because it

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.149 
it would be revving very low because it
would<00:01:57.979> have<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.249> put<00:01:59.149> so<00:01:59.389> much<00:01:59.599> force<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.799> only

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
would have to put so much force to only

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.999 
would have to put so much force to only
turn<00:02:01.669> the<00:02:01.880> final<00:02:02.239> drive<00:02:02.479> very<00:02:02.959> little<00:02:03.380> whereas

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
turn the final drive very little whereas

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.789 
turn the final drive very little whereas
you<00:02:04.189> need<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.489> lot<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:04.999> force<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:05.419> turn<00:02:05.959> the<00:02:06.349> fact

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
you need a lot of force to turn the fact

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.650 
you need a lot of force to turn the fact
the<00:02:07.489> final<00:02:07.849> drive<00:02:08.080> very<00:02:09.080> little<00:02:10.210> in<00:02:11.210> first

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
the final drive very little in first

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.150 
the final drive very little in first
gear

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
gear

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.220 
gear
I<00:02:13.930> think<00:02:15.010> know<00:02:16.010> very<00:02:16.610> little<00:02:16.820> force<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.990> tend

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
I think know very little force to tend

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.350 
I think know very little force to tend
the<00:02:18.290> final<00:02:19.010> drive<00:02:19.160> in<00:02:19.280> first<00:02:19.490> gear<00:02:19.640> sorry<00:02:19.940> as<00:02:20.240> I

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
the final drive in first gear sorry as I

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.830 
the final drive in first gear sorry as I
said<00:02:20.420> not<00:02:20.720> scripted<00:02:21.130> okay<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:22.190> you've<00:02:22.520> got<00:02:22.840> the

depending on the bike or maybe a prop if
you've<00:02:33.440> got<00:02:33.470> BMW<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.480> if<00:02:35.990> this<00:02:36.290> bris<00:02:36.800> bracket

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
you've got BMW so if this bris bracket

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.490 
you've got BMW so if this bris bracket
is<00:02:37.400> very<00:02:37.640> large<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.810> front<00:02:39.020> sprocket<00:02:39.410> is

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
is very large and the front sprocket is

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.710 
is very large and the front sprocket is
very<00:02:39.770> small<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:41.150> will<00:02:41.330> have<00:02:41.420> better

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
very small you will have better

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.490 
very small you will have better
acceleration<00:02:42.550> but<00:02:43.550> compromise<00:02:44.000> with<00:02:44.930> low<00:02:45.290> its

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
acceleration but compromise with low its

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.500 
acceleration but compromise with low its
top<00:02:46.010> end<00:02:46.280> okay<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:49.550> is<00:02:49.670> because<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.270> gear

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
top end okay that is because of the gear

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.270 
top end okay that is because of the gear
ratio<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.350> same<00:02:51.560> way<00:02:51.770> as<00:02:51.890> your<00:02:52.070> gearbox

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
ratio in the same way as your gearbox

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.460 
ratio in the same way as your gearbox
does<00:02:52.820> whereas<00:02:53.510> if<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:53.750> have<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.900> big<00:02:54.200> sprocket

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
does whereas if you have a big sprocket

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.650 
does whereas if you have a big sprocket
on<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.800> front<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.760> small<00:02:56.060> sprocket<00:02:56.330> on<00:02:56.540> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
on the front and a small sprocket on the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.380 
on the front and a small sprocket on the
back<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:57.590> will<00:02:57.710> get<00:02:57.890> bigger<00:02:58.250> top<00:02:58.580> end<00:02:58.820> but

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
back you will get bigger top end but

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.710 
back you will get bigger top end but
less<00:02:59.660> acceleration<00:03:01.030> it's<00:03:02.030> kind<00:03:02.360> of<00:03:02.570> in<00:03:02.690> the

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
less acceleration it's kind of in the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.170 
less acceleration it's kind of in the
same<00:03:02.840> way<00:03:03.200> as<00:03:03.440> if<00:03:03.980> you've<00:03:04.310> got<00:03:04.520> talk<00:03:04.820> you've

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
same way as if you've got talk you've

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.030 
same way as if you've got talk you've
got<00:03:05.390> more<00:03:05.570> pulling<00:03:05.930> power<00:03:06.050> so<00:03:06.860> you've<00:03:07.010> got

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
got more pulling power so you've got

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.190 
got more pulling power so you've got
loads<00:03:07.490> of<00:03:07.670> power<00:03:07.880> off<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.090> line<00:03:08.420> whereas<00:03:09.050> if

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
loads of power off the line whereas if

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.370 
loads of power off the line whereas if
you've<00:03:09.320> got<00:03:09.500> more<00:03:10.070> talking<00:03:10.580> less<00:03:10.790> horsepower

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
you've got more talking less horsepower

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.720 
you've got more talking less horsepower
then<00:03:12.380> you're<00:03:12.530> going<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.710> have<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:13.100> higher<00:03:15.730> and

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
then you're going to have a higher and

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.970 
then you're going to have a higher and
more<00:03:16.760> less<00:03:17.630> talk<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.110> more<00:03:18.230> horsepower

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
more less talk and more horsepower

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.830 
more less talk and more horsepower
you're<00:03:19.580> going<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.820> have<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.970> higher<00:03:20.270> top<00:03:20.600> end

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
you're going to have a higher top end

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.140 
you're going to have a higher top end
but<00:03:21.470> less<00:03:21.770> pulling<00:03:22.250> power<00:03:22.430> in<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.820> same<00:03:23.000> way

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
but less pulling power in the same way

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.449 
but less pulling power in the same way
as<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.270> truck<00:03:23.630> has<00:03:23.870> loads<00:03:24.080> of<00:03:24.230> talk<00:03:24.470> but<00:03:24.770> not<00:03:25.190> as

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
as a truck has loads of talk but not as

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.430 
as a truck has loads of talk but not as
much<00:03:25.550> horsepower<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.270> a<00:03:26.330> race<00:03:26.510> car<00:03:26.810> has<00:03:27.080> loads

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
much horsepower and a race car has loads

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.550 
much horsepower and a race car has loads
a<00:03:27.560> horsepower<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.220> not<00:03:28.760> much<00:03:28.940> talk<00:03:29.740> okay<00:03:31.270> so

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
a horsepower and not much talk okay so

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.699 
a horsepower and not much talk okay so
that<00:03:33.560> is<00:03:33.800> then<00:03:34.670> on<00:03:34.910> a<00:03:34.970> push<00:03:35.630> drive<00:03:35.959> to<00:03:36.350> your

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
that is then on a push drive to your

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.610 
that is then on a push drive to your
rear<00:03:36.980> wheel<00:03:37.220> hub<00:03:37.520> and<00:03:38.140> then<00:03:39.140> obviously<00:03:39.260> that

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
rear wheel hub and then obviously that

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.560 
rear wheel hub and then obviously that
goes<00:03:39.800> through<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.250> tires<00:03:40.490> and<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:40.940> friction

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
goes through the tires and the friction

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.050 
goes through the tires and the friction
on<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.810> ground<00:03:42.140> creates<00:03:43.040> your<00:03:43.430> forward

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
on the ground creates your forward

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.770 
on the ground creates your forward
momentum<00:03:45.040> okay<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.100> that<00:03:46.700> is<00:03:46.730> basically<00:03:47.000> how

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
momentum okay so that is basically how

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.780 
momentum okay so that is basically how
an<00:03:48.080> engine<00:03:48.230> works<00:03:48.440> if<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.340> want<00:03:49.489> me<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.670> go

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
an engine works if you want me to go

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.610 
an engine works if you want me to go
into<00:03:49.970> some<00:03:50.300> parts<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:50.840> in<00:03:50.989> more<00:03:51.170> detail<00:03:51.230> I

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
into some parts of that in more detail I

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.770 
into some parts of that in more detail I
will<00:03:51.980> do<00:03:52.190> leave<00:03:52.700> in<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.000> comments<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:53.630> I'll

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
will do leave in the comments and I'll

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.600 
will do leave in the comments and I'll
happily<00:03:54.020> go<00:03:54.350> through<00:03:54.560> absolutely<00:03:55.280> anything

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
happily go through absolutely anything
