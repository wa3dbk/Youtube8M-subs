00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.970 

and<00:03:51.890> I<00:03:52.159> hose<00:03:52.489> it<00:03:52.790> longer<00:03:53.180> so

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:19.199 

I<00:03:57.870> liked<00:03:58.870> 432<00:03:59.709> south

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:34.080 

just<00:04:20.079> sales<00:04:20.380> cleaner

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.450 

you<00:04:35.090> know<00:04:35.270> those<00:04:35.510> just<00:04:35.930> sounds<00:04:36.320> so<00:04:36.590> much<00:04:36.650> how

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
you know those just sounds so much how

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.629 
you know those just sounds so much how
about<00:04:37.730> it's<00:04:37.970> hard<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.330> explain

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.990 

so<00:04:45.330> it's<00:04:46.050> 432<00:04:46.770> Hertz<00:04:47.210> versus<00:04:49.490> 440<00:04:50.490> Hertz<00:04:50.669> with

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
so it's 432 Hertz versus 440 Hertz with

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.689 
so it's 432 Hertz versus 440 Hertz with

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
out of the other guitar better that's

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.510
