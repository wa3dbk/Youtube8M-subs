00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.170
 plush loops around 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.810

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.650
 by the latex dive or there then on 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.570
 this pocket 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:41.610
 here I put a sync cable 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:48.289
 for the phone and I have a little 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:52.440
 flashlight a keychain a lighter 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.449

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:03.420
 for the sync cable and my 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:10.890
 purse so then in the small 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:14.100
 pocket that is here I made myself 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.549
 a little box where I put too much key 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.830
 usb 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.610
 because I often need a 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.830
 adapter for micro sim to usb 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:30.329
 usb sync cable to have a 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:32.869

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:12.670
 practical it makes 50 liters of capacity 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:35.900
