on top looks better than the Thames

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:30.790 
on top looks better than the Thames
we'll<00:03:20.610> give<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.880> good<00:03:21.030> old<00:03:21.090> Rock<00:03:21.420> test

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.670 

lots<00:03:31.800> of<00:03:31.950> water<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:33.330> can<00:03:33.480> see<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.780> line<00:03:34.500> of

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
lots of water you can see that line of

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.830 
lots of water you can see that line of
runoff

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.630 

so<00:03:41.840> here<00:03:41.989> we're<00:03:42.140> at<00:03:42.200> Bear<00:03:42.379> Creek<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:43.370> can<00:03:43.489> see

rain and uh still a layer of ice in the
creek<00:03:54.260> back<00:03:54.500> there<00:03:54.769> maybe<00:03:55.610> about<00:03:55.819> a<00:03:56.110> 25<00:03:57.110> 30<00:03:57.860> 35

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
creek back there maybe about a 25 30 35

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.550 
creek back there maybe about a 25 30 35
foot<00:03:58.790> sheet<00:03:59.569> of<00:03:59.659> ice<00:03:59.810> from<00:04:00.049> here<00:04:00.349> and<00:04:00.440> then

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
foot sheet of ice from here and then

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.459
