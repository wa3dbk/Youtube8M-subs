00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.640
 a master class will be shown now 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.849
 make such here bumps with corrugated 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.840
 paper for work we need 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.940
 corrugated paper scissors and wire 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.910
 one segment of corrugated paper in 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.980
 us with a length of about 40 50 centimeters 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.800
 and about 5 5 6 wide 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:31.640
 the second segment is about 10 centimeters 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.230
 3 wide and narrow paper length 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.890
 starts working with the first segment 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.890
 paper make small locks balkans 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:50.300
 then another one in the same place like this 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:01:00.480
 one hand hold half 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.809
 bend and the second we bend as far as 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.790
 the bow turns out further we bend more 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.010
 once a month and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:16.020
 and half bend so bend 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.840
 and the half and the panel we need well 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.930
 fix will not tear the paper 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.930
 because otherwise if bad 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.909
 fix then it will fall apart so 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:34.250
 bending down and half bend down bending and 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.140
 bend it we will do to the end of the paper 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.619
 so the first segment is a mother 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.399
 we are ready in fear the seam was smooth 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:51.500
 now take the second piece of paper it 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.500
 we fold in half again in half 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:05.140
 can we take the scissors again and we need 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.130
 let the rubber cut it into small 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:16.060
 segments 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:20.830
 first the assembly we trim bear 2 book 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.970
 and then inside, some five miles 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.510
 or millimeters somewhere models make up 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.510
 the middle 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.140
 Now we need to deploy each 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.610
 cut 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:46.450
 collapse how we do it 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.959
 once the manufacture to the doctor and so 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:56.800
 take 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:03:02.860
 between your fingers and turn it like this 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.970
 do with all the pieces of paper the second 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.370
 Three digits for us year 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.090
 now working again with our first 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:14.920
 segment we argue for starting to twist in 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.459
 the tubule does not have to be pulled but given 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.459
 when starting 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.010
 around well our pattern because business 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:30.720
 must be outside when twisting 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.720
 we are coming down 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.480
 1st daughter and should be under another 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:36.760
 we clamp here we take 2 3 from paper and 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:36.760
 from the bottom, too, do not tighten we wrap 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:48.020
 if he is long help them like 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:54.220
 In this case, we will cut off the ends 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.220
 i now we take the wire 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:04.070
 small cut we tweak steel 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:10.690
 bend the wire and a brew somewhere 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:10.690
 twice around the bumps and lower down 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.330
 now we take a thin paper cut 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:26.810
 we did not leave this land by chance 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:31.280
 we will serve as anchoring in fine 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:35.180
 pieces of paper wrap wire 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.230
 a couple of times around the bumps close so 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.980
 way to wire 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:46.070
 and this section left walk we 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:48.670
 fix that the segment we have not 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.670
 fell off 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:05.210
 the rise will be wrapped a couple more times to 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.210
 close the whole crump 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:15.750
 now we go down 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:23.430
 wrap the degree of the end prokruchu 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:28.320
 a little bit of paper in it is kept so do 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:32.550
 on constant when it came to the end thin 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.120
 and tear off the remaining piece of wire 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.870
 bend 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:44.180
 this is fixed and the paper is not 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:44.180
 unwind the best touched
