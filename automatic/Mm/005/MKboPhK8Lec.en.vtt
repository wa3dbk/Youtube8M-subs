00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
better one of the things I do is I had

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.280 
better one of the things I do is I had
to<00:02:34.069> use<00:02:34.250> one<00:02:34.489> of<00:02:34.519> these<00:02:34.670> nice<00:02:35.599> welder<00:02:36.050> gloves

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
to use one of these nice welder gloves

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.559 
to use one of these nice welder gloves
that<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.590> got<00:02:36.800> with<00:02:37.040> my<00:02:37.670> dead<00:02:37.849> wood<00:02:38.060> stove<00:02:38.330> and

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
that I got with my dead wood stove and

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.080 
that I got with my dead wood stove and
then<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.230> can<00:02:39.410> just<00:02:39.560> pick<00:02:39.680> up<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.950> grill<00:02:40.129> and<00:02:40.400> do

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
then I can just pick up the grill and do

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.660 
then I can just pick up the grill and do
anything<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.510> want<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.780> do<00:02:41.900> at<00:02:42.050> any<00:02:42.200> time<00:02:42.670> you

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
anything I want to do at any time you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.309 
anything I want to do at any time you
might<00:02:43.849> also<00:02:44.030> notice<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.480> I'm<00:02:44.660> not<00:02:44.840> using<00:02:45.080> the

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
might also notice that I'm not using the

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.390 
might also notice that I'm not using the
legs<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.709> my<00:02:45.830> dead<00:02:46.010> wood<00:02:46.220> stove<00:02:46.519> today<00:02:46.849> I<00:02:48.400> built

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
legs on my dead wood stove today I built

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.430 
legs on my dead wood stove today I built
a<00:02:49.489> little<00:02:49.700> base<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.480> can<00:02:50.630> sit<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:51.019> and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
a little base that I can sit it on and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.050 
a little base that I can sit it on and
that's<00:02:51.680> real<00:02:51.890> handy<00:02:52.310> because<00:02:52.459> then<00:02:52.790> when<00:02:52.970> it

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
that's real handy because then when it

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.640 
that's real handy because then when it
does<00:02:53.209> cool<00:02:53.420> off<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:53.840> pick<00:02:54.140> up<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.380> stove

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
does cool off I just pick up the stove

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.820 
does cool off I just pick up the stove
and<00:02:54.860> dump<00:02:55.610> out<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.080> small<00:02:57.080> amount<00:02:57.319> of<00:02:57.410> ashes

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
and dump out the small amount of ashes

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.460 
and dump out the small amount of ashes
but<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:59.030> point<00:02:59.299> of<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.510> video<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.110> to

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.700 

once<00:03:49.740> you've<00:03:49.980> got<00:03:50.280> all<00:03:50.610> of<00:03:50.640> your<00:03:51.350> fuel<00:03:52.350> in

order it's a simple matter to light you

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.040 
order it's a simple matter to light you
just<00:03:56.460> use<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.700> little<00:03:56.820> starter<00:03:57.360> like<00:03:57.570> this<00:03:57.810> I

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
just use a little starter like this I

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.070 
just use a little starter like this I
actually<00:03:58.610> started<00:03:59.610> by<00:03:59.820> having<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.690> starter

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
actually started by having the starter

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.780 
actually started by having the starter
come<00:04:01.290> out<00:04:01.440> this<00:04:01.710> side<00:04:01.950> but<00:04:02.220> now<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.370> have<00:04:02.670> it

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
come out this side but now I have it

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.580 
come out this side but now I have it
come<00:04:02.910> out<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.180> other<00:04:03.330> L<00:04:03.540> air<00:04:03.930> hole<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.380> just

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
come out the other L air hole and I just

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.090 
come out the other L air hole and I just
light<00:04:04.800> it

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
light it

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.670 
light it
well<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.730> takes<00:04:05.910> off<00:04:06.120> every<00:04:06.450> time<00:04:06.660> without<00:04:07.650> a

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
well it takes off every time without a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.200 
well it takes off every time without a
problem<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.670> that's<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.900> guess<00:04:10.290> partly<00:04:11.280> the

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
problem and that's I guess partly the

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.120 
problem and that's I guess partly the
experience<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:13.050> I'm<00:04:13.170> getting<00:04:13.500> from<00:04:13.740> using

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
experience that I'm getting from using

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.890 
experience that I'm getting from using
my<00:04:14.400> dead<00:04:14.610> wood<00:04:14.790> stove<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.270> best<00:04:15.480> way<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.660> get

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
my dead wood stove the best way to get

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.650 
my dead wood stove the best way to get
good<00:04:16.140> at<00:04:16.200> cooking<00:04:16.680> on<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.160> is<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.459> use<00:04:17.640> it<00:04:17.820> and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
good at cooking on it is to use it and

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.930 
good at cooking on it is to use it and
I'll<00:04:18.989> tell<00:04:19.230> you<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.350> really<00:04:19.790> really<00:04:20.790> have
