00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.710
 ah 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.810
 well pleased the joy trying to make 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.080
 all 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.030
 we were where we are going to give a joy to 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.370
 the big fans swell thinking about 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.110
 these three games that we have left for 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.490
 try to classify the orders and then 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.490
 arrive as soon as possible 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.880
 player 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.349
 in this way help the player of colo 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.539
 with the spirit and optimism of 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.000
 help with home win as well 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.590
 with the extra ingredient of the debut in the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.110
 first equipment and repair of others 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.780
 in the pastures of the monumental stadium 10 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.730
 that maintains the illusion of entering play 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.589
 out in a match where we could 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.850
 to have taken advantage of much before in 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.190
 the first time we have many options 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.190
 of clear goal I think we continue level 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.970
 notoriously the first 45 minutes 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.159
 happy what I do not care about 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.539
 positive result to go 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.149
 walking what the playoffs are coming 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.100
 I think we needed to have a triumph 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.070
 and now it leaves us very well standing 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.500
 sheets fixed lady me in good shape 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.170
 32 manuel brabo therefore the 28th 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.149
 issuing the 30 but the debutantes in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.740
 the almost that while Bryan Rabello 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.539
 podium ownership 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.610
 Since the closure of 2011, no 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.229
 started in the starting line all 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.390
 happy with his performance on the court 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.789
 above all he revealed that he was the figure of 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.890
 encounter I think that in general everything 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.570
 they went quite well real net that 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.429
 involved a couple of play and resolved 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.780
 ok but I'm staying with the performance in 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.650
 general of the team which by attitude 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.090
 no one 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.800
 bone companions back from a 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.870
 shape and what we are now more united 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.450
 that never and it went to great shape and that we 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.640
 I liked it felt really good waiting 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.100
 the moment although it was reached I had to 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.320
 run run run and wet the shirt 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.670
 so that so the victory left 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.140
 so far a colo colo and the ninth 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.450
 position of the table 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.560
 are three units that leave as a summary 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.540
 to a picture that little by little 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.880
 finding his rhythm as he mentions 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.650
 Luis Perez and with tranquility too 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.440
 as Carlos MuÃ±oz says then write down 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.390
 today the victory goal 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.260
 soon the parties that come 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.220
 can find a much more game 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.020
 according to what color is what 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.520
 we look for is what I think that swells me in 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.810
 general what you seek what you want from 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.760
 place a total delivery 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.890
 we are calm that we are all left 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.170
 the ends more we know that all the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.660
 responsibility falls on our shoulder 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.490
 and it depends only on what we can 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.230
 do so we are very satisfied and 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.959
 happy with today's work 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.060
 colo colo showed a lot more soccer a lot 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.250
 more chance of goal 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.780
 and generally happy at the beginning 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.550
 He spoke that Pablo Contreras would leave from 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.200
 the start but a nuisance in his 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.690
 Aductor left him out of this meeting 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.550
 on the other hand manuel brabo who left 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.620
 injured will be in such observations 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.230
 as explained by Wilson Rada, who only 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.239
 campus power we tried was in the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.660
 practice the last soccer practice is 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.750
 had a fatigue the right author had 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.540
 a law of inflammation that we approved 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.849
 actually we had against also with 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.810
 the heating program and a slight 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.810
 annoyance especially at 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.300
 the brakes side displacements that 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.580
 where they actually work and do their 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.210
 maximum action in the adductor thus suffered 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.190
 a strong bruise and it generated a 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.660
 strong torsion of your ankle evaluate the 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.660
 Monday will be immobilized 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.560
 the truth
