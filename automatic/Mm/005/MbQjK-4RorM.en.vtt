been looking for um dupes or similar
things<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:43.230> frustrating<00:00:43.680> because<00:00:43.890> there's

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
things it's frustrating because there's

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.180 
things it's frustrating because there's
not<00:00:44.340> very<00:00:44.370> many<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:45.410> Matt<00:00:46.410> formulas<00:00:47.160> that

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
not very many like Matt formulas that

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310 
not very many like Matt formulas that
are<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.789> good<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> typically<00:00:49.020> don't<00:00:49.170> like

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
are this good so I typically don't like

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.590 
are this good so I typically don't like
to<00:00:49.440> buy<00:00:49.649> Matt<00:00:49.890> formulas<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.180> don't<00:00:51.420> really

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to buy Matt formulas so I don't really

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.910 
to buy Matt formulas so I don't really
think<00:00:51.719> most<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.110> these<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:52.530> we'll<00:00:52.739> get

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
think most of these are but we'll get

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.920 
think most of these are but we'll get
into<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.210> first<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.780> have

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
into that so the first one that I have

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.410 
into that so the first one that I have
is<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.320> buxom<00:00:55.800> exhibitionist<00:00:56.550> lipstick<00:00:56.969> no

it<00:01:59.369> doesn't<00:01:59.610> last<00:01:59.729> as<00:01:59.969> long<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.719> feels<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
it doesn't last as long but it feels a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.100 
it doesn't last as long but it feels a
little<00:02:01.110> bit<00:02:01.290> nicer<00:02:01.409> going<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:02.840> still<00:02:03.840> smells

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
little bit nicer going on still smells

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.350 
little bit nicer going on still smells
gross<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:05.490> buck<00:02:05.670> someone<00:02:06.000> doesn't<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.299> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
gross the buck someone doesn't have a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.090 
gross the buck someone doesn't have a
scent<00:02:06.649> yeah<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.770> doesn't<00:02:07.920> tell<00:02:08.129> send<00:02:08.369> at<00:02:08.520> all

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
scent yeah it doesn't tell send at all

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.670 
scent yeah it doesn't tell send at all
so<00:02:10.640> there's<00:02:10.910> that<00:02:11.210> one<00:02:12.250> next<00:02:13.250> is<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:13.670> Milani

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
so there's that one next is this Milani

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.800 
so there's that one next is this Milani
whatever<00:02:15.680> these<00:02:15.920> are<00:02:16.070> called<00:02:16.570> lipsticks<00:02:17.570> in

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
whatever these are called lipsticks in

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:29.830 
whatever these are called lipsticks in
rosehip<00:02:24.460> right<00:02:25.460> here<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.750> as<00:02:26.960> far<00:02:27.230> as<00:02:28.840> the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
rosehip right here so as far as the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.710 
rosehip right here so as far as the
formula<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:31.610> guess<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.180> kind<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.480> mix

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
formula it's I guess it's kind of a mix

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.630 
formula it's I guess it's kind of a mix
between<00:02:32.900> these<00:02:33.320> two<00:02:33.530> between<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.010> Rimmel<00:02:34.430> and

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
between these two between the Rimmel and

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.680 
between these two between the Rimmel and
the<00:02:35.170> buxom<00:02:36.170> it's<00:02:38.200> shiny<00:02:40.330> but<00:02:41.330> it's<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.540> lot

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
the buxom it's shiny but it's a lot

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.780 
the buxom it's shiny but it's a lot
smoother<00:02:42.170> going<00:02:42.410> on<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:42.710> it<00:02:42.800> feels<00:02:42.920> thick<00:02:43.310> it

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
smoother going on but it feels thick it

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.070 
smoother going on but it feels thick it
does<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.060> make<00:02:44.210> sense<00:02:44.240> because<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.810> Rimmel

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
does that make sense because the Rimmel

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.610 
does that make sense because the Rimmel
feels<00:02:45.320> thin<00:02:45.620> but<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:45.950> shiny<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.510> don't<00:02:47.510> know

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
feels thin but it's shiny I don't know

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.980 
feels thin but it's shiny I don't know
the<00:02:48.620> next<00:02:48.890> one<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.040> another<00:02:49.460> new<00:02:50.270> release<00:02:50.750> from

fuchsia<00:03:40.970> shock<00:03:44.050> this<00:03:45.050> is<00:03:45.290> very<00:03:45.710> similar<00:03:46.040> to

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
fuchsia shock this is very similar to

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.540 
fuchsia shock this is very similar to
the<00:03:47.360> L'Oreal<00:03:47.960> in<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.980> needs<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.310> be<00:03:49.370> built

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
the L'Oreal in that it needs to be built

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.590 
the L'Oreal in that it needs to be built
up<00:03:49.760> like<00:03:51.490> there's<00:03:52.490> one<00:03:52.730> pass<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.330> there's

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
up like there's one pass and there's

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.410 
up like there's one pass and there's
built<00:03:53.990> up<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:55.280> formula<00:03:55.640> though<00:03:55.970> I<00:03:56.180> don't<00:03:56.270> know

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
built up the formula though I don't know

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.540 
built up the formula though I don't know
if<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.570> can<00:03:56.720> tell<00:03:56.960> from<00:03:57.290> this<00:03:57.770> like<00:03:58.040> one<00:03:58.280> tiny

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
if you can tell from this like one tiny

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.720 
if you can tell from this like one tiny
swatch<00:03:59.350> it's<00:04:00.350> a<00:04:00.500> little<00:04:00.770> bit<00:04:00.890> patchy<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.550> I

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
swatch it's a little bit patchy and I

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.520 
swatch it's a little bit patchy and I
don't<00:04:02.030> there's<00:04:02.990> just<00:04:03.140> something<00:04:03.230> about

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
don't there's just something about

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.860 
don't there's just something about
putting<00:04:03.950> it<00:04:04.040> on<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:04.460> is<00:04:04.820> difficult<00:04:05.540> if

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
putting it on that is is difficult if

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.010 
putting it on that is is difficult if
that<00:04:06.170> makes<00:04:06.890> sense<00:04:07.270> but<00:04:08.270> the<00:04:08.390> colors<00:04:08.750> of<00:04:08.780> all

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
that makes sense but the colors of all

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:20.610 
that makes sense but the colors of all
these<00:04:09.170> are<00:04:09.380> very<00:04:09.500> very<00:04:09.650> similar

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.870
