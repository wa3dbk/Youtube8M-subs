00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
you guys how to make them so your first

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.420 
you guys how to make them so your first
layer<00:00:38.850> should<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.809> man<00:00:40.020> fist<00:00:40.320> now<00:00:40.860> what

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
layer should be the man fist now what

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.590 
layer should be the man fist now what
you<00:00:41.460> want<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.879> everything<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.420> you're

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
you want to do is everything that you're

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.000 
you want to do is everything that you're
going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.870> putting<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.440> make<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.770> black

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
going to be putting just make it black

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.920 
going to be putting just make it black
so<00:00:44.579> we'll<00:00:44.730> flip<00:00:44.940> them<00:00:45.149> rotate<00:00:45.600> them<00:00:45.750> whatever

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
so we'll flip them rotate them whatever

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.290 
so we'll flip them rotate them whatever
and<00:00:46.320> play<00:00:47.129> some<00:00:47.190> kind<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> bottom<00:00:48.090> corner

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and play some kind in the bottom corner

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.910 
and play some kind in the bottom corner
it's<00:00:48.960> probably<00:00:49.050> better<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> show<00:00:49.800> his

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it's probably better not to show his

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.889 
it's probably better not to show his
feet<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.610> gotta<00:00:50.850> kind<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.270> put<00:00:51.420> them<00:00:51.510> far

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
feet so just gotta kind of put them far

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.510 
feet so just gotta kind of put them far
in<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> corner<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.440> guess<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
in the corner I guess and then the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700 
in the corner I guess and then the
second<00:00:53.879> layer<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.390> want<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> put<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.289> Oval

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
second layer you want to put is the Oval

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.490 
second layer you want to put is the Oval
thin<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.239> you're<00:00:57.239> gonna<00:00:57.360> place<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.809> off<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
thin and you're gonna place this off to

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.439 
thin and you're gonna place this off to
the<00:00:58.530> side<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.879> is<00:00:59.969> kind<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.270> gives

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the side and this is kind of what gives

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.889 
the side and this is kind of what gives
them<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.750> circular<00:01:01.320> kinda<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:03.030> guess<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.359> circular

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
them a circular kinda I guess a circular

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
them a circular kinda I guess a circular
shape<00:01:04.229> or<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.530> curve<00:01:05.070> whatever<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.519> want<00:01:05.640> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
shape or a curve whatever you want to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.179 
shape or a curve whatever you want to
call<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.409> again<00:01:07.409> make<00:01:07.590> everything<00:01:07.830> black

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
call it and again make everything black

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.010 
call it and again make everything black
once<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> next

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
once you can do that go to the next

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.420 
once you can do that go to the next
layer<00:01:10.260> you're<00:01:10.680> gonna<00:01:10.770> find<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> pointing

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
layer you're gonna find the pointing

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.030 
layer you're gonna find the pointing
shield<00:01:11.670> again<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.900> angle<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.229> correctly<00:01:13.619> so

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
shield again just angle it correctly so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.580 
shield again just angle it correctly so
now<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.729> core<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.330> Batman<00:01:16.290> shape

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
now this is the core of Batman shape

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.260 
now this is the core of Batman shape
right<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.580> looks<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.759> his<00:01:18.000> cape

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
right here so it looks like his cape

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.850 
right here so it looks like his cape
he's<00:01:18.509> kind<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:18.900> often<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.409> corner

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
he's kind of just often to the corner

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.679 
he's kind of just often to the corner
maybe<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> winds<00:01:20.759> blowing<00:01:20.970> his<00:01:21.150> cave<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.479> don't

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
maybe the winds blowing his cave I don't

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.050 
maybe the winds blowing his cave I don't
know<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.920> last<00:01:23.100> piece<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.790> want<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
know and the last piece that you want to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.480 
know and the last piece that you want to
put<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.780> bat<00:01:24.960> ears<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.009> guess<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
put is the bat ears this is I guess the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.219 
put is the bat ears this is I guess the
cherry<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.119> top<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:29.450> resize<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.720> again

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
cherry on top so just resize it again

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.590 
cherry on top so just resize it again
make<00:01:31.439> everything<00:01:31.680> black<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.390> got<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
make everything black and all you got to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.480 
make everything black and all you got to
do<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:33.810> kind<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.259> angle<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.770> correctly

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
do is just kind of angle it correctly

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.499 
do is just kind of angle it correctly
because<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.790> can't<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.060> put<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.329> straight

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
because you can't just put it straight

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.210 
because you can't just put it straight
otherwise<00:01:36.960> it'll<00:01:37.140> look<00:01:37.259> weird<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.100> have

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
otherwise it'll look weird so you have

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.740 
otherwise it'll look weird so you have
to<00:01:38.340> angle<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.729> some<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.659> right

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
to angle this some a little to the right

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.929
