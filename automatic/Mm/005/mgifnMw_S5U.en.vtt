another part of the world and just learn

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.740 
another part of the world and just learn
what<00:01:59.799> women<00:02:00.069> are<00:02:00.189> doing<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:01.240> was<00:02:01.390> in<00:02:01.569> this

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
what women are doing and it was in this

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.910 
what women are doing and it was in this
time<00:02:01.810> period<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.799> I<00:02:03.099> met<00:02:03.880> Roxana<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.590> she<00:02:05.649> was

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
time period that I met Roxana so she was

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.150 
time period that I met Roxana so she was
straight<00:02:06.250> but<00:02:06.459> she<00:02:07.240> didn't<00:02:07.450> stay<00:02:07.599> that<00:02:07.630> way<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
straight but she didn't stay that way it

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.580 
straight but she didn't stay that way it
seems<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.700> only<00:02:12.819> way<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.150> balance<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.959> gender

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
seems the only way to balance the gender

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.620 
seems the only way to balance the gender
of<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:15.010> audience<00:02:15.459> is<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.120> take<00:02:16.329> this

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.170 
of the audience is to take this
testimony<00:02:17.290> upstairs<00:02:18.220> where<00:02:18.579> the<00:02:18.610> gender<00:02:19.030> is

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
imbalanced the other way

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.210 
imbalanced the other way
