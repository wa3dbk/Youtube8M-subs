00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.450
 the rooftop friend hence his name is not to form a group 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.140
 this way and everyone a little quick that showed how it works cherres 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.029
 in the editor 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.069
 to repair the bad sectors on the hard drive that generate 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:16.069
 the famous as a taboo 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.989
 Windows Xp 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.989
 restart a virtual machine that your windows xp 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.650
 I do not have captured 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.819
 my unit 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:29.819
 should be finalizing is fleeing towards the voters 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.700
 is starting this week 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.670
 what he is going to do is 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.460
 or should the hard disk of 10 be detected and so then what 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.960
 we are going to do is we are going to select 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.960
 with the one with the number and said we want 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.500
 if we want as sectarian yes and here we have is basically two options one 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.160
 to read the mishap that only shows the effect area only sectors of 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.550
 Then the only thing you are going to do is show where the center is 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.380
 defective in this case is a virtual hard disk has not shown anything 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.280
 A) Yes 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.400
 but the fact is that we found something 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.620
 what may or may not be what yes or no depending 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.640
 that if the sector really has sectors of the well 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.100
 we can contribute escape yes 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.170
 I mossad 6 mod in the four 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.520
 in we change 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.720
 let's read sector 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.130
 and here we go back to the version 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.840
 let's look at the missive screen then with your selected normal can 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.320
 wintour and freed him 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.060
 your selection on 2 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.380
 and we are going to give you with your selection when you are 1 channel back 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.499
 17s will be the second in that step 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:46.590
 don alberto yes and that only 100 showed was presented alone 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.580
 and that if I do not think it regenerates all sectors 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.210
 in ranges and entering slowly even if they are not damaged 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.680
 these two expensive hoodlums are added 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.260
 we have a problem 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.560
 1 boy when entering 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.420
 and that is what will be that measure that in four high sectors or love repairing 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.470
 yes 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.849
 seven tax colleges that is wrong 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.379
 he was really Jewish he is not going to repair anything like that or appear as 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.379
 nadery nadery yesterday 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.010
 signus but that he's responding well corruption and what 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:25.939
 ps appear many of its sectors in positive but can not repair a 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.789
 Conclusion seems a lot 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.409
 efron can stop him 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.750
 3 such a guideline or is it just how to take as a measure to know if you 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:34.819
 corrected 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.239
 it's closing its end and it's time to change it so good 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:42.599
 but he thinks he has returned to it very quickly because God comes out and did not correct the 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.969
 which one 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.259
 is a killer that is inside my computer then go fast 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:51.419
 We ship depending on the size indicated may take more or less yes 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.939
 but to give you an idea 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.909
 I feel blessed because of that I can not now for this new year 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.559
 and if in some repair 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.700
 a massive I hope you like credit 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.419
 we must demonstrate 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:10.879
 so any questions can stop me from reading the comments
