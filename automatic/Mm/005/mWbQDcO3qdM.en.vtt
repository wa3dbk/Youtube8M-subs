this tutorial is going to focus on
animate<00:00:14.219> textures<00:00:14.730> because<00:00:14.969> that's<00:00:15.179> been<00:00:15.360> one

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
animate textures because that's been one

in a blender tab an edit mode on the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.220 
in a blender tab an edit mode on the
default<00:00:36.750> cube<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:38.270> you<00:00:39.270> want<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> unwrap<00:00:42.230> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
default cube and you want to unwrap and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.600 
default cube and you want to unwrap and
open<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.040> uv/image<00:00:44.550> editor<00:00:45.590> hey<00:00:46.610> here's

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.510 
open up the uv/image editor hey here's
the<00:00:47.789> unwrap<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.050> we've<00:00:49.410> got<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> basic<00:00:50.039> cube

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the unwrap so we've got the basic cube

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.260 
the unwrap so we've got the basic cube
set<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.239> applying<00:00:52.230> movies<00:00:53.030> okay<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.090> we

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
set up for applying movies okay so we

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.709 
set up for applying movies okay so we
want<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.449> document<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:56.329> 512<00:00:57.329> by<00:00:57.480> 512

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
want a document this one is 512 by 512

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.810 
want a document this one is 512 by 512
it's<00:00:58.559> good<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.890> work<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.160> pairs<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.670> two's<00:00:59.910> like

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
it's good to work in pairs of two's like

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.030 
it's good to work in pairs of two's like
128<00:01:02.820> 256<00:01:03.890> 512<00:01:05.240> 1024<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.740> find<00:01:07.920> them

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
128 256 512 1024 and you can find them

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
128 256 512 1024 and you can find them
online<00:01:08.159> somewhere<00:01:08.520> that's<00:01:09.450> way<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.840> just

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
online somewhere that's way it's just

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.200 
online somewhere that's way it's just
easier<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> mass<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:11.100> tile<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.000> stuff

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
easier to the mass for tile and stuff

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.210 
easier to the mass for tile and stuff
there<00:01:12.420> okay<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.500> create<00:01:13.740> your<00:01:13.799> document

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
there okay so you create your document

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.820 
there okay so you create your document
and<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:15.270> draw<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:16.320> frame<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and then you draw one frame of the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.760 
and then you draw one frame of the
animation<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:18.020> trace<00:01:19.020> over<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> top<00:01:19.530> on

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
animation and then trace over the top on

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.740 
animation and then trace over the top on
a<00:01:19.950> new<00:01:20.100> layer<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.580> draw<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.880> next<00:01:21.090> frame<00:01:21.659> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
a new layer and draw the next frame of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.039 
a new layer and draw the next frame of
the<00:01:21.810> animation<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:23.040> then<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.670> should<00:01:24.049> wobble

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the animation and then it should wobble

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.170 
the animation and then it should wobble
as<00:01:25.200> animates<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.430> drew<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.700> by<00:01:26.970> hand

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
as animates because I drew this by hand

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.870 
as animates because I drew this by hand
yeah<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.320> save<00:01:28.530> those<00:01:28.710> out<00:01:28.950> individually

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
yeah so you save those out individually

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.929 
yeah so you save those out individually
like<00:01:30.150> save<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.799> frame<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.520> save<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
like save this frame and then save this

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.770 
like save this frame and then save this
frame<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:33.390> PNG<00:01:34.320> s<00:01:34.560> then<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:36.329> create<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.659> new

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
frame as PNG s then you create a new

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.530 
frame as PNG s then you create a new
document<00:01:37.009> with<00:01:38.009> double<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> width<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
document with double the width of the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.950 
document with double the width of the
original<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:41.490> same<00:01:41.820> height<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.360> apply

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
original and then same height and apply

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.060 
original and then same height and apply
and<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.009> want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> go<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:45.710> slice<00:01:46.710> tool

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and then you want to go to slice tool

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.700 
and then you want to go to slice tool
which<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.610> under<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> crop<00:01:48.119> tool<00:01:48.390> icon<00:01:49.200> just

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
which is under the crop tool icon just

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.999 
which is under the crop tool icon just
drag<00:01:50.009> over<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.369> whole<00:01:50.490> document<00:01:50.909> right<00:01:51.479> click

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
drag over the whole document right click

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.190 
drag over the whole document right click
divide<00:01:53.009> slice<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.750> then<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.049> right<00:01:55.170> click

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
divide slice and then you right click

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.289 
divide slice and then you right click
this<00:01:55.950> bottom<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.880> then<00:01:57.329> press<00:01:57.960> 2<00:01:59.299> that

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
this bottom one and then press 2 that

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.230 
this bottom one and then press 2 that
will<00:02:00.360> give<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.630> 2<00:02:00.960> nights

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
will give you 2 nights

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.990 
will give you 2 nights
slices<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.860> grab<00:02:05.100> wherever<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.790> save

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
slices you can grab wherever you save

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.250 
slices you can grab wherever you save
these<00:02:06.240> two<00:02:06.540> images<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:08.840> drag<00:02:09.840> them<00:02:09.990> both<00:02:10.110> for

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
these two images and drag them both for

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.850 
these two images and drag them both for
the<00:02:10.410> same<00:02:10.590> time<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.590> hopefully<00:02:13.590> you'll

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the same time and then hopefully you'll

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.180 
the same time and then hopefully you'll
have<00:02:13.950> snap<00:02:14.340> turned<00:02:14.940> on<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.990> then<00:02:16.710> this<00:02:16.950> should

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
have snap turned on and then this should

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.720 
have snap turned on and then this should
just<00:02:17.400> snap<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.150> place<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.860> then<00:02:20.250> since<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.520> drag

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730

just snap in place and then since I drag
the<00:02:20.850> both<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.030> them<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.360> instantly<00:02:22.050> brings<00:02:22.260> in

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
the both of them and instantly brings in

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.170 
the both of them and instantly brings in
the<00:02:22.530> next<00:02:22.740> one<00:02:24.740> hey<00:02:25.740> there<00:02:26.610> we<00:02:26.700> go<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.120> you

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
I do is load an image open let me go

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.480 
I do is load an image open let me go
desktop<00:02:42.960> then<00:02:43.560> we'll<00:02:43.680> go<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.770> desktop<00:02:44.220> cuz<00:02:44.400> I've

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
desktop then we'll go a desktop cuz I've

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.300 
desktop then we'll go a desktop cuz I've
saved<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.060> face<00:02:45.690> einem<00:02:46.080> there<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:47.010> go<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.160> know

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
saved it face einem there we go you know

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.640 
saved it face einem there we go you know
it's<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.630> UVs<00:02:49.020> look<00:02:49.230> kind<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.500> weird

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
it's the the UVs look kind of weird

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.860 
it's the the UVs look kind of weird
they're<00:02:50.610> stretched<00:02:51.090> lately

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
they're stretched lately

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.690 
they're stretched lately
I<00:02:51.900> will<00:02:52.350> just<00:02:52.590> create<00:02:52.770> material<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.460> we<00:02:53.580> can

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
I will just create material so we can

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.490 
I will just create material so we can
see<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.880> bear<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.900> change<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.800> GLSL<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.260> create

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
see a bear and change the GLSL so create

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.860 
see a bear and change the GLSL so create
material<00:02:58.980> change<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.460> shitless<00:02:59.850> you<00:03:00.720> don't

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
material change it to shitless you don't

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.960 
material change it to shitless you don't
need<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.110> change<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.500> shadeless<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.010> just<00:03:02.220> as

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
need to change it to shadeless I just as

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.000 
need to change it to shadeless I just as
good<00:03:03.240> for<00:03:03.300> demonstrate<00:03:03.900> then<00:03:04.620> go<00:03:04.800> over<00:03:04.920> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
good for demonstrate then go over the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.670 
good for demonstrate then go over the
texture<00:03:05.760> tab<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.709> open<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:09.440> scroll<00:03:10.440> down

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
texture tab and open that scroll down

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.350 
texture tab and open that scroll down
change<00:03:11.400> coordinates<00:03:12.270> from<00:03:12.480> generate<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.200> UV

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
change coordinates from generate to UV

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.580 
change coordinates from generate to UV
so<00:03:15.360> then<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.720> will<00:03:15.840> give<00:03:15.989> us<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.260> UV

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
so then that will give us the UV

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.740 
so then that will give us the UV
coordinates<00:03:17.270> and<00:03:18.270> then<00:03:18.660> we<00:03:19.290> should<00:03:19.470> do<00:03:19.620> this

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.020

we've<00:03:49.300> got<00:03:49.480> two<00:03:49.720> in<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.200> x-direction<00:03:51.070> yeah<00:03:52.770> so

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
we've got two in the x-direction yeah so

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.620 
we've got two in the x-direction yeah so
it<00:03:54.010> does<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.580> duplicates<00:03:55.300> that's<00:03:55.510> one<00:03:55.600> over

it does it duplicates that's one over
here<00:03:56.020> and<00:03:56.140> then<00:03:56.200> we<00:03:56.770> go<00:03:56.950> we<00:03:57.250> want<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.520> animate

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
here and then we go we want to animate

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.810 
here and then we go we want to animate
it<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.410> we<00:03:59.410> want<00:03:59.620> it<00:03:59.830> to<00:04:00.190> start<00:04:00.430> at<00:04:00.550> frame<00:04:00.760> 0

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
it and we want it to start at frame 0

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.300

and<00:04:01.150> end<00:04:01.630> at<00:04:01.780> frame<00:04:01.990> 1<00:04:02.200> if<00:04:02.800> you've<00:04:02.950> got<00:04:03.130> more

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
and end at frame 1 if you've got more

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.980 
and end at frame 1 if you've got more
you<00:04:03.940> add<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.740> more<00:04:05.740> here<00:04:06.070> in<00:04:06.130> here<00:04:06.370> then<00:04:07.090> we<00:04:07.750> test

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
you add a more here in here then we test

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.330 
you add a more here in here then we test
it<00:04:10.380> you<00:04:11.380> realize<00:04:11.590> we<00:04:11.709> didn't<00:04:11.920> give<00:04:12.010> it<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.160> speed

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
it you realize we didn't give it a speed

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.280 
it you realize we didn't give it a speed
so<00:04:13.120> we'll<00:04:13.270> give<00:04:13.360> us<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.510> suite<00:04:13.660> of<00:04:13.780> somewhere

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
so we'll give us a suite of somewhere

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.530 
so we'll give us a suite of somewhere
like<00:04:14.470> 12<00:04:14.770> and<00:04:16.410> then<00:04:17.410> it<00:04:17.530> wobbles<00:04:18.540> sometimes

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
like 12 and then it wobbles sometimes

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.590 
like 12 and then it wobbles sometimes
it'll<00:04:20.320> do<00:04:20.590> some<00:04:20.829> weird<00:04:21.040> stuff<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.579> that<00:04:22.450> we

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
it'll do some weird stuff and that we

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.310 
it'll do some weird stuff and that we
have<00:04:22.750> phone<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.169> fix<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.680> is<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:24.900> go<00:04:25.900> into<00:04:26.050> edit

you've changed these values and it
should<00:04:35.650> fix<00:04:35.890> it<00:04:36.810> so<00:04:37.810> madam<00:04:38.169> it<00:04:38.290> in<00:04:38.350> on<00:04:38.440> all

should fix it so madam it in on all

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.000 
should fix it so madam it in on all
sides<00:04:38.860> so<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:40.300> was<00:04:40.960> on<00:04:41.080> that<00:04:41.260> I'm<00:04:41.500> going<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:41.860> show

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
straight face boy you might recognize

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.300 
straight face boy you might recognize
them<00:04:47.169> if<00:04:47.260> you've<00:04:47.440> been<00:04:47.560> following<00:04:47.710> my<00:04:47.950> blog<00:04:47.979> at

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
them if you've been following my blog at

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.100 
them if you've been following my blog at
all<00:04:48.460> I'll<00:04:49.180> show<00:04:49.240> you<00:04:49.419> how<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:49.660> works

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
all I'll show you how that works

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.100 
all I'll show you how that works
so<00:04:50.919> we've<00:04:51.070> got<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.370> UVs<00:04:51.669> up<00:04:51.880> here<00:04:52.240> you<00:04:52.900> save

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
so we've got the UVs up here you save

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.430 
so we've got the UVs up here you save
this<00:04:53.290> out<00:04:53.470> by<00:04:53.800> pressing<00:04:54.160> export<00:04:55.260> UV<00:04:56.260> layout

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
this out by pressing export UV layout

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.219 
this out by pressing export UV layout
and<00:04:56.710> that<00:04:57.250> gives<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.580> PNG<00:04:57.910> image<00:04:58.090> which<00:04:59.080> you

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
and that gives you a PNG image which you

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.740 
and that gives you a PNG image which you
can<00:04:59.380> then<00:04:59.500> print<00:04:59.740> out<00:04:59.950> then<00:05:00.700> use<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.330> light<00:05:01.570> box

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
can then print out then use a light box

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.620 
can then print out then use a light box
or<00:05:02.140> a<00:05:02.169> window<00:05:02.740> or<00:05:02.770> something<00:05:03.100> to<00:05:03.669> trace

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
or a window or something to trace

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.810 
or a window or something to trace
through<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.260> just<00:05:05.770> draw<00:05:06.040> over<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.280> top<00:05:06.550> I

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
through and just draw over the top I

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.330 
through and just draw over the top I
just<00:05:07.600> stayed<00:05:07.990> within<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.290> lines<00:05:08.530> if<00:05:08.770> you<00:05:09.220> know

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
just stayed within the lines if you know

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.490 
just stayed within the lines if you know
how<00:05:09.669> to<00:05:09.729> do<00:05:10.000> UVs<00:05:10.419> that<00:05:10.720> kind<00:05:11.260> of<00:05:11.320> makes<00:05:11.440> sense

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
how to do UVs that kind of makes sense

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.260 
how to do UVs that kind of makes sense
used<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:11.950> do<00:05:12.040> it<00:05:12.100> by<00:05:12.220> hand<00:05:12.400> instead<00:05:12.970> of<00:05:13.030> on<00:05:13.180> the

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
used to do it by hand instead of on the

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.930 
used to do it by hand instead of on the
computer<00:05:13.630> you<00:05:14.590> have<00:05:14.710> to<00:05:14.830> clean<00:05:15.010> up<00:05:15.040> afterwards

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
computer you have to clean up afterwards

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.530 
computer you have to clean up afterwards
but<00:05:16.270> it's<00:05:16.600> relatively<00:05:17.410> easy<00:05:18.030> so<00:05:19.030> show<00:05:19.330> one

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
but it's relatively easy so show one

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.020 
but it's relatively easy so show one
I've<00:05:19.720> already<00:05:19.900> did<00:05:20.680> just<00:05:21.550> to<00:05:21.640> show<00:05:21.790> that<00:05:21.820> it

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
I've already did just to show that it

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.330 
I've already did just to show that it
works<00:05:23.130> image<00:05:24.130> open<00:05:25.140> you<00:05:26.140> want<00:05:26.320> crayon<00:05:26.770> and<00:05:27.130> a

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
works image open you want crayon and a

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.640 
works image open you want crayon and a
map<00:05:27.640> so<00:05:28.330> we<00:05:28.540> set<00:05:28.780> up<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:29.110> real-time

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
map so we set up the real-time

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.990 
map so we set up the real-time
properties

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
tails 2 &amp; 1 speed of 12 and we create

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.900 
tails 2 &amp; 1 speed of 12 and we create
the<00:05:40.510> material<00:05:41.200> to<00:05:41.320> go<00:05:41.410> with<00:05:41.560> it

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
the material to go with it

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.970 
the material to go with it
you<00:05:42.910> shared<00:05:43.330> less<00:05:46.260> you<00:05:47.260> can<00:05:47.380> call<00:05:47.620> these<00:05:47.800> what

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
you shared less you can call these what

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
you want just for the speed of this

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.010 
you want just for the speed of this

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
since I've opened I already know it

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:02.040 
since I've opened I already know it
should<00:05:54.910> be<00:05:54.940> here<00:05:57.600> we<00:05:58.600> got<00:05:59.100> hey<00:06:00.840> there's<00:06:01.840> press

should be here we got hey there's press

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.840 
should be here we got hey there's press
reload<00:06:02.410> just<00:06:02.590> to<00:06:02.680> be<00:06:02.740> safe<00:06:02.920> and<00:06:04.230> I<00:06:06.150> forgot<00:06:07.150> to

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
reload just to be safe and I forgot to

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:15.000 
reload just to be safe and I forgot to
change<00:06:09.850> it<00:06:10.030> from<00:06:10.120> generated<00:06:10.630> to<00:06:10.750> UV<00:06:11.080> and<00:06:14.010> here

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
change it from generated to UV and here

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.260 
change it from generated to UV and here
we<00:06:15.070> go<00:06:15.250> you<00:06:15.370> can<00:06:15.520> see<00:06:15.670> it's<00:06:15.760> an<00:06:15.880> amine

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
we go you can see it's an amine

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.060 
we go you can see it's an amine
it's<00:06:17.020> just<00:06:17.200> flicker<00:06:17.410> in<00:06:17.560> between<00:06:17.830> the<00:06:17.920> two

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
it's just flicker in between the two

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.040 
it's just flicker in between the two
yeah<00:06:19.000> as<00:06:19.270> simple<00:06:19.570> as<00:06:19.660> that

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
yeah as simple as that

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.870 
yeah as simple as that
I'll<00:06:20.950> just<00:06:21.130> show<00:06:21.310> that<00:06:21.340> one<00:06:21.670> more<00:06:21.850> time<00:06:21.880> I<00:06:22.360> open

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
I'll just show that one more time I open

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.970 
I'll just show that one more time I open
for<00:06:24.880> the<00:06:25.000> outline<00:06:25.330> this<00:06:25.570> one<00:06:25.750> so<00:06:26.470> for<00:06:26.620> this<00:06:26.740> I

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980 
for the outline this one so for this I

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.880 
for the outline this one so for this I
just<00:06:27.040> darkened<00:06:28.030> the<00:06:28.180> colors<00:06:28.480> of<00:06:28.720> the<00:06:29.320> original

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
just darkened the colors of the original

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.790 
just darkened the colors of the original
one<00:06:30.040> like<00:06:30.280> I<00:06:30.310> made<00:06:30.730> them<00:06:30.910> a<00:06:31.230> lot<00:06:32.230> harsher<00:06:32.470> and

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
one like I made them a lot harsher and

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.070 
one like I made them a lot harsher and
then<00:06:33.550> that<00:06:33.760> kind<00:06:33.940> of<00:06:34.120> works<00:06:34.419> as<00:06:34.630> the<00:06:34.690> outline

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
then that kind of works as the outline

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:48.629 
then that kind of works as the outline
and

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.589 

you<00:06:49.389> be<00:06:49.569> there<00:06:49.750> we<00:06:49.870> go<00:06:50.819> hey<00:06:51.819> so<00:06:51.879> this<00:06:52.360> one<00:06:52.569> you

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 
you be there we go hey so this one you

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:55.010 
you be there we go hey so this one you
changed<00:06:53.050> as<00:06:53.199> well

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
changed as well
