00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
question is how effective is that system

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.130

of<00:01:14.640> getting<00:01:14.939> guys<00:01:15.090> into<00:01:15.360> space<00:01:15.630> which<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.900> what

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
of getting guys into space which is what

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.620 
of getting guys into space which is what
all<00:01:16.170> systems<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.400> how<00:01:18.150> good<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
all systems do and how good is the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.899 
all systems do and how good is the
quarterback<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.350> accessing<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.369> space<00:01:20.729> and

they structure the pattern now the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.639 
they structure the pattern now the
reason<00:02:06.240> they<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.930> many<00:02:06.990> yards<00:02:07.530> is

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
reason they have so many yards is

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.380 
reason they have so many yards is
because<00:02:08.220> they're<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:08.849> good<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
because they're really really good and

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.119 
because they're really really good and
they<00:02:09.840> don't<00:02:09.959> play<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> whole<00:02:10.410> lot<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.679> top-notch

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
they don't play a whole lot of top-notch

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.699 
they don't play a whole lot of top-notch
defenses<00:02:11.819> it's<00:02:12.150> not<00:02:12.420> because<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.290> system

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
defenses it's not because of the system

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.710 
defenses it's not because of the system
against<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> defense<00:02:14.819> like<00:02:14.970> LSU<00:02:15.330> or<00:02:15.660> Alabama

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
against the defense like LSU or Alabama

the<00:02:19.290> Conference<00:02:19.620> USA<00:02:19.680> defense<00:02:20.489> might<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:20.849> a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
the Conference USA defense might be a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.900 
the Conference USA defense might be a
10-yard<00:02:21.810> gate<00:02:22.020> but<00:02:22.410> those<00:02:22.560> spaces<00:02:22.980> exist

against<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.569> top<00:02:24.750> defenses<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.590> question<00:02:25.980> is

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
against the top defenses the question is

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.040 
against the top defenses the question is
are<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.250> good<00:02:26.580> enough<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.970> access<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.780> I

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
are you good enough to access it and I

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.229 
are you good enough to access it and I
believe<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.319> Keenum<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:28.950> his<00:02:29.370> core<00:02:30.060> of

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
believe that Keenum and his core of

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.470 
believe that Keenum and his core of
skill<00:02:31.230> players<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.769> good<00:02:32.190> enough<00:02:32.430> well<00:02:32.940> if<00:02:33.300> you

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
skill players is good enough well if you

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.300 
skill players is good enough well if you
just<00:02:33.690> look<00:02:33.870> at<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.050> numbers<00:02:34.440> he<00:02:35.040> should<00:02:35.220> win

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
just look at the numbers he should win

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.250 
just look at the numbers he should win
the<00:02:35.459> Heisman<00:02:35.790> Trophy<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.690> these<00:02:36.840> numbers<00:02:37.170> are

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
the Heisman Trophy and these numbers are

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.479 
the Heisman Trophy and these numbers are
better<00:02:37.379> than<00:02:37.560> everyone<00:02:37.680> else's<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.370> they're

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
better than everyone else's and they're

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.100 
better than everyone else's and they're
undefeated<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.180> here's<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.510> argument

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
undefeated but here's the argument

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.199 
undefeated but here's the argument
against<00:02:40.920> keenum<00:02:41.250> for<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.489> Heisman<00:02:41.640> Trophy

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
against keenum for the Heisman Trophy

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.150 
against keenum for the Heisman Trophy

the kingdom's really good I guess what
it<00:03:18.750> changes<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.560> do<00:03:20.370> we<00:03:20.519> really<00:03:20.550> know<00:03:21.090> how<00:03:21.360> good

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
it changes is do we really know how good
