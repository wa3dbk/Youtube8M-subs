00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 and I was a boy speaking here in the 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960
 time b to resolve a question that does not 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.440
 Do not understand, do not worry. 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.440
 video 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.370
 It was not that doubt that I'm here to 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.080
 solve 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.060
 had me quiet most of the people 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.240
 already had to receive any for the study 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:35.020
 video and this doubt is called worth it 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.700
 or not play tibia so I decided to see 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.550
 the old shah here to solve this 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.150
 doubt that you, let's go, let's go 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.090
 to analyze problems of the kakÃ¡ team has 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.530
 much butts power abuse will be hot the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.399
 which was major that we had night of 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.760
 Saturday 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:58.000
 that always had on the tibia why the hell 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.760
 it's not worth playing now it's beauty of 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.399
 beja was consecrated so our lady 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.040
 and if you judge too much, we also have to 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.240
 open people who did not like it and this 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.420
 problem I think is not something that 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.490
 should interfere in the game not 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.280
 but three bronze parts in the game 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.800
 pvp still have players who think 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.630
 more worth playing now because 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.200
 main in fact main problem 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.060
 which is old is a weight system of the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.530
 I think most of the people who 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.659
 they currently play knows that there are many 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.979
 games has a daughter for the team but still 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.979
 so wait till you play for that 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.710
 pv impetus phs made of you pick up 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.350
 kill the animals book and legs thing 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.290
 so odd that it looks roberto 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.650
 many games have neither time nor give 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.670
 too much ball for pvp kuyt why not 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:53.320
 because mister pizza for example 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.580
 You're level 31 Carlos takes eight Lapp 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.100
 kill him 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.530
 he may not miss anything useful 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.280
 practice one always has that role was 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.680
 abusive 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.009
 The problem with this is that if you're light 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.290
 eight and you die you will lose one 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.440
 face missile is a chemistry I always 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.829
 I fight a lot for the night, I lose a lot. 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.019
 A long time ago that bastard looks I know 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.269
 not nickel 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.560
 and hence all the suffering you had 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.170
 it was in vain 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.400
 And because it's not worth you either. 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.040
 is on tvp servers 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.450
 according to the prefect the zada sometimes you 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.280
 is there and will want to kill a couple of yours 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.760
 own level there do what? 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.760
 it's cool llanelli same level 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.740
 No, you did not kill, man. 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.940
 earns nothing for it formally requested the 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.670
 most times the guy will not lose 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.130
 a lot of it is from bbb maybe some 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.520
 some goal that backpack and but little 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.959
 thing is complicated and expensive I do not think 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.860
 he is losing the grace of pv by 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.420
 time but I know it's worth much more 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.370
 play on pp 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.340
 now I have had a lot of variation on the show 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.860
 There's a lot of cool new things and monsters. 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.470
 new more new days new weapons always 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.170
 new finish and I think it's worth 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.670
 worth playing servers in bpp because 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.680
 otherwise you'll be there killing your 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.459
 monster abuse the caramba 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.190
 there is a little beat 8 kill 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.930
 So you like this kind of game, you? 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.360
 already been positive and know that it's worth 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.630
 play if you have the good parts the only one 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.580
 problem is even the heavy spm so no 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.250
 I know, if you like chile, Jorge. 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.540
 worth the big retarded science 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.160
 who say it's not worth playing is 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.040
 because you just do not play you do not like 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.739
 of the game because if one day they liked it or 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.420
 not liking now because I had a 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.180
 chance on the team because not because not 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.160
 it's worth paying the pvp just want 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.920
 A baita, a sin, I'm so sorry. 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.480
 when I played in the juniors but continued 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.540
 having known them better known still 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.540
 monster of everything then jorge I had here 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.670
 it's worth if I had conclusions 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.260
 by my own gameplay 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.560
 I decided to live marched I had to 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.780
 call those who do not know the law 29 that 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.810
 Bugs is very old, I just came in here. 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.880
 to see how it looks the same if you 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.590
 he wants to play and his name will be called there 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.780
 It is common that this script is that close new 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:23.110
 I thought I was new but I did not like being 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:26.220
 not too empty servers and full of 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:30.370
 boot very very good to have lose more 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.200
 and if you then months can live together 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.500
 it has no problem in just 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.040
 to play like this always has something good 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.710
 you do the same 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.270
 when button for example it had 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.060
 Timbu time passing by me no 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.390
 disrupts the score in one language but in 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.950
 nothing that certain we will play all day 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.800
 even have time to play 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.140
 the buttons will not get in the way too much 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.940
 so if you there you think you 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.400
 agree with me then I already got it if you 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.270
 do not agree danny can a blog does not play 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.520
 your life 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.080
 I'm just waiting my opinion is 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.080
 That's it , if you liked the video 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.180
 let jewelry down if you do not like it 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.920
 Do not also share the video with 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.580
 all your enemy friends that you already 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:17.670
 know parents and uncles aunts mothers in mother earth 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.160
 of his friends his enemies also 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.250
 inscribe on the difficult channel with god 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.650
 Okay, I went to something else that is said 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.390
 before also that you now have a client 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.760
 Old flash if you want to play in 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.960
 flash is cool, well done, everything 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.180
 Can you get your luck sorted? 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.940
 case for every key right all right 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.200
 if you set the game and for each key to 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.460
 very selection has many things 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.460
 different and that's when I went
