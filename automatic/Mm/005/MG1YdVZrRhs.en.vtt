you know the cool the cool guys painted
on<00:01:22.680> paper<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.119> see<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
on paper and as you can see it as a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.140 
on paper and as you can see it as a
feather<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.619> top<00:01:25.650> while<00:01:26.340> we're<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> normal

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
feather on top while we're as a normal

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
painting has no feather on top so this

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.060 
painting has no feather on top so this
this<00:01:29.640> painting<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.180> fly<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.810> know<00:01:30.930> it

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
this painting can fly you know it

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.789 
this painting can fly you know it
represents<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.250> ability<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.360> fly<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.049> you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
represents your ability to fly but you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.160 
represents your ability to fly but you
also<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.340> create<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.820> sort<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.509> palette<00:01:36.900> so

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
also have to create a sort of palette so

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.440 
also have to create a sort of palette so
that's<00:01:37.619> where<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> ink<00:01:38.130> comes<00:01:38.610> from<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.329> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that's where the ink comes from and it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.060 
that's where the ink comes from and it
has<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> recipe<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.470> probably<00:01:40.710> won't<00:01:40.979> be

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
has a recipe that you probably won't be

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.219 
has a recipe that you probably won't be
able<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.430> remember<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.570> always<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
able to remember and like always the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.620 
able to remember and like always the
