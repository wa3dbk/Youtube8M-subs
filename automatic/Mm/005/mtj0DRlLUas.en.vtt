00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
to do now this is kind of the basic way

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560 
to do now this is kind of the basic way
how<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.860> lot<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.370> people<00:00:35.730> will<00:00:35.969> do<00:00:36.120> their<00:00:36.329> scene

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
so if you just go and add a plane so

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.160 
so if you just go and add a plane so
they<00:00:40.320> go<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.620> plane<00:00:40.920> they<00:00:41.219> type<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:42.170> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
they go to a plane they type in the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.930 
they go to a plane they type in the
biggest<00:00:43.530> number<00:00:43.800> possible<00:00:44.250> which<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.430> kind<00:00:44.910> of

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
biggest number possible which is kind of

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.240

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.069 
what I do but you just got the basic
floor<00:00:47.579> there<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.149> then<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.719> they<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
floor there and then what they do is

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.450 
floor there and then what they do is
they're<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> text<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.190> pull<00:00:50.370> the

and<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.189> not<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
and it just is just really not a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.770 
and it just is just really not a
pleasant<00:01:45.780> scene<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:47.220> really<00:01:47.490> watch<00:01:47.780> he

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
pleasant scene to to really watch he

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.690 
pleasant scene to to really watch he
just<00:01:48.960> looks<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:49.920> professional<00:01:50.520> at

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
just looks just not very professional at

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.420 
just looks just not very professional at
all<00:01:51.380> whereas<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.770> go<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> file<00:01:53.250> new

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
all whereas if I just go to file new

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.200 
all whereas if I just go to file new
again<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.000> if<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.020> add<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> floor<00:01:56.210> yeah

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
again and if you just add a floor yeah

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.560 
again and if you just add a floor yeah
let's<00:01:57.390> go<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> light<00:01:58.020> tone<00:01:58.290> go<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> floor

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
let's go to the light tone go to floor

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.490 
let's go to the light tone go to floor
then<00:02:00.570> if<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.810> go<00:02:00.990> ahead<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.229> add<00:02:01.320> some

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
then if you just go ahead and add some

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.800 
then if you just go ahead and add some
text<00:02:01.799> add<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.820> text<00:02:03.420> object<00:02:04.070> like<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:06.659> again

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
text add a text object like so and again

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.150 
text add a text object like so and again
if<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.200> render<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.680> out<00:02:07.799> we'll<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:07.950> be

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
if you just render it out we'll just be

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.029 
if you just render it out we'll just be
like<00:02:08.310> before<00:02:08.459> or<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:09.090> bland<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
like before or just be bland and

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.840 
like before or just be bland and
whatever<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.370> won't<00:02:11.670> be<00:02:11.760> much<00:02:11.879> difference

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
whatever and it won't be much difference

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.640 
whatever and it won't be much difference
what<00:02:13.780> we're<00:02:13.900> gonna<00:02:13.960> be<00:02:14.080> doing<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.440> we're<00:02:14.530> gonna

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.980 
what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna
be<00:02:14.740> going<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.310> be<00:02:15.460> adding<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.850> sky<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.660> if<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.870> go

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
be going to be adding a sky so if you go

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.420 
be going to be adding a sky so if you go
to<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.260> light<00:02:17.470> -<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:17.860> hella<00:02:17.980> bad<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.340> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
to the light - it's hella bad in the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.040 
to the light - it's hella bad in the
light<00:02:18.640> whatever<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.030> gonna<00:02:19.150> add<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.330> sky<00:02:19.750> and

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
light whatever you gonna add to sky and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
light whatever you gonna add to sky and
then<00:02:20.920> go<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.130> render<00:02:21.630> render<00:02:22.630> settings<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.950> go

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
then go to render render settings and go

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.740 
then go to render render settings and go
to<00:02:24.130> effect<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.530> global<00:02:26.530> illumination<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:28.630> now

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
to effect and global illumination so now

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.240 
to effect and global illumination so now
if<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.990> render<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.380> out<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.740> noticed<00:02:30.070> it'll

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
if you render it out you noticed it'll

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.150 
if you render it out you noticed it'll
be<00:02:30.370> like<00:02:30.520> before<00:02:31.290> however<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.620> won't<00:02:32.710> be<00:02:32.950> with

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
be like before however it won't be with

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.000 
be like before however it won't be with
as<00:02:33.250> many<00:02:33.370> shadows<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:34.810> won't<00:02:34.990> be<00:02:35.080> as<00:02:35.200> soft<00:02:35.500> it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
as many shadows it won't be as soft it

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.320 
as many shadows it won't be as soft it
will<00:02:36.130> be<00:02:36.250> kind<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.550> more<00:02:36.970> gray<00:02:38.730> like<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.090> but

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
will be kind of more gray like so but

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.750 
will be kind of more gray like so but
even<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.840> yourself<00:02:41.380> looks<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.490> lot<00:02:42.610> better

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
even that yourself looks a lot better

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.780 
even that yourself looks a lot better
than<00:02:43.000> what<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.210> was<00:02:43.330> just<00:02:43.780> originally<00:02:44.700> but<00:02:45.700> we

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
than what it was just originally but we

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.190 
than what it was just originally but we
should<00:02:45.880> want<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.060> add<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.180> light<00:02:46.480> here<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.050> if<00:02:47.140> we

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
should want to add a light here so if we

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.610 
should want to add a light here so if we
can<00:02:47.350> go<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.560> add<00:02:47.710> a<00:02:47.740> light<00:02:48.240> like<00:02:49.240> so<00:02:49.630> just<00:02:50.530> like

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
can go and add a light like so just like

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.290 
can go and add a light like so just like
before<00:02:50.740> I<00:02:51.130> suppose<00:02:51.550> it's<00:02:51.790> just<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.090> glue

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
before I suppose it's just the glue

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.690 
before I suppose it's just the glue
global<00:02:52.960> illumination<00:02:53.370> that's<00:02:54.370> kind<00:02:54.520> of<00:02:54.550> what

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
global illumination that's kind of what

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.370 
global illumination that's kind of what
makes<00:02:54.820> it<00:02:55.120> I'm<00:02:55.270> just<00:02:55.330> gonna<00:02:55.510> change<00:02:56.020> the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
makes it I'm just gonna change the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.120 
makes it I'm just gonna change the
intensity<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.130> about<00:02:57.400> 60<00:02:58.300> here<00:02:58.770> I'm<00:02:59.770> gonna

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
intensity to about 60 here I'm gonna

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.960 
intensity to about 60 here I'm gonna
make<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.340> color<00:03:01.150> like<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.510> soft<00:03:02.020> baby<00:03:02.410> blue

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
make this color like a soft baby blue

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.740 
make this color like a soft baby blue
okay<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.360> now<00:03:05.020> if<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.380> render<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:05.980> out

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
okay and now if you just render that out

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.850 
okay and now if you just render that out
now<00:03:07.750> you'll<00:03:07.930> notice<00:03:08.080> that<00:03:08.320> before<00:03:08.470> rendering

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
now you'll notice that before rendering

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.910 
now you'll notice that before rendering
you'll<00:03:09.160> come<00:03:09.310> up<00:03:09.340> with<00:03:09.430> these<00:03:09.580> grey<00:03:09.940> spots<00:03:10.330> the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
you'll come up with these grey spots the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.200 
you'll come up with these grey spots the
the<00:03:11.920> white<00:03:12.100> dots<00:03:12.400> are<00:03:12.580> actually<00:03:12.670> picking<00:03:13.030> out

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
the white dots are actually picking out

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.670 
the white dots are actually picking out
the<00:03:13.300> points<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.690> light<00:03:13.900> on<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.230> image<00:03:14.470> and

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
the points of light on the image and

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.400 
the points of light on the image and
kind<00:03:14.860> of<00:03:14.980> retracing<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:17.110> now<00:03:17.230> if<00:03:17.350> you

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
kind of retracing that so now if you

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.200 
kind of retracing that so now if you
just<00:03:17.560> say<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.770> rendered<00:03:18.100> you<00:03:18.220> see<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.610> the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
just say it rendered you see that the

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.720 
just say it rendered you see that the
tick's<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.660> looking<00:03:19.960> really<00:03:20.170> nice<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.800> it's

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
tick's is looking really nice and it's

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.580 
tick's is looking really nice and it's
really<00:03:21.940> soft<00:03:22.210> and<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:22.810> kind<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.260> looks<00:03:23.440> like<00:03:23.500> a

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
really soft and it kind of looks like a

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.200 
really soft and it kind of looks like a
dreamy<00:03:24.040> sort<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.490> effect<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:24.940> you've<00:03:25.030> got<00:03:25.150> the

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
dreamy sort of effect and you've got the

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.530 
dreamy sort of effect and you've got the
kind<00:03:25.360> of<00:03:25.450> blue<00:03:25.840> gray<00:03:26.500> white<00:03:26.860> diffusion<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:28.300> it

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
kind of blue gray white diffusion and it

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.020 
kind of blue gray white diffusion and it
just<00:03:28.690> looked<00:03:28.930> really<00:03:29.110> nice<00:03:29.790> it's<00:03:30.790> looking

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
just looked really nice it's looking

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.480 
just looked really nice it's looking
really<00:03:31.300> good<00:03:31.710> one<00:03:32.710> extra<00:03:32.980> thing<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.190> could<00:03:33.340> do

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
soft look you can change the contrast

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.510 
soft look you can change the contrast
you<00:03:43.930> can<00:03:43.990> not<00:03:44.440> have<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.590> contrast<00:03:44.950> if<00:03:45.130> icarus

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
you can not have a contrast if icarus

you can not have a contrast if icarus
soft<00:03:45.760> look<00:03:46.000> I'm<00:03:46.300> like<00:03:46.480> 20<00:03:47.550> recommend<00:03:48.550> no

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
but that is just looking really nice as

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.789 
but that is just looking really nice as
opposed<00:04:14.980> to<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.550> other<00:04:15.820> just<00:04:16.210> basic<00:04:16.870> light<00:04:17.230> on

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
a really big plane and we are coming up

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.490 
a really big plane and we are coming up
to<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.930> end

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
to the end

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.190

again<00:05:17.330> then<00:05:18.080> it's<00:05:18.260> just<00:05:18.380> a<00:05:18.530> hassle<00:05:18.710> so<00:05:18.950> just<00:05:19.220> a

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
again then it's just a hassle so just a

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.730 
again then it's just a hassle so just a
quick<00:05:19.490> tip<00:05:19.700> yeah<00:05:20.650> so<00:05:21.650> now<00:05:21.800> render<00:05:22.220> again

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.320 

and<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:27.890> will<00:05:28.040> take<00:05:28.250> a<00:05:28.280> bit<00:05:28.400> longer<00:05:28.550> but<00:05:29.210> that's

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
and it will take a bit longer but that's

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.830 
and it will take a bit longer but that's
what<00:05:29.540> you<00:05:29.600> can't<00:05:29.830> so<00:05:30.830> you<00:05:30.919> have<00:05:31.040> to<00:05:31.160> go<00:05:31.370> through

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
what you can't so you have to go through

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.260 
what you can't so you have to go through
I'm<00:05:32.840> making<00:05:33.260> something<00:05:34.010> decent<00:05:34.610> in<00:05:34.760> cinema<00:05:35.090> 4d

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
I'm making something decent in cinema 4d

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.620 
I'm making something decent in cinema 4d
a<00:05:35.710> lot<00:05:36.710> of<00:05:36.800> people<00:05:37.130> wonder<00:05:37.490> like<00:05:37.760> well<00:05:38.210> well<00:05:38.479> it

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
a lot of people wonder like well well it

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.530 
a lot of people wonder like well well it
takes<00:05:38.780> you<00:05:38.900> so<00:05:39.080> long<00:05:39.110> to<00:05:39.500> render<00:05:39.830> in<00:05:39.919> cinema<00:05:40.250> 4d

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
takes you so long to render in cinema 4d

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.430 
takes you so long to render in cinema 4d
that's<00:05:41.540> because<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:41.870> lighting<00:05:42.110> that<00:05:42.410> I

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
that's because the lighting that I

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.580 
that's because the lighting that I
generally<00:05:42.770> tend<00:05:43.250> to<00:05:43.310> use<00:05:44.110> as<00:05:45.110> you<00:05:45.229> see<00:05:45.380> there

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
generally tend to use as you see there

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.490 
generally tend to use as you see there
is<00:05:45.710> taking<00:05:46.100> a<00:05:46.190> good<00:05:46.370> what<00:05:46.630> 30<00:05:47.630> seconds<00:05:48.169> just<00:05:48.410> to

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
is taking a good what 30 seconds just to

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.590 
is taking a good what 30 seconds just to
window<00:05:48.800> render<00:05:49.130> one<00:05:49.310> frame<00:05:49.669> in<00:05:50.180> most

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
window render one frame in most

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.960 
window render one frame in most
animations<00:05:51.169> I<00:05:51.320> have<00:05:51.440> like<00:05:51.650> 500<00:05:51.979> or<00:05:52.400> so<00:05:52.580> frames

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
animations I have like 500 or so frames

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.600 
animations I have like 500 or so frames
so<00:05:53.240> you<00:05:53.300> can<00:05:53.479> imagine<00:05:53.810> how<00:05:53.870> long<00:05:53.930> it<00:05:54.110> takes

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
so you can imagine how long it takes

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.900 
so you can imagine how long it takes
quite<00:05:55.610> a<00:05:55.669> few<00:05:55.970> hours<00:05:57.040> but<00:05:58.040> anyway<00:05:58.280> wrap<00:05:58.550> it<00:05:58.760> up

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
quite a few hours but anyway wrap it up

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.150 
quite a few hours but anyway wrap it up
there<00:05:59.210> that's<00:05:59.630> a<00:05:59.810> to<00:05:59.870> epicene<00:06:00.410> in<00:06:00.590> cinema<00:06:00.890> 4d

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
there that's a to epicene in cinema 4d

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.219 
there that's a to epicene in cinema 4d
