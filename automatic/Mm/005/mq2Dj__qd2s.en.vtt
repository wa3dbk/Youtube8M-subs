00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:43.570
 good friend pablo 8 76 54 32 15 25 25 25 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.430
 and in this new video tutorial as it says 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.290
 the title I'm going to teach you how to 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.050
 recover the recycling bin in 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.059
 windows xp let's start 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.440
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.440
 enter my pc 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.640
 once inside we will find 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.150
 something like this we look for the wayward 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.010
 and we give him a right click and now we give him 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.010
 click where it says properties 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.570
 and then something like this will come out 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.640
 next thing we have to do is give it 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.790
 click where it says free space in 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.790
 disk 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.110
 then we will open a small window 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.120
 we will wait a while this can 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.930
 take depends on how full your 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.930
 Local disk 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.150
 when it finishes loading it will open a 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.680
 window as it is here we will select 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.680
 where it says recycle bin 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.160
 now we give the button that says see 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.160
 records 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.890
 now we minimize this and close everything 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.100
 the rest except my video because if not 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.619
 how the fuck you will know how to follow xd 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.030
 now we have to drag this little 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.030
 icon from here to the desktop 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.280
 now I will open it to see what is the 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.460
 recycling bin hehe how many things 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.470
 eliminated xd and ready we have back 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.300
 to the recycling bin now if 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.400
 we want to change the name and 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.100
 we delete this that says direct access to 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.080
 and now we move it anywhere we want 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.720
 and we right click and update 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.790
