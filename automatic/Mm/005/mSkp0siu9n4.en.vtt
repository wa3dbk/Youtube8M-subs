00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.810
 Welcome to a little bug 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.670
 so to speak so i will be me now 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.440
 introduce a bug in minecraft pocket 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.590
 edition null 6.0 if you are here in 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.840
 sees the clouds and yes so if you 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.040
 build something now 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.900
 I believe in the beginning that works now 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.130
 not it is sometimes so sometimes 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.260
 Sometimes it does not work now 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.850
 Clear again 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:28.349
 and now it's back 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:30.779
 gerd backes namely exactly then go 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.640
 then out again and suddenly 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.620
 no longer able to do that now 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.140
 if you look right now 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.590
 namely no longer there and that is 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.149
 just really shit because so 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.129
 you can in real minecraft more 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.239
 to build 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.760
 At least not when this bug is straight 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:55.350
 appears so to speak now it works 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.329
 short out of that and now that's exactly it 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.070
 shows again that is not there 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.170
 have built wheel back is not there and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.930
 now that has always happened 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.689
 if that was built on the same 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.159
 as holzer full so we here the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.280
 again briefly jumped bit of stone 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:16.290
 back again so yes, it is okay 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.380
 Again, it is really sometimes 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.180
 Just like that sometimes, but I have 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.369
 now I do not know us at how the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.979
 android is fine as well as some 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.520
 bugs so I wanted to do it at least I 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.950
 first normal and matthias only earth 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.950
 actually erase on earth 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:42.450
 so now you can see it is exactly what it is 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:49.439
 gone now, where I go something but me 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:52.380
 do that again wood on earth is okay 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.659
 it still there then I need it 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:01.890
 Earth will be on earth moment to become 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:04.979
 then from me that still on earth and 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.000
 now he'll be fine again 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.940
 Actually, here's how we do it 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.330
 take turns taking turns at last 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.950
 just now we are doing here 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.650
 tree trunks with it the earth 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:22.170
 this time as normal stairs and there 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.830
 again such an earth exactly and now yes 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.420
 let's see it happen 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.420
 after what happens when more go out 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.890
 Ok, now it's still there, I'll do it 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.610
 short time to try something again 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.610
 so I'll go there 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.400
 Now you can see everything is still there
