00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.640
 valerio d'arcangelo wants to get fit 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.560
 hold and have the sharkoon for it 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.630
 he will not only be chosen here 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.840
 friendly received but also receives 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.000
 Coupons trial hours for three whereupon 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.949
 So wait the customers have a full 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.550
 filled new season program for 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.859
 selection 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:28.650
 because toyota can jlo decide 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:30.599
 especially for the course bodyforming 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.149
 Back problems, this course is good 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.190
 suitable for the participants whom each 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.500
 individual muscle groups of your body and 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.500
 get really sweaty 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:58.489
 and everything else I would not have 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.680
 really thought what what exercises what 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.300
 most exhausting you where I am now 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.180
 just made him lie with him 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:12.470
 to walk over and try 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:14.240
 my hand between them can be 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.970
 valerio d'arcangelo but not 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.280
 demotivate because as with all courses 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.680
 come fast with a little bit of training 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.560
 success and he already realizes that the 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.330
 Exercises well with those of his body 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.660
 it is very much so i find it 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.660
 important 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:40.759
 most problems coach vladimir 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.929
 kálmán is a physiotherapist and walks in 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.460
 the hour on each participant 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.649
 individually a 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.750
 All courses will be beginners 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.759
 she immediately integrated into the group 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.350
 can all in the first hour 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:02:02.929
 join in the exercises and at the 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:05.810
 Personal limits are the main issue 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.700
 on the back many strains and in 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.349
 I also try one course 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.770
 to activate certain muscle groups 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.540
 she is better trained 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.160
 valtteri or whole has the trial lesson 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.410
 convinced he would like to continue with 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.209
 kyoto kidneys and other courses 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.270
 Of course, come and try 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.700
 so again the course is currently 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.190
 What I did now is very good 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.720
 great coach, I also think the whole 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.650
 people the atmosphere was very relaxed 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.330
 runs super and with a little practice 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.349
 It will certainly not be around soon 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.349
 quite so exhausting
