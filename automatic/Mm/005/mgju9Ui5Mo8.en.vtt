00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.370
 necessary ingredients that's it and I 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.680

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.880
 can get in Asian markets 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.250
 well as they come in these sticks 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.910
 wrapped and they are very easy to 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.000
 crumble you take off in the envelope 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.880
 and they are the same credits look and match 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.800
 that gold will be a total success 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.720
 then we will be using the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.300
 white or yellow onion that you 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.700

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.880
 attractive the lilac color in the salad 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.220
 crushed garlic cilantro abundant and 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.399
 If not then also use messages or the 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.559
 mixture of the two flavors that divine the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.030
 red peppers can use the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.270
 yellow red bell peppers 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.899
 orange or the morrones like you 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.909
 prefer also we integrate the fruit of the 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.700
 caribbean mango 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.549
 a Caribbean touch to this salad in 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.170
 the season true country and jesse came 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.659

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.030
 inside this indra salad knows 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.170
 spectacular and the cream cheese but the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.090
 who want to find a little bit the one 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.549
 you can use light mayonnaise or yogurt 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.109
 for this is to disguise a little but 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.819
 I'm going to do it with alternative rubber 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.890
 it is now and never a container of 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.140
 crystal preferably I will open with 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.240
 the lemon acids are going to squeeze the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.709
 lemon minutes help but not 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.729

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:41.489

 olive oil and using the oil 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.670
 goya olive the extra virgin because 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.399
 remember that if it is goya it has to be 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.560
 good and excellent alternative to use 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.569
 the extra virgin oil that has a 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.090
 more robust flavor but if you do not want more 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.159

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.179

 with these intense flavors put on 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.690
 in gloves because sometimes a 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.360
 little bit of the flavor without taking off 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.370
 of our cheeks then it's ready 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.600
