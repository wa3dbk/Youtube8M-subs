00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.700
 plus today's traffic jams 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.470
 really more convenient and easier 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.480
 return the car with an automatic 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.640
 gear box 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.030
 most students prefer 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.380
 automatic box 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.940
 much easier to learn from automatic 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.860
 a box then you can learn how 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.030
 notes gear 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.940
 if on mechanics 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.430
 man will be forced to control 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.530
 clutch torque 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.350
 gear situation in may football 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.740
 attention time is one thing to be honest 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.259
 enough 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.529
 briskly driving is this one 

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:10.910
 matter and at the initial stage it creates 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.910
 certain difficulties 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.770
 the box was often needed for 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.480
 well let's say torque transmission 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.580
 motor wheels 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.860
 the engine cannot run wide 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.910
 range 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.890
 wheel speeds 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.400
 therefore necessary for but soon the star 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.990
 normal acceleration dynamics 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.810
 for normal engine operation change 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.479
 broadband transmission ratio 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.040
 the contrast of the whole car serves to 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.820
 engine torque transmission 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.650
 prickly wheels 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.690
 not only passes it we pass 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.820
 changes in magnitude this direction 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.830
 when you need to move such as reversing 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.940
 and in traditionally the first ooo 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.420
 powertrain previously consisted of them 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.510
 mechanical units it was 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.530
 manual gearbox 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.760
 running 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.019
 often cardan transmission 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.629
 the main gear will receive which 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.329
 rotates the wheels 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:13.540
 over time in the united states 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.819
 appeared 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.199
 gear boxes 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.339
 automatically controlled 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.409
 as we call them hydromechanical 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.919
 gearbox now machines were 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.469
 Generally I was stepped 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.089
 money transformer machines they easily 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:28.899
 in some sort of switching plans 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.429
 woke up plans range of revolutions 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.599
 it's about the forties 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.709
 fifties 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.680
 in an attempt to put it 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.379
 European cars such 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.569
 gear boxes 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.539
 failed in their time because 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:44.819
 what's new 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.619
 car american 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:48.679
 in size according to omaha basis 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:50.339
 characteristics differ later 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.069
 train speed box all 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.349
 speed box 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.440
 but there are tenths 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.839
 and the present time 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.749
 also reached eight or more 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:00.259
 automatic gears 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:02.369
 boxes electronics became hot 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:04.569
 apply but in the middle end 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:05.869
 eighties 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.519
 now all the boxes are the sun nobody 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.419
 died on the site of the boxes 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.419
 practically we do not meet them 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:16.559
 most exotic happens to fail 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.049
 these japanese cars 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.180
 today in many countries, rubles 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.849
 long road car release 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.889
 percent is iness 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.349
 automatic transmissions 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.269
 moreover, except hydromechanical 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.869
 other automatic ones appeared 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.739
 automated when special 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.359
 gray aggregates special 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.019
 the device switches the place 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.089
 Transmission driver in ordinary fine box 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:42.059
 gears as well as there were so 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:44.849
 called gearbox with a variator 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.759
 which main function changes 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.079
 torque carries 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.469
 m when the belt transmission 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.129
 with resizable grinding 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.819
 you 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.299
 when rescued automatic 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.639
 Mahno diverse 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.639
 along the course of the skies box that repeats 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.989
 almost usually mechanics 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.259
 year robotic 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.069
 boxes that are with the usual mechanics with 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.169
 automatic switching 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.359
 but the most extreme machine and this 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.249
 variable speed drive 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:11.529
 where let's say adventures 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:13.929
 happens without dumber bills without changing 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:15.959
 without the use of let's say the gears 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.439
 but nevertheless anyway for today 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:20.220
 moment more gearboxes 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.650
 exactly hydromechanical 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.370
 which part of the job takes on 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.370
 liquid 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.080
 in conventional gearbox 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.280
 torque change occurs 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.879
 by celebrating the number of teeth already 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.219
 gears 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:41.499
 automatic hydromechanical 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:42.699
 Transmission 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.979
 the second part of the work does this 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.029
 a device that looks like a true glint in it 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:52.099
 there are three crosses there is one wheel flag
