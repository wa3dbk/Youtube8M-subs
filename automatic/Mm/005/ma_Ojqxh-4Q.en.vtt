00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.880
 greetings to all those aspirants welcome animation to the second 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.840
 delivers the Venezuelan 3d 3 animation course below we will see a 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.390
 greater efficiency of the tracks 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.140
 we will make or create the selection and manipulation of objects 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.140
 basic in may pl 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.060
 3 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.839
 let's see about 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:23.930
 what they are 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.120
 this creation objects I feel that the main thing between them 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.329
 there we created women team as authors and the basic elements of the 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.810
 scene as we have 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.160
 surfaces 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.820
 camera lights 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.469
 embroidery do this process measuring text 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:40.539
 what all there 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.250
 exeter 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.240
 We were Kinnock cast us as a team and biometrics and mouth stretched with 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.200
 efe 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.600
 to create it simply to castro with the left button armed after the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.720
 senate 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.010
 and so he said the size and the diameter of the Aztec as such and the usual 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.290
 here in maya defining local or which are an object to the surface as such 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.060
 we have five visits 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.980
 always but it will always be votes against going in course to leave 10th 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.980
 where we have propitiated wait as such 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.040
 if you pressed button 4 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.310
 orchestrated leaders this is called mouahhid commented we see as a 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.100
 kind of occupying that like a wire 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.810
 royalties as are lines 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.930
 which are the intersection of each the points that make up the object 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.540
 three-dimensional 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.360
 I follow t5 ego pressed for example one will see an injury in his day the 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.420
 cold breasts especially if we work in spain on computers that does not have 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.560
 a lot of capacity 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.630
 naked in is a little a lot and a half and three 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.310
 which is like this the maximum division that we have 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.200
 available objects 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.180
 howard to the excess of how we select metopa makes it more efficient if 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.940
 you put in a file with this 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.700
 now master the basic transformations 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.510
 here it is worth we have full while not that if this one 1 starting already it leaves by hamas 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.940
 are the first things and that to light 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.940
 I think moving j and scale 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.839
 because many are half 3 of all if it is not a simple one here 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.649
 here samuel to the manipulator to move 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:17.360
 to be able to move it of tone 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.740
 if you put a click on it in the dead man's dam I wanted to bring it back 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.290
 yellow in puembo clicks and what dies were transmitted to the new thing 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.839
 I maintain that Senate 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.569
 olocco dead mx 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.069
 hears 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.069
 look like the object abdi ipecki j 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.629
 it's the same being in that sense it was broken 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.609
 belluscio and here in the middle to provide it but as reported today that is 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.199
 flame so precisely 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.129
 by the other other eta seems to be 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.299
 equally team in mind when the moe is promoted they are located in the middle of 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.229
 new way the common ones 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:56.959
 allows to prop up the chemical industry 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.159
 finish 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.149
 to modify its form 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:07.189
 there is a faster forum in the pumas and sara stagnation what are the keys 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:11.699
 there was rr she wants to mentioned that they have been busy 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.569
 here we do not have much much have manipulated fear the normal thing that without 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.870
 doubt you fit new menu 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.400
 this process to him 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.660
 manipulator to transport objects 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.919
 he always believes it 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.579
 minors for giraldo militated who wants 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.579
 is to be it speck 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.799
 Now I'm going to talk to you about what is tunneling like that 47 with stoicism 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.069
 the program we want to select and what not 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.809
 put in asia and simple this 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:45.979
 this yearning to manage what they are 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.919
 the wakes masks selection in the program 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.760
 4 for another liter of water putting another one camera 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.909
 james cameron 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.909
 slight picture for tan no loves and 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:00.949
 on the other hand lights uatre here 1 pontiac 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.379
 I will also create a curve 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:18.879
 well as when they start a badge for each one more 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.419
 hundred 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.790
 the so-called divo that indicates 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.150
 4 pts precisely the program for example 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.800
 this guy will expose surfaces let's open to tindÃºf what selection 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.430
 or 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.669
 see that I have fifteen paintings 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.669
 and opposition to the entire sector expected 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.439
 keeping the button pitching pressed 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.949
 now if to select curves 1 athletic - 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.759
 Moreno Ponce will swear by himself because choice to the camera quique is 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.759
 got ins that dreamed some half of them mechanization 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.550
 and for this position to the surface 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.699
 the USSR to poor populations and clicks hindemith in ecuador 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.740
 and to posterity 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.490
 alazraki if it moves there are those who pass were 11 points and went down 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.919
 we can come six age 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.969
 bull object sacyr sides 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.979
 kodak with four with everything in fact insisted 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.010
 in attack it seems difficult to make this 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.580
 the killing machine by females was simply a manager and they see no 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.249
 because it's bad 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:31.520
 but 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.949
 the sphere as such 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.780
 or that I think that this is to make this one in the second installment 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.100
 remember that you can place stubborn on your eminence in the sun prize forum 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.289
 additionally good license 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.080
 and we'll see each other in the next installment of the animation course
