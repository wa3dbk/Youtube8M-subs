00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
why is what we're about to do is it's

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.899 
why is what we're about to do is it's
going<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.649> affect<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.280> color<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.670> all<00:01:51.729> those

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
going to affect the color of all those

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.959 
going to affect the color of all those
pixels<00:01:52.299> and<00:01:52.539> when<00:01:53.439> I<00:01:53.469> do<00:01:53.560> my<00:01:53.859> initial<00:01:54.310> under

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
pixels and when I do my initial under

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.749 
pixels and when I do my initial under
sketches<00:01:55.890> before<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:56.920> go<00:01:57.100> into<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.429> graphite

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
sketches before I go into the graphite

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.459 
sketches before I go into the graphite
pencil<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:58.149> use<00:01:58.359> a<00:01:58.390> non-photo<00:01:58.899> blue<00:01:58.990> pencil

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
pencil I use a non-photo blue pencil

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.319 
pencil I use a non-photo blue pencil
there<00:01:59.649> and<00:01:59.890> if<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.490> scan<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.850> color<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.179> will

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
there and if you scan in color it will

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.660 
there and if you scan in color it will
pick<00:02:01.539> up<00:02:01.659> those<00:02:01.780> non-photo<00:02:02.229> blue<00:02:02.319> lines<00:02:02.679> but

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
pick up those non-photo blue lines but

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.959 
pick up those non-photo blue lines but
if<00:02:03.759> you've<00:02:03.880> scanned<00:02:04.149> in<00:02:04.390> greyscale<00:02:04.899> it's

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
if you've scanned in greyscale it's

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.760 
if you've scanned in greyscale it's
going<00:02:06.969> to<00:02:07.119> mostly<00:02:07.719> pick<00:02:07.929> up<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.259> graphite

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
going to mostly pick up the graphite

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.360 
going to mostly pick up the graphite
lines<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.899> take<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.380> grayscale<00:02:11.800> image<00:02:12.130> at

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
lines so I take this grayscale image at

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.000 
lines so I take this grayscale image at
3<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.210> 600<00:02:13.630> dpi<00:02:13.840> or<00:02:13.900> more<00:02:14.350> if<00:02:14.500> your<00:02:14.650> computer

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
3 to 600 dpi or more if your computer

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.650 
3 to 600 dpi or more if your computer
can<00:02:15.100> handle<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.700> we're<00:02:16.240> going<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.420> create

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
can handle it and we're going to create

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.550 
can handle it and we're going to create
what's<00:02:16.810> called<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:17.050> duotone

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
what's called a duotone

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.850 
what's called a duotone
and<00:02:17.970> without<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.360> know<00:02:19.390> going<00:02:19.959> into<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.230> deep

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
and without you know going into a deep

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.160 
and without you know going into a deep
technical<00:02:21.250> explanation<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.030> what<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.299> is

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
technical explanation of what that is

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.440 
technical explanation of what that is
it<00:02:23.709> essentially<00:02:24.370> just<00:02:24.490> converts<00:02:24.940> all<00:02:25.180> of

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
it essentially just converts all of

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.510 
it essentially just converts all of
what's<00:02:25.720> gray<00:02:26.050> into<00:02:26.560> whatever<00:02:26.800> color<00:02:27.069> I<00:02:27.190> tell

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
what's gray into whatever color I tell

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.240 
what's gray into whatever color I tell
it<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.819> so<00:02:28.120> for<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.420> we<00:02:28.690> go<00:02:28.840> into<00:02:29.110> here's<00:02:29.500> just

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
it to so for that we go into here's just

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.930 
it to so for that we go into here's just
opened<00:02:30.580> up<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.120> scan<00:02:31.420> file<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.520> if<00:02:33.520> you

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
opened up the the scan file and if you

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.180 
opened up the the scan file and if you
need<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.120> clean<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.450> up<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:34.950> then<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.069> go

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
need to clean it up you can then you go

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.309 
need to clean it up you can then you go
to<00:02:36.250> image<00:02:36.760> mode<00:02:38.160> duotone<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.959> this<00:02:40.959> dialog

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
to image mode duotone and this dialog

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.130 
to image mode duotone and this dialog
box<00:02:41.350> appears<00:02:42.100> now<00:02:42.780> duotone<00:02:43.780> gives<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:44.110> a

box appears now duotone gives you a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.440 
box appears now duotone gives you a

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
this is Adobe Photoshop cs4 it might be

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.759 
this is Adobe Photoshop cs4 it might be
set<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:51.310> typeset<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.940> duotone<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.840> you

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
set to the typeset to duotone and you

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.830 
set to the typeset to duotone and you
can<00:02:53.950> set<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.400> bunch<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:54.849> different<00:02:55.239> colors<00:02:55.630> that

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
can set a bunch of different colors that

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.150 
can set a bunch of different colors that
will<00:02:55.989> interact<00:02:56.290> with<00:02:56.709> each<00:02:56.830> other<00:02:58.860> like<00:02:59.860> so

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
will interact with each other like so

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.789 
will interact with each other like so
you<00:03:00.459> can<00:03:00.489> do<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.670> tritone<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.660> add<00:03:02.200> lots<00:03:02.620> of

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
you can do a tritone and add lots of

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.590 
you can do a tritone and add lots of
more<00:03:02.950> colors<00:03:03.220> they'll<00:03:03.430> all<00:03:03.549> interact<00:03:04.060> on<00:03:04.330> your

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
more colors they'll all interact on your

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.640 
more colors they'll all interact on your
image<00:03:04.900> but<00:03:05.110> we<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.380> want<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.940> monotone<00:03:06.940> and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
image but we just want a monotone and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.500 
image but we just want a monotone and
for<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.739> monotone<00:03:09.130> it<00:03:10.030> gives<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.360> this

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
for the monotone it gives you this

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.949 
for the monotone it gives you this
option<00:03:11.080> here<00:03:11.230> for<00:03:11.440> your<00:03:11.620> first<00:03:11.769> ink<00:03:12.069> color<00:03:12.310> and

you're going to set the C for cyan to
30%<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:27.730> can<00:03:27.880> adjust<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.209> later<00:03:28.450> if<00:03:28.810> you

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
going to open this up in Adobe Photoshop

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.900 
going to open this up in Adobe Photoshop
Elements<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:30.340> is<00:05:30.460> where<00:05:30.580> it<00:05:30.640> says<00:05:30.760> seem

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
Elements and this is where it says seem

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.100 
Elements and this is where it says seem
a<00:05:30.940> little<00:05:31.000> backwards<00:05:31.540> we're<00:05:31.810> going<00:05:31.990> to

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
a little backwards we're going to

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.860 
a little backwards we're going to
convert<00:05:32.440> this<00:05:32.830> greyscale<00:05:33.460> image<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:34.210> an<00:05:34.390> RGB

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
convert this greyscale image to an RGB

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.300 
convert this greyscale image to an RGB
image<00:05:34.900> but<00:05:35.470> there's<00:05:35.620> a<00:05:35.680> reason<00:05:35.950> why<00:05:36.040> you<00:05:36.100> want

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
image but there's a reason why you want

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.280 
image but there's a reason why you want
to<00:05:36.340> do<00:05:36.520> that<00:05:36.700> you<00:05:36.880> want<00:05:37.150> all<00:05:37.390> of<00:05:37.420> the<00:05:37.840> line<00:05:38.050> art

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
to do that you want all of the line art

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.290 
to do that you want all of the line art
to<00:05:38.380> be<00:05:38.470> in<00:05:38.770> just<00:05:39.160> black<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:39.400> white<00:05:39.610> pixels<00:05:40.150> to

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
to be in just black and white pixels to

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.120 
to be in just black and white pixels to
start<00:05:40.570> with<00:05:40.720> before<00:05:40.900> you<00:05:41.110> convert<00:05:41.320> it<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:41.620> RGB

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
start with before you convert it to RGB

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.230 
start with before you convert it to RGB
so<00:05:42.850> first<00:05:43.300> to<00:05:43.510> convert<00:05:43.810> it<00:05:43.930> we<00:05:44.050> go<00:05:44.170> up<00:05:44.260> to<00:05:44.380> image

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
so first to convert it we go up to image

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.760 
so first to convert it we go up to image
mode<00:05:46.620> RGB<00:05:47.620> color<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:49.870> it<00:05:49.960> takes<00:05:50.140> a<00:05:50.260> second<00:05:50.620> and

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
mode RGB color and it takes a second and

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.670 
mode RGB color and it takes a second and
then<00:05:51.400> it's<00:05:51.550> converted<00:05:51.840> now<00:05:52.840> we're<00:05:53.320> going<00:05:53.470> to

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
then it's converted now we're going to

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.950 
then it's converted now we're going to
apply<00:05:54.010> what's<00:05:54.370> called<00:05:54.610> a<00:05:54.730> layer<00:05:54.970> effect<00:05:55.480> to

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
apply what's called a layer effect to

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.550 
apply what's called a layer effect to
this<00:05:56.140> line<00:05:56.380> art<00:05:56.620> to<00:05:56.980> turn<00:05:57.370> it<00:05:57.520> into<00:05:57.670> cyan

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
this line art to turn it into cyan

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.170 
this line art to turn it into cyan
pixels<00:05:59.560> so<00:05:59.980> when<00:06:00.130> we<00:06:00.250> print<00:06:00.430> it<00:06:00.580> out<00:06:00.670> we<00:06:00.940> can

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
pixels so when we print it out we can

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.080 
pixels so when we print it out we can
ink<00:06:01.390> it<00:06:01.540> with<00:06:01.900> impunity<00:06:02.290> so<00:06:02.650> for<00:06:03.580> that<00:06:03.670> we<00:06:03.910> go

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
ink it with impunity so for that we go

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.660 
ink it with impunity so for that we go
to<00:06:04.120> layer<00:06:04.780> new<00:06:05.230> adjustment<00:06:06.220> layer

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
to layer new adjustment layer

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.310 
to layer new adjustment layer
hue/saturation<00:06:09.670> and<00:06:09.880> we<00:06:10.480> click<00:06:10.690> on<00:06:10.840> that<00:06:10.870> and

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
hue/saturation and we click on that and

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.470 
hue/saturation and we click on that and
we<00:06:11.770> get<00:06:11.860> this<00:06:11.980> dialog<00:06:12.340> box<00:06:12.580> that<00:06:12.670> pops<00:06:12.820> up<00:06:13.330> and

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
we get this dialog box that pops up and

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.730 
we get this dialog box that pops up and
we<00:06:13.570> can<00:06:13.690> call<00:06:13.810> this<00:06:13.930> layer<00:06:14.140> whatever<00:06:14.410> we<00:06:14.530> want

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
we can call this layer whatever we want

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.290 
we can call this layer whatever we want
but<00:06:14.920> what's<00:06:15.070> call<00:06:15.250> this<00:06:15.370> hue/saturation<00:06:16.150> one

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
but what's call this hue/saturation one

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.490 
but what's call this hue/saturation one
because<00:06:16.540> it<00:06:16.660> really<00:06:16.780> doesn't<00:06:17.230> matter<00:06:17.290> because

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
because it really doesn't matter because

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.720 
because it really doesn't matter because
once<00:06:17.890> we're<00:06:18.040> done<00:06:18.130> with<00:06:18.250> this<00:06:18.340> file<00:06:18.520> words

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
once we're done with this file words

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.970 
once we're done with this file words
gonna<00:06:18.880> dump<00:06:19.180> it<00:06:19.300> once<00:06:19.570> we<00:06:19.690> print<00:06:19.930> out<00:06:20.050> the<00:06:20.320> hard

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 
gonna dump it once we print out the hard

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.860 
gonna dump it once we print out the hard
copy<00:06:21.220> or<00:06:21.370> rather<00:06:21.790> we'll<00:06:22.120> just<00:06:22.330> save<00:06:22.510> it<00:06:22.540> but<00:06:22.750> we

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
copy or rather we'll just save it but we

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.940 
copy or rather we'll just save it but we
won't<00:06:23.020> really<00:06:23.110> need<00:06:23.290> to<00:06:23.440> mess<00:06:23.590> around<00:06:23.740> with<00:06:23.920> a

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
won't really need to mess around with a

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.950 
won't really need to mess around with a
whole<00:06:24.190> lot<00:06:24.370> of<00:06:24.400> layers<00:06:24.610> in<00:06:24.820> this<00:06:24.940> file<00:06:25.180> so<00:06:25.870> we

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
whole lot of layers in this file so we

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.400 
whole lot of layers in this file so we
hit<00:06:26.110> OK<00:06:26.140> and<00:06:27.030> then<00:06:28.030> this<00:06:28.180> dialog<00:06:28.630> box<00:06:28.870> pops<00:06:29.170> up

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
hit OK and then this dialog box pops up

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.200 
hit OK and then this dialog box pops up
now<00:06:30.100> here<00:06:30.280> are<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.370> settings<00:06:30.700> that<00:06:30.790> I<00:06:30.910> found

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
now here are the settings that I found

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
now here are the settings that I found
that<00:06:32.170> match<00:06:32.470> as<00:06:32.800> close<00:06:33.250> as<00:06:33.430> possible<00:06:33.690> to<00:06:34.690> the

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
that match as close as possible to the

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.900 
that match as close as possible to the
duotone<00:06:35.710> effect<00:06:36.010> in<00:06:36.160> regular<00:06:36.610> Adobe

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
duotone effect in regular Adobe

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.600 
duotone effect in regular Adobe
Photoshop<00:06:37.390> so<00:06:38.380> first<00:06:39.070> we<00:06:39.160> want<00:06:39.310> to<00:06:39.340> click<00:06:39.490> the

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
Photoshop so first we want to click the

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.480 
Photoshop so first we want to click the
colorize<00:06:40.180> box<00:06:41.140> and<00:06:41.530> we'll<00:06:41.710> notice<00:06:42.040> that<00:06:42.070> it

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
colorize box and we'll notice that it

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.460 
colorize box and we'll notice that it
automatically<00:06:43.060> starts<00:06:43.300> applying<00:06:43.690> the<00:06:44.170> color

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
automatically starts applying the color

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.340 
automatically starts applying the color
to<00:06:44.920> our<00:06:45.070> line<00:06:45.340> art<00:06:45.610> and<00:06:45.850> for<00:06:46.510> hue<00:06:46.780> we<00:06:47.080> want<00:06:47.290> it

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
to our line art and for hue we want it

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.920 
to our line art and for hue we want it
to<00:06:47.440> be<00:06:47.560> 200<00:06:48.340> you<00:06:49.210> can<00:06:49.270> see<00:06:49.450> we<00:06:49.600> can<00:06:49.720> move<00:06:49.810> the

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
to be 200 you can see we can move the

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.110 
to be 200 you can see we can move the
slider<00:06:50.200> around<00:06:50.650> and<00:06:50.980> it<00:06:51.430> will<00:06:51.520> apply<00:06:51.760> all

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
slider around and it will apply all

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.600 
slider around and it will apply all
sorts<00:06:52.390> of<00:06:52.450> different<00:06:52.600> shades<00:06:53.250> to<00:06:54.250> our<00:06:54.370> line

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
sorts of different shades to our line

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.600 
sorts of different shades to our line
art<00:06:54.910> but<00:06:55.870> what<00:06:56.020> I<00:06:56.050> found<00:06:56.320> is<00:06:56.590> that<00:06:56.620> 200<00:06:57.430> works

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
art but what I found is that 200 works

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.400 
art but what I found is that 200 works
about<00:06:58.150> the<00:06:58.360> best<00:06:58.630> you're<00:06:58.870> going<00:06:58.990> to<00:06:59.050> get<00:06:59.260> to

00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.410 
about the best you're going to get to

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.860 
about the best you're going to get to
get<00:06:59.590> the<00:06:59.740> cyan<00:07:00.130> look<00:07:00.370> for<00:07:00.880> the<00:07:00.970> saturation<00:07:01.690> we

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
get the cyan look for the saturation we

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.570 
get the cyan look for the saturation we
want<00:07:02.110> to<00:07:02.200> go<00:07:02.290> all<00:07:02.530> the<00:07:02.980> way<00:07:03.010> over<00:07:03.130> to<00:07:03.460> the<00:07:03.550> right

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
want to go all the way over to the right

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.630 
want to go all the way over to the right
so<00:07:04.180> 100<00:07:04.900> for<00:07:05.050> the<00:07:05.110> saturation<00:07:05.590> and<00:07:05.920> then<00:07:06.550> we

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:06.640 
so 100 for the saturation and then we

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.890 
so 100 for the saturation and then we
want<00:07:06.790> to<00:07:06.880> lighten<00:07:07.210> it<00:07:07.300> a<00:07:07.360> little<00:07:07.510> bit<00:07:07.660> you<00:07:07.840> can

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
want to lighten it a little bit you can
