of plugs up in the front

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.250

so<00:03:26.160> polymer<00:03:26.609> plug<00:03:27.269> doesn't<00:03:27.930> quite<00:03:28.049> reach

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.460 
so polymer plug doesn't quite reach
across<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:28.920> they<00:03:29.010> must<00:03:29.160> be<00:03:29.280> using<00:03:29.489> this<00:03:29.730> same

the<00:03:47.280> only<00:03:47.430> issue<00:03:47.750> we<00:03:48.750> could<00:03:48.900> see<00:03:49.109> which<00:03:49.350> was

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
the only issue we could see which was

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.450 
the only issue we could see which was
kind<00:03:50.280> of

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
kind of

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.630

positive<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.270> negative<00:03:51.440> was<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.860> rear

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
positive and a negative was the rear

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.570 
positive and a negative was the rear

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
fact it's quite a positive that they

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.400 
fact it's quite a positive that they
went<00:04:01.830> with<00:04:02.100> an<00:04:02.280> actual<00:04:02.580> button<00:04:02.970> head<00:04:03.410> bolt

found actually to be quite weak we see

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.180 
found actually to be quite weak we see
those<00:04:14.100> brake<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.700> fair<00:04:15.060> bit<00:04:15.530> it's<00:04:16.530> just<00:04:16.800> not<00:04:16.980> as

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
those brake a fair bit it's just not as

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.380 
those brake a fair bit it's just not as
strong<00:04:17.489> as<00:04:17.520> the<00:04:18.390> one<00:04:18.750> piece<00:04:19.050> with<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.680> nut<00:04:20.390> so

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.120 
strong as the one piece with the nut so
what<00:04:21.600> we<00:04:21.720> saw<00:04:21.900> is<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:22.110> bit<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.860> drawback

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
what we saw is a bit of a drawback

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.710 
what we saw is a bit of a drawback
because<00:04:23.550> if<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:23.820> want<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:23.970> put<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.150> peg<00:04:24.360> on<00:04:24.540> this

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
because if you want to put a peg on this

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.210 
because if you want to put a peg on this
you<00:04:24.840> can<00:04:24.960> probably<00:04:25.050> gonna<00:04:25.290> need<00:04:25.470> about<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.800> 5

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
you can probably gonna need about a 5

you can probably gonna need about a 5
inch<00:04:26.670> bolt<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:28.260> accomplish<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:29.070> so<00:04:29.850> just

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
inch bolt to accomplish that so just

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.660 
inch bolt to accomplish that so just
just<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.570> be<00:04:30.600> aware<00:04:30.960> that<00:04:31.290> when<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:32.340> purchase

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.410 
just to be aware that when you purchase
this<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.650> your<00:04:34.650> rear<00:04:35.220> axle<00:04:35.640> bolt<00:04:35.790> will<00:04:36.270> need

this that your rear axle bolt will need

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.170 
this that your rear axle bolt will need

to be swapped out with a longer bolt in

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.170 
to be swapped out with a longer bolt in
