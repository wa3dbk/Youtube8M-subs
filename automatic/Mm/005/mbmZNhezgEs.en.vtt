00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.369
 with a police car a rudi states 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.439
 here in chip online so here I am 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.050
 show the paz mackler us this now 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.140
 can get done with a police car 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.820
 we are only with a police car 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.189
 that left at a location 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.260
 arrived where we can do that too 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.300
 By the way, again to tell me before 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.309
 two months noticed that with this 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.690
 price car not everything tip-true 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.460
 that means you can with these 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.500
 police car already do this earlier 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.140
 but it was found out about 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.780
 one week or four days ago 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.479
 that by the way, by the way, with this car 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.760
 with a keyboard shortcut a mini 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.890
 By the way, one can start one 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.360
 northwood 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.729
 that means we are now at this 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.129
 Great card has been where the locations 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.019
 how are going with natural gas now 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.119
 we then with the 2 front tire after 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.520
 would have to go up in the air then 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.830
 Hold analog stick forward 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.399
 the stick forward that's very important 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.679
 and then we would just have to l2 for that 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.450
 Press brake and pressed together 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.159
 hold and then we will see now 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.890
 what's happening now 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.859
 Now we press l2 and instinctively 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.859
 front and we are making a new idea and 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.789
 Of course you can still do that by the way 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.590
 let's say you can many more 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.600
 Doing different tricks means you 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.280
 if you can l2 and the left 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.560
 holds analog stick pressed forward 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.060
 Press gently to the left or to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.619
 but you still have to do that yourself 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.880
 give it a try because I thought so 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.890
 I'll just show you the now 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.929
 first class you and you can of course 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.359
 Show the second class that is 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.579
 you can turn with this car leuch 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.439
 left to right like to have iris 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.259
 I found out something again when 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.050
 Then her shows he then stops 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.610
 happen 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.670
 for example, we also have one 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.420
 location stays away with l2 and tina dogs 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.730
 Forward 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.860
 rolling forward very slowly and easily 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.080
 if you then put r2 together then 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.130
 the car dare stay if you are 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.780
 then by chance l2 and r2 go on then 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.370
 the car stays without the tires 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.470
 Just move my air 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.790
 but sometimes it is like that the car 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.170
 Goes down and sometimes in the air 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.220
 In this case it stays that way 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.470
 stopped as he already 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.510
 have seen it is a matter of practice 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.300
 try that out for yourself as well 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.480
 said to press forward l2 and ran 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.810
 had ramona are you live scared and 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.810
 bye for now 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.480
 color magic
