to<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.420> cap<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.319> front<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.710> cab<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.490> you

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
to the cap in front of the cab so you

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.879 
to the cap in front of the cab so you
can<00:01:26.759> take<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> legs<00:01:27.270> apart<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:28.319> can<00:01:28.469> separate

out<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> arms<00:01:45.829> same<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.979> both<00:01:47.159> sides<00:01:47.219> similar

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
out the arms same on both sides similar

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.199 
out the arms same on both sides similar
to<00:01:48.090> g1<00:01:48.509> or<00:01:48.539> my<00:01:48.749> other<00:01:48.929> models<00:01:49.439> okay<00:01:50.249> then<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
to g1 or my other models okay then you

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:52.160 
to g1 or my other models okay then you
have<00:01:51.270> some<00:01:51.539> poseability

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
have some poseability

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.469 
have some poseability
obviously<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.859> arms<00:01:53.219> you<00:01:54.060> want<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.270> fold

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
obviously in the arms you want to fold

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.969

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
down the girl back down that will become

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.260 
down the girl back down that will become
the<00:01:56.189> bee<00:01:56.850> gut<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.959> abdomen<00:01:58.380> area<00:01:59.119> then<00:02:00.119> you

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the bee gut or the abdomen area then you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.309 
the bee gut or the abdomen area then you
want<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.509> pull<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:02.100> head<00:02:02.310> over<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:04.170> want

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
to turn around

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.050 
to turn around
okay<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.780> there<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.259> go<00:02:10.670> again<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.850> guy's

okay so there you go again this guy's

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.080 
okay so there you go again this guy's
super<00:02:12.690> poseable<00:02:12.900> knee<00:02:13.590> joints<00:02:14.160> waist<00:02:14.520> joints

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
