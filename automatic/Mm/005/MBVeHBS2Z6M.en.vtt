00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
on in so see if we can do this these

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.300 
on in so see if we can do this these
door<00:01:20.610> setups<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.210> pretty<00:01:21.479> quick<00:01:21.840> oh<00:01:22.310> they

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
door setups are pretty quick oh they

door setups are pretty quick oh they
make<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> oh<00:01:24.439> if<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.590> finally<00:01:26.070> broke<00:01:26.189> everything

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
make it oh if I finally broke everything

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.960 
make it oh if I finally broke everything
so<00:01:27.299> they<00:01:27.420> go<00:01:27.600> pretty<00:01:27.750> quick<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.320> got<00:01:28.500> it

so they go pretty quick so you got it

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.249 
so they go pretty quick so you got it
third<00:01:29.970> time<00:01:30.210> see<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> third<00:01:31.049> time

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
third time see if we can do a third time

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.219 
third time see if we can do a third time
did<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.509> that's<00:01:33.509> kind<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.780> tricky<00:01:33.960> when

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
to figure out a better system for that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.609 
to figure out a better system for that
work<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.130> progress<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> here<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.470> is

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
work in progress so here we are this is

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.649 
work in progress so here we are this is
inside<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.490> says<00:01:41.700> welcome<00:01:41.970> would<00:01:42.329> take<00:01:42.479> what
