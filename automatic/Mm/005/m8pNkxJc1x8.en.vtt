been<00:00:12.530> following<00:00:12.589> video<00:00:13.219> snapshot<00:00:13.759> videos<00:00:14.059> you

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
been following video snapshot videos you

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.760 
been following video snapshot videos you
would<00:00:15.169> over<00:00:15.940> remember<00:00:16.940> d<00:00:17.290> pretty<00:00:18.290> much<00:00:18.470> the

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
would over remember d pretty much the

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.020 
would over remember d pretty much the
quietest<00:00:19.490> fastest<00:00:20.950> dropper<00:00:21.950> tower<00:00:22.160> in

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.030 
quietest fastest dropper tower in

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.570 
quietest fastest dropper tower in
existence<00:00:23.540> that<00:00:23.840> I<00:00:24.260> came<00:00:24.440> up<00:00:24.590> with<00:00:24.740> this<00:00:25.310> nice

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
existence that I came up with this nice

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.240 
existence that I came up with this nice
little<00:00:25.760> where<00:00:26.120> one<00:00:26.540> here<00:00:26.930> which<00:00:27.620> run<00:00:27.980> on

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
little where one here which run on

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.000 
little where one here which run on
policies<00:00:29.150> from<00:00:30.430> comparator<00:00:31.430> clocks<00:00:31.790> and<00:00:33.010> had

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
policies from comparator clocks and had

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.970 
policies from comparator clocks and had
the<00:00:34.219> two<00:00:34.399> hopper<00:00:34.969> feeds<00:00:35.239> so<00:00:36.080> that<00:00:36.410> they<00:00:36.650> keep

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
the two hopper feeds so that they keep

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.210 
the two hopper feeds so that they keep
up<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:37.280> speed<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.580> dropper<00:00:37.850> tower<00:00:39.100> that<00:00:40.100> was

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
up the speed the dropper tower that was

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.790 
up the speed the dropper tower that was
working<00:00:40.520> fine<00:00:40.760> a<00:00:41.120> didn't<00:00:41.840> break<00:00:42.079> like<00:00:42.440> a<00:00:42.470> lot

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
working fine a didn't break like a lot

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.220 
working fine a didn't break like a lot
of<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.730> other<00:00:43.910> ones<00:00:44.210> that<00:00:44.660> were<00:00:44.960> getting

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
of the other ones that were getting

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:53.090 
of the other ones that were getting
slowly<00:00:45.560> fixed<00:00:46.010> in<00:00:46.160> snapshots<00:00:48.160> but<00:00:49.160> then

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.540 

yep<00:00:54.050> as<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.829> no<00:00:56.129> longer<00:00:56.370> works

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.959 

it<00:01:00.940> was<00:01:01.090> basically<00:01:01.239> broken<00:01:02.489> about<00:01:03.489> one

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
it was basically broken about one

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.950 
it was basically broken about one
snapshot<00:01:04.360> before<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:04.960> pre-release<00:01:06.750> why<00:01:07.750> did

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
snapshot before the pre-release why did

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.580 
snapshot before the pre-release why did
this<00:01:08.050> happen<00:01:08.260> well<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.780> was<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.050> do<00:01:11.200> with

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
this happen well it was to do with

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.230 
this happen well it was to do with
pulses<00:01:12.280> now<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:15.100> little<00:01:15.369> arrangement<00:01:15.430> here

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
pulses now this little arrangement here

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.030 
pulses now this little arrangement here
used<00:01:16.840> to<00:01:17.020> have<00:01:17.340> red<00:01:18.340> stone<00:01:18.580> source<00:01:18.940> here<00:01:19.420> and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
used to have red stone source here and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.930 
used to have red stone source here and
because<00:01:21.040> it<00:01:21.159> is<00:01:21.190> running<00:01:21.400> a<00:01:21.520> little<00:01:21.610> clock

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
because it is running a little clock

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.350 
because it is running a little clock
around<00:01:22.180> here<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.860> would<00:01:24.040> set<00:01:24.220> off<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:25.479> now

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.970 

I<00:01:28.420> see<00:01:29.380> absolutely<00:01:29.590> no<00:01:30.340> response<00:01:31.860> what<00:01:32.860> about

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
I see absolutely no response what about

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.190 
I see absolutely no response what about
running<00:01:33.490> into<00:01:33.550> blocks<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.450> using<00:01:35.050> art<00:01:35.170> as

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
running into blocks and using art as

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.850 
running into blocks and using art as
part<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.190> one<00:01:37.470> no<00:01:38.470> response

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
part of it and that one no response

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.160 
part of it and that one no response
either<00:01:39.040> at<00:01:39.820> these<00:01:40.030> do<00:01:40.240> have<00:01:40.270> our<00:01:40.840> NAL's<00:01:40.990> their

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
either at these do have our NAL's their

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.570 
either at these do have our NAL's their
number<00:01:41.380> just<00:01:41.530> in<00:01:41.620> case<00:01:41.650> you<00:01:42.070> think<00:01:42.280> I'm<00:01:42.430> faking

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
number just in case you think I'm faking

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.620 
number just in case you think I'm faking
it<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:45.430> just<00:01:45.640> don't<00:01:45.820> respond<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.420> clocks

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
it they just don't respond to the clocks

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.170 
it they just don't respond to the clocks
anymore<00:01:47.080> what<00:01:47.560> if<00:01:47.680> we<00:01:47.830> make<00:01:48.010> it<00:01:48.250> as<00:01:48.400> part<00:01:49.090> of

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
anymore what if we make it as part of

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.950 
anymore what if we make it as part of
the<00:01:49.300> clock<00:01:49.479> perhaps<00:01:51.090> addict<00:01:52.090> see<00:01:52.270> absolutely

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
the clock perhaps addict see absolutely

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.290 
the clock perhaps addict see absolutely
no<00:01:53.170> response<00:01:53.530> till<00:01:54.960> now<00:01:55.960> over<00:01:56.470> here<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:58.030> was

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
no response till now over here this was

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.570 
no response till now over here this was
actually<00:01:58.479> what<00:01:59.080> was<00:01:59.260> running<00:01:59.650> the<00:01:59.890> dropper

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
actually what was running the dropper

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.780 
actually what was running the dropper
tower<00:02:00.790> over<00:02:01.090> there<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.479> clock<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:03.280> line<00:02:03.550> end

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
tower over there a clock and a line end

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.999 
tower over there a clock and a line end
supplying<00:02:04.330> power<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.250> put<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.700> on<00:02:07.619> HCA<00:02:08.619> will

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
supplying power so put that on HCA will

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.370 
supplying power so put that on HCA will
fire<00:02:09.280> an<00:02:09.489> arrow<00:02:09.640> as<00:02:11.130> it<00:02:12.130> is<00:02:12.220> providing<00:02:12.730> power

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
fire an arrow as it is providing power

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.430 
fire an arrow as it is providing power
however<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:15.370> pulsed<00:02:15.850> power<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.330> not<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:17.050> and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
however it's pulsed power is not on and

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.820 
however it's pulsed power is not on and
off<00:02:17.650> therefore<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.720> won't<00:02:20.050> file<00:02:20.290> until<00:02:20.680> the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
off therefore this won't file until the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.600 
off therefore this won't file until the
power<00:02:21.010> actually<00:02:21.340> goes<00:02:21.670> off<00:02:21.940> again<00:02:23.340> such

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.250 

however<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.850> morning<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.450> know<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.840> something

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
however this morning I know is something

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.300 
however this morning I know is something
a<00:02:29.320> little<00:02:29.530> bit<00:02:29.830> odd<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.510> notice<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.600> this<00:02:31.780> one

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
a little bit odd you notice it this one

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.340 
a little bit odd you notice it this one
exactly<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.459> same<00:02:33.700> except<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.330> has<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:34.900> one

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
exactly the same except it has just one

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.870 
exactly the same except it has just one
extra<00:02:35.650> length<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.400> redstone<00:02:38.549> obvious<00:02:39.549> a<00:02:39.700> full

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
extra length of redstone obvious a full

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.430 
extra length of redstone obvious a full
power<00:02:40.120> signal<00:02:40.570> so<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.810> shouldn't<00:02:41.140> really<00:02:41.200> do

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
power signal so I shouldn't really do

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:54.000 
power signal so I shouldn't really do
anything<00:02:50.459> yep<00:02:51.459> don't<00:02:51.790> ask<00:02:51.910> me<00:02:52.030> why<00:02:52.330> but<00:02:52.920> if<00:02:53.920> you

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
anything yep don't ask me why but if you

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.070 
anything yep don't ask me why but if you
extend<00:02:54.370> more<00:02:54.820> than<00:02:55.120> two<00:02:55.330> away<00:02:55.600> from<00:02:55.660> the

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
extend more than two away from the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.759 
extend more than two away from the
comparator<00:02:56.680> so<00:02:57.160> free<00:02:57.519> or<00:02:57.670> more<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:59.230> starts

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
comparator so free or more it starts

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.620 
comparator so free or more it starts
accepting<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.400> pulse<00:03:00.610> power<00:03:00.880> again<00:03:03.630> thanks

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
accepting the pulse power again thanks

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.259 
accepting the pulse power again thanks
to<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.930> I've<00:03:05.709> been<00:03:06.070> able<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.430> fix<00:03:06.730> the

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
to that I've been able to fix the

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.900 
to that I've been able to fix the
dropper<00:03:07.600> tower<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.980> it's<00:03:09.130> just<00:03:09.280> as<00:03:09.489> fast<00:03:09.700> as

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
dropper tower so it's just as fast as

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.210 
dropper tower so it's just as fast as
always<00:03:10.360> was<00:03:10.600> it's<00:03:11.320> actually<00:03:11.590> also<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.100> little

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
always was it's actually also a little

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.660 
always was it's actually also a little
bit<00:03:12.400> neater<00:03:12.580> as<00:03:12.850> well<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:15.040> just<00:03:15.310> have<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.519> look

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
bit neater as well you just have a look

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.160 
bit neater as well you just have a look
here<00:03:15.940> we've<00:03:16.209> got<00:03:16.269> ourselves<00:03:16.540> some<00:03:16.870> lovely

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
here we've got ourselves some lovely

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.900 
here we've got ourselves some lovely
diamonds<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:18.730> start<00:03:18.970> our<00:03:19.090> tow<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.420> up

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.430 

and<00:03:24.000> through<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.020> come<00:03:26.600> now<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.660> see<00:03:27.960> still

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
and through the come now you see still

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.870 
and through the come now you see still
running<00:03:28.680> off<00:03:28.860> policies<00:03:31.520> so<00:03:32.520> let<00:03:32.670> me<00:03:32.730> just

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
running off policies so let me just

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.910 
running off policies so let me just
quickly<00:03:33.000> run<00:03:33.240> through<00:03:33.420> how<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.320> actually<00:03:34.800> make

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
quickly run through how to actually make

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.330 
quickly run through how to actually make
this<00:03:35.370> with<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:38.210> there<00:03:39.210> we<00:03:39.270> go<00:03:39.390> now<00:03:39.660> stop<00:03:40.340> so

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
this with you there we go now stop so

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.910 
this with you there we go now stop so
same<00:03:41.880> as<00:03:42.000> before<00:03:42.390> we've<00:03:42.720> got<00:03:43.020> two<00:03:43.320> lines<00:03:43.590> of

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
same as before we've got two lines of

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.850 
same as before we've got two lines of
hoppers<00:03:44.460> one<00:03:44.940> running<00:03:45.300> into<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.110> front<00:03:46.710> of

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
hoppers one running into the front of

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.370 
hoppers one running into the front of
that<00:03:46.950> proper<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.910> another<00:03:48.690> set<00:03:48.930> running<00:03:49.080> into

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
that proper and another set running into

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.290 
that proper and another set running into
the<00:03:49.500> side<00:03:51.440> now<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:53.730> works<00:03:53.970> on<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.150> principle

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
the side now this works on the principle

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.160 
the side now this works on the principle
of<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:55.170> comparator<00:03:55.470> here<00:03:55.830> detects<00:03:56.220> blocks

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
of the comparator here detects blocks

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.980 
of the comparator here detects blocks
were<00:03:58.170> items<00:03:58.410> inside<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.100> block<00:03:59.660> and<00:04:00.660> hope<00:04:00.810> it

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
were items inside this block and hope it

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.810 
were items inside this block and hope it
runs<00:04:01.140> around<00:04:01.350> here<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:03.920> repeaters<00:04:04.920> must<00:04:05.550> be

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
runs around here the repeaters must be

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.820 
runs around here the repeaters must be
set<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.480> two<00:04:06.810> techs<00:04:07.670> that's<00:04:08.670> just<00:04:09.830> without

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
set to two techs that's just without

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
that in this particular design you have

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.160 
that in this particular design you have
trouble<00:04:13.620> with<00:04:13.830> large<00:04:14.010> amount<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.400> items<00:04:15.109> on<00:04:16.109> a

item in tikrit stop the multiple items
goes<00:04:20.730> a<00:04:20.760> bit<00:04:20.910> funny<00:04:21.120> which<00:04:21.390> is<00:04:21.540> actually<00:04:21.750> the

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
goes a bit funny which is actually the

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.470 
goes a bit funny which is actually the
opposite<00:04:22.530> of<00:04:22.710> how<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.100> used<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.370> be<00:04:23.520> where<00:04:24.360> the

opposite of how it used to be where the

we have just a couple of threads on
running<00:04:34.350> out<00:04:34.470> door<00:04:34.590> so<00:04:34.710> we<00:04:34.800> can<00:04:34.830> extend<00:04:35.190> a

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
running out door so we can extend a

signal slightly and here we have our

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.570

actually be powering this block fully

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.400 
actually be powering this block fully
and<00:05:19.910> we'll<00:05:20.910> stop<00:05:21.360> these<00:05:21.630> from<00:05:21.960> putting<00:05:22.169> items
