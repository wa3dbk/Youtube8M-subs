00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.790 
questions using the compensation
strategy<00:00:21.600> we<00:00:21.750> have<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.080> understand<00:00:22.590> what<00:00:22.769> a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
strategy we have to understand what a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.189 
strategy we have to understand what a
friendly<00:00:23.250> number<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.760> if<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.779> look<00:00:24.930> at<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
friendly number is if we look at the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.490 
friendly number is if we look at the

of paper if we look at the numbers from

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.580 
of paper if we look at the numbers from
our<00:00:45.840> question<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.610> ask<00:00:47.730> ourselves

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
our question we have to ask ourselves

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.740 
our question we have to ask ourselves
which<00:00:49.590> one<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.890> these<00:00:50.129> numbers<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.820> close<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
which one of these numbers is close to a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.549 
which one of these numbers is close to a
friendly<00:00:52.199> number<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:53.420> we<00:00:54.420> put<00:00:54.629> 43<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
friendly number if we put 43 on the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.979 
friendly number if we put 43 on the
number<00:00:55.860> line<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.760> find<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.660> in

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
number line we find that it is in

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.990 
number line we find that it is in
between<00:00:58.199> 40<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.129> 45<00:00:59.670> if<00:01:00.680> we<00:01:01.680> put<00:01:01.890> 59<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.850> our

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
between 40 and 45 if we put 59 on our

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.320 
between 40 and 45 if we put 59 on our
number<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.449> number<00:01:04.199> line<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:05.280> notice<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.180> it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
number not number line we notice that it

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.289 
number not number line we notice that it
is<00:01:06.360> very<00:01:06.570> close<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> 60

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
is very close to 60

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.770 
is very close to 60
therefore<00:01:09.530> 59<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.950> number<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.540> use

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
therefore 59 is a number that we can use

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.679 
therefore 59 is a number that we can use
to<00:01:13.170> compensate<00:01:13.860> because<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.640> very<00:01:14.909> close<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
to compensate because it's very close to

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.440 
to compensate because it's very close to
a<00:01:16.049> fredley<00:01:16.530> number<00:01:19.970> when<00:01:20.970> using<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
a fredley number when using the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.320 
a fredley number when using the
compensation<00:01:22.229> strategy<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:23.700> what<00:01:24.150> we're

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
compensation strategy we what we're

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.510 
compensation strategy we what we're
doing<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.780> borrowing<00:01:25.110> from<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.740> number<00:01:26.100> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
doing is borrowing from one number to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.340 
doing is borrowing from one number to
turn<00:01:26.729> another<00:01:27.060> number<00:01:27.509> into<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.869> friendly

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
turn another number into a friendly

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.450 
turn another number into a friendly
number<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.850> case<00:01:29.909> looking<00:01:30.630> at<00:01:30.810> 43<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.770> 59

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
number in this case looking at 43 and 59

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.149 
number in this case looking at 43 and 59
we<00:01:32.909> know<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.299> 59<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.140> close<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> friendly

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
we know that 59 is close to the friendly

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.240 
we know that 59 is close to the friendly
number<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.670> 60<00:01:36.560> we<00:01:37.560> need<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.890> ask<00:01:38.009> ourselves

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
number of 60 we need to ask ourselves

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.569 
number of 60 we need to ask ourselves
what<00:01:38.880> do<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.180> need<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.570> add<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:40.170> 59<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.189> order<00:01:41.460> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
what do I need to add to 59 in order to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.149 
what do I need to add to 59 in order to
get<00:01:41.759> 60<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:43.320> answer<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:45.439> but<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.619> one

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
get 60 the answer is one but that one

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.789 
get 60 the answer is one but that one
needs<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.729> come<00:01:47.939> from<00:01:48.149> somewhere<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:49.439> need<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
needs to come from somewhere we need to

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.149 
needs to come from somewhere we need to
take<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.340> from<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.939> 43<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.930> order<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> add<00:01:52.860> it

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
take it from the 43 in order to add it

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.209 
take it from the 43 in order to add it
to<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> 59<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.310> add<00:01:56.490> 1<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.119> 59<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.380> becomes

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
to the 59 so if I add 1 to 59 it becomes

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.350 
to the 59 so if I add 1 to 59 it becomes
60<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> got<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.259> from<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.530> 43<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.210> have

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
60 but I got that from the 43 so we have

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.830 
60 but I got that from the 43 so we have
to<00:02:03.509> take<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:04.049> away<00:02:04.229> from<00:02:04.829> 43<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.540> gives

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
to take one away from 43 and that gives

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.599 
to take one away from 43 and that gives
us<00:02:07.020> 42

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.609 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.660 

forty-two<00:02:13.609> plus<00:02:13.879> 60<00:02:14.569> is<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.650> same<00:02:15.950> question

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
forty-two plus 60 is the same question

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.009 
forty-two plus 60 is the same question
as<00:02:16.849> 43<00:02:17.750> plus<00:02:18.049> 59<00:02:22.239> now<00:02:23.239> when<00:02:23.450> we<00:02:23.540> look<00:02:23.719> at<00:02:23.840> this

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
as 43 plus 59 now when we look at this

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.110

strategy can be used for both problems

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:40.460 
strategy can be used for both problems
it<00:06:37.919> is<00:06:38.070> a<00:06:38.099> much<00:06:38.460> better<00:06:38.789> solution<00:06:39.210> to<00:06:40.139> use<00:06:40.289> the

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
it is a much better solution to use the

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.500 
it is a much better solution to use the
compensation<00:06:41.220> strategy<00:06:41.729> for<00:06:41.970> a<00:06:42.000> question

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
such as 49 plus 33 because 49 is so

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.510 
such as 49 plus 33 because 49 is so
close<00:06:46.770> to<00:06:46.979> the<00:06:47.099> friendly<00:06:47.490> number<00:06:47.820> of<00:06:47.970> 50
