okay<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.750> meantime<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.200> attack<00:00:37.469> being

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
okay and meantime this attack being

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.619 
okay and meantime this attack being
pushed<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.100> mind<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.520> kicking<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.329> attack

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
pushed in mind is kicking that attack

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.729 
pushed in mind is kicking that attack
out<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.590> mind<00:00:40.800> space<00:00:41.480> in<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> meantime<00:00:42.750> man<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
out of mind space in the meantime man I

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.049 
out of mind space in the meantime man I
switch<00:00:43.980> colors<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.460> me<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:44.850> hard<00:00:45.000> to

switch colors on me so it's hard to

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.639 
switch colors on me so it's hard to

many<00:00:58.829> SCV's<00:00:59.309> were<00:00:59.460> killed<00:00:59.699> there<00:00:59.789> because<00:00:59.969> it

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
many SCV's were killed there because it

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.369 
many SCV's were killed there because it

really had that kind of disruptive view

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.830 
really had that kind of disruptive view
but<00:01:01.530> Wayson<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.309> those<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:03.030> siege<00:01:03.239> tanks

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
but Wayson with those for siege tanks

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.440 
but Wayson with those for siege tanks
managed<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.350> fight<00:01:04.619> off<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.580> that

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
managed to fight off that that that

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.539 
managed to fight off that that that
dropship<00:01:06.960> grouping<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> meantime<00:01:08.340> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
dropship grouping in the meantime is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.800 
dropship grouping in the meantime is
going<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> take<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:08.970> engineering<00:01:09.450> Bay<00:01:09.600> down

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
going to take that engineering Bay down

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.240 
going to take that engineering Bay down
so<00:01:10.049> he's<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.650> spot<00:01:11.070> he's

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
so he's not going to have that spot he's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.440 
so he's not going to have that spot he's
not<00:01:11.400> gonna<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.580> able<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.790> build<00:01:11.939> turrets<00:01:12.240> for

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
not gonna be able to build turrets for

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.120 
not gonna be able to build turrets for
time<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.619> really<00:01:13.830> going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
time and that's really going to be a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.770 
time and that's really going to be a
definitely<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.030> significant<00:01:15.540> advantage

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
definitely a significant advantage

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.850 
definitely a significant advantage
because<00:01:15.960> he's<00:01:16.110> not<00:01:16.259> gonna<00:01:16.350> be<00:01:16.470> able<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> stop

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
because he's not gonna be able to stop

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.920 
because he's not gonna be able to stop
these<00:01:17.040> drop<00:01:17.280> ships<00:01:17.490> coming<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.820> man<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.810> looks

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
these drop ships coming in man it looks

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.270 
these drop ships coming in man it looks
like<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.110> took<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.380> all<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.590> SUV's<00:01:20.009> at<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
like you took out all the SUV's at the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.429 
like you took out all the SUV's at the
location<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.090> puts<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.439> significant

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
location really that puts a significant

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.260 
location really that puts a significant
advantage<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.920> wasting<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.580> that

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
advantage for wasting because that that

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.420 
advantage for wasting because that that
is<00:01:24.420> one<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.720> few<00:01:25.409> expansions<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:25.979> was<00:01:26.220> at

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
is one of the few expansions that was at

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.569 
is one of the few expansions that was at
full<00:01:26.729> production<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.470> really<00:01:28.470> had<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> lot<00:01:29.430> of

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
full production and really had a lot of

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.120 
full production and really had a lot of
new<00:01:30.150> minerals<00:01:30.659> at<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.020> mine<00:01:31.650> really<00:01:31.920> has<00:01:32.100> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
new minerals at it mine really has to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.620 
new minerals at it mine really has to
take<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.490> forces<00:01:32.820> taking<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.150> back<00:01:33.329> which<00:01:33.509> is

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
take a forces taking that back which is

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.539 
take a forces taking that back which is
what<00:01:33.900> she's<00:01:34.020> doing<00:01:34.229> now<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:35.009> ways<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.369> manage

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
what she's doing now but ways to manage

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.359

01<00:02:57.609> vs<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:59.040> my<00:03:00.040> mind<00:03:00.370> has<00:03:00.549> an<00:03:00.730> upgraded<00:03:01.180> armor

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
01 vs a my mind has an upgraded armor

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.479 
01 vs a my mind has an upgraded armor
but<00:03:01.720> he<00:03:01.810> has<00:03:01.959> upgraded<00:03:02.230> no<00:03:02.980> actually<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.340> looks

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
but he has upgraded no actually it looks

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.940 
but he has upgraded no actually it looks
like<00:03:03.609> it's<00:03:03.989> 00<00:03:04.989> as<00:03:05.140> well<00:03:05.290> it's<00:03:05.470> really<00:03:05.680> hard<00:03:05.859> to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
like it's 00 as well it's really hard to

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.220 
like it's 00 as well it's really hard to
tell<00:03:06.129> on<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:06.549> vid<00:03:07.079> but<00:03:08.079> in<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.200> meantime

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
tell on this vid but in the meantime

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.110 
tell on this vid but in the meantime
yeah<00:03:08.620> Wayson<00:03:09.040> has<00:03:09.190> significant<00:03:09.670> forces<00:03:09.879> he

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
yeah Wayson has significant forces he

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.240 
yeah Wayson has significant forces he
has<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.349> significant<00:03:11.349> res<00:03:11.500> advantage<00:03:11.920> he<00:03:12.069> has<00:03:12.220> a

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
has a significant res advantage he has a

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.280 
has a significant res advantage he has a
lot<00:03:12.549> of<00:03:12.579> drop<00:03:12.879> ships<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.389> really<00:03:13.690> he<00:03:13.959> can<00:03:14.139> just

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
lot of drop ships and really he can just

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.099 
lot of drop ships and really he can just
take<00:03:14.470> his<00:03:14.590> time<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:15.389> attack<00:03:16.389> now<00:03:16.630> he's<00:03:16.870> got

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
take his time and attack now he's got

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.599 
take his time and attack now he's got
those<00:03:17.290> two<00:03:17.530> armies<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:17.859> pretty<00:03:18.310> soon<00:03:18.430> he's

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
those two armies and pretty soon he's

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:19.740 
those two armies and pretty soon he's
going<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.819> have<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.150> double<00:03:19.450> upgrade

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
going to have that double upgrade

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.809 
going to have that double upgrade
advantage<00:03:20.169> would<00:03:20.620> be<00:03:20.769> my<00:03:20.919> guess<00:03:21.130> yeah<00:03:21.609> looks

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
advantage would be my guess yeah looks

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.120 
advantage would be my guess yeah looks
like<00:03:21.880> 01<00:03:22.419> vs<00:03:22.780> 11<00:03:23.109> as<00:03:23.410> far<00:03:23.560> as<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.769> upgrades

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
like 01 vs 11 as far as the upgrades

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.159 
like 01 vs 11 as far as the upgrades
which<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.849> is<00:03:25.030> very<00:03:25.359> important<00:03:25.840> in<00:03:26.019> these

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
which that is very important in these

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.620 
which that is very important in these
sort<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.470> matches<00:03:26.680> have<00:03:27.310> seen<00:03:27.639> taking<00:03:28.510> that

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
sort of matches have seen taking that

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.240 
sort of matches have seen taking that
that<00:03:28.959> single<00:03:29.200> attack<00:03:29.500> did<00:03:29.680> not<00:03:29.799> take<00:03:29.980> out<00:03:30.130> the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
that single attack did not take out the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.949 
that single attack did not take out the
Goliath<00:03:30.639> even<00:03:31.389> though<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.599> was<00:03:31.750> slightly

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
Goliath even though it was slightly

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.050 
Goliath even though it was slightly
damaged<00:03:32.380> mind<00:03:33.250> in<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.459> meantime<00:03:33.579> bringing<00:03:34.000> up

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
damaged mind in the meantime bringing up

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.190 
damaged mind in the meantime bringing up
some<00:03:34.209> dropships<00:03:34.569> going<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.810> try<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:34.959> fight

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
some dropships going to try to fight

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.809 
some dropships going to try to fight
this<00:03:35.349> off<00:03:35.560> here<00:03:35.799> he's<00:03:35.889> but<00:03:36.549> I<00:03:36.579> don't<00:03:36.760> think

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
this off here he's but I don't think

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.069 
this off here he's but I don't think
he's<00:03:36.970> going<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.120> be<00:03:37.209> very<00:03:37.419> successful<00:03:37.569> he's

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
he's going to be very successful he's

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.659 
he's going to be very successful he's
really<00:03:38.319> losing<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.709> res<00:03:38.859> battle<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.370> as<00:03:39.639> a

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
really losing the res battle and as a

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.099 
really losing the res battle and as a
result<00:03:39.880> losing<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.389> production<00:03:40.750> battle<00:03:40.989> at

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
result losing the production battle at

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.990 
result losing the production battle at
this<00:03:41.290> point<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:42.250> meantime<00:03:42.459> mind<00:03:42.700> did<00:03:42.849> a<00:03:42.910> good

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
this point the meantime mind did a good

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.569 
this point the meantime mind did a good
job<00:03:43.060> pulling<00:03:43.450> up<00:03:43.859> stopping<00:03:44.859> that<00:03:45.069> 12th<00:03:45.400> at

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
job pulling up stopping that 12th at

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.339 
job pulling up stopping that 12th at
twelve<00:03:46.120> o'clock<00:03:46.359> expansion<00:03:46.810> from<00:03:46.959> going<00:03:47.230> up

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
twelve o'clock expansion from going up

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.319 
twelve o'clock expansion from going up
but<00:03:47.530> i<00:03:47.709> think<00:03:48.280> that<00:03:48.310> six<00:03:48.579> o'clock<00:03:48.819> expansion

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
but i think that six o'clock expansion

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.379 
but i think that six o'clock expansion
is<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.780> hastens<00:03:50.790> isn't<00:03:51.790> ways<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.090> ways<00:03:52.209> and

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
is and hastens isn't ways and ways and

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:53.729 
is and hastens isn't ways and ways and
doing<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.569> good<00:03:52.690> job<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:52.989> pincer<00:03:53.290> attack<00:03:53.319> on

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
doing a good job of a pincer attack on

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.710 
doing a good job of a pincer attack on
mind<00:03:54.069> at<00:03:54.280> this<00:03:54.430> point<00:03:54.700> it's<00:03:55.389> going<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.569> take

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
mind at this point it's going to take

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.990 
mind at this point it's going to take
out<00:03:55.870> all<00:03:56.019> these<00:03:56.139> forces<00:03:56.579> is<00:03:57.579> going<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.819> keep

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
out all these forces is going to keep

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.849 
out all these forces is going to keep
mine<00:03:58.239> from<00:03:58.510> being<00:03:58.750> able<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.019> build<00:03:59.230> right

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
mine from being able to build right

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.860 
mine from being able to build right
there<00:04:00.069> get<00:04:00.340> any<00:04:00.579> res<00:04:00.760> up<00:04:00.940> he's<00:04:01.569> just<00:04:01.629> going<00:04:01.780> to

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
there get any res up he's just going to

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.970 
there get any res up he's just going to
come<00:04:02.049> and<00:04:02.139> he's<00:04:02.260> going<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.440> take<00:04:02.590> this<00:04:02.769> out<00:04:02.950> and

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
come and he's going to take this out and

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.099 
come and he's going to take this out and
i<00:04:03.220> think<00:04:03.459> this<00:04:03.669> is<00:04:03.790> once<00:04:04.239> all<00:04:04.389> these<00:04:04.510> SUVs<00:04:04.660> dies

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
i think this is once all these SUVs dies

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.080 
i think this is once all these SUVs dies
that's<00:04:05.290> going<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.560> be<00:04:05.650> GG<00:04:05.889> for<00:04:06.190> mine<00:04:06.370> because<00:04:07.060> I

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
that's going to be GG for mine because I

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.449 
that's going to be GG for mine because I
really<00:04:07.510> mind<00:04:07.720> lost<00:04:08.019> all<00:04:08.260> his<00:04:08.410> at<00:04:08.919> the<00:04:09.129> Los

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
really mind lost all his at the Los

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.580 
really mind lost all his at the Los
basically<00:04:10.180> already<00:04:10.480> what<00:04:10.900> three<00:04:11.230> sets<00:04:11.470> of

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
basically already what three sets of

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.849 
basically already what three sets of
SUVs<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.970> command<00:04:13.299> centers<00:04:13.629> and<00:04:13.829> has<00:04:14.829> a

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
SUVs to command centers and has a

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.020 
SUVs to command centers and has a
burning<00:04:15.250> command<00:04:15.489> center<00:04:15.699> floating

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
burning command center floating

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.149 
burning command center floating
somewhere<00:04:16.209> really<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.709> going<00:04:17.829> to<00:04:17.890> be<00:04:18.039> the

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.159 
somewhere really this is going to be the

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.099 
somewhere really this is going to be the
decisive<00:04:18.459> final<00:04:18.909> blow<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.060> think<00:04:19.209> for<00:04:19.659> ways<00:04:19.900> and

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
decisive final blow I think for ways and

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.360 
decisive final blow I think for ways and
he's<00:04:20.229> already<00:04:20.440> in<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.620> commanding<00:04:20.919> position

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
he's already in a commanding position

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.460 
he's already in a commanding position

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
is just going to seal it going to take

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.260 
is just going to seal it going to take

down that engineering Bay nothing

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.300 
down that engineering Bay nothing
nothing<00:04:25.570> happening<00:04:26.080> for<00:04:26.350> mine<00:04:26.530> mine<00:04:26.800> had<00:04:27.070> some

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
nothing happening for mine mine had some

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.710 
nothing happening for mine mine had some
forces<00:04:27.639> he's<00:04:27.760> putting<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:28.150> those<00:04:28.479> dropships

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
forces he's putting in those dropships

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.090 
forces he's putting in those dropships
but<00:04:29.050> really<00:04:29.229> I<00:04:29.260> feel<00:04:29.320> like<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.650> games<00:04:29.860> already

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
but really I feel like the games already

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.550 
but really I feel like the games already
over<00:04:30.460> looks<00:04:31.449> like<00:04:31.570> he<00:04:31.660> has<00:04:31.780> some<00:04:31.990> some<00:04:32.350> glass

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
over looks like he has some some glass

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.439 
over looks like he has some some glass
he's<00:04:32.770> going<00:04:32.919> to<00:04:32.979> try<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:33.190> push<00:04:33.460> in<00:04:33.639> but<00:04:33.970> spotted

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
he's going to try to push in but spotted

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:35.700 
he's going to try to push in but spotted
out<00:04:34.540> by<00:04:34.690> wasting<00:04:35.050> he's<00:04:35.199> gonna<00:04:35.290> go<00:04:35.470> for<00:04:35.650> an

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
out by wasting he's gonna go for an

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.219 
out by wasting he's gonna go for an
attack<00:04:35.919> on<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.220> main<00:04:36.340> try<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.580> reduce<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.229> the

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
attack on the main try to reduce the the

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:39.570 
attack on the main try to reduce the the
rez<00:04:38.380> advantage<00:04:38.740> but<00:04:38.889> looks<00:04:39.070> like<00:04:39.130> Wayson

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
rez advantage but looks like Wayson

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.430 
rez advantage but looks like Wayson
already<00:04:40.060> has<00:04:40.180> any<00:04:40.389> position<00:04:40.660> place<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.080> again

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
already has any position place and again

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.020 
already has any position place and again
doing<00:04:41.590> another<00:04:41.889> tack<00:04:42.130> on<00:04:42.340> those<00:04:42.669> resources

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
doing another tack on those resources

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.840 
doing another tack on those resources
gonna<00:04:43.479> take<00:04:43.720> out<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:43.960> command<00:04:44.260> center<00:04:44.560> I

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
gonna take out that command center I

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.890 
gonna take out that command center I
don't<00:04:45.850> see<00:04:45.970> mine<00:04:46.120> coming<00:04:46.330> back<00:04:46.570> from<00:04:46.720> this

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
don't see mine coming back from this

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.650 
don't see mine coming back from this
mine<00:04:47.800> was<00:04:47.979> again<00:04:48.550> he<00:04:48.820> had<00:04:49.000> that<00:04:49.180> disadvantage

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
mine was again he had that disadvantage

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.210 
mine was again he had that disadvantage
he<00:04:49.780> didn't<00:04:50.050> have<00:04:50.199> the<00:04:50.380> rez<00:04:50.560> he<00:04:50.800> does<00:04:50.979> have<00:04:51.190> a

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
he didn't have the rez he does have a

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.219 
he didn't have the rez he does have a
few<00:04:51.580> minutes<00:04:51.790> out<00:04:52.030> in<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.180> field<00:04:52.419> but<00:04:53.050> just

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
few minutes out in the field but just

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.260 
few minutes out in the field but just
the<00:04:53.320> production<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:54.070> kind<00:04:54.669> of<00:04:54.760> that<00:04:54.910> he's<00:04:55.120> got

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
the production and kind of that he's got

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.760 
the production and kind of that he's got
that<00:04:55.360> again<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:55.810> slight<00:04:56.050> upgrade<00:04:56.260> advantage

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
that again that slight upgrade advantage

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.100 
that again that slight upgrade advantage
soon<00:04:56.979> as<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.250> level<00:04:57.669> 2<00:04:57.850> kicks<00:04:58.600> in<00:04:58.750> on<00:04:58.900> either

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
soon as the level 2 kicks in on either

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.770 
soon as the level 2 kicks in on either
of<00:04:59.350> those<00:04:59.850> it's<00:05:00.850> going<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.060> be<00:05:01.150> overwhelming

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
of those it's going to be overwhelming

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.719 
of those it's going to be overwhelming
it<00:05:02.199> already<00:05:02.410> is<00:05:02.500> overwhelming<00:05:03.220> in<00:05:03.340> my<00:05:03.490> opinion

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
it already is overwhelming in my opinion

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.610 
it already is overwhelming in my opinion
going<00:05:04.389> for<00:05:04.570> cheaper<00:05:04.870> units<00:05:05.169> going<00:05:05.320> for<00:05:05.560> the

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
going for cheaper units going for the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.960 
going for cheaper units going for the
vultures<00:05:05.800> now<00:05:06.070> but<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.310> vultures<00:05:06.610> as<00:05:06.729> you<00:05:06.850> can

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
vultures now but the vultures as you can

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.400 
vultures now but the vultures as you can
see<00:05:07.090> aren't<00:05:07.360> speed<00:05:07.539> upgraded<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:08.020> don't<00:05:08.229> think

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
see aren't speed upgraded I don't think

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.230 
see aren't speed upgraded I don't think
they<00:05:08.500> have<00:05:08.620> minds<00:05:08.860> but<00:05:09.580> that<00:05:09.760> really<00:05:09.910> that's

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
they have minds but that really that's

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.879 
they have minds but that really that's
all<00:05:10.479> that<00:05:10.810> he<00:05:10.930> can<00:05:11.020> afford<00:05:11.320> he<00:05:11.470> doesn't<00:05:11.770> have

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
all that he can afford he doesn't have

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.129 
all that he can afford he doesn't have
gas<00:05:12.100> production<00:05:12.460> up<00:05:12.760> he<00:05:12.910> doesn't<00:05:13.210> have<00:05:13.389> again

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
gas production up he doesn't have again

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.629 
gas production up he doesn't have again
a<00:05:14.169> lot<00:05:14.380> of<00:05:14.530> production<00:05:14.860> elsewise<00:05:15.190> so<00:05:15.370> he's<00:05:15.490> got

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
a lot of production elsewise so he's got

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:16.890 
a lot of production elsewise so he's got
to<00:05:15.729> go<00:05:15.789> for<00:05:15.940> the<00:05:16.030> cheaper<00:05:16.270> units<00:05:16.570> to<00:05:16.690> try<00:05:16.840> to

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
to go for the cheaper units to try to

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.870 
to go for the cheaper units to try to
hold<00:05:17.080> Wayson<00:05:17.500> off<00:05:17.620> he's<00:05:18.370> taking<00:05:18.580> up<00:05:18.820> his

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
hold Wayson off he's taking up his

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.210 
hold Wayson off he's taking up his
forces<00:05:19.270> going<00:05:19.630> for<00:05:19.810> that<00:05:20.039> upper<00:05:21.039> left

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
forces going for that upper left

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.320 
forces going for that upper left
expansion<00:05:21.639> but<00:05:21.699> really<00:05:21.940> that's<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.300> don't

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
expansion but really that's I don't

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.760 
expansion but really that's I don't
think<00:05:22.479> that's<00:05:22.630> what's<00:05:22.990> producing<00:05:23.470> for<00:05:23.590> Hawaii

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
think that's what's producing for Hawaii

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.250 
think that's what's producing for Hawaii
at<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.220> moment<00:05:24.750> doing<00:05:25.750> good<00:05:25.840> job<00:05:26.020> with<00:05:26.169> those

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
at the moment doing good job with those

at the moment doing good job with those
vultures<00:05:26.500> taking<00:05:26.919> finally<00:05:27.280> taking<00:05:27.550> up<00:05:27.700> taking

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
vultures taking finally taking up taking

vultures taking finally taking up taking
out<00:05:28.690> those<00:05:28.870> units<00:05:29.530> at<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.800> upper<00:05:30.099> position

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
out those units at the upper position

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.750 
out those units at the upper position
but<00:05:31.180> again<00:05:31.270> going<00:05:31.630> for<00:05:31.720> vultures<00:05:32.080> instead

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
but again going for vultures instead

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.760

that's Gigi mind realizing that yeah he

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.170 
that's Gigi mind realizing that yeah he

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
just can't catch up economically you

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.580 
just can't catch up economically you
can't<00:05:37.450> catch<00:05:37.750> up<00:05:37.930> with<00:05:38.080> his<00:05:38.169> production

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
can't catch up with his production

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.070 
can't catch up with his production
