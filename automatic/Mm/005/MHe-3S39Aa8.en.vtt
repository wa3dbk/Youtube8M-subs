have you put a lot of effort into it up

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.969 
have you put a lot of effort into it up
until<00:01:26.939> now<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.470> people<00:01:28.740> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
until now that's not really at people I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.469 
until now that's not really at people I
sold<00:01:29.340> pretty<00:01:29.850> much<00:01:29.970> by<00:01:30.119> word<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.420> mouth

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
sold pretty much by word of mouth

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.450 
sold pretty much by word of mouth
because<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.350> haven't<00:01:31.890> advertised<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
because I haven't advertised and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.800 
because I haven't advertised and
marketed<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.000> did<00:01:33.150> 20<00:01:33.479> million<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.750> the

marketed and I did 20 million in the
last<00:01:33.869> four<00:01:34.110> years<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.939> think<00:01:36.060> there'll<00:01:36.329> be

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
last four years so I think there'll be

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.670 
last four years so I think there'll be
so<00:01:36.570> far<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.560> local

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
so far and this is just in the local

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.649 
so far and this is just in the local
market<00:01:38.070> no<00:01:38.670> I'm<00:01:39.030> actually<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.420> worldwide

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
