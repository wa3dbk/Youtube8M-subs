00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.740

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.450
 party and the magic piñatas just 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.180
 they thought about the potter who had 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.610

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.130

 in the yard with hay 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.550
 and Japanese paper lanterns look for 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.880

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.860
 broom to break the piñatas and also 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.950
 the baskets full of confetti that 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.950
 distributed with aguinaldo 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.530
 in the afternoon the 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.959
 family guests with parents and 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.769
 neighbors with many children together prayed 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.780
 the rosary and then they sang the litany 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.240
 one inside the house and another outside in 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.040
 procession and with the pilgrims carrying 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.670
 until they heard behind the door 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.170
 among saint pilgrims pilgrims 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:56.260
 receive this corner not from my poor 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.660
 abode but from my heart they opened 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.890
 the doors blew the whistles 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.050
 they put out the candles ended the devotion and 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.300
 started to go fun burned 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.340
 rockets served very flights and strikeouts 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.740
 hot for the old ladies who do not 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.520
 they have teeth all the joy 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.520
 when girls 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.810
 they started a piñata they were more 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.630
 fun came the daddy took the watermelon 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.220
 between the children's uproar and the 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.990
 hung with more straight in the middle of the yard 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.180
 the magic piñata was swinging 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.250
 softly dreaming that they had feet and 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.070
 danceable and danced in the flirtatious air 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.140
 they say to themselves 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.690
 Suddenly a group of children began to 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.380
 sing any offer or want money 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.720
 What I want is to break the piñata 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.120
 it breaks I think the watermelon did not give 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.220
 too much time because a pretty girl already 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.830
 his eyes were blindfolded with a bandana 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.080
 and a stick in his hands to hit the 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.270
 piñata thought he could get away but 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.810
 everything was in vain with a blow and another more 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.950
 the watermelon fell to the ground in pieces 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.420
 I discovered in two or three hours fruits and 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.740
 candy that the kids are 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.740
 they cheerfully snatched 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.990
 then the dad hung the second piñata 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.540
 It was the nice turkey that does not 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.800
 was missing nothing had his corals his 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:23.449
 monkeys steel broom on the breast 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.449
 the guests shouted enthusiastically 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.699
 the low note that I already knew the luck that 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.190
 I was waiting for you I take advantage of the milestones of 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:33.160
 reata to show off your hills and enjoy 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.850
 I understand I feel that finally I can 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.410
 talk while everyone was singing 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.680
 after many sticks in the air finally 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.990
 the kids finished everything with the 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.330
 doctor and they did their August picking 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.879
 Fruit 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:52.270
 when the turn of the third piñata 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:55.060
 that was the gleaming golden star of 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.550
 tinsel the kids gave him the 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.919
 welcome the sun shine like gold the 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.400
 moon like silver instead of candle 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:05.830
 piñata with tastes like treasure the 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.340
 star knew that at that time she 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.729
 it was the happiness of the children excited 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.639
 and excited to think that nobody is 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:19.389
 loses and everything is transformed 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:22.690
 wanted to say lower the piñata lower the 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.380
 Anything that gives me duck for the little ones 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.170
 a little 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:31.610
 there was a thud and the piñata 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:35.150
 He broke in many of Palca but tes 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.460
 Once they fell to the ground they flew to heaven and 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.090
 he became a real star 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.400
 bright and bright 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:46.710
 and colored red the story of the 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.710
 magic piñatas is not over yet
