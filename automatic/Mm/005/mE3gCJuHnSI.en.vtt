00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.620 

I<00:02:46.130> guess<00:02:47.130> here<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.700> put<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.090> different<00:02:48.270> and

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
I guess here I put a different and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.830 
I guess here I put a different and
lubricant<00:02:49.110> in<00:02:49.230> there<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:51.140> way<00:02:52.140> expensive

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
lubricant in there is it way expensive

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.200 
lubricant in there is it way expensive
what's<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.990> called<00:02:57.800> Fievel<00:02:58.800> purple<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.430> guess

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
what's it called Fievel purple I guess

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.880

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
so they say only sewing machine all

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.740 
so they say only sewing machine all
