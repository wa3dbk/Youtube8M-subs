00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
provision oh that's a tough one because

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.699 
provision oh that's a tough one because
I<00:02:40.459> actually<00:02:40.940> get<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.450> question<00:02:41.630> quite<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.440> lot

but<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:42.950> never<00:02:43.489> had<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.730> think<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.269> so<00:02:45.220> it's

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
but I never had to think of it so it's

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.470

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
tough to really answer it but my feeling

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.000 
tough to really answer it but my feeling

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
it's more like a ritual and instead of

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.430 
it's more like a ritual and instead of
superstition<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:29.060> finally<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:30.079> obviously

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440
