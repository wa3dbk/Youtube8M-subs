turn<00:00:08.940> up<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.090> distortion<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.290> here<00:00:10.889> we<00:00:11.099> go

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.029

man I'm just doing a two finger power

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.880 
man I'm just doing a two finger power
cord<00:00:23.400> because<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.509> 90s<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.349> we<00:00:25.619> turn<00:00:25.800> up

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
cord because it's the 90s and we turn up

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.819 
cord because it's the 90s and we turn up
our<00:00:26.009> distortion<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.529> make<00:00:28.680> sure

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
our distortion and you can make sure

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.130 
our distortion and you can make sure
that<00:00:28.859> your<00:00:29.309> pickup<00:00:30.000> switches<00:00:30.539> all<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.779> way

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that your pickup switches all the way

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.520 
that your pickup switches all the way
down<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.340> we're<00:00:32.519> using<00:00:33.199> we're<00:00:34.199> using<00:00:34.320> this

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
down so we're using we're using this

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.600 
down so we're using we're using this
bridge<00:00:34.860> pickup

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
bridge pickup

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.819 
bridge pickup
that<00:00:36.300> way<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.570> can<00:00:39.050> we<00:00:40.050> get<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:40.379> those<00:00:40.559> sweet

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that way we can we get all those sweet

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.740 
that way we can we get all those sweet
harmonics<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:43.850> we're<00:00:44.850> at<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.659> I'm

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
harmonics in there so we're at a and I'm

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.149 
harmonics in there so we're at a and I'm
just<00:00:45.839> doing<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.050> power<00:00:46.229> cord<00:00:46.470> at<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:47.040> is

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
just doing a power cord at a which is

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.250 
just doing a power cord at a which is
five<00:00:47.430> seven<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:49.159> I'm<00:00:50.159> sliding<00:00:50.820> from<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.989> G

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
five seven and I'm sliding from the G

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.880 
five seven and I'm sliding from the G
chord<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.980> three<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.910> five<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:57.890> then

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
chord which is a three and five and then

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.460 
chord which is a three and five and then
I<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.339> few<00:00:59.670> exes

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.320 

gee<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:08.370> I<00:01:08.460> go<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.610> F<00:01:08.790> sharp<00:01:10.190> 244<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.430> back<00:01:12.120> to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
gee then I go to F sharp 244 and back to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.460 
gee then I go to F sharp 244 and back to
G<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.840> then<00:01:13.340> repeat

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.310 

and<00:01:18.980> I'm<00:01:19.130> just<00:01:19.220> keeping<00:01:19.550> my<00:01:19.580> strummin

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
and I'm just keeping my strummin

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.200 
and I'm just keeping my strummin
constant<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:22.100> fact<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.460> I'm<00:01:22.730> just<00:01:23.030> kind

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
constant and the fact that I'm just kind

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.550 
constant and the fact that I'm just kind
of<00:01:23.270> lifting<00:01:23.540> up<00:01:23.630> keeping<00:01:23.900> my<00:01:24.020> fingers<00:01:24.350> there

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
of lifting up keeping my fingers there

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.380 
of lifting up keeping my fingers there
before<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:24.980> press<00:01:25.430> down<00:01:25.610> on<00:01:25.730> the<00:01:25.850> cord<00:01:26.060> it

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
before I press down on the cord it

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.000 
before I press down on the cord it
actually<00:01:26.660> gets<00:01:26.840> those<00:01:26.930> harmonics<00:01:27.530> in<00:01:27.710> between

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
actually gets those harmonics in between

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:38.320 
actually gets those harmonics in between
so

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:47.800 

shoo<00:01:40.540> all<00:01:41.540> right<00:01:41.690> so<00:01:42.170> we<00:01:42.290> keep<00:01:42.440> doing<00:01:42.590> this

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.290 

brings<00:01:48.470> us<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.920> chorus

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.580 

so<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:57.050> base<00:01:57.230> of<00:01:57.260> it<00:01:57.620> is<00:01:57.710> just<00:01:57.890> open<00:01:58.400> opening

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
so the base of it is just open opening

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.060 
so the base of it is just open opening
fourth<00:02:01.250> fret<00:02:02.079> second<00:02:03.079> fret<00:02:03.229> back<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.950> the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
fourth fret second fret back to the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.219 
fourth fret second fret back to the
fourth<00:02:04.310> fret<00:02:04.490> then<00:02:05.030> open<00:02:05.420> there's<00:02:05.869> that<00:02:06.020> Barre

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
fourth fret then open there's that Barre

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:18.160 
fourth fret then open there's that Barre
chords<00:02:06.500> on<00:02:06.619> there

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.120 

okay<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.300> chorus<00:02:20.810> or<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.890> song

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
okay so that is the chorus or the song

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:30.070 
okay so that is the chorus or the song
and<00:02:22.430> then<00:02:22.580> we<00:02:22.670> go<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:28.280> it's<00:02:28.670> just<00:02:28.730> for<00:02:29.390> for<00:02:29.750> on

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
and then we go and it's just for for on

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.480 
and then we go and it's just for for on
the<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:31.069> string<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.670> D<00:02:32.000> string<00:02:33.220> going<00:02:34.220> down<00:02:34.340> to

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
the a string and D string going down to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.490 
the a string and D string going down to
the<00:02:34.610> two

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.509 

but<00:02:39.500> then<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.829> add<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.010> lot<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.340> sweet

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
but then you add a lot of sweet

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:48.590 
but then you add a lot of sweet
harmonics

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.500 

okay<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:50.500> then<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.370> last<00:02:51.550> part<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:52.060> we're<00:02:52.390> on

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
okay and then the last part is we're on

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.140 
okay and then the last part is we're on
E

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.500 

okay<00:02:56.019> so

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.740 

I'm<00:03:02.080> just<00:03:02.349> hitting<00:03:02.470> on<00:03:02.620> E

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
I'm just hitting on E

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.060 
I'm just hitting on E
then<00:03:05.290> I'm<00:03:05.350> going<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.770> three<00:03:06.310> four<00:03:07.200> all<00:03:08.200> in<00:03:08.830> one

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
then I'm going to three four all in one

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.890 
then I'm going to three four all in one
pick

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.039 

and<00:03:13.989> then<00:03:14.590> on<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.799> E<00:03:14.829> chord<00:03:15.159> I<00:03:15.459> can<00:03:15.730> do<00:03:15.849> this<00:03:16.329> so

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
and then on the E chord I can do this so

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:23.390 
and then on the E chord I can do this so
it's<00:03:17.200> open<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.769> two

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.039 

and<00:03:23.909> these<00:03:24.150> fingers<00:03:24.420> are<00:03:24.690> just<00:03:24.840> kind<00:03:24.989> of

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
and these fingers are just kind of

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.479 
and these fingers are just kind of
stopping<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.530> e-string<00:03:25.709> from<00:03:26.099> ringing<00:03:26.310> out

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
stopping the e-string from ringing out

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:41.759 
stopping the e-string from ringing out
two<00:03:26.670> months<00:03:26.940> then<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.420> get<00:03:27.569> cool<00:03:27.810> harmonics

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.890 

all<00:03:42.099> right<00:03:42.430> so<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.180> only<00:03:43.299> other<00:03:43.390> part<00:03:43.719> of<00:03:43.810> the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
all right so the only other part of the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.849 
all right so the only other part of the
song<00:03:44.079> is<00:03:44.499> the<00:03:44.879> bridge<00:03:45.879> which<00:03:46.510> is<00:03:46.719> keep<00:03:47.409> my<00:03:47.650> feet

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
song is the bridge which is keep my feet

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.280 
song is the bridge which is keep my feet
on<00:03:47.889> the<00:03:48.249> ground<00:03:48.459> so<00:03:48.819> here<00:03:49.329> we<00:03:49.420> are<00:03:49.450> in<00:03:49.689> E<00:03:50.019> so

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290
