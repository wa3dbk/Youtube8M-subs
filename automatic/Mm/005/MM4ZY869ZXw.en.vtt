that is very minimal shedding and I

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.690 
that is very minimal shedding and I
think<00:04:32.650> that's<00:04:32.830> because<00:04:32.950> I<00:04:33.220> have<00:04:33.370> been<00:04:33.520> cutting

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
think that's because I have been cutting

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.430 
think that's because I have been cutting
on<00:04:33.970> this<00:04:34.150> wig<00:04:34.360> on<00:04:34.510> cut<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.810> bangs<00:04:35.020> I've<00:04:35.290> been

cutting the layers so I mean it

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.240 
cutting the layers so I mean it
definitely<00:04:37.960> has<00:04:38.410> some<00:04:38.680> shedding<00:04:39.040> but<00:04:39.160> the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
definitely has some shedding but the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.280 
definitely has some shedding but the
shedding<00:04:39.520> is<00:04:39.639> very<00:04:39.970> very<00:04:40.270> very<00:04:40.510> minimal<00:04:40.840> um

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290
