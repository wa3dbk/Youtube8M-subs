00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
what people do one of the easiest things

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.050 
what people do one of the easiest things
to<00:02:32.819> do<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.120> make<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.959> font<00:02:34.230> bigger<00:02:34.349> yeah

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
to do is just make the font bigger yeah

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.270 
to do is just make the font bigger yeah
but<00:02:36.260> what<00:02:37.260> we<00:02:37.379> did<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.650> actually<00:02:37.859> change<00:02:38.159> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
but what we did is actually change the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.059 
but what we did is actually change the
layout<00:02:38.549> so<00:02:38.939> I<00:02:38.970> mean<00:02:39.120> if<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.269> notice<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.769> size

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
layout so I mean if you notice the size

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.039 
layout so I mean if you notice the size
of<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.730> input<00:02:41.909> screen<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:42.510> actually<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.840> size

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
of the input screen is actually the size

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.899 
of the input screen is actually the size
of<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.260> text<00:02:43.440> which<00:02:43.889> if<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.730> make<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
of the text which if you just make the

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.610 
of the text which if you just make the
font<00:02:45.150> bigger<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.659> lot<00:02:46.109> of<00:02:46.200> phones<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.470> just

overflows yeah terapia you know we made
these<00:02:50.129> bubbles<00:02:50.609> wider<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.049> it<00:02:52.230> fits<00:02:52.440> more

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
these bubbles wider so that it fits more

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.910

we<00:02:58.560> change<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:59.280> font<00:02:59.519> usually<00:02:59.849> I<00:02:59.879> could<00:03:00.090> just

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
we change the font usually I could just

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.199 
we change the font usually I could just
change<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:01.530> know<00:03:01.620> specific<00:03:02.220> might<00:03:02.639> just<00:03:02.939> be

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
change you know specific might just be

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.379 
change you know specific might just be
the<00:03:03.480> text<00:03:03.870> here<00:03:04.099> and<00:03:05.099> this<00:03:05.400> applies<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.970> every

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
every system app it also works in

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.979 
every system app it also works in
third-party<00:03:09.120> apps<00:03:09.389> but<00:03:09.689> obviously

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
third-party apps but obviously

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.420 
third-party apps but obviously
third-party<00:03:10.470> apps<00:03:10.620> don't<00:03:10.799> necessarily<00:03:11.189> have

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
third-party apps don't necessarily have

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.949 
third-party apps don't necessarily have
like<00:03:11.849> layout<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.450> for<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.109> fonts<00:03:14.480> so<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
like layout is for the fonts so so the

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.110 
like layout is for the fonts so so the
change<00:03:16.199> in<00:03:16.440> text<00:03:16.769> says<00:03:16.949> will<00:03:17.160> reflect<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.699> like
