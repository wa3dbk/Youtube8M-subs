00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.090 

so<00:00:00.659> we're<00:00:00.870> going<00:00:00.960> to<00:00:01.050> take<00:00:01.199> the<00:00:01.290> surface<00:00:01.530> and

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
so we're going to take the surface and

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.920 
so we're going to take the surface and
we're<00:00:02.429> going<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.610> do<00:00:03.149> it<00:00:03.240> in<00:00:03.419> Z<00:00:03.990> direction<00:00:05.930> add

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
we're going to do it in Z direction add

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.780 
we're going to do it in Z direction add
this<00:00:07.200> curve<00:00:07.500> that<00:00:07.680> we<00:00:07.799> use<00:00:07.950> from<00:00:08.130> our<00:00:08.250> sketches

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
this curve that we use from our sketches

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.780 
this curve that we use from our sketches
and<00:00:09.030> build<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.360> into<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.750> model<00:00:10.580> and<00:00:11.580> we

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
and build this into the model and we

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.430 
and build this into the model and we
just<00:00:11.910> click<00:00:12.090> trim<00:00:12.330> these<00:00:12.480> out<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:15.139> we<00:00:16.139> just<00:00:16.170> get

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
just click trim these out so we just get

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.380 
just click trim these out so we just get
this<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.890> surface<00:00:17.130> on<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> side<00:00:20.150> just<00:00:21.150> build

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
this this surface on the side just build

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.840 
this this surface on the side just build
a<00:00:21.480> few<00:00:21.660> more<00:00:21.840> curves<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.380> also<00:00:23.010> building<00:00:23.670> so

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
a few more curves and also building so

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.429 
a few more curves and also building so
now<00:00:24.090> we've<00:00:24.240> got<00:00:24.330> trimmed<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> side

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
now we've got trimmed out the side

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.670 
now we've got trimmed out the side
surface<00:00:26.240> we're<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.420> build<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.230> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
surface we're going to build in and a a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.880 
surface we're going to build in and a a
curve<00:00:29.179> snap<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.929> then<00:00:31.470> drag<00:00:31.769> it

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
curve snap this in here and then drag it

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.310 
curve snap this in here and then drag it
out<00:00:32.009> list<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.700> direction<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.960> I'm<00:00:34.170> gonna

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
out list in this direction and I'm gonna

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.049 
out list in this direction and I'm gonna
line<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:35.360> to<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.450> surface<00:00:36.750> edge<00:00:37.879> just<00:00:38.879> have

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
line this to this surface edge just have

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.910 
line this to this surface edge just have
a<00:00:39.090> quick<00:00:39.300> look<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.600> line<00:00:39.780> shall<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.260> um

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
a quick look on line shall we um

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.430 
a quick look on line shall we um
few<00:00:41.280> few<00:00:41.940> options<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.750> control<00:00:43.290> things

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
few few options here to control things

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.459 
few few options here to control things
like<00:00:43.590> tangency<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.340> curvature<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.140> I'm<00:00:46.140> just

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
like tangency and curvature and I'm just

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.560 
like tangency and curvature and I'm just
going<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> go<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.430> adjust<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.090> handles

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
going to go in and adjust in the handles

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.799 
going to go in and adjust in the handles
interactively<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.340> curvature<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.329> this

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
interactively the curvature of this this

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.260 
interactively the curvature of this this
curve<00:00:52.079> as<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.789> track<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
curve as you can see as we track the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.380 
curve as you can see as we track the
handles<00:00:54.800> is<00:00:55.800> really<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.340> adjusting<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
handles is really just adjusting it and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.060 
handles is really just adjusting it and
updating<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.989> surface<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.309> curve<00:00:59.550> side

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
updating the surface at the curve side

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.680 
updating the surface at the curve side
so<00:01:02.070> let's<00:01:02.219> go<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.789> build<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.149> biro

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
so let's go in now and build a biro

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.660 
so let's go in now and build a biro
we're<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.100> two<00:01:05.460> plus

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
we're going to have a two plus

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.039 
we're going to have a two plus
generation<00:01:06.380> I'm<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.619> build<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.010> round

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
generation I'm going to build it round

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.620 
generation I'm going to build it round
these<00:01:10.049> sections<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.000> then<00:01:12.000> over<00:01:12.390> this

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
these sections and then over this

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.590 
these sections and then over this
boundary<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:14.119> gives<00:01:15.119> us<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.390> top

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
boundary and that gives us the top

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.230 
boundary and that gives us the top
portion<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.740> surface<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.150> can

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
portion of the the surface so as you can

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.789 
portion of the the surface so as you can
see<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.259> nice<00:01:19.439> blended<00:01:20.040> surface<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:22.530> one

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
see it's a nice blended surface in one

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.510 
see it's a nice blended surface in one
operation

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.980 

so<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.610> next<00:01:28.790> step<00:01:29.030> is<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.330> build<00:01:29.479> in<00:01:29.690> another

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
so the next step is to build in another

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.530 
so the next step is to build in another
buyer<00:01:30.620> around<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.159> back<00:01:31.310> backside<00:01:32.240> of<00:01:32.390> this

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
buyer around the back backside of this

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.440 
buyer around the back backside of this
and<00:01:33.200> use<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:33.500> one<00:01:33.710> profile<00:01:34.190> curve<00:01:34.460> where

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
and use this one profile curve where

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.590 
and use this one profile curve where
these<00:01:35.630> are<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.840> two<00:01:36.020> profile<00:01:36.500> curves<00:01:36.770> and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
these are the two profile curves and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.660 
these are the two profile curves and
we're<00:01:38.600> then<00:01:38.780> into<00:01:39.050> a<00:01:39.080> line<00:01:39.350> in<00:01:39.590> this<00:01:40.460> other

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
we're then into a line in this other

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
we're then into a line in this other
surface<00:01:41.060> into<00:01:41.360> here

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
surface into here

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.580 
surface into here
start<00:01:42.409> with<00:01:42.560> pick<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:43.190> edges<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.590> slave

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
start with pick this edges the the slave

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.969 
start with pick this edges the the slave
to<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.460> master<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.300> can<00:01:47.450> see<00:01:47.660> here<00:01:47.979> we

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
to the master and you can see here we

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.310 
to the master and you can see here we
can<00:01:49.100> also<00:01:49.250> have<00:01:49.460> tangency<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.270> curvature<00:01:51.020> and

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
can also have tangency and curvature and

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.820 
can also have tangency and curvature and
again<00:01:52.190> we<00:01:52.460> can<00:01:52.610> adjust<00:01:52.990> these<00:01:53.990> tension<00:01:54.470> and

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
again we can adjust these tension and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.770 
again we can adjust these tension and
scale<00:01:55.220> just<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.580> control<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.630> way<00:01:56.750> the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
scale just to control the way the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.440 
scale just to control the way the
surface<00:01:57.170> is<00:01:57.440> built<00:02:01.030> something<00:02:02.030> else<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.330> can

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
surface is built something else we can

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.359 
surface is built something else we can
do<00:02:02.630> now<00:02:02.869> is<00:02:03.050> once<00:02:03.380> we've<00:02:03.560> built<00:02:03.590> this<00:02:04.009> with<00:02:04.250> the

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
do now is once we've built this with the

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.770 
do now is once we've built this with the
history<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:04.820> we've<00:02:04.940> got<00:02:05.180> built<00:02:05.509> in<00:02:05.660> the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
history that we've got built in the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.229 
history that we've got built in the
model<00:02:06.050> I<00:02:06.200> can<00:02:07.190> actually<00:02:07.460> move<00:02:07.759> these<00:02:07.970> points

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
model I can actually move these points

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.290 
model I can actually move these points
and<00:02:08.600> have<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.470> whole<00:02:09.590> model<00:02:09.920> update<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:11.180> when

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
and have the whole model update so when

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.350 
and have the whole model update so when
I<00:02:11.330> make<00:02:11.570> changes<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.110> can<00:02:12.230> see<00:02:12.500> here<00:02:12.850> I'm<00:02:13.850> just

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
I make changes you can see here I'm just

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.560 
I make changes you can see here I'm just
distorting<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.380> back<00:02:15.560> curve<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:17.450> in<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
distorting the back curve so in the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.360 
distorting the back curve so in the
sketch<00:02:17.780> phase<00:02:18.050> we<00:02:18.260> created<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.100> number<00:02:19.250> of

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
sketch phase we created a number of

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.400 
sketch phase we created a number of
curves<00:02:19.700> these<00:02:20.330> curves<00:02:20.660> here<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.989> see<00:02:21.230> our

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
curves these curves here you see our

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.740 
curves these curves here you see our
kids<00:02:22.040> were<00:02:22.160> created<00:02:22.489> in<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.580> sketch<00:02:22.880> phase<00:02:23.150> so

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
kids were created in the sketch phase so

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.470 
kids were created in the sketch phase so
we're<00:02:23.900> now<00:02:24.050> going<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.320> reuse<00:02:24.530> in<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.070> modeling

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
we're now going to reuse in the modeling

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.420 
we're now going to reuse in the modeling
so<00:02:26.480> what<00:02:26.570> I'm<00:02:26.630> going<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.780> do<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:27.019> I<00:02:27.140> was

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
so what I'm going to do is I was

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.000 
so what I'm going to do is I was
rejected<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.489> model<00:02:28.850> again<00:02:29.920> using<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
rejected this model again using the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.210 
rejected this model again using the
z-direction<00:02:33.640> these<00:02:34.640> curves<00:02:35.920> make<00:02:36.920> sure<00:02:37.070> we've

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
z-direction these curves make sure we've

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.390 
z-direction these curves make sure we've
got<00:02:37.370> more<00:02:37.549> picked<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.660> projected<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.560> I'm

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
got more picked and projected on and I'm

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.930 
got more picked and projected on and I'm
going<00:02:40.549> to<00:02:40.640> trim<00:02:40.880> out<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.120> surface<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.730> we<00:02:43.820> get

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
going to trim out the surface so we get

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.840 
going to trim out the surface so we get
the<00:02:44.030> hole<00:02:44.180> in<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.630> surface<00:02:45.190> next<00:02:46.190> step<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.640> to

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
the hole in the surface next step is to

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.449 
the hole in the surface next step is to
put<00:02:47.239> on<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.450> flange<00:02:48.100> so<00:02:49.100> I'm<00:02:49.160> just<00:02:49.280> going<00:02:49.430> to

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
put on a flange so I'm just going to

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.789 
put on a flange so I'm just going to
work<00:02:49.610> around<00:02:49.760> each<00:02:50.120> individual<00:02:50.630> part<00:02:51.019> putting

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
work around each individual part putting

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.229 
work around each individual part putting
on<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.010> flange<00:02:53.829> build<00:02:54.829> that<00:02:55.100> flange<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:55.700> in<00:02:56.000> this

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
on a flange build that flange in in this

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.229 
on a flange build that flange in in this
case<00:02:56.560> which<00:02:57.560> is<00:02:57.590> gonna<00:02:57.920> in<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.000> worst

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
case which is gonna in the worst

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.780 
case which is gonna in the worst
direction<00:02:59.870> but<00:03:00.739> now<00:03:00.890> we've<00:03:01.070> done<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.459> we<00:03:01.640> can

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
direction but now we've done that we can

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.600 
direction but now we've done that we can
also<00:03:01.940> go<00:03:02.180> back<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.920> use<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.100> history<00:03:04.340> within

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
also go back to use the history within

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.789 
also go back to use the history within
the<00:03:04.730> model<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.150> we<00:03:05.840> can<00:03:05.900> actually<00:03:06.290> modify<00:03:06.590> the

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
the model and we can actually modify the

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.060 
the model and we can actually modify the
curves<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:07.459> use<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.910> create<00:03:08.060> this<00:03:08.709> I'm<00:03:09.709> so

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
curves that we use to create this I'm so

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.740 
curves that we use to create this I'm so
I'm<00:03:10.190> just<00:03:10.310> going<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.519> modify<00:03:10.820> this<00:03:11.030> curve<00:03:11.450> here

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
I'm just going to modify this curve here

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.770 
I'm just going to modify this curve here
and<00:03:11.900> you'll<00:03:12.470> see<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:13.040> when<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.430> change<00:03:13.549> in<00:03:14.060> let

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
and you'll see that when I change in let

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.039 
and you'll see that when I change in let
it<00:03:14.810> update<00:03:15.079> it<00:03:16.010> updates<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.519> model<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.840> I<00:03:17.900> can

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
it update it updates the model so I can

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.000 
it update it updates the model so I can
see<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.350> design<00:03:18.680> change<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.130> I've<00:03:19.220> made<00:03:21.010> so

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
see the design change that I've made so

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.410 
see the design change that I've made so
moving<00:03:22.310> on<00:03:22.430> through<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.760> model<00:03:23.000> again<00:03:23.209> and

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
moving on through the model again and

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.210 
moving on through the model again and
you<00:03:23.870> can<00:03:23.989> see<00:03:24.200> around<00:03:24.350> here<00:03:24.560> we've<00:03:24.890> got<00:03:25.100> to

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
you can see around here we've got to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.640 
you can see around here we've got to
transition<00:03:25.730> surface<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.450> we<00:03:27.380> want<00:03:27.560> to

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
transition surface that we want to

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.180 
transition surface that we want to
create<00:03:28.630> so<00:03:29.630> using<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.989> surface<00:03:30.200> Phillip<00:03:30.650> I'm

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
create so using the surface Phillip I'm

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.710 
create so using the surface Phillip I'm
just<00:03:31.430> going<00:03:31.579> to<00:03:31.610> go<00:03:31.790> in<00:03:31.970> I'm<00:03:32.180> going<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.480> build

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
just going to go in I'm going to build

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.880 
just going to go in I'm going to build
in<00:03:32.930> a<00:03:33.079> a<00:03:33.440> surface<00:03:34.010> or<00:03:34.220> I<00:03:34.400> fill<00:03:35.030> it

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.740 

so<00:03:38.890> build<00:03:39.159> a<00:03:39.370> fill<00:03:39.549> it<00:03:39.670> choose<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.239> options

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
so build a fill it choose the options

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.869 
so build a fill it choose the options
here<00:03:41.530> we<00:03:41.739> actually<00:03:42.040> want<00:03:42.159> to<00:03:42.219> coddle<00:03:42.459> fill<00:03:42.790> it

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
here we actually want to coddle fill it

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.770 
here we actually want to coddle fill it
so<00:03:42.939> that<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.269> blends<00:03:43.659> out<00:03:44.019> this<00:03:44.799> this<00:03:45.700> wash<00:03:46.060> for

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
so that it blends out this this wash for

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.989 
so that it blends out this this wash for
us
