 here's a really great car fair 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:44.120
 Imagine for trekking camping bus force 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:50.080
 I think it's great 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:57.710
 is not too expensive costs about 120 euros 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:01:05.869
 is from fkm de the pro hunter with leather 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:08.450
 Scheider The black is off the blade 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.759
 is already completed because the word 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.430
 scratched by the wood chopping cheerfully 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:19.460
 I was polished down like that 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:25.450
 shelf of this water the schaaf r stole 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:28.190
 is a citizen in 6 190 steel and 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.899
 cut per point blade flat hit 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.149
 flat finally a good compromise 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:38.840
 between yes sharpness and stability 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:42.289
 the blade is 5 mm thick the knife 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.039
 had grabbed with katar and weighed 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:49.880
 complete with a vague say 270 times 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:55.130
 Gramm about has a beautiful ladies 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:59.679
 hide here for example 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.679
 everyone to cut and apply pressure 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:09.349
 yes, of course, say fuller goes through the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:16.790
 complete grip here or below stands 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:18.220
 there is a hole in it over camera kottan 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.140
 do 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:27.739
 I think it's very useful 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:32.260
 knife it is very sharp rockwell 58 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.489
 given to 60 very cut sustainably 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.650
 one does not pull out so beautiful one does not 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.700
 have used this black paint of 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.800
 most sensitive so cheese because 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.150
 I do not want anyone in the night 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.590
 attack my knife is allowed to shine calmly 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.640
 it is very useful too 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.379
 wood chipper pardon, this is how it works 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.239
 robust 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.500
 There is no such thing as the universal knife 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.720
 he can take everything 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.849
 that's why we have many runners her 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.459
 that knows itself the closets become 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.780
 always fuller 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.290
 but what i did now but i have 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:17.130
 exchanged these songs tailors and 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:20.549
 I've made a decision here 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:25.220
 of course, the typical driving style in front 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.220
 attached below a belt loop 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.599
 If necessary, you can screw kardex screwed 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:35.040
 Take each other when Schlamp is in it 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.720
 clean and hold really 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.170
 managed is now firmly falls 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:45.450
 did not come out quietly shake many 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.630
 say criticism slice 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.030
 also scratch the blade through the 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.769
 a lot of work attracts this owner 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.850
 cÃ¡ceres of the age to a knife for 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.049
 work and not for the showcase and 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.380
 have several knives over it 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:09.600
 finer for fine work and so on 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.459
 knife therefore for the rough that is still 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.569
 One thing I like to take 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.310
 I also switched a card 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:22.130
 built something different for the gorgeous 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.130
 bow around too with a lot of style 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.300
 that is a very cheap but must 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:35.789
 nevertheless I have two of them 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:40.940
 piece and then I have again 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.940
 Critic shit built for the moratorium 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:48.449
 But if I have the time to 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.159
 wanted to take snorkeling there it is 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.050
 leather not ideal now I have it 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:58.229
 again a plastic disc for it 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:05:01.199
 tinkered and wonderfully easy 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:09.960
 handy very sharp morality is always 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:11.690
 very nice thing and usually is yes 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.800
 that still there 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:21.419
 this is the workcamp of victorinox with 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:27.060
 all rambazamba in there you have 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:30.740
