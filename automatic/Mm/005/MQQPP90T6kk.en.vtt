it's<00:01:52.049> actually<00:01:52.439> constraint<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.400> see

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
it's actually constraint and you can see

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.859 
it's actually constraint and you can see
all<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.820> information<00:01:54.030> underneath<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
artwork tab you can have it centered

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
horizontally and Center it vertically so

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.920 
horizontally and Center it vertically so

it's in the dead center keeping the
constraint<00:02:01.350> portions<00:02:01.830> will<00:02:02.009> keep<00:02:02.220> your

tend to fade so this black will go with

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.119 
tend to fade so this black will go with
it<00:03:10.959> instead<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.230> making<00:03:11.409> it<00:03:11.620> look<00:03:11.739> like<00:03:11.920> it's

over 82 percent of black ink it's going

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.029 
over 82 percent of black ink it's going

the<00:05:44.999> reason<00:05:45.300> for<00:05:45.449> this<00:05:45.629> is<00:05:45.839> the<00:05:46.020> new<00:05:46.319> print

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:46.649 
the reason for this is the new print
