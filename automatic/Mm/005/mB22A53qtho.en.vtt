00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.150 
cool for some reason this game didn't
sell<00:00:53.370> really<00:00:53.640> well<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.329> quite<00:00:54.980> yeah<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
sell really well it's quite yeah the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.029 
sell really well it's quite yeah the
setting<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.699> quite<00:00:57.320> not<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.469> child-friendly

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
setting is quite not so child-friendly

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.610 
setting is quite not so child-friendly
etc<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.850> maybe<00:01:00.780> that's<00:01:01.020> one<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> reasons

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
etc and maybe that's one of the reasons

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
etc and maybe that's one of the reasons
why<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> didn't<00:01:02.129> sell<00:01:02.280> well<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:02.640> finding<00:01:02.879> this

thing you see here although the 3d
effect<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> quite<00:01:12.510> yea<00:01:13.470> meager<00:01:14.130> because<00:01:14.369> I

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
effect is quite yea meager because I

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.850

changing<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.520> this

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
changing with this

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.810 
changing with this
it's<00:01:18.479> lenticular<00:01:18.840> though<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.920> doesn't

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
it's lenticular though but doesn't

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.600 
it's lenticular though but doesn't
really<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.150> an<00:01:21.270> extra<00:01:21.570> added<00:01:21.930> effect<00:01:22.610> so

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
really have an extra added effect so

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.030 
really have an extra added effect so
when<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.360> open<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> box<00:01:24.780> there's<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.320> pretty

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
when we open the box there's a pretty

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.999 
when we open the box there's a pretty
tough<00:01:26.939> construction<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.710> getting

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
tough construction in there and getting

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.670 
tough construction in there and getting
this<00:01:29.189> out<00:01:29.430> there<00:01:29.759> was<00:01:29.990> kind<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.140> hard<00:01:31.380> last

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
this out there was kind of hard last

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.950 
this out there was kind of hard last
time<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.189> let's<00:01:32.939> try<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.240> without<00:01:33.450> damaging

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
time so let's try it without damaging

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.179 
time so let's try it without damaging
the<00:01:34.290> box<00:01:34.500> too<00:01:34.799> much<00:01:36.259> just<00:01:37.259> kind<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.560> fold<00:01:37.799> open

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the box too much just kind of fold open

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.550 
the box too much just kind of fold open
here<00:01:41.630> see<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.990> put<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.380> lot<00:01:43.530> of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
here see I have to put in a lot of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440 
here see I have to put in a lot of
strength<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.159> that's<00:01:44.280> something<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.970> don't

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
strength and that's something I don't

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:54.120 
strength and that's something I don't
really<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.350> games

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
there we go so that took quite some

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.770 
there we go so that took quite some
strength<00:01:57.860> but<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.730> box<00:01:58.910> is<00:01:59.030> still<00:01:59.150> in<00:01:59.510> one

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
strength but the box is still in one

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.610
