00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.770 
that
and<00:04:52.430> said<00:04:53.360> so<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.930> have<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:55.180> one<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.240> my<00:04:56.330> post<00:04:56.570> I

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
and said so I have a one of my post I

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.750 
and said so I have a one of my post I
started<00:04:57.140> some<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.440> events<00:04:57.800> this<00:04:58.280> is<00:04:58.460> one<00:04:58.730> of

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
started some the events this is one of

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.860 
started some the events this is one of
them<00:04:59.140> this<00:05:00.140> is<00:05:00.290> one<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.530> them<00:05:01.510> this<00:05:02.510> one<00:05:02.750> is

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
them this is one of them this one is

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.370 
them this is one of them this one is
more<00:05:03.470> nitrogen-based<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:05.660> nitrogens<00:05:06.170> higher

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
more nitrogen-based the nitrogens higher

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.160 
more nitrogen-based the nitrogens higher
than<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.740> carbons<00:05:07.420> over<00:05:08.420> here<00:05:08.720> on<00:05:08.810> my<00:05:08.960> big

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
than the carbons over here on my big

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.120 
than the carbons over here on my big
blue<00:05:09.440> one<00:05:10.360> I<00:05:11.360> got<00:05:12.140> a<00:05:12.170> lot<00:05:12.290> of<00:05:12.320> paper<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:12.890> stuff

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
blue one I got a lot of paper and stuff

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.770 
blue one I got a lot of paper and stuff
in<00:05:13.280> here<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:13.790> this<00:05:14.390> is<00:05:14.450> really<00:05:14.780> moving<00:05:15.080> well

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
in here and this is really moving well

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.930 
in here and this is really moving well
this<00:05:17.780> is<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.800> nitrogen<00:05:19.280> bases<00:05:19.490> a<00:05:19.700> lot

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
this is the the nitrogen bases a lot

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.460 
this is the the nitrogen bases a lot
drier<00:05:20.180> than<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.420> carbon-based<00:05:20.930> and<00:05:21.350> its

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
drier than the carbon-based and its

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.890 
drier than the carbon-based and its
really<00:05:21.680> both<00:05:22.160> are<00:05:22.370> really<00:05:22.610> doing<00:05:22.790> well<00:05:23.060> it<00:05:23.690> was

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
really both are really doing well it was

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.660 
really both are really doing well it was
just<00:05:24.110> something<00:05:24.290> I<00:05:24.470> want<00:05:24.650> to<00:05:24.740> try<00:05:24.980> one<00:05:25.310> was

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
just something I want to try one was

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.040 
just something I want to try one was
going<00:05:25.760> to<00:05:25.850> be<00:05:25.910> more<00:05:26.060> and<00:05:26.120> more<00:05:26.240> carbons<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:26.900> it

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
going to be more and more carbons and it

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.490 
going to be more and more carbons and it
won't<00:05:27.290> nitrogen<00:05:28.070> and<00:05:28.280> that's<00:05:28.790> fine<00:05:29.060> and<00:05:29.090> all

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
won't nitrogen and that's fine and all

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.410 
won't nitrogen and that's fine and all
so<00:05:30.500> what<00:05:30.830> I'm<00:05:30.920> gonna<00:05:31.070> do<00:05:31.220> here<00:05:31.520> is<00:05:31.700> you<00:05:32.270> know<00:05:32.360> I

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
so what I'm gonna do here is you know I

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.660 
so what I'm gonna do here is you know I
got<00:05:32.570> a<00:05:32.600> little<00:05:32.840> bit<00:05:33.020> of<00:05:33.050> paper<00:05:33.290> in<00:05:33.500> here<00:05:33.770> that

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
got a little bit of paper in here that

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.610 
got a little bit of paper in here that
what<00:05:34.850> I<00:05:34.880> have<00:05:36.160> is<00:05:37.160> my<00:05:38.120> own<00:05:38.510> homemade<00:05:39.110> manure

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
what I have is my own homemade manure

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.570 
what I have is my own homemade manure
mix<00:05:40.300> this<00:05:41.300> is<00:05:41.570> calvin<00:05:42.440> or<00:05:42.620> that's<00:05:42.890> wet<00:05:43.190> and

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
mix this is calvin or that's wet and

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.650 
mix this is calvin or that's wet and
there's<00:05:44.390> some<00:05:44.570> green<00:05:44.840> stuff<00:05:45.020> in<00:05:45.410> there<00:05:45.740> and

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
there's some green stuff in there and

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.200 
there's some green stuff in there and
you're<00:05:47.660> going<00:05:47.780> to<00:05:47.900> guess<00:05:48.170> what<00:05:48.380> it<00:05:48.410> is<00:05:48.590> I

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.630 

telling<00:05:53.830> so<00:05:54.830> I'm<00:05:55.130> just<00:05:55.280> going<00:05:55.430> to<00:05:55.490> take<00:05:55.580> a

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
telling so I'm just going to take a

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.900 
telling so I'm just going to take a
couple<00:05:55.790> handfuls<00:05:57.010> be<00:05:58.010> just<00:05:58.460> cover<00:05:58.640> up<00:05:58.700> that

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
couple handfuls be just cover up that

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.270 
couple handfuls be just cover up that
smelly<00:06:00.040> butt<00:06:01.040> look<00:06:01.160> good<00:06:01.510> call<00:06:02.510> it<00:06:02.720> good<00:06:03.280> so

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
smelly butt look good call it good so

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.750 
smelly butt look good call it good so
this<00:06:04.730> is<00:06:04.760> mark<00:06:05.110> mark<00:06:06.110> from<00:06:06.230> Kansas<00:06:06.680> for<00:06:07.580> red

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
this is mark mark from Kansas for red

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.610 
this is mark mark from Kansas for red
worm<00:06:07.940> composting<00:06:09.220> thank<00:06:10.220> you<00:06:10.340> for<00:06:10.460> watching
