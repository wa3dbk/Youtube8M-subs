axis<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.950> just<00:03:01.100> put<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.400> right<00:03:01.430> into<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
axis so I just put it right into the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.480 
axis so I just put it right into the

kind<00:03:04.820> of<00:03:04.970> fast<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:06.080> start<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.650> don't<00:03:06.920> know<00:03:07.010> if<00:03:07.130> it

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
kind of fast to start I don't know if it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.490 
kind of fast to start I don't know if it
makes<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.490> difference<00:03:07.850> or<00:03:07.940> not<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.420> was<00:03:09.200> probably

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
makes a difference or not I was probably

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.570 
makes a difference or not I was probably
all<00:03:09.680> in<00:03:09.770> my<00:03:09.830> head<00:03:10.570> anyway<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.960> like<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.590> then

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
all in my head anyway I like to then

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.860 
all in my head anyway I like to then

baby looks like a glass is getting
pretty<00:03:35.870> soft<00:03:36.440> here<00:03:36.830> you'll<00:03:37.520> see<00:03:37.700> a<00:03:37.730> lot<00:03:37.970> of

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
pretty soft here you'll see a lot of

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.170 
pretty soft here you'll see a lot of
people<00:03:38.180> on<00:03:38.420> different<00:03:38.600> tutorials<00:03:40.120> kind<00:03:41.120> of

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
people on different tutorials kind of

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.670 
people on different tutorials kind of
turn<00:03:41.390> from<00:03:41.600> side<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:41.840> side<00:03:41.960> but<00:03:42.290> I<00:03:42.350> think<00:03:42.380> my

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
turn from side to side but I think my

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.800 
turn from side to side but I think my
plan<00:03:42.740> was<00:03:43.300> hard<00:03:44.300> you<00:03:44.450> know

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
plan was hard you know

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.020 
plan was hard you know
hey<00:03:45.500> why<00:03:45.710> I<00:03:45.980> like<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.370> pull<00:03:46.550> it<00:03:46.640> up<00:03:46.700> just<00:03:46.760> a

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
hey why I like to pull it up just a

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.660 
hey why I like to pull it up just a
little<00:03:47.060> bit<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:48.709> can<00:03:48.950> go<00:03:49.280> ahead<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.550> get<00:03:49.640> a

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
little bit so I can go ahead and get a

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.750 
little bit so I can go ahead and get a
larger<00:03:50.060> diameter<00:03:50.770> handle<00:03:51.770> and<00:03:52.400> what's<00:03:52.610> that

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
larger diameter handle and what's that

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.120 
larger diameter handle and what's that
dire<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.120> gets<00:03:53.270> kind<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.480> set<00:03:53.690> then<00:03:54.130> that's

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
dire it gets kind of set then that's

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.650 
dire it gets kind of set then that's
when<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.370> start<00:03:55.730> to

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
when I start to

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.950 
when I start to
so<00:03:56.900> pull<00:03:57.940> anyway<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.210> want<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.390> focus<00:03:59.540> on<00:03:59.810> the

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
so pull anyway you want to focus on the

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.510 
so pull anyway you want to focus on the
food<00:04:00.290> side<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:03.650> point<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.370> want

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
food side of the the point and you want

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.710 
food side of the the point and you want
to<00:04:04.640> make<00:04:04.760> sure<00:04:04.880> that<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.180> handles<00:04:05.510> gonna<00:04:05.660> be

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
to make sure that that handles gonna be

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.590 
to make sure that that handles gonna be
able<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.900> access<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.920> next<00:04:07.220> point<00:04:07.460> once<00:04:08.450> it

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
able to access the next point once it

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.420 
able to access the next point once it
stiffens<00:04:09.020> up<00:04:09.170> that's<00:04:09.680> kind<00:04:09.890> of<00:04:09.920> a<00:04:09.980> shorter<00:04:10.310> one

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
stiffens up that's kind of a shorter one

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.480 
stiffens up that's kind of a shorter one
good

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.330 

that's<00:04:13.940> it<00:04:14.090> stiffens<00:04:14.480> up<00:04:14.860> you<00:04:15.860> just<00:04:16.100> want<00:04:16.160> to

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
that's it stiffens up you just want to

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.360 
that's it stiffens up you just want to
put<00:04:16.489> this<00:04:17.450> part<00:04:17.780> back<00:04:18.380> into<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.709> plane<00:04:18.950> and

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
put this part back into the plane and
