whatever is happening they still live

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.380 
whatever is happening they still live
and<00:04:12.410> they<00:04:12.590> still<00:04:12.860> give<00:04:13.069> us<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.549> huge<00:04:14.090> spectrum

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
and they still give us a huge spectrum

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.420

most<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.479> them<00:04:17.660> go<00:04:17.930> deep<00:04:18.260> into<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.650> ground<00:04:18.949> and

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
got to be smart you know I mean we had

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.860 
got to be smart you know I mean we had
trees<00:04:40.850> that<00:04:41.090> were<00:04:41.180> in<00:04:41.270> front<00:04:41.449> of<00:04:41.600> all<00:04:41.720> these

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
that were you know picking today so the

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.430 
that were you know picking today so the
chance<00:04:44.210> of<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.389> animals<00:04:44.750> getting<00:04:44.900> back<00:04:45.169> there

chance of the animals getting back there

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.100 
chance of the animals getting back there
was<00:04:45.620> very<00:04:45.860> small<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:47.120> wouldn't<00:04:47.660> go<00:04:47.780> pick<00:04:47.990> the

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
was very small I wouldn't go pick the

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.990 
was very small I wouldn't go pick the
