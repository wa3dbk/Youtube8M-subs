00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:23.830
Hey, my name is Shawna Coronado, and right
now I'm at P. Allen Smith's garden home.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.280
It is so cool that it is 89 degrees out.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.320
Super hot.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.770
And today, I wanna show you a tip: How to
plant Ralph.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.770
This is my friend Ralph.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.970
He's a tomato.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.800
And there's a special way to plant a tomato.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.220
And what it will do is make your tomato stronger
and tougher all through the season.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.740
Okay, here's the idea: Ralph is actually a
superhero.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.740
No kidding.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.600
When you peel this is off and you rip off
Ralph's arms--I'm gonna do it--I'm ripping

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.050
off his arms like that.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.180
Don't break the stem.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.370
Hold on, I'm gonna rip them all off.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.430
What we have is one giant, long stem.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:14.650
Now, what you wanna do is dig a trench–
straight trench in the soil.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.710
Close enough.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.500
And we're gonna lay Ralph down.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.590
And what we're gonna do is put him right on
the side.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.900
Now, it looks like I'm being harsh to Ralph.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.780
But the reality is–is that we're gonna give
him new life.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.780
I think we're even gonna go one more arm off.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.140
And lay him all the way down.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.520
What happens is: We cover him with soil and
then Ralph the superhero grows new roots all

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.520
by himself.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.520
It's really cool.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.270
He grows little, tiny root hairs all along
this and pretty soon it will be like a rock.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.680
It's a great foundation for your tomatoes
to grow around.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.820
So we'll cover it all with soil.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:03.180
And then what we'll do is make sure there's
only a little bit of Ralph peeping up.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.180
And that's it.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.180
That's all there is to it.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:32.680
Easy way to plant a tomato and it's gonna
make your garden far more successful.
