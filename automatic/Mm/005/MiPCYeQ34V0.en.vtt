00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:04.749
 the 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.620
 all 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.159
 the accident happened around produces the drivers for poultry pigs in particular 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:18.070
 and beef 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.010
 the company has recently opened a second production site in meppel 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.949
 the building where the early twentieth century was equipped with the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.939
 automation systems that help to produce as efficiently as possible 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.680
 our operating room is located here 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.980
 This is a drama place where the entire factory is controlled 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.180
 from the ten names of raw materials to a reduction of raw materials 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.520
 and we do that with a number of employees, the system ensures one 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.190
 emergency bridge between the administrative systems and you for the csi in the past 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.310
 it delivered with that before 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.020
 customers' orders directly 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.480
 about the precise date of this area 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.409
 because of its first full-fledged our industry 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.950
 It's about the very low margins a sign that it should have benefits 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.770
 but with yes make sure you control the costs 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.930
 an in between means that it is a ci 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.060
 guide others in all the decisions we make and this is there 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.170
 one of 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.890
 This is the there is a control panel sizes 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.230
 the 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.260
 driver 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.300
 sign up 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.950
 and then a truck bored with raw materials 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.930
 after he got this 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.020
 you experience that badge has passed the scanner 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.480
 and then the system automatically knows 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.820
 a view and how many resources 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.280
 this person has taken the comoros general manual acts in the 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.220
 intermediate position 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 an employee of the institute who has to arrange everything himself 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.680
 the mestach goal in itself is the moderating process control solution and 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.820
 optimization 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.590
 it's not just about producing more efficiently 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.340
 but it also ensures that the end product is a constant standard 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.680
 has quality 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.670
 it meets all food safety requirements 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.350
 But we are the real ones when it happens 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.570
 It is true that we give him what we produce today 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.759
 if we rarely asked tomorrow or could produce tomorrow 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.779
 so the feasibility of the process 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.009
 and therefore the consistency of its production 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.129
 of which there are coming before and on the cosmetic side 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.049
 but it saves money for the golden tip 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.989
 so again no food safety 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.679
 and that is also the risk that new ones are limited 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:28.019
 if there are any, they are recorded by all the data that we have here again 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.309
 and also a risk 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:32.400
 thanks to the automation of the production process 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.500
 it was possible for the falcon to be operational within a few months 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.819
 produce high-quality food of consistent quality 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.199
 produce the factory much more efficiently 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.869
 and that saves 10 percent on costs 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:48.799
 life five years 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.419
 that has to do with 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.419
 better quality 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.400
 and thereby proceed
