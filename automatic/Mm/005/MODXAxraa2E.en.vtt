I<00:04:39.300> can't<00:04:39.750> wait<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:40.050> build<00:04:40.229> something<00:04:40.710> similar

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
I can't wait to build something similar

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
their diet now these guys are very

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.230 
their diet now these guys are very
similar<00:04:47.009> to<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.250> tortoise<00:04:47.580> as<00:04:47.699> I<00:04:47.849> mentioned

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
similar to the tortoise as I mentioned

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.140 
similar to the tortoise as I mentioned
they<00:04:48.630> feed<00:04:49.020> on<00:04:49.229> exactly<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:50.039> same<00:04:50.250> things<00:04:50.610> you

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
they feed on exactly the same things you

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.089 
they feed on exactly the same things you
don't<00:04:51.300> want<00:04:51.599> to<00:04:51.690> give<00:04:51.840> these<00:04:52.050> guys<00:04:52.110> a<00:04:52.710> lot<00:04:52.949> of

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
don't want to give these guys a lot of

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.920 
don't want to give these guys a lot of
fruit<00:04:53.340> they're<00:04:53.759> hindgut<00:04:54.180> fermenters<00:04:54.900> and

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
fruit they're hindgut fermenters and

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.870 
fruit they're hindgut fermenters and
that<00:04:55.470> means<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:55.889> they<00:04:56.039> have<00:04:56.070> an<00:04:56.370> organ<00:04:56.729> in

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
that means that they have an organ in

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.460 
that means that they have an organ in
their<00:04:57.030> intestines<00:04:57.300> called<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.810> hindgut<00:04:58.139> and

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
their intestines called the hindgut and

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.379 
their intestines called the hindgut and
that<00:04:58.710> actually<00:04:59.280> breaks<00:04:59.580> down<00:04:59.699> the<00:05:00.030> cellulose

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
that actually breaks down the cellulose

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.629 
that actually breaks down the cellulose
by<00:05:01.080> a<00:05:01.110> process<00:05:01.590> called<00:05:01.620> fermentation<00:05:02.070> and

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
by a process called fermentation and

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.420 
by a process called fermentation and
there<00:05:03.210> is<00:05:03.330> actually<00:05:03.810> bacteria<00:05:04.440> in<00:05:04.770> that<00:05:05.070> gut

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
there is actually bacteria in that gut

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.180 
there is actually bacteria in that gut
living<00:05:06.360> in<00:05:06.509> there<00:05:06.720> that<00:05:06.990> are<00:05:07.139> beneficial<00:05:07.530> to

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
living in there that are beneficial to

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.920 
living in there that are beneficial to
helping<00:05:08.520> break<00:05:08.759> down<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.180> cellulose<00:05:09.509> in<00:05:09.720> the

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
helping break down the cellulose in the

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
scientists were thinking up when they

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:42.860 
scientists were thinking up when they
named<00:05:41.490> them<00:05:41.699> another<00:05:42.210> way<00:05:42.389> to<00:05:42.449> tell<00:05:42.750> the

named them another way to tell the
difference<00:05:42.900> between<00:05:43.349> a<00:05:43.590> cycle<00:05:44.039> or<00:05:44.099> rock

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
iguana and another type of maraca wanted

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.790 
iguana and another type of maraca wanted
like<00:05:46.680> a<00:05:46.710> Santino<00:05:47.190> sore<00:05:47.520> is<00:05:47.789> the<00:05:48.780> breaks<00:05:49.139> in<00:05:49.440> the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
like a Santino sore is the breaks in the

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.709 
like a Santino sore is the breaks in the
spikes<00:05:50.130> so<00:05:50.759> you'll<00:05:50.940> have<00:05:51.030> a<00:05:51.090> break<00:05:51.389> here<00:05:51.630> on

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
spikes so you'll have a break here on

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.320 
spikes so you'll have a break here on
the<00:05:51.810> spike<00:05:52.080> okay<00:05:52.740> it<00:05:53.340> stops<00:05:53.699> you<00:05:54.060> get<00:05:54.150> a<00:05:54.180> row

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
the spike okay it stops you get a row

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.689 
the spike okay it stops you get a row
spikes<00:05:54.659> it<00:05:54.870> stops<00:05:55.289> no<00:05:55.590> spike<00:05:55.860> then<00:05:56.370> you<00:05:56.490> have

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
spikes it stops no spike then you have

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.670 
spikes it stops no spike then you have
their<00:05:57.060> dorsal<00:05:57.419> crest<00:05:57.750> here<00:05:58.020> in<00:05:58.169> the<00:05:58.320> main<00:05:58.469> body

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
their dorsal crest here in the main body

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.740 
their dorsal crest here in the main body
and<00:05:58.830> another<00:05:59.250> break<00:05:59.520> so<00:06:00.180> that's<00:06:00.389> another

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
and another break so that's another

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.140 
and another break so that's another
telltale<00:06:01.320> sign<00:06:01.620> for<00:06:01.889> the<00:06:01.979> cyclo<00:06:02.400> rock<00:06:02.669> iguanas

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
telltale sign for the cyclo rock iguanas

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.779 
telltale sign for the cyclo rock iguanas
when<00:06:03.300> distinguishing<00:06:03.990> them<00:06:04.110> so<00:06:05.039> I<00:06:05.340> want<00:06:05.699> to

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
when distinguishing them so I want to

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.159 
when distinguishing them so I want to
also<00:06:05.880> talk<00:06:06.180> a<00:06:06.240> little<00:06:06.479> bit<00:06:06.630> about<00:06:06.659> the<00:06:06.960> tail

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
also talk a little bit about the tail

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.140 
also talk a little bit about the tail
now<00:06:07.440> these<00:06:07.590> guys<00:06:07.770> are<00:06:07.830> rock<00:06:08.400> one<00:06:08.699> is<00:06:08.820> they<00:06:08.940> dig

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
now these guys are rock one is they dig

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.570 
now these guys are rock one is they dig
burrows<00:06:09.360> they<00:06:09.630> live<00:06:09.840> on<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.080> ground<00:06:10.349> only<00:06:11.190> the

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
burrows they live on the ground only the

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.520 
burrows they live on the ground only the
young<00:06:11.820> will<00:06:12.180> go<00:06:12.360> up<00:06:12.509> into<00:06:12.690> trees<00:06:13.020> most<00:06:13.349> of<00:06:13.469> the

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
young will go up into trees most of the

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.350 
young will go up into trees most of the
time<00:06:13.740> so<00:06:13.919> they<00:06:14.009> don't<00:06:14.039> climb<00:06:14.400> too<00:06:14.580> much<00:06:14.759> in<00:06:14.969> the

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
time so they don't climb too much in the

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.730 
time so they don't climb too much in the
trees<00:06:15.570> they're<00:06:15.719> not<00:06:15.840> a<00:06:15.870> boreal<00:06:16.349> they're

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
trees they're not a boreal they're

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.379 
trees they're not a boreal they're
actually<00:06:17.159> terrestrial<00:06:17.729> and<00:06:17.909> they<00:06:18.090> clamor

over<00:06:18.690> rocks<00:06:18.900> and<00:06:19.080> they<00:06:19.139> dig<00:06:19.349> these<00:06:19.500> burrows

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
over rocks and they dig these burrows

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.159 
over rocks and they dig these burrows
and<00:06:20.130> they<00:06:20.430> use<00:06:20.639> this<00:06:20.849> awesome<00:06:21.030> tail<00:06:21.690> they<00:06:21.900> have
