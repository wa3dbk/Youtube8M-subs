00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
like sledding down a shield wall type of

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.560 
like sledding down a shield wall type of
thing<00:00:28.140> yeah<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.820> has<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> hill<00:00:30.210> around<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
thing yeah and it has a hill around it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.970 
thing yeah and it has a hill around it
which<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.840> what's<00:00:31.050> dragging<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.619> forward

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
which is what's dragging this forward

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.370 
which is what's dragging this forward
and<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> keep<00:00:32.550> up<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.290> I

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and so you have to keep up with it and I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.600 
and so you have to keep up with it and I
think<00:00:34.440> if<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.739> go<00:00:34.829> outside<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.160> hill<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.489> it

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
think if you go outside the hill what it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.740 
think if you go outside the hill what it
slows<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.969> down<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:36.450> if<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.660> get

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
slows you down and then if you get

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.780 
slows you down and then if you get
slowed<00:00:36.960> down<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.260> die<00:00:37.410> yep<00:00:38.370> there's<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
slowed down you die yep there's the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.490 
slowed down you die yep there's the
teleporters<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.600> one<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.170> they<00:00:40.260> just

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
teleporters this one in and they just

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.950 
teleporters this one in and they just
freakin<00:00:41.040> kill<00:00:41.579> ya<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.480> don't<00:00:42.719> know<00:00:42.780> how<00:00:42.899> I

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
freakin kill ya but I don't know how I

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.360 
freakin kill ya but I don't know how I
came<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.200> with<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.800> pretty<00:00:44.040> great<00:00:44.309> oh

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
came up with this is pretty great oh

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.500 
came up with this is pretty great oh
yeah<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.730> brilliant<00:00:44.910> at<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.270> end<00:00:45.390> you'll

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
yeah it's brilliant at the end you'll

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.850 
yeah it's brilliant at the end you'll
see<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.750> mechanism<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.649> meantime

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
see the mechanism but in the meantime

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.590 
see the mechanism but in the meantime
it's<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.670> tight<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.180> he's<00:00:48.360> been<00:00:48.510> able

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it's just so tight that he's been able

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.119 
it's just so tight that he's been able
to<00:00:48.719> make<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> mini<00:00:49.230> game<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:50.010> us

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
to make a mini game like this that's us

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.160 
to make a mini game like this that's us
basically<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:51.180> sprinting<00:00:51.690> against<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
basically you sprinting against the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.660 
basically you sprinting against the
other<00:00:52.260> Spartans<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.399> go<00:00:53.489> through

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
other Spartans you have to go through

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.490 
other Spartans you have to go through
these<00:00:53.789> corridors<00:00:54.149> do<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.050> Jason

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
these corridors do like all this Jason

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.049 
these corridors do like all this Jason
Bourne<00:00:55.739> stuff<00:00:56.039> through<00:00:56.250> windows<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
Bourne stuff through windows and

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.520 
Bourne stuff through windows and
Assassin's<00:00:57.510> Creed<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.930> that's<00:00:58.350> pretty

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
freakin intense yeah there's a bunch of

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.360 
freakin intense yeah there's a bunch of
different<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:01.320> pathways<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.309> don't

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
different like pathways like I don't

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.189 
different like pathways like I don't
know<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.579> when<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> was<00:01:03.390> running<00:01:03.870> through

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
know like when I was running through

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.690 
know like when I was running through
like<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.650> don't<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.100> played<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.430> route

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
like I don't know we played this route

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.109 
like I don't know we played this route
like<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> month<00:01:06.540> or<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.760> thought

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
like a month or so and we we thought

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.550 
like a month or so and we we thought
we'd<00:01:09.299> figure<00:01:09.600> out<00:01:09.720> all<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> pathways<00:01:10.409> but

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
we'd figure out all the pathways but

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.990 
we'd figure out all the pathways but
there's<00:01:10.740> still<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> bunch<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.760> like

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
there's still like a bunch of like

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
there's still like a bunch of like
hidden<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.780> doorways<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.740> jump

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
hidden little doorways that you can jump

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.289 
hidden little doorways that you can jump
on<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.250> stuff<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.700> it'll<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.210> you

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
on and stuff like that it'll get you

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.580 
on and stuff like that it'll get you
through<00:01:15.479> them<00:01:15.630> at<00:01:15.750> faster<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.439> like

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
through them at faster it's just like

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.810 
through them at faster it's just like
crazy<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> don't<00:01:17.520> know<00:01:17.640> how<00:01:17.759> he

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
crazy it's just like I don't know how he

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.510 
crazy it's just like I don't know how he
put<00:01:18.119> all<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.200> stuff<00:01:19.470> into<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.860> one<00:01:20.070> simple

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
put all this stuff into like one simple

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.160 
put all this stuff into like one simple
map<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.000> maybe<00:01:21.479> we'll<00:01:21.659> come<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.140> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
map so maybe we'll come out with like a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.870 
map so maybe we'll come out with like a
sequel<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:22.680> something<00:01:23.070> yeah<00:01:23.520> there<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.820> go

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
sequel or something yeah there you go

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.810 
sequel or something yeah there you go
there<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> that's<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.340> don't<00:01:26.580> know<00:01:26.640> who

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
there is so that's that I don't know who

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.280 
there is so that's that I don't know who
thinks<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.720> brilliant

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
thinks up with that but that's brilliant

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.969 
thinks up with that but that's brilliant
I<00:01:29.810> guess<00:01:30.810> he<00:01:30.900> ran<00:01:31.049> out<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.259> dominion<00:01:31.710> shields

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
I guess he ran out of dominion shields

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.280 
I guess he ran out of dominion shields
cuz<00:01:32.130> he<00:01:32.220> put<00:01:32.430> some<00:01:32.610> some<00:01:33.240> red<00:01:33.689> shields<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.140> on

cuz he put some some red shields up on

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.350 
cuz he put some some red shields up on
the<00:01:34.409> bottom<00:01:34.829> over<00:01:34.979> there<00:01:35.130> yeah<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.549> must<00:01:36.240> have

the bottom over there yeah I must have

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.730 
the bottom over there yeah I must have
taken<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.659> much<00:01:36.780> testing<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.320> get<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.590> thing

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
it's just like they they find out that

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.499 
it's just like they they find out that
it<00:02:05.040> works<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.700> hey<00:02:05.850> let's<00:02:05.880> switch

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
it works and it's like hey let's switch

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.119 
it works and it's like hey let's switch
up<00:02:06.540> routes<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.140> want<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> show<00:02:07.469> your<00:02:07.649> route<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
up routes I want to show your route and

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.859 
up routes I want to show your route and
then<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.090> try<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.690> just

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
then it's just like you try and you just

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.660 
then it's just like you try and you just
fail<00:02:10.050> cuz<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.410> don't<00:02:10.500> know<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.370> ended

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
fail cuz you don't know it and it ended

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.580 
fail cuz you don't know it and it ended
up<00:02:11.730> just<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:12.060> back<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.390> back<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.440> route

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
up just going back to back to the route

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.970 
up just going back to back to the route
that<00:02:13.709> you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
that you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.520 
that you
mistake<00:02:14.280> yeah<00:02:14.909> um<00:02:15.569> in<00:02:15.810> your<00:02:15.989> experience<00:02:16.110> did

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
mistake yeah um in your experience did

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.110 
mistake yeah um in your experience did
you<00:02:16.560> find<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:16.920> every<00:02:17.069> route<00:02:17.489> like<00:02:17.940> there's

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
you find that every route like there's

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.640 
you find that every route like there's
no<00:02:18.269> dead<00:02:18.480> ends<00:02:18.720> right<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.080> every<00:02:19.290> route<00:02:19.500> will

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
no dead ends right like every route will

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.589 
no dead ends right like every route will
get<00:02:19.830> there<00:02:20.159> yeah<00:02:20.760> every<00:02:21.120> ride<00:02:21.269> will<00:02:21.390> get<00:02:21.510> you

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
get there yeah every ride will get you

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.820 
get there yeah every ride will get you
there<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.870> some<00:02:22.049> will<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.409> kind<00:02:22.799> of

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
there and some will like kind of

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.530 
there and some will like kind of
intertwine<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.400> mix<00:02:23.790> into<00:02:23.940> each<00:02:24.150> other<00:02:24.330> so

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
intertwine and mix into each other so

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.970 
intertwine and mix into each other so
you<00:02:24.599> get<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.810> lot<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.080> people<00:02:25.319> just<00:02:25.560> jumping

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
you get a lot of people just jumping

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.259 
you get a lot of people just jumping
into<00:02:26.099> each<00:02:26.310> other<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.700> like<00:02:26.760> screwing<00:02:27.150> each

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
into each other and like screwing each

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.670 
into each other and like screwing each
other<00:02:27.420> over<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.930> then<00:02:28.140> you'll<00:02:28.319> end<00:02:28.440> up<00:02:28.530> like

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
other over and then you'll end up like

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.160 
other over and then you'll end up like
falling<00:02:29.040> down<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.370> stuff<00:02:29.519> like<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.930> yeah<00:02:30.930> so

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
falling down and stuff like that yeah so

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.449 
falling down and stuff like that yeah so
it's<00:02:31.290> definitely<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.620> very<00:02:31.739> clever<00:02:32.129> clever

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
it's definitely a very clever clever

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.770 
it's definitely a very clever clever
minigame<00:02:32.879> it's<00:02:33.060> kind<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.330> like<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> Indiana

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
minigame it's kind of like the Indiana

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.180 
minigame it's kind of like the Indiana
