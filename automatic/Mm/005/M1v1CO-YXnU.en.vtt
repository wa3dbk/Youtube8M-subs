okay<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:02.010> are<00:01:02.130> there<00:01:02.580> we'll<00:01:02.790> be

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.899 

yes<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.630> I'm<00:01:08.840> Martin<00:01:09.079> from<00:01:09.409> acid<00:01:09.909> education

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
yes and I'm Martin from acid education

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.399 
yes and I'm Martin from acid education
and<00:01:11.950> we<00:01:12.950> are<00:01:13.039> at<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.250> aerobic<00:01:14.000> 2008<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.140> we

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
and we are at the aerobic 2008 and we

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.649 
and we are at the aerobic 2008 and we
all<00:01:15.530> think<00:01:15.740> that<00:01:16.039> this<00:01:16.460> event<00:01:16.640> is<00:01:16.970> really

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
all think that this event is really

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.880 
all think that this event is really
great<00:01:17.929> yeah<00:01:19.509> by<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:20.539> way<00:01:20.689> my<00:01:21.079> robots<00:01:21.439> playful

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
great yeah by the way my robots playful

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.790 
great yeah by the way my robots playful
who<00:01:22.070> has<00:01:22.429> the<00:01:22.700> reason<00:01:23.090> is<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.140> background

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.930 

they<00:01:30.800> use<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.190> as<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:32.120> platform<00:01:34.930> is<00:01:36.700> much<00:01:37.700> more

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
they use that as a platform is much more

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.620 
they use that as a platform is much more
as<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.120> platform<00:01:38.390> my<00:01:38.960> society

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
as a platform my society

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.520 
as a platform my society
so<00:01:40.930> where<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.290> background<00:01:41.470> of<00:01:42.540> rowboats<00:01:43.540> is<00:01:44.470> a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
so where the background of rowboats is a

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.820 
so where the background of rowboats is a
very<00:01:44.860> very<00:01:45.250> seriously<00:01:46.110> those<00:01:47.110> are<00:01:47.409> they're

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
very very seriously those are they're

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.430 
very very seriously those are they're
all<00:01:48.009> looking<00:01:48.340> for<00:01:48.610> ways<00:01:49.030> for<00:01:49.360> example<00:01:49.390> help<00:01:50.020> to

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
to help us to have to get in situations

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:09.339 
to help us to have to get in situations
where<00:02:01.729> we<00:02:01.960> lose<00:02:02.960> our<00:02:05.049> main<00:02:06.049> goal<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:08.349> gain

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
where we lose our main goal is to gain

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.330 
where we lose our main goal is to gain
some<00:02:09.830> scientific<00:02:10.519> progress<00:02:10.879> okay

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
some scientific progress okay

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.640 
some scientific progress okay
the<00:02:13.340> basic<00:02:13.670> idea<00:02:14.000> when<00:02:14.840> robotruck<00:02:15.379> was

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
the basic idea when robotruck was

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.630 
the basic idea when robotruck was
founded<00:02:16.160> about<00:02:17.440> 10-15<00:02:18.440> years<00:02:18.470> ago<00:02:18.920> was<00:02:19.610> to

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
founded about 10-15 years ago was to

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.020 
founded about 10-15 years ago was to
create<00:02:20.269> a<00:02:21.200> standard<00:02:22.010> environment<00:02:22.250> where

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
create a standard environment where

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.080 
create a standard environment where
different<00:02:23.810> teams<00:02:24.170> could<00:02:24.680> implement<00:02:25.580> their

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
different teams could implement their

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.050 
different teams could implement their
solutions<00:02:26.750> for<00:02:26.989> specific<00:02:27.580> robotics<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:28.849> they

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
solutions for specific robotics so they

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.199 
solutions for specific robotics so they
can<00:02:29.239> compare<00:02:29.690> their<00:02:29.989> solutions<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.970> can<00:02:31.970> find

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
can compare their solutions and can find

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.750 
can compare their solutions and can find
out<00:02:32.450> which<00:02:33.049> solution<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.709> better<00:02:33.950> which<00:02:34.610> is

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
out which solution is better which is

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.400 
out which solution is better which is
not<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.090> good<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.480> how<00:02:35.629> they<00:02:35.989> can<00:02:36.049> improve

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
not so good and how they can improve

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.920 
not so good and how they can improve
them<00:02:36.860> together

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
them together

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.559 
them together
robotruck<00:02:38.930> itself<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.799> something<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.879> little

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
robotruck itself is something a little

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.640 
robotruck itself is something a little
bit<00:02:41.660> about<00:02:41.840> fun<00:02:42.170> as<00:02:42.440> well<00:02:42.709> yeah<00:02:44.110> but<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
bit about fun as well yeah but in the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.250 
bit about fun as well yeah but in the
end<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.190> about<00:02:46.280> scientific<00:02:46.940> realities

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
end it's about scientific realities

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.110 
end it's about scientific realities
technical<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.530> algorithmically<00:02:49.519> solutions

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
technical and algorithmically solutions

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.259 
technical and algorithmically solutions
that<00:02:50.420> have<00:02:51.019> been<00:02:51.349> created<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.859> built<00:02:52.129> by

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
that have been created and built by

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.140 
that have been created and built by
various<00:02:53.269> teams<00:02:53.569> have<00:02:54.379> been<00:02:54.650> used<00:02:54.890> in<00:02:55.280> robots

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
various teams have been used in robots

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.460 
various teams have been used in robots
to<00:02:56.329> find<00:02:56.599> land<00:02:56.780> mines<00:02:57.140> or<00:02:58.329> even<00:02:59.329> an

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
to find land mines or even an

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.370 
to find land mines or even an
interstellar<00:03:00.470> environment<00:03:01.220> like<00:03:01.400> Mars

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
interstellar environment like Mars

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.580 
interstellar environment like Mars
is<00:03:03.710> that<00:03:03.950> they<00:03:04.100> want<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.580> have<00:03:04.670> fun<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:06.350> those

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
is that they want to have fun of those

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.690 
is that they want to have fun of those
four<00:03:07.310> days

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.849 

thank<00:03:12.700> you
