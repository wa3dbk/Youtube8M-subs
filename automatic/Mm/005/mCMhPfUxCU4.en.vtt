00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:08.179
 My name is Susin. Today I am 43 years old. 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.679
 mother of three beautiful teenage daughters 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:15.750
 and my history with breast cancer 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:21.029
 began in 2005 I feel an adenoma wire 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.820
 no in the manual exam in touch and and so 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.939
 It woke me up neon that's happening. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.920
 so I went to do the consultations 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.199
 medical 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.540
 the genome fiber was nothing was 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.110
 simply a zink nodule could be 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.800
 removed but at mastectomy was revealed 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.129
 microcalcifications was revealed that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.390
 yes they were evil and how they were 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.510
 stops 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.960
 so I had no choice but to 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.030
 mastectomy was withdrawn 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.340
 of the breast 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.390
 I had an impact on that thing and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.879
 now it's going to happen you're not cured 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.199
 Good God, I'll try the treatment. 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.450
 What am I going to do? 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.360
 And how have I prayed to God for a 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.890
 Direction, sir, I do treatment. 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.920
 I keep looking for no miracles 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.780
 straight from the Lord and I kind of signal and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.259
 she told me do the treatment then 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.640
 we started to do the treatment instead 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.909
 to be what will happen, friend 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.270
 so the pain of the next day 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.689
 problem was what is God's purpose 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.750
 me right in this hospital that 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.350
 situation here and there we saw 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.840
 a lot of hope a lot of hopelessness 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:52.860
 a lot of strength a lot of weakness a lot of 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.189
 joy a lot of sadness and each person 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.869
 carries within itself a story each 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.600
 different story 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.219
 But while you 're in the hospital 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.880
 one thing I know everyone has in common 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.429
 The story of the people happens as soon as I 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.190
 already build because I already wrote as 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.830
 that my life has already been here and 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.060
 still have opportunity 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.180
 and what I'm going to do is how it's going to be 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.150
 I can build 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.020
 I did the treatment for five years I had 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.430
 the news that the cancer had returned 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.260
 there are many moments that we do not 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.340
 we understand the why 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.650
 neither do they but they exist 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.270
 when I opened the exams I saw the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.210
 result that the cancer had come back 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.390
 I did not start air traffic control or 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.390
 cry and I started thinking paraded 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.370
 I'm a long time ago I chose 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.940
 being on the light side 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.760
 I chose jesus and it means that I have 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.860
 side of life and not death and every year 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.800
 of cure and not of sickness everywhere 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.959
 anxiety page is every side of the 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.650
 joy does not make you sad 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:14.600
 there are two sides and I chose to be 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.570
 side where God opens and why I chose 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.989
 the law I know my safety is 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:26.209
 on a rock that is in the word of truth 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:29.330
 God wiped his eyes every tear and there 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:33.230
 I started a second phase of 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:36.350
 treatment again because God can not 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.340
 cure in an instant and I 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.570
 did not ask i did not search the way 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.410
 correct 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.209
 none of this I truly believe that all 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.840
 things work together for the good of those who 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.150
 My love, I feel like you know 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.110
 I was in the middle of the fire with this fire 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.540
 it does not burn as if you were one of the 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.680
 daniel 's friends are living in 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.110
 furnace 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.040
 but when you leave or smell of fire 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.920
 pass 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.700
 I do not feel the different skin I do not 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.840
 I feel the pain I feel aa difficulty 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.780
 that is 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.760
 even chemo the text has 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.109
 been saved in this sense has been 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:25.310
 Wonderful to see God's care during 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.949
 the process is nothing that guarantees 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.350
 plus our well being 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.699
 our security than love and the 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.970
 poet of 10 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:37.960
 take care of the preventive exams 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.960
