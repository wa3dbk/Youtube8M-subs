what's going on guys it's cube ologist

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.169 
what's going on guys it's cube ologist
here<00:00:01.949> again<00:00:02.190> with<00:00:02.370> another<00:00:02.490> average<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:03.030> five

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
here again with another average of five

here again with another average of five
commentary<00:00:03.780> just<00:00:04.470> have<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.620> few<00:00:04.770> things<00:00:04.830> to

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
commentary just have a few things to

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.170 
commentary just have a few things to
talk<00:00:05.220> about<00:00:05.279> before<00:00:05.580> we<00:00:05.759> get<00:00:05.879> into<00:00:06.089> the

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
talk about before we get into the

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.460 
talk about before we get into the
questions<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.720> figured<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.080> would<00:00:07.170> be<00:00:07.290> best

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
questions I figured that would be best

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.830 
questions I figured that would be best
to<00:00:07.589> do<00:00:07.740> first<00:00:08.040> first<00:00:08.970> off<00:00:09.150> this<00:00:09.389> cube<00:00:09.690> is

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
to do first first off this cube is

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.049 
to do first first off this cube is
actually<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> new<00:00:10.559> making<00:00:11.099> I'm<00:00:11.610> setting<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:11.969> up

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
actually a new making I'm setting it up

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.209 
actually a new making I'm setting it up
for<00:00:12.120> one<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.420> my<00:00:12.509> friend<00:00:12.809> Sammy<00:00:13.110> he<00:00:13.679> sent<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.070> to

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
for one of my friend Sammy he sent it to

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.470 
for one of my friend Sammy he sent it to
me<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.670> told<00:00:14.880> him<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.030> would<00:00:15.089> set<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.299> up<00:00:15.450> for

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
me and I told him I would set it up for

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.970 
me and I told him I would set it up for
him<00:00:15.690> I'm<00:00:15.870> super<00:00:16.260> happy<00:00:16.410> with<00:00:16.619> how<00:00:16.800> it's

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
him I'm super happy with how it's

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.220 
him I'm super happy with how it's
turning<00:00:17.190> out<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.180> turns<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.779> differently

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
turning out but it turns so differently

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.050 
turning out but it turns so differently
from<00:00:19.289> against<00:00:19.710> 356<00:00:20.430> sometimes<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> hard

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
from against 356 sometimes have a hard

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.480 
from against 356 sometimes have a hard
time<00:00:21.359> solving<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.710> that's<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
time solving with it so that's the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.679 
time solving with it so that's the
reason<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.789> my<00:00:23.939> times<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.359> little<00:00:24.390> bit

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
reason that my times are a little bit

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.509 
reason that my times are a little bit
inconsistent<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:25.769> that's<00:00:25.949> not<00:00:26.070> too<00:00:26.220> big<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.430> a

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
inconsistent but that's not too big of a

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.519 
inconsistent but that's not too big of a
deal<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.180> Sammy<00:00:27.930> if<00:00:28.080> you're<00:00:28.199> watching<00:00:28.349> this

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
deal so Sammy if you're watching this

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.099 
deal so Sammy if you're watching this
it's<00:00:28.890> coming<00:00:29.279> along<00:00:29.460> great<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.689> cubing

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
it's coming along great but in cubing

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.299 
it's coming along great but in cubing
news<00:00:31.260> something<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.740> wanted<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.009> talk<00:00:32.130> about

582<00:00:40.530> by<00:00:40.710> two<00:00:40.770> single<00:00:41.399> now<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.969> was<00:00:42.120> actually

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
582 by two single now this was actually

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.229 
582 by two single now this was actually
declared<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.530> dnf<00:00:44.070> at<00:00:44.340> first<00:00:44.640> because<00:00:44.969> he

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
declared to be a dnf at first because he

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.549 
declared to be a dnf at first because he
admitted<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.600> some<00:00:45.840> kid<00:00:46.020> had<00:00:46.140> actually<00:00:46.440> told

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
admitted that some kid had actually told

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.290 
admitted that some kid had actually told
him<00:00:46.739> about<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> scramble<00:00:47.460> or<00:00:47.730> showed<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
him about the scramble or showed it to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.580 
him about the scramble or showed it to
him<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.570> something<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.050> he<00:00:49.379> didn't

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
him or something like that he didn't

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.260 
him or something like that he didn't
even<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:50.010> access<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> scramble

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
even have access to the scramble

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.209 
even have access to the scramble
beforehand<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.870> think<00:00:52.020> he<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.289> saw<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
beforehand I think he just saw it the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.939 
beforehand I think he just saw it the
WCA<00:00:53.610> has<00:00:53.969> now<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.690> ruled<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.350> think<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
WCA has now just ruled I think in the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.610 
WCA has now just ruled I think in the
last<00:00:56.100> day<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.420> actually<00:00:57.750> legitimate

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
last day that it's actually legitimate

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.770 
last day that it's actually legitimate
so<00:00:58.829> he<00:00:58.980> now<00:00:59.160> has<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.399> world<00:00:59.820> record<00:01:00.090> single

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
so he now has the world record single

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.810 
so he now has the world record single
with<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> point<00:01:01.260> 58<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.309> world<00:01:02.520> record

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
with a point 58 and the world record

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.390 
with a point 58 and the world record
average<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> 1.55<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:05.040> completely

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
average with a 1.55 and I completely

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.429 
average with a 1.55 and I completely
support<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:06.060> decision<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.720> think<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.290> was<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
support this decision I think it was a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.800 
support this decision I think it was a
bad<00:01:07.650> move<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> kid<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.760> show<00:01:09.240> him<00:01:09.479> or<00:01:09.659> say

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
bad move on the kid to show him or say

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.539 
bad move on the kid to show him or say
anything<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.229> him<00:01:10.320> about<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.490> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
anything to him about it but as a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.160 
anything to him about it but as a
