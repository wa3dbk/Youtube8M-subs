00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:08.990
 Today is that doll doll p It is quite today 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.990
 First of all 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:18.120
 It is the hope Well one grounder to use in either the up 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:22.290
 I want you to add even while running 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:30.150
 Well tips for improving your ability to advance and retreat 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:33.200
 Well from your shell's but I'm frequently used the word Tteyuu experience orchid trunk running 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:38.810
 It is while using the experience 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.740
 It is that it is going to run. While running , it will be packed up as you acquire body strength 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.040
 I mean that 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.090
 It is normal 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:51.400
 Well first, one by one it is using the straight line 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.120
 I think that I want to do the movement 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:59.329
 Well then , let 's get started 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.329
 It is skipped as Taikan et al. The first one 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:24.570
 Yes Kai First wintering I'm one I skip 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.350
 I think that no one has said in a skip Well just because usually very interesting school to school 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.880
 right 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:34.319
 Anyway , I came here to experience the land 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:39.040
 Recommended do children also go and write in the book as a way to go 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:46.060
 If you do not do much of the movement that you are usually doing, it is the biggest theme here 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:51.300
 As you think of the way of the chip , it means that you shake your arms firmly 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:55.230
 At this time, I think that the child whose body strength is weak should come with a brush. 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.410
 I think you can see it already, but the axis of the body is doing this 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:06.110
 It looks like you're a kid like this 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:06.110
 It's not like this, even if you look firmly from the side straight in your body axis 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.450
 It will only be time to skip 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.990
 Hello 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:20.069
 When it runs 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:23.420
 It's easy to bend the elbow in the same way, but I dare to stretch the elbow 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.420
 Such Fu straight 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.260
 It is straight like this 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.909
 Straight out straight elbow straight 5 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.819
 Are we that shake the big arm to the size back to before the First 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:42.760
 What 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:46.989
 Such as you have to run it is to say that somehow still waving their arms in such Fu 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:54.219
 Which is but I was here after all it is to say whether the body is shaking easy to shake the arm to Fu 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:54.579
 It's easier to shake your body if you shake your arm like this way it's a big deal back and forth before and after 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.810
 Ne 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:01.550
 Easy to tear car is Oh 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.950
 Natural way so as not to shake everyone Well, it is the children that you take it in 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.319
 It is upper body to control first 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.099
 In particular the fact that continue to control so as not to blur the important First, in this skip 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.180
 It will be 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:18.450
 so 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:22.090
 As I continue to do that, I must definitely do this while my trunk is gradually getting along 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.739
 Such Fu in stable without break live 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:31.980
 Upper body will be able to shake arms steadily 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:36.720
 Shake heavily on before and after the video as a first point by say 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:41.750
 You can bend your elbow, so next time it was accompanied by this 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.750
 It is movement of the ring spine, but it is surely 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.720
 Knee 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.640
 It is that raise high the knee in not you bouncing hopping hopping on too much 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.569
 Not 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.569
 It's important to be diagonally forward and firmly before you and unconscious before 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.260
 It is like this 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:12.970
 The tightly practices Fu Tteyuu pattern the other end pattern pattern play down 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.450
 It's being chopped 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:22.990
 It is important to move forward before 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:24.610
 It does not Ika led to the movement when running It is after all and would sunny'll take you to the top to the top 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.480
 It's time to run 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.610
 I will exhale force before 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:36.410
 Are discharged from the every day before because so you do not have'm on the way 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:41.210
 Important to be Tteyuu go kick with the foot in the ankle two people to Fu say firmly this 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:46.470
 It goes cultivated such a movement in this kind of skip of the movement in the will made by 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.740
 Things have become is first important to say 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:54.729
 Because 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:57.039
 Apart the movement of the movement side of the body of the tongue of the movement of the above it is a good up and down can not be a well-balanced 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:04.060
 You may also when the ringing would 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:07.729
 Even so a If it is possible from the very beginning, everyone is a professional player. 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:14.509
 To learn how to move your body while 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:19.789
 It is important that for that reason I will tell you various movements from now on 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:25.909
 Because we will now be able to be sure any child if we do the movement say so door to 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:27.720
 Just because can not because you do not need to do just this there Rahen is the difference between Re 8 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:32.900
 I want to ask you not to 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.900
 I think So Shi It is a ticket First 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:45.949
 A big day before the big beat while cutting the rhythm 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.949
 Of course scride 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:58.520
 It is a big increase as long as the width of the step by step 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:06:03.380
 I want you to do it in a way that you can go before 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:08.210
 I'm going to skip that one and say that way 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:13.400
 I think that some of you might think after you hear me, but from me, one such thing 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:17.450
 What's baseball Well yeah to not do it is one of even basic operation 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:21.410
 That's why I'm thinking about the better players 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:23.370
 I think I've been do it is still carefully the delicate one one motion 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:43.360
 That's why mistakes and mistakes during the game 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:47.590
 Kaa ah ah Re' Nyongo 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.940
 And but Do not want to do this is I firmly I believe that say I'm important 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.710
 What 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:54.620
 I think so it was a skip for today's theme 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:07:02.150
 Before and after 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:04.940
 Swing your arms straight up with your elbows raised, raise your knees and energy before imitating before 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.849
 It's a big stride that spits out 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.610
 To in 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:12.750
 Well example when the last fly 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.750
 In this way it's a little anticipation or it's in a form like this 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:18.729
 What 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:22.659
 I will see a child who has moved his arms and moved forward but must 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:26.190
 This stable straight vertical stripe is also seen from the side 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:32.000
 It is straight and was the vertical axis viewed from the front 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:32.000
 While firmly Tamo cheap it is this kind of place 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.530
 While keeping 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:45.340
 As it is important to finish skipping , one such one 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:48.550
 Etc. If you Could have done without missing the point of 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:54.040
 I think without hesitation today is the first 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:55.160
 Let's challenge first so that you can skip in a beautiful form 

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:59.740
 Then 

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.740
 Thank you again for telling us tomorrow
