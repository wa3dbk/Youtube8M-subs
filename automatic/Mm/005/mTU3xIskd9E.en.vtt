able to do that thus far so basically
you<00:02:10.679> select<00:02:11.160> which<00:02:11.400> video<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.390> you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
you select which video you like and you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.470 
you select which video you like and you
can<00:02:12.810> add<00:02:13.080> a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
can add a

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.410 
can add a
the<00:02:13.569> picture<00:02:13.989> mask<00:02:14.459> which<00:02:15.459> i<00:02:15.670> think<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:16.120> fairly

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
the picture mask which i think is fairly

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.020 
the picture mask which i think is fairly
cool<00:02:16.629> and<00:02:17.409> you<00:02:17.650> can<00:02:17.830> add<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.069> checkered<00:02:18.700> skull

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
cool and you can add a checkered skull

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.880 
cool and you can add a checkered skull
which<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.540> can<00:02:19.720> see<00:02:19.750> down<00:02:20.110> there<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.379> he's

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
which you can see down there and he's

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.860 
which you can see down there and he's
knows<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.489> is<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:21.940> between<00:02:22.060> his<00:02:22.330> teeth<00:02:22.540> or<00:02:22.840> a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
knows and is in between his teeth or a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.630 
knows and is in between his teeth or a
mask<00:02:23.760> or<00:02:24.760> basically<00:02:25.540> any<00:02:25.780> ones<00:02:26.280> through<00:02:27.280> there

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
mask or basically any ones through there

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.259 
mask or basically any ones through there
so<00:02:28.480> what<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.989> do<00:02:29.170> have<00:02:29.349> to<00:02:29.530> do<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:31.060> is

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
so what you do have to do that this is

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.869 
so what you do have to do that this is
unlike<00:02:31.720> previous<00:02:32.080> versions<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.980> video

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
unlike previous versions of video

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.789 
unlike previous versions of video
wallpaper<00:02:34.090> programs<00:02:34.720> all<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.140> need<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.410> do<00:02:35.590> is

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
wallpaper programs all you need to do is

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.970 
wallpaper programs all you need to do is
just<00:02:36.220> get<00:02:36.370> out<00:02:36.549> of<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.730> program<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.650> then<00:02:38.650> you

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
just get out of the program and then you

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.569 
just get out of the program and then you
will<00:02:39.069> see<00:02:39.340> your<00:02:39.819> updated<00:02:40.420> video<00:02:40.870> wallpaper

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
will see your updated video wallpaper

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.170 
will see your updated video wallpaper
mine<00:02:42.579> is<00:02:42.849> at<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.239> moment<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.780> matrix<00:02:44.470> code

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
mine is at the moment the matrix code

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.080 
mine is at the moment the matrix code
it's<00:02:46.180> quite<00:02:46.599> effective<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:48.090> quite

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
it's quite effective in it's quite

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.850 
it's quite effective in it's quite
realize<00:02:49.450> think<00:02:49.660> it'll<00:02:49.930> play<00:02:50.260> around<00:02:50.500> there<00:02:50.709> in

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
realize think it'll play around there in

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.250 
realize think it'll play around there in
a<00:02:50.950> loop<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.370> numb<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.910> keep<00:02:52.150> going<00:02:52.329> runs<00:02:53.109> in

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
a loop and numb and keep going runs in

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.330 
a loop and numb and keep going runs in
the<00:02:53.319> background<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.739> don't<00:02:53.920> really<00:02:54.040> need<00:02:54.220> to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
the background you don't really need to

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.520
