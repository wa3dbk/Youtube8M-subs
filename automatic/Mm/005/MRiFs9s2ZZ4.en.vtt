00:00:11.017 --> 00:00:13.349
 It was the jewel, 

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:16.729
 Of our empire. 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.590
 The people of Pompeii, 

00:00:20.606 --> 00:00:22.156
 Let the games start! 

00:00:25.653 --> 00:00:27.638
 A place of corruption, 

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:28.659
 They killed them. 

00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:31.285
 Experience, 

00:00:31.326 --> 00:00:34.109
 Abed looks at you, if he's in a dream, Cassia. 

00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:35.408
 And battle 

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:36.759
 What is your name? 

00:00:36.832 --> 00:00:37.809
 My name is Milo. 

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:39.260
 For survival. 

00:00:39.376 --> 00:00:40.706
 Tomorrow we will fight. 

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:45.200
 Live slaves, earn your freedom. 

00:00:46.788 --> 00:00:49.271
 From all corners of the Roman world, 

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:52.814
 People will gather here. 

00:00:53.768 --> 00:00:54.879
 What is? 

00:00:54.973 --> 00:00:56.257
 This is the mountain. 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.279
 And despite all our strength, 

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:00.998
 Did you feel that? 

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:03.342
 We lived in the shade, 

00:01:04.888 --> 00:01:07.064
 Of greater power. 

00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:33.675
 -in February- 

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:37.603
 - Who will cost- 

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:39.850
 Whatever happens here, 

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:41.451
 - Who will fall - 

00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:43.203
 We found freedom, my friend. 

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:45.366
 - Who will flee - 

00:01:46.242 --> 00:01:47.740
 We have to get to the bay. 

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:51.544
 senator! 

00:02:08.144 --> 00:02:10.504
 - Pompeii-
