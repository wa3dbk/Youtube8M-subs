00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
in here so I know I got my motherboard

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.070 
in here so I know I got my motherboard
here<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:05.000> some<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.119> these<00:01:06.210> cards<00:01:06.570> poke<00:01:06.900> around

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
here and some of these cards poke around

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.620 
here and some of these cards poke around
to<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> back<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.130> that's<00:01:08.970> how<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.270> tell

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to the back and that's how I can tell

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.960 
to the back and that's how I can tell
what<00:01:10.170> some<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.500> them<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.220> video<00:01:11.549> cards

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
what some of them are like video cards

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.140 
what some of them are like video cards
and<00:01:12.030> whatnot<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.650> great<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.430> then

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and whatnot so that's all great and then

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.719 
and whatnot so that's all great and then
I've<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:16.259> my<00:01:17.570> water<00:01:18.570> cooling<00:01:19.259> here<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:20.610> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
I've got my water cooling here which I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.580 
I've got my water cooling here which I
don't<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.240> fully<00:01:21.600> understand<00:01:22.290> how<00:01:22.530> that

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
don't really fully understand how that

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.270 
don't really fully understand how that
works

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
works

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.340 
works
or<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.909> need<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.210> add<00:01:24.330> water<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.080> or

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
or if I need to add water to it or

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.770 
or if I need to add water to it or
something<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.479> got<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> bunch

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
something like that and they got a bunch

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.410 
something like that and they got a bunch
of<00:01:27.930> cool<00:01:28.080> fans<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:29.070> LEDs<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.880> them<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.210> haven't

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
of cool fans with LEDs in them I haven't

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.730 
of cool fans with LEDs in them I haven't
plugged<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.170> yet<00:01:31.409> because<00:01:31.500> I'm<00:01:31.710> still

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
plugged this in yet because I'm still

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.370 
plugged this in yet because I'm still
trying<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.490> kind<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.360> figure<00:01:33.600> out<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:34.110> there's

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
trying to kind of figure out if there's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.350 
trying to kind of figure out if there's
anything<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.400> really<00:01:35.460> need<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.000> know

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
anything that I really need to know

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.319 
anything that I really need to know
before<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.900> turn<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:37.979> there's<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.850> surprising

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
before I turn it on there's a surprising

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.580 
before I turn it on there's a surprising
lack<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.229> documentation<00:01:41.119> in<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.960> files<00:01:43.409> that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
lack of documentation in the files that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.710 
lack of documentation in the files that
I<00:01:43.799> got<00:01:44.070> there's<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> lot<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.759> paperwork<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.540> all

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
I got there's a lot of paperwork but all

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.490 
I got there's a lot of paperwork but all
of<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.960> relates<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:48.020> motherboard<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
of it relates to the motherboard and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.560 
of it relates to the motherboard and
things<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.549> there's<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.270> lot<00:01:51.450> of

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
things like that and there's a lot of

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.020 
things like that and there's a lot of
hardware<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.380> metal<00:01:52.920> pieces<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> don't

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
hardware like metal pieces that I don't

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.609 
hardware like metal pieces that I don't
really<00:01:54.240> understand<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:54.960> those<00:01:55.079> are<00:01:55.140> for

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
really understand what those are for

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.859 
really understand what those are for
but<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.579> far<00:01:56.790> as<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.969> know<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.149> don't<00:01:57.240> need<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.659> put

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
but as far as I know I don't need to put

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.840 
but as far as I know I don't need to put
anything<00:01:58.200> together<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.159> need<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.430> plug<00:01:59.670> it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
anything together I just need to plug it

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.840 
anything together I just need to plug it
in<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.299> turn<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.250> that's<00:02:02.250> what<00:02:02.610> my

kind of poking around here on the inside
I<00:02:16.720> hope<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.910> did<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:19.060> shot<00:02:19.330> everything<00:02:20.140> that

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
I hope that I did I shot everything that

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.510 
I hope that I did I shot everything that
everybody<00:02:21.070> wanted<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.120> see<00:02:22.320> there's<00:02:23.320> my<00:02:24.160> empty

Bay's that I could have filled with

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.400 
Bay's that I could have filled with
sixteen<00:02:27.220> dollar<00:02:27.570> optical<00:02:28.570> drives<00:02:28.840> but<00:02:29.170> I

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
sixteen dollar optical drives but I

outside lots of great interesting stuff
there's<00:03:31.450> more<00:03:31.660> hardware<00:03:32.080> here<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.440> I'm<00:03:32.530> used

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
there's more hardware here that I'm used

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.460 
there's more hardware here that I'm used
to<00:03:32.830> so<00:03:33.100> I'm<00:03:33.220> still<00:03:33.780> not<00:03:34.780> sure<00:03:35.140> where

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
to so I'm still not sure where

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.980 
to so I'm still not sure where
everything<00:03:36.340> plugs<00:03:36.670> into<00:03:36.910> but<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.570> think<00:03:37.840> I'll

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
everything plugs into but I think I'll

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.510 
everything plugs into but I think I'll
figure<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.380> out<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.770> I'm<00:03:38.920> hoping<00:03:39.070> to<00:03:39.280> get<00:03:39.400> it

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
figure it out and I'm hoping to get it

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.960 
figure it out and I'm hoping to get it
set<00:03:39.730> up<00:03:39.850> really<00:03:40.390> soon<00:03:41.460> check<00:03:42.460> back<00:03:42.700> with<00:03:42.850> you

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
set up really soon check back with you

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.480 
set up really soon check back with you
guys<00:03:43.090> when<00:03:43.300> they<00:03:43.420> do
