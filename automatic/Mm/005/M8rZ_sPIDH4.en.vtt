and<00:03:00.819> there<00:03:01.480> are<00:03:02.519> yellow<00:03:03.519> or<00:03:03.730> red<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:04.359> this<00:03:04.540> deck

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
and there are yellow or red on this deck

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.869 
and there are yellow or red on this deck
so<00:03:05.049> they're<00:03:05.650> kind<00:03:05.829> of<00:03:05.889> inverted<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.459> little<00:03:06.700> bit

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
so they're kind of inverted a little bit

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.179 
so they're kind of inverted a little bit
but<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.659> deck<00:03:07.900> itself<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.470> handling<00:03:08.889> the<00:03:08.950> way

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
but the deck itself the handling the way

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.210 
but the deck itself the handling the way
it<00:03:09.310> feels<00:03:09.549> everything<00:03:10.090> about<00:03:10.480> it<00:03:10.720> is

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
it feels everything about it is

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.509 
it feels everything about it is
precisely<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.579> same<00:03:12.609> as<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:14.159> as<00:03:15.159> the<00:03:15.220> black

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
deck and I'm sure this deck is going to

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.189 
deck and I'm sure this deck is going to
be<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.729> same<00:03:29.040> get<00:03:30.040> sticky<00:03:30.519> quick<00:03:31.199> the

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
be the same get sticky quick the
