00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
out of the context and Iranian well I

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.630 
out of the context and Iranian well I
think<00:01:15.080> emphasizes<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.950> green<00:01:16.190> through<00:01:16.550> the

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
think emphasizes the green through the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.540 
think emphasizes the green through the
red<00:01:16.850> there<00:01:17.120> is<00:01:17.150> incredibly<00:01:17.960> interesting<00:01:18.550> back

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
red there is incredibly interesting back

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.490 
red there is incredibly interesting back
and<00:01:19.760> fast<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.210> green<00:01:20.450> I<00:01:20.780> think<00:01:21.080> never<00:01:21.320> look

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
and fast the green I think never look

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.960 
and fast the green I think never look
greener<00:01:22.040> because<00:01:22.400> of<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.640> right<00:01:22.790> it's

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
greener because of the right it's

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.090 
greener because of the right it's
something<00:01:23.270> Ollie<00:01:23.450> Matthysse<00:01:23.900> Ron<00:01:24.560> said<00:01:24.860> and

he painted in 1911 he said the color red

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.060 
he painted in 1911 he said the color red
makes<00:01:28.720> other<00:01:29.720> colors<00:01:30.140> looks<00:01:30.290> different<00:01:30.740> more

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
makes other colors looks different more

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.740 
makes other colors looks different more
intense<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.700> it's<00:01:31.850> technically<00:01:32.240> what's

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
intense and it's technically what's

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.440 
intense and it's technically what's
happening<00:01:33.110> here<00:01:33.320> we<00:01:34.160> did<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.550> choice<00:01:34.790> of<00:01:35.030> the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
happening here we did the choice of the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.480 
happening here we did the choice of the
red<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.020> it's<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.260> symphony<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.740> red<00:01:37.040> not<00:01:37.250> one

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
dimension of it I mean this whole idea

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.540 
dimension of it I mean this whole idea
of<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.870> being<00:02:21.070> architecture<00:02:22.070> for<00:02:22.190> all<00:02:22.340> and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
of it being architecture for all and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.040 
of it being architecture for all and
this<00:02:22.610> whole<00:02:22.790> idea<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.690> gives<00:02:23.900> the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
this whole idea that it gives the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.840 
this whole idea that it gives the
possibility<00:02:24.650> for<00:02:24.830> visitors<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.520> experience

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
possibility for visitors to experience

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.090 
possibility for visitors to experience
architecture<00:02:26.600> one-to-one<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.800> very

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
architecture one-to-one is very

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.680 
architecture one-to-one is very
different<00:02:28.489> difficult<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.970> show<00:02:29.150> architecture

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
different difficult to show architecture

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.600 
different difficult to show architecture
in<00:02:29.750> an<00:02:29.840> exhibition<00:02:30.110> because<00:02:30.709> it's<00:02:31.489> almost

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
in an exhibition because it's almost

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.540 
in an exhibition because it's almost
like<00:02:31.820> showing<00:02:32.030> music<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.600> scar<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:34.160> not

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
like showing music to scar and not

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.160 
like showing music to scar and not
listening<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.239> music<00:02:35.360> well<00:02:35.989> if<00:02:36.050> you've

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
listening to the music well if you've

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.720 
listening to the music well if you've
got<00:02:36.200> these<00:02:36.500> architecture<00:02:37.160> plans<00:02:37.430> and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
got these architecture plans and

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.940 
got these architecture plans and
drawings<00:02:37.940> on<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.300> wall<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.810> sort<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:39.080> want<00:02:39.800> to

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
drawings on the wall you sort of want to

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.140 
drawings on the wall you sort of want to
listen<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.520> you<00:02:40.670> actually<00:02:40.820> want<00:02:41.090> to

listen to it you actually want to

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.790 
listen to it you actually want to
immerse<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.750> if<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:41.930> want<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.170> experience<00:02:42.500> it

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.170 
immerse it if you want to experience it
and<00:02:42.920> that's<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.520> great<00:02:43.730> thing<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.970> think<00:02:44.150> about

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
and that's the great thing I think about

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.979 
and that's the great thing I think about
pavilions

one<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.040> things<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.489> we<00:02:46.580> do<00:02:46.760> every<00:02:47.060> year

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
one of the things that we do every year

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.470 
one of the things that we do every year
is<00:02:47.480> by<00:02:48.170> having<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.650> pavilion

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
is by having a pavilion

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.150 
is by having a pavilion
increase<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:51.050> possibilities<00:02:51.739> of<00:02:51.770> what<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
increase the possibilities of what the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.530 
increase the possibilities of what the
public<00:02:52.340> can<00:02:52.610> do<00:02:52.760> when<00:02:52.910> they<00:02:53.030> come<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.420> the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
public can do when they come to the

it<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.310> an<00:03:23.490> incredibly<00:03:24.330> quick<00:03:25.260> project<00:03:26.010> to

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
it is an incredibly quick project to

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.580 
it is an incredibly quick project to
realize<00:03:26.970> something<00:03:27.270> that<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.930> six<00:03:28.200> months

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
realize something that is six months

from invitation to completion but the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.680 
from invitation to completion but the
energy<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.280> everybody<00:03:32.790> has<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.150> devote<00:03:33.450> to

energy that everybody has to devote to

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.170 
energy that everybody has to devote to
it<00:03:33.720> gives<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:34.950> kind<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.400> momentum<00:03:35.880> that

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
it gives it a kind of momentum that

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.540 
it gives it a kind of momentum that
perhaps<00:03:36.390> other<00:03:36.660> projects<00:03:37.200> don't<00:03:37.410> have<00:03:37.650> what's

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
perhaps other projects don't have what's

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.970 
perhaps other projects don't have what's
so<00:03:38.790> fantastically<00:03:39.600> exciting<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.860> the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
so fantastically exciting is that the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.280 
so fantastically exciting is that the
tenth<00:03:41.250> anniversary<00:03:41.520> of<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.060> pavilion<00:03:42.570> also

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
tenth anniversary of the pavilion also

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.200 
tenth anniversary of the pavilion also
coincides<00:03:43.860> with<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.160> 40th<00:03:44.580> anniversary<00:03:44.760> of

anniversary of the interview marathon so

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.370 
anniversary of the interview marathon so
you<00:03:49.470> could<00:03:49.800> say<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.030> really<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> major

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
you could say that it is really a major

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.620 
you could say that it is really a major
year<00:03:53.010> for<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> serpentine<00:03:53.880> in<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.270> sense

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
year for the serpentine in that sense

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.960 
year for the serpentine in that sense
really<00:03:55.230> it's<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.500> time<00:03:55.770> to<00:03:56.100> reflect<00:03:56.340> but<00:03:56.790> it's

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
really it's a time to reflect but it's

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.330 
really it's a time to reflect but it's
also<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.330> time<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:58.020> say<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.500> how<00:03:58.950> will<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.130> be

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
also a time to say and how will it be

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.310 
also a time to say and how will it be
different<00:03:59.520> next<00:03:59.820> year<00:04:00.030> always<00:04:00.870> look<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.110> the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
different next year always look to the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.740 
different next year always look to the
future<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.270> course<00:04:03.420> that<00:04:03.540> is

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
future and it is that of course that is

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.300 
future and it is that of course that is
concentrating<00:04:04.500> our<00:04:04.650> mind<00:04:04.920> at<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.280> moment

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
concentrating our mind at the moment
