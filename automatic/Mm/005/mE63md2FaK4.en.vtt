from<00:05:46.380> very<00:05:46.830> similar<00:05:47.130> to<00:05:47.159> how<00:05:47.340> Android<00:05:47.759> does<00:05:47.940> it

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
from very similar to how Android does it

well excuse me for doing that so that
pretty<00:05:50.460> much<00:05:50.550> sums<00:05:50.819> up<00:05:50.970> this<00:05:51.150> iconic<00:05:51.569> chasm

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
pretty much sums up this iconic chasm

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.360 
pretty much sums up this iconic chasm
which<00:05:52.050> is<00:05:52.139> the<00:05:52.229> icon<00:05:52.590> framework<00:05:52.979> can<00:05:53.159> get<00:05:53.340> a

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
which is the icon framework can get a

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.969 
which is the icon framework can get a
bunch<00:05:53.580> of<00:05:53.699> layouts<00:05:54.120> available<00:05:54.360> I<00:05:55.199> can<00:05:55.650> show

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
bunch of layouts available I can show

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.469 
bunch of layouts available I can show
you<00:05:56.039> simple<00:05:56.400> show<00:05:56.669> you<00:05:56.729> one<00:05:56.940> more<00:05:56.970> layout

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
you simple show you one more layout

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.850 
you simple show you one more layout
before<00:05:57.930> we<00:05:58.229> go<00:05:59.090> I'll<00:06:00.090> show<00:06:00.330> you<00:06:00.389> the<00:06:01.020> triangle

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
before we go I'll show you the triangle

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.610 
before we go I'll show you the triangle
nail<00:06:02.009> I'll<00:06:02.280> see<00:06:02.400> how<00:06:02.520> that<00:06:02.669> works<00:06:02.789> with<00:06:03.120> the

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.879 

shrink<00:06:07.819> so<00:06:08.819> cuz<00:06:09.060> of<00:06:09.180> iconoclasm<00:06:09.570> layout<00:06:10.139> which

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
shrink so cuz of iconoclasm layout which

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.939 
shrink so cuz of iconoclasm layout which
is<00:06:11.130> triangle<00:06:12.080> just<00:06:13.080> to<00:06:13.139> show<00:06:13.289> you<00:06:13.320> one<00:06:13.500> more<00:06:13.530> I

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
is triangle just to show you one more I

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.290 
is triangle just to show you one more I
believe<00:06:14.280> it's<00:06:14.460> not<00:06:14.669> going<00:06:14.789> to<00:06:14.880> show<00:06:15.090> me<00:06:15.270> that

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
believe it's not going to show me that

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.529 
believe it's not going to show me that
