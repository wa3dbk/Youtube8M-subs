00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
very beginning and what we find is that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.300 
very beginning and what we find is that
parent<00:01:50.869> involvement<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.469> probably<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:52.039> key

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
parent involvement is probably the key

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.459
