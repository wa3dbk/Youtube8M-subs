Freight and I've got picked up two of
these<00:02:16.070> automatic<00:02:17.070> battery<00:02:17.250> maintainer<00:02:18.709> so<00:02:19.709> I

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
these automatic battery maintainer so I

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.100 
these automatic battery maintainer so I
could<00:02:19.980> charge<00:02:20.190> them<00:02:20.370> separately<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.780> change

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
could charge them separately to change

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.390 
could charge them separately to change
the<00:02:23.060> amperage<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.209> here<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:25.410> 6<00:02:25.680> volt<00:02:25.830> 12<00:02:26.190> volt

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
the amperage on here the 6 volt 12 volt

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.380 
the amperage on here the 6 volt 12 volt
you<00:02:27.060> could<00:02:27.270> change<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.660> amps<00:02:28.019> from<00:02:29.060> two<00:02:30.060> four

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
you could change the amps from two four

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.550 
you could change the amps from two four
six<00:02:30.720> amp<00:02:31.050> charge<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:34.130> about<00:02:35.130> two<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.489> them<00:02:36.560> they

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
six amp charge so about two of them they

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:47.110 
six amp charge so about two of them they
were<00:02:37.620> 17<00:02:38.459> what<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.060> no<00:02:39.510> was<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.690> 17<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:41.040> was

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.050 

2497<00:02:48.120> each<00:02:48.450> four<00:02:48.830> for<00:02:49.830> this<00:02:49.920> charger<00:02:50.430> here<00:02:50.610> so

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
2497 each four for this charger here so

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.220 
2497 each four for this charger here so
2497

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
2497

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.130

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
got one for each battery to charge I

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.770 
got one for each battery to charge I
