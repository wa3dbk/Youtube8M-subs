00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 apparently there is a small book with this 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.150
 expertise is the only player that is the one 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.370
 we need in the love character to 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.380
 achieve a book of infinite life or shield 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.150
 infinite so to speak this is not a 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.059
 vessel 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.550
 let's say it's a bit unusual, apparently 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.680
 buy armor a little armor 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.720
 the character to mobile and what we're going to 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.150
 do is upload e 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.830
 among all the points we can 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.119
 put them as they want to do it then we 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.720
 we are going to direct an area where they 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.730
 good minions 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.349
 we're not going to let them hit us 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.149
 it seems they do us no harm instead 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.280
 of giving themselves for damages they give us shield 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.440
 we can have up to 50 thousand 100,000 is 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.820
 infinity the shield for what little I have 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.470
 could see and then they can take us from 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.840
 kill tower abraham baron you alone 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.980
 I until now only under the towers what 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.650
 is projecting a customized 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.089
 remember that this is a bug when using 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.300
 a portfolio can be shot them myself 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.379
 I share the book I've seen that I thought 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.059
 it was a joke when I 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.530
 they commented but not so they were 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.780
 I share with you to see it and 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.399
 think and here I will let you fill me 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.470
 it is with a long time if it was to overtake the 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.780
 video after explaining this and already 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.090
 it's something quick and concise and then there 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.670
 can appreciate the shield ship of 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.439
 Infinity said it and he surely it 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.850
 happens some moderator is more so that 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.590
 abuse him but if you can see he had 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.619
 the custom puts the using it like I did 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.619
 I
