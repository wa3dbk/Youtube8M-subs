00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
going to do I left a very long tail when

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.720 
going to do I left a very long tail when
I<00:00:36.770> finish<00:00:37.129> this<00:00:37.309> column<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.980> we're<00:00:40.249> going<00:00:40.519> to

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
I finish this column so we're going to

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.610 
I finish this column so we're going to
use<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:41.210> metal<00:00:41.660> yarn<00:00:42.440> needle<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.640> blue<00:00:43.879> ones

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
use a metal yarn needle the blue ones

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.560 
use a metal yarn needle the blue ones
tend<00:00:45.620> to<00:00:45.739> get<00:00:45.859> stuck<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:46.879> it's<00:00:47.030> a<00:00:47.089> lot<00:00:47.210> easier

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
tend to get stuck so it's a lot easier

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.689 
tend to get stuck so it's a lot easier
if<00:00:47.690> you<00:00:47.809> use<00:00:48.079> what<00:00:48.620> is<00:00:48.829> for<00:00:49.039> me<00:00:49.129> if<00:00:49.280> you<00:00:49.399> use<00:00:49.519> the

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
if you use what is for me if you use the

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.579 
if you use what is for me if you use the
metal<00:00:50.440> needle<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.920> we're<00:00:52.219> going<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:53.589> thread

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
metal needle and we're going to thread

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.469 
metal needle and we're going to thread
our<00:00:54.649> needle<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.609> slip<00:00:56.059> it<00:00:56.179> out<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:58.449> put<00:00:59.449> it

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
our needle and slip it out and put it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.009 
our needle and slip it out and put it
through<00:00:59.719> the<00:00:59.839> eye<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.239> I<00:01:02.239> generally<00:01:02.629> do<00:01:02.989> not

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
through the eye and I generally do not

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.730 
through the eye and I generally do not
tie<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.589> knot<00:01:04.600> because<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:06.020> also<00:01:06.200> tends<00:01:06.620> to

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
tie a knot because that also tends to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.590 
tie a knot because that also tends to
get<00:01:06.920> stuck<00:01:07.190> so<00:01:07.760> you<00:01:07.850> can<00:01:08.060> just<00:01:08.210> keep<00:01:08.330> an<00:01:08.479> eye<00:01:08.570> on

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
get stuck so you can just keep an eye on

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.780 
get stuck so you can just keep an eye on
it<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.820> first<00:01:11.030> thing<00:01:11.149> we're<00:01:11.270> going<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:11.420> do

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
it and the first thing we're going to do

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.420 
it and the first thing we're going to do
is<00:01:14.110> we're<00:01:15.110> going<00:01:15.320> we're<00:01:15.979> already<00:01:16.100> attached

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
is we're going we're already attached

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.660 
is we're going we're already attached
here<00:01:16.969> I'm<00:01:17.149> going<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:17.869> go<00:01:18.310> into<00:01:19.310> this<00:01:21.549> bump<00:01:22.549> here

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
here I'm going to go into this bump here

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.999 
here I'm going to go into this bump here
and<00:01:23.119> we're<00:01:23.570> going<00:01:23.689> to<00:01:23.719> pull<00:01:23.930> through<00:01:25.329> and<00:01:27.009> if

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
and we're going to pull through and if

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.639 
and we're going to pull through and if
you<00:01:28.159> have<00:01:28.399> a<00:01:28.430> tail<00:01:28.850> here<00:01:29.329> and<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:30.110> usually<00:01:30.259> don't

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
you have a tail here and I usually don't

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.850 
you have a tail here and I usually don't
leave<00:01:31.460> them<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:31.960> that<00:01:32.960> way<00:01:33.110> I<00:01:33.140> can<00:01:33.409> always<00:01:33.560> tie

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
leave them in that way I can always tie

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.060 
leave them in that way I can always tie
a<00:01:33.890> knot<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.729> secure<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:35.270> sewing<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.950> we

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
a knot to secure the sewing and so we

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.399 
a knot to secure the sewing and so we
went<00:01:37.280> from<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.640> green<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.840> cream<00:01:39.109> here

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
went from the green to the cream here

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.730 
went from the green to the cream here
and<00:01:39.619> I'm<00:01:40.430> going<00:01:40.579> to<00:01:40.640> stay<00:01:40.850> on<00:01:40.969> the<00:01:41.060> same<00:01:41.299> side

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
and I'm going to stay on the same side

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.099 
and I'm going to stay on the same side
I'm<00:01:42.740> just<00:01:43.310> going<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:43.520> go<00:01:43.640> up<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:44.000> little<00:01:44.180> if<00:01:44.420> you

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
I'm just going to go up a little if you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.399 
I'm just going to go up a little if you
zigzag<00:01:45.609> then<00:01:46.780> there's<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.869> big<00:01:48.049> chance<00:01:48.320> that

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
zigzag then there's a big chance that

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.649 
zigzag then there's a big chance that
you<00:01:48.560> will<00:01:48.680> be<00:01:48.829> able<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.130> see<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.429> seaming<00:01:49.759> so

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
you will be able to see the seaming so

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:51.669 
you will be able to see the seaming so
we're<00:01:50.810> just<00:01:50.840> going<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.079> go<00:01:51.200> what<00:01:51.409> I<00:01:51.439> call

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
we're just going to go what I call

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.649 
we're just going to go what I call
skimming<00:01:52.189> off<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.399> top<00:01:52.609> we<00:01:53.119> don't<00:01:53.299> want<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.570> go

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
skimming off the top we don't want to go

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.099 
skimming off the top we don't want to go
through<00:01:54.939> because<00:01:55.939> then<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.270> will<00:01:56.359> be<00:01:56.420> seen<00:01:56.750> so

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
through because then it will be seen so

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.429 
through because then it will be seen so
we're<00:01:57.259> just<00:01:57.289> going<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.619> go<00:01:57.829> off<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.840> top<00:02:00.049> here

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
we're just going to go off the top here

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.889 
we're just going to go off the top here
and<00:02:00.939> then<00:02:01.939> we're<00:02:02.030> going<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.179> find<00:02:02.479> one<00:02:02.659> on<00:02:02.780> the

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
and then we're going to find one on the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.859 
and then we're going to find one on the
opposite<00:02:03.380> side<00:02:04.060> that's<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.329> top<00:02:05.539> so<00:02:05.780> it

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
opposite side that's on the top so it

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.760 
opposite side that's on the top so it
won't<00:02:06.020> be<00:02:06.170> seen<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:08.740> pull<00:02:09.740> that<00:02:09.890> through

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.040 

and<00:02:13.060> don't<00:02:14.060> worry<00:02:14.210> about<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.540> being<00:02:14.750> tight

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
and don't worry about it being tight

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.810 
and don't worry about it being tight
we'll<00:02:15.350> tighten<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.860> after<00:02:16.220> we<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.520> several

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
we'll tighten it after we do several

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.650 
we'll tighten it after we do several
more<00:02:16.970> inches<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:18.290> again<00:02:18.530> I'm<00:02:18.680> going<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.890> go<00:02:19.070> up

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
more inches so again I'm going to go up

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.160 
more inches so again I'm going to go up
on<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.780> same<00:02:21.020> side<00:02:21.610> grab<00:02:22.610> one<00:02:22.910> on<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.960> top

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
on the same side grab one on the top

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
through to the opposite side and we're

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.970 
through to the opposite side and we're
going<00:04:52.480> to<00:04:52.570> stay<00:04:52.750> on<00:04:52.780> this<00:04:53.020> cycle<00:04:53.260> up<00:04:53.620> a<00:04:53.800> little

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
going to stay on this cycle up a little

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.110 
going to stay on this cycle up a little
bit<00:04:54.550> go<00:04:54.669> right<00:04:54.910> through<00:04:55.240> here<00:04:56.910> right<00:04:57.910> on<00:04:57.940> the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
bit go right through here right on the

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.540 
bit go right through here right on the
top<00:04:58.390> you're<00:04:58.900> not<00:04:59.050> going<00:04:59.350> under<00:04:59.650> at<00:04:59.740> all<00:05:00.570> and

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
top you're not going under at all and

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.770 
top you're not going under at all and
then<00:05:03.550> we're<00:05:03.640> going<00:05:03.730> to<00:05:03.790> go<00:05:03.910> right<00:05:04.150> off<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.600> top

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
then we're going to go right off the top

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:12.180 
then we're going to go right off the top
here

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.540 

then<00:05:12.790> I'm<00:05:12.910> going<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.090> stay<00:05:13.240> on<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:13.450> same<00:05:13.690> side

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
then I'm going to stay on the same side

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.860 
then I'm going to stay on the same side
and<00:05:15.550> I'm<00:05:15.970> going<00:05:16.090> to<00:05:16.150> take<00:05:16.330> this<00:05:16.540> right<00:05:16.840> here

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
and I'm going to take this right here

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.380 
and I'm going to take this right here
and<00:05:17.370> again<00:05:18.370> you<00:05:18.550> won't<00:05:18.670> even<00:05:18.850> see<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.210> on<00:05:19.300> the

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
and again you won't even see it on the

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.120 
and again you won't even see it on the
other<00:05:19.420> side<00:05:19.600> because<00:05:20.530> you're<00:05:20.740> not<00:05:20.860> going

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
other side because you're not going

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.210 
other side because you're not going
through<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:24.370> now<00:05:24.550> we<00:05:24.610> are<00:05:24.820> going<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:25.240> go<00:05:25.420> on

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
through and now we are going to go on

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.200

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
this side and we're going to go right

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:37.700 
this side and we're going to go right
into<00:05:28.540> there<00:05:31.260> and<00:05:33.030> pull<00:05:35.490> pull<00:05:36.490> through<00:05:37.060> and

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
into there and pull pull through and

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.680 
into there and pull pull through and
what<00:05:38.710> I<00:05:38.740> do<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:38.980> tighten<00:05:39.340> it<00:05:39.670> is<00:05:39.850> I<00:05:39.970> put<00:05:40.180> my<00:05:40.330> hand

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
what I do to tighten it is I put my hand

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.820 
what I do to tighten it is I put my hand
down<00:05:42.390> on<00:05:43.390> the<00:05:43.510> part<00:05:43.720> that's<00:05:43.930> sewn<00:05:44.170> press<00:05:44.530> hard

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
down on the part that's sewn press hard

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.940 
down on the part that's sewn press hard
and<00:05:45.070> then<00:05:45.340> pull<00:05:46.740> and<00:05:48.960> that<00:05:49.960> prevents<00:05:50.590> it<00:05:50.710> I

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
and then pull and that prevents it I

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.550 
and then pull and that prevents it I
mean<00:05:51.310> if<00:05:51.400> you<00:05:51.520> just<00:05:51.550> do<00:05:51.850> like<00:05:52.000> this<00:05:52.270> it<00:05:52.630> just

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
mean if you just do like this it just

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.610 
mean if you just do like this it just
bunches<00:05:54.010> off<00:05:54.190> this<00:05:54.460> will<00:05:54.670> sag<00:05:54.970> and<00:05:55.470> we<00:05:56.470> don't

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
bunches off this will sag and we don't

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.230 
bunches off this will sag and we don't
want<00:05:56.770> that<00:05:56.920> so<00:05:57.130> putting<00:05:57.310> your<00:05:57.400> hand<00:05:57.670> down<00:05:57.880> and

want that so putting your hand down and

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.710 
want that so putting your hand down and
then<00:05:58.420> pulling<00:05:58.690> it<00:05:58.960> will<00:05:59.200> tighten<00:06:00.720> perfectly

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
then pulling it will tighten perfectly

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.010 
then pulling it will tighten perfectly
you<00:06:01.870> can<00:06:02.020> almost<00:06:02.140> barely<00:06:02.830> even<00:06:02.950> see<00:06:03.370> it<00:06:03.460> and<00:06:04.240> on

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
you can almost barely even see it and on

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.230 
you can almost barely even see it and on
this<00:06:05.170> side<00:06:05.440> you<00:06:06.780> see<00:06:07.780> absolutely<00:06:08.940> no<00:06:09.940> sign

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
this side you see absolutely no sign

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.230 
this side you see absolutely no sign
that<00:06:10.480> you<00:06:10.600> sew<00:06:10.780> this<00:06:10.990> together<00:06:11.200> and<00:06:12.090> so<00:06:13.090> when

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
that you sew this together and so when

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.820 
that you sew this together and so when
you<00:06:13.330> get<00:06:13.450> to<00:06:13.570> the<00:06:13.660> end<00:06:13.840> if<00:06:14.110> you<00:06:14.140> do<00:06:14.350> have<00:06:14.470> a<00:06:14.530> tail

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
you get to the end if you do have a tail

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.640 
you get to the end if you do have a tail
you<00:06:15.700> can<00:06:15.850> make<00:06:16.000> another<00:06:16.270> knot<00:06:16.540> or<00:06:16.930> you<00:06:17.500> could

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
you can make another knot or you could

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.430 
you can make another knot or you could
just<00:06:17.680> make<00:06:17.950> a<00:06:17.980> knot<00:06:18.250> with<00:06:18.840> this<00:06:19.840> needle<00:06:20.140> by

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
just make a knot with this needle by

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.270 
just make a knot with this needle by
going<00:06:20.770> to<00:06:20.890> the<00:06:21.010> opposite<00:06:21.460> side<00:06:22.980> we'll<00:06:23.980> just<00:06:24.160> go

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
going to the opposite side we'll just go

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.880 
going to the opposite side we'll just go
directly<00:06:24.460> across<00:06:24.960> pull<00:06:25.960> it<00:06:26.110> through<00:06:26.500> a<00:06:26.530> little

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
directly across pull it through a little

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:33.300 
directly across pull it through a little
bit<00:06:27.070> and<00:06:27.540> then<00:06:28.540> just<00:06:28.810> put<00:06:29.020> it<00:06:29.050> through<00:06:32.310> through

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
bit and then just put it through through

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.950 
bit and then just put it through through
that<00:06:33.610> and<00:06:34.000> then<00:06:34.120> you<00:06:34.240> can<00:06:34.419> tie<00:06:34.630> a<00:06:34.660> knot<00:06:34.900> like

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
that and then you can tie a knot like

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.040 
that and then you can tie a knot like
that<00:06:35.460> so<00:06:36.460> just<00:06:36.730> continue<00:06:37.240> all<00:06:37.540> the<00:06:37.570> way<00:06:37.750> down
