00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 in this lesson we'll deal with you 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:07.410
 correction of night photos from the lesson you 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.389
 learn how to achieve very beautiful 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.250
 effects that are often used 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.730
 professional photographers using 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.910
 different filters in his cell but 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.070
 if you are not able to shoot on 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.990
 professional cameras then nothing 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.850
 terrible can be the same effect 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.029
 achieve with standard 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.510
 photoshop tools so let's 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.719
 let's see how to do it here 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.239
 already loaded the original photo and now we 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.460
 let's process it first 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.570
 we are about duplicating our main layer 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.489
 press control jay and now we with 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.530
 you need to do so 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.260
 Visible in our photo remained 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.960
 only the brightest areas here 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.949
 flashlights and lights for this we 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.100
 go to the point 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.550
 image choose correction and 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:03.379
 We select here the level of the move 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.260
 average slider almost to the limit right 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.619
 to about 0.10 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.070
 we must remain visible only 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.040
 the brightest areas in our photo 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.590
 so you can even make a little brighter 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.869
 about 012 like that we press ok and 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.340
 now you and I need to paint over those 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.750
 areas on photos that are not needed 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.930
 so that we subsequently formed 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.110
 unnecessary glare because they have to 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.400
 come only from the lanterns and so 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:45.140
 choose a brush for it choose black 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:50.329
 color and paint over here this plot 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.329
 so we paint the background completely 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:00.540
 here under the bridge we also paint over everything 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:04.200
 so in the background the city ​​too 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.350
 paint a little about this 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.959
 the result you must have is changing the mode 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.110
 overlay then u layer on screen and now 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.849
 let's make three more copies of ours 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.200
 top layer click control jay 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.629
 control jay 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.110
 control jay in the end we should 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.860
 get 4 layers that will respond 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.129
 behind 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.610
 highlights and so go to the bottom 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.000
 layer 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.970
 go to the filter point select blur in 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.790
 movement 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:43.500
 so put the angle -45 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.840
 and we set the offset to 150 so we 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.349
 it turns out such an interesting one 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:55.590
 effect as you can see yes we press ok 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:57.900
 We turn now to the second layer also 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.140
 go to the filter select blur in 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.860
 movement but this time we put 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.030
 bias 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.330
 two times more that is 300 so push 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.640
 ok 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.750
 turn now to the third condition go 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.720
 also filter blur in motion on this 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:25.980
 just change the angle and set not -45 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:29.970
 a45 like this we put the offset 150 push 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:35.540
 ok so well and the last layer also 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:39.840
 motion blur set lighting 300 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.690
 so great click ok and that's what u 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.970
 you and I got what you see around 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.000
 all lights on the bridge 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.590
 there were such beautiful highlights 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.549
 just what you and I needed 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.780
 now let's all the 4 layer will declare in one 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.760
 press the shift key click on 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.260
 top layer and click on the bottom 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.879
 I press the control combination and set 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.879
 blend mode for this layer on screen 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.599
 Now you can slightly increase the contrast 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.900
 data lights for this we use 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:18.209
 Curves adjustment layer create it 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.639
 apply only to the layer with lights 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.300
 hold down the alt key and click on 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.250
 the border between these two layers 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.040
 go back settings 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:33.960
 adjustment layer and start 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:39.360
 neatly look at our 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:43.470
 images are looking for the best option which 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:48.260
 ours and where will look cute 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.260
 here so 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:07.619
 look here I think something like this can 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:10.959
 even a little bit more 

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:16.209
 this way we close this 

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:19.049
 adjustment layer well and to even more 

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:21.129
 diversify our photo it can be a little 

00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:22.319
 coloring this create a new empty 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:29.829
 layer 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:31.209
 so choose a large brush so 

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:36.239
 and make sure you have it 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:38.979
 worth soft so choose on the palette 

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:47.519
 let's take for example blue now 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:51.219
 color we pass that stretch would be so 

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:54.509
 choose on the palette another color to 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:59.139
 For example let's take such a purple 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:02.739
 we pass here in purple here 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:06.519
 so here and let's take the last one 

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:11.189
 color is yellow and paint this area 

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:15.419
 yellow now go to the item filter 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:18.839
 choose blur by gauss 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:21.179
 blur with a very large radius 

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:27.610
 about 200 pixels 

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:29.379
 click ok and now let's change 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.749
 blend mode of this layer either on 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:34.809
 soft light 

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:37.149
 either overlap in this case 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:39.309
 overlap looks much better if 

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:43.989
 the effect seems too strong 

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:47.829
 lower the layer opacity to about 

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:49.300
 up to seventy percent and as you can see u 

00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:53.519
 you and I get this 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.519
 beautiful and finished photo
