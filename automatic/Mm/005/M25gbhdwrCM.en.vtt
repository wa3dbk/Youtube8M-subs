00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.660 
ordering all of this metal and then
we're<00:00:03.659> building<00:00:04.049> it<00:00:04.170> from<00:00:04.319> you<00:00:04.500> guys<00:00:04.650> how<00:00:05.490> does

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
we're building it from you guys how does

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.980 
we're building it from you guys how does
it<00:00:05.790> work<00:00:06.919> okay<00:00:07.919> so<00:00:08.550> this<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.630> G<00:00:09.780> Street

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
it work okay so this is the G Street

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.070 
it work okay so this is the G Street
chassis<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:10.590> we<00:00:10.769> have<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.480> kit<00:00:12.480> which<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.809> see

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
chassis so we have a kit which you see

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.560 
chassis so we have a kit which you see
here<00:00:13.259> in<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.469> card<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.700> it's<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> back<00:00:15.030> half<00:00:15.269> kit

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
here in the card so it's a back half kit

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.920 
here in the card so it's a back half kit
so<00:00:16.049> basically<00:00:16.410> we<00:00:16.710> would<00:00:16.890> buy<00:00:17.180> this<00:00:18.180> metal<00:00:18.660> kit

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
so basically we would buy this metal kit

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.720 
so basically we would buy this metal kit
from<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.710> would<00:00:19.859> get<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> crossmember

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
from you you would get the crossmember

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.099 
from you you would get the crossmember
back<00:00:21.029> crossmember<00:00:21.960> back<00:00:23.720> without<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.930> rear

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
back crossmember back without the rear

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.720 
back crossmember back without the rear
the<00:00:25.380> rear<00:00:25.410> differential<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.430> whole<00:00:26.550> nine

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the rear differential the whole nine

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.670 
the rear differential the whole nine
yards<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.570> separate<00:00:27.900> piece<00:00:28.080> obviously<00:00:28.320> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
yards it's a separate piece obviously a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.150 
yards it's a separate piece obviously a
separate<00:00:29.070> piece<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.490> housing<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:31.160> lose

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
separate piece the housing is so lose

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.500 
separate piece the housing is so lose
all<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.610> suspension<00:00:33.570> links<00:00:34.380> okay<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:36.300> we

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
all of the suspension links okay so we

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.750 
all of the suspension links okay so we
could<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.899> could<00:00:37.050> buy<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.440> kit<00:00:37.920> from<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
your ship is the frame all welded

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.790 
your ship is the frame all welded
together<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.770> basically

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
together and they just have to basically

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.439 
together and they just have to basically
but<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.610> main<00:00:50.940> board<00:00:51.210> right

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
but what about this main board right

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.810 
but what about this main board right
here<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.989> big<00:00:52.199> old<00:00:52.410> honkin<00:00:52.980> curve<00:00:53.430> for

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
here with this big old honkin curve for

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.910 
here with this big old honkin curve for
the<00:00:56.780> we're<00:00:57.780> talking<00:00:58.109> about<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.559> exhaust

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the we're talking about the exhaust

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.849 
the we're talking about the exhaust
pipes<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.079> all<00:01:01.199> drive<00:01:01.500> sharing

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
pipes and the this is all drive sharing

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.200 
pipes and the this is all drive sharing
brain<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.430> will<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> welded

were only on the floor pan so there's
only<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:14.000> little<00:03:14.300> bit<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.630> backing<00:03:14.960> up<00:03:15.110> because

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
only a little bit of backing up because

the floor pan would have to get cut off
right<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.800> floor<00:03:19.040> plan<00:03:19.220> would<00:03:19.280> have<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.490> get

right the floor plan would have to get

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.790 
right the floor plan would have to get
cut<00:03:19.820> off<00:03:19.970> too<00:03:20.150> here<00:03:20.420> right<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:20.960> then<00:03:21.650> they

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
cut off too here right and then they

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.190 
cut off too here right and then they
give<00:03:21.980> us<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.220> metal<00:03:22.630> it's<00:03:23.630> gonna<00:03:23.750> go<00:03:23.930> back

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200
