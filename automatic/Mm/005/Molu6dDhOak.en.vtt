00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.519
 Nine people I'm more likely to get steffen 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.429
 you get a new video of marginal wood from 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.639
 other weapons for us was at f2000 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.220
 you can unlock them from 124000 with the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.660
 Tax data is not too low now 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.100
 but again not that much 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.850
 I would have been so good in midfield 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.470
 already fits the damage is 25 to 18.4 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.820
 that means in close combat you become four 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.170
 Need hits to kill an enemy 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.360
 under fair fight a maximum of six hits 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.100
 popstar at eight meters job and at 50 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.530
 meter that is from eight meters is the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.320
 he has to be hurt less than 150 meters 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.110
 Minimum value reached is 30 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.050
 plus a shot so 3 31 balls nothing 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.190
 special only the pharma and the g3 a3 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.860
 have less the rest 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.610
 storm rifles have as much as the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.280
 Fire rate is 850 balls per minute 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.280
 Pretty good actually is almost with one 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 the best values only ihk the farmer 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.809
 are even better over the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.960
 a94 talk in burst mode because no 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.600
 burst mode can get you 1200 mpm 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.159
 but it is relatively impossible so fast 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.780
 with the mouse key would therefore press 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.509
 i say f2000 is the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.520
 third quickest weapon and that's it 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.810
 good 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.250
 speed is 600 meters per 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.189
 second and this will increase the range 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.689
 Being 900 meters is nothing now 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.850
 special is actually medium 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.740
 classic not worth bad and also 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.720
 not very well 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.180
 the after la time if I'm still one 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.670
 ball in the run is 25 seconds 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.439
 and if it is completely empty 35 seconds 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.119
 that's a bit longer if it means 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.520
 you once in close combat since opponents directly 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.560
 Now before you; then you must rattle their 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.840
 even to himself and there threw poignant 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.680
 with which the opponents kill because 25 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.220
 seconds or 35 seconds after location 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.560
 incredibly long 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.860
 That's why you always have to be careful 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.810
 for spreading the visor 04 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.549
 that means as much as if this was the case 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.110
 know more exactly how is the livestock farmers 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.540
 the eca is a bit more accurate 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.920
 but not so great that is 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.959
 so if you are in the scope and shoot 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.950
 no balls also good and like 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.380
 go wrong 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.470
 that's what she's aiming for when you look at herself 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.150
 moves a little better since she 07 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.990
 most of the weapons attack the storm rifles at 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.840
 10 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.090
 Also called weapons is the FW 2000 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.280
 the pulpo weapon that means only when 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.230
 You in the scope of pages have been moving since you 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.420
 faster than when the normal wolff 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.440
 price of the magazine 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.480
 and they are still in motion 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.250
 a bit more accurate than the vote would be 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.600
 not in the pop but still stop 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.310
 still has exactly when you are but 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.680
 still deaf that means they could one 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.810
 bit more aggressive play from likely 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.490
 the webdesign is also better 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.170
 a little bit that is you 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.290
 meets better than one 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.400
 16 3 for example and that's it 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.920
 not bad that cares for more 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.930
 Aggressive gameplay with the weapon only 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.660
 even to the recoil of the whole again 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.960
 beautiful is definitely 05 after 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.610
 left and right skin in there 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.370
 Hardly any weapons have such a high one 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.740
 recoil diane 90s for example, also 0 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.410
 5 and 0 5 so on both sides 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.210
 and that's very close to that 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.980
 The weapon skin is sometimes good and 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.420
 like to turn left to right over the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.640
 not only skin left and right 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.330
 both sides very strong upwards 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.740
 she has 026 is one piece lower 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.960
 is quite good actually that's it 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.530
 much worse energy 33 to 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.850
 Example , the 045 for example so the vÃ¶z 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.890
 she is not so bad upstairs though 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.500
 outwardly the relatively strong pure 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.810
 above all, multiply at the first 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.280
 Shot is 3.0 that is if you the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.350
 first shot and make your weapon 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.630
 beats her somewhat stronger entertaining 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.400
 threefold threefold that is then 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.220
 really blatant that the threefold is possible 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.840
 yes everywhere so yes yes with that 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.310
 so burst the single shot of 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.860
 balls you have a little bit there 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.030
 watch out 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.280
 summary so you symbol pub that 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.970
 Precisely means faster in the 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.320
 visor 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.000
 but that's the thing for a long time too 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.580
 a little longer and the spill in 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.360
 Movement too high is the fire rate 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.880
 quite high 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.500
 the mess messias unfortunately high and the 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.209
 conclusion thus also means visor 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.580
 It is always a bit difficult 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.370
 with the weapon and she loads long 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.620
 unfortunately only to the records that 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.840
 ironside so no messiah eyes and 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.670
 Korn is actually quite good at 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.270
 You can even really enjoy f2000 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.970
 play 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.460
 but I'm more of a cobra cobra 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.870
 offers great field of vision because of the edge 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.280
 of the ko 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.490
 the edge of the visor and also the 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.780
 lower part of the kug disco practice hood 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.460
 not as much of the screen as it is 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.720
 an example in reflex reflex but provides 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.760
 for making such a big dick 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.260
 the bar has the good and likes the times 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.669
 that's all the enemy's face-down 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
 Of course not necessarily the meaning of 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.940
 thing therefore the cobra is missing in the 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.030
 offensive area yet again 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.860
 You can better step two on it 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.080
 either take the front handle 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.760
 no tower or two legs I 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.680
 would be more for the front handle because 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.860
 the recoil is really blatant and I have 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.419
 after my tests, he saves 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.620
 front forces really a lot so the 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.820
 Regulation can get a whole lot out 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.800
 should that he would me too 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.490
 I would really take 5 and 5 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.380
 give points 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.090
 In any case you will have the advantage 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.440
 Really remember and without a front handle 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.780
 suggests the weapon simply everywhere 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.430
 and then you can distance for a long time 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.810
 to hit the opponent more because the easy 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.430
 always misses because the weapon 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.870
 The opponents simply take beats 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.530
 Therefore, because I tell the women attacked 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.289
 doing his job really good there 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.180
 last tower row the laser is 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.410
 that is highly recommended because by 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.389
 we already have the bold visual 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.000
 So we should do better precision 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.680
 even better by the laser so the 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.720
 you can take good and happy times 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.190
 in any case in the offensive fight 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.630
 Pay for it 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.099
 but I sprinkle for her he is natural 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.660
 then through the front, the lasers attacked 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.580
 very high that's why you meet in the 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.800
 Do not sight so much except on 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.900
 short distances of course 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.460
 Muffler is quite good at the 2000 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.810
 because muffler is on fast 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.940
 always good to use the weapons 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.190
 Nevertheless, one should still be accurate 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.900
 lowers recoil and one 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.699
 does not appear on the minimap is 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.110
 half to the switch of 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.820
 recommendable or damage 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.010
 distance is a bit good 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.169
 why not the 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.210
 the opinion pollster he recommends the 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.190
 Mongolian says I must take the summer 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.440
 say yes that is not so important now 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.419
 the practice is likely to weaken the 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.530
 accuracy from the visor was not 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.419
 be improved 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.650
 the rebound up is not so 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.810
 bad is there I would say - because 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.550
 you do not have to take a few 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.070
 maybe for not so experienced players 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.880
 you can use the magician but 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.440
 try it someday 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.690
 it's not so nice to get used to it 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.639
 rather the heavy running of the height 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.190
 second recoil to the top was not 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.200
 always necessarily so doll is but the 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.740
 Precision in sight simply rises 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.180
 enormously 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.110
 you can do much better in sight 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.160
 what to meet 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.470
 so also the opponents distance 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.820
 the damage sinks later that is to say 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.250
 At a distance, you see more in this way 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.010
 hurt because of the drop staying 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.480
 later damage would be later 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.790
 even a heavy run there very much 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.040
 practically on the weapon as a conclusion would 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.410
 either tell the cobra the infront 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.810
 handle and the laser or cobra visor 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.160
 front handle and heavy running well 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.080
 hopefully you liked it 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.080
 At the next video, it's pure people
