00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.050 
for so let's get into the video and what
I<00:00:28.019> would<00:00:28.230> spend<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.650> huge<00:00:29.130> chunk<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.609> cash<00:00:29.820> on

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
I would spend this huge chunk of cash on

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.999 
I would spend this huge chunk of cash on
so<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> very<00:00:31.050> first<00:00:31.199> thing<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.529> would<00:00:31.650> do<00:00:31.800> is

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
so the very first thing I would do is

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.799 
so the very first thing I would do is
put<00:00:32.250> four<00:00:32.550> hundred<00:00:32.910> thousand<00:00:33.239> dollars<00:00:33.540> into

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
put four hundred thousand dollars into

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.780 
put four hundred thousand dollars into
slow<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.530> steady<00:00:34.710> stats<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.219> mutual<00:00:35.610> funds

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
slow and steady stats and mutual funds

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.400 
slow and steady stats and mutual funds
this<00:00:36.000> way<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.660> money<00:00:36.870> will<00:00:37.050> make<00:00:37.110> money

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
this way that that money will make money

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.530 
this way that that money will make money
on<00:00:37.739> itself<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> will<00:00:39.000> continue<00:00:39.420> making

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
on itself so I will continue making

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.479 
on itself so I will continue making
money<00:00:39.870> without<00:00:40.290> having<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.920> anything<00:00:41.160> in

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
money without having to do anything in

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.520 
money without having to do anything in
addition<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.930> would<00:00:43.079> take<00:00:43.200> two

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
addition to that I would take two

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.110 
addition to that I would take two
hundred<00:00:43.649> thousand<00:00:44.100> dollars<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.520> put<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.820> into

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
