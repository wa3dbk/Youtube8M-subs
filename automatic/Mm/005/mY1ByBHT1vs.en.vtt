00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.279
 that has national coach 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.459
 first if there is also a day 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.630
 including one in Haiti 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.300
 yet further away 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.300

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.999
 Higher education 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.509
 that in the citizen total 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.940
 and it is also very far away 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.730
 the cells 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.030
 I'm ali 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.310
 one online 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.450
 9 regular buses from the UK 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.360
 is the same as a reward 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.870
 and columns 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.370
 salient detail 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.370
 are you a whole team 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.540
 4energy persie and sometimes win 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.140
 this is actually work 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.510

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.510
 the or flexibility and the rossi 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.240
 or your newspaper 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.830
 just though make powerful move 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.190
 to the title 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.770
 yet it became massive 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.770
 at work 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.060
 in Brazil 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.020
 that is being able to 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.020
 as a company that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.630

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.100
 the lead 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.730
 a length that the blue line 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.460
 but do not come from banks 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.440
 That's for safety's sake that it's not at a trader's 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.710

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.949
 if it is jumbo 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.599

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.479
 the supplier 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.839
