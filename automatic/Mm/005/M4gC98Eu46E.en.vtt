hi<00:00:06.480> I'm<00:00:06.660> Andy<00:00:06.990> they're<00:00:07.170> at<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.410> studio<00:00:07.740> here

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
hi I'm Andy they're at the studio here

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.720 
hi I'm Andy they're at the studio here
and<00:00:08.160> we're<00:00:08.550> going<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.849> do<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:08.970> little<00:00:09.150> product

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
and we're going to do a little product

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.070 
and we're going to do a little product
demonstration<00:00:11.730> identification<00:00:12.540> but<00:00:12.750> some<00:00:12.990> of

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
demonstration identification but some of

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.880 
demonstration identification but some of
the<00:00:13.139> products<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.710> use<00:00:14.330> one<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.509> big

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
the products I use one of the big

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.400 
the products I use one of the big
differences<00:00:16.890> between<00:00:17.900> Sundy<00:00:18.900> painting<00:00:19.289> and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
differences between Sundy painting and

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.710 
differences between Sundy painting and
professional<00:00:19.949> painting<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:21.119> ability<00:00:21.570> to

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
professional painting is the ability to

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.689 
professional painting is the ability to
handle<00:00:22.080> wet<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.439> wet<00:00:22.470> materials<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.519> I

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
handle wet on wet materials and that I

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.340 
handle wet on wet materials and that I
hate<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.180> use<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.510> word<00:00:24.539> chemistry<00:00:25.199> but

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
hate to use the word chemistry but

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.810 
hate to use the word chemistry but
that's<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:25.680> more<00:00:25.769> about<00:00:26.070> chemistry<00:00:26.609> and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
that's really more about chemistry and

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.670 
that's really more about chemistry and
viscosities<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.840> liquids<00:00:28.260> than<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.529> is

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
viscosities of liquids than it is

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
viscosities of liquids than it is
anything<00:00:29.099> else<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.550> there<00:00:30.119> are<00:00:30.210> different

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
anything else so there are different

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.780 
anything else so there are different
liquids<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.199> powders<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.949> use<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.430> keep<00:00:32.610> my

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
liquids and powders I use to keep my

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.720 
liquids and powders I use to keep my
paint<00:00:33.090> wetter<00:00:33.450> or<00:00:33.750> drier<00:00:34.190> give<00:00:35.190> me<00:00:35.340> more<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.640> an

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
paint wetter or drier give me more of an

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.520 
paint wetter or drier give me more of an
impasto<00:00:36.329> surface<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.020> means<00:00:37.140> let<00:00:37.380> my

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
impasto surface that means let my

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.889 
impasto surface that means let my
brushstrokes<00:00:38.129> stand<00:00:38.550> up<00:00:38.790> more<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.270> let<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
brushstrokes stand up more or let the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.840 
brushstrokes stand up more or let the
brushstroke<00:00:40.350> fade<00:00:40.620> away<00:00:40.950> more<00:00:41.219> depending<00:00:41.760> on

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
brushstroke fade away more depending on

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.880 
brushstroke fade away more depending on
what<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> want<00:00:42.360> right<00:00:43.200> now<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.500> I'm<00:00:43.620> looking

so<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.770> tend<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.880> use<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.060> cold<00:01:09.479> although

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
so I tend to just use it cold although

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
so I tend to just use it cold although
in<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> past<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.650> heated<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.130> today<00:01:11.640> we're

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
in the past I have heated it today we're

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.690 
in the past I have heated it today we're
going<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> use<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.240> cold<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.650> usually<00:01:14.520> have

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
going to use it cold and I usually have

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.719 
going to use it cold and I usually have
it<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.000> big<00:01:15.270> jug<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.229> was<00:01:17.100> able<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.430> get<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it in a big jug but I was able to get a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.760 
it in a big jug but I was able to get a
hold<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.240> very<00:01:18.450> nice<00:01:18.659> conveniently<00:01:19.500> sized

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
hold of a very nice conveniently sized

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.340 
hold of a very nice conveniently sized
piece<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.880> percentage<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.689> wax<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.110> use

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
piece and the percentage of wax you use

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.170 
piece and the percentage of wax you use
to<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> percentage<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.580> paint<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.090> very

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
to the percentage of paint is very

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
to the percentage of paint is very
important<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:25.710> I'm<00:01:25.830> trying<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.189> do<00:01:26.280> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
important so what I'm trying to do is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.249 
important so what I'm trying to do is
add<00:01:26.549> enough<00:01:26.850> wax<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.420> let<00:01:27.570> my<00:01:27.689> brushstrokes

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
add enough wax to let my brushstrokes

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.100 
add enough wax to let my brushstrokes
stand<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.060> use<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> mixed

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
stand up and so I'm going to use a mixed

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.800 
stand up and so I'm going to use a mixed
black<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.130> wax<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.759> come<00:01:33.030> into<00:01:33.210> these<00:01:33.479> trees

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
black and wax to come into these trees

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.179 
black and wax to come into these trees
and<00:01:34.049> give<00:01:34.170> them<00:01:34.350> some<00:01:34.530> surface<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.100> will

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and give them some surface that will

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.550 
and give them some surface that will
come<00:01:35.369> back<00:01:35.820> again<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.420> paint<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.500> I'm

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
come back again and paint on so I'm

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.679 
come back again and paint on so I'm
going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.710> use<00:01:37.829> about<00:01:37.920> 10%<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> wax<00:01:38.909> -<00:01:39.450> 10

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
going to use about 10% of the wax - 10

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.440 
going to use about 10% of the wax - 10
to<00:01:39.810> 15%<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.560> wax<00:01:40.770> into<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.759> mixed<00:01:42.150> black

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to 15% of the wax into a mixed black

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.270 
to 15% of the wax into a mixed black
which<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> burnt<00:01:43.530> sienna<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.829> ultramarine

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
which is a burnt sienna and ultramarine

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.679 
which is a burnt sienna and ultramarine
blue<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:45.649> I'll<00:01:46.649> mix<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.420> trying<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.450> get<00:01:48.600> it

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
blue and I'll mix that trying to get it

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.590 
blue and I'll mix that trying to get it
pretty<00:01:48.990> close<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.380> dead<00:01:49.710> center<00:01:50.390> you<00:01:51.390> can

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
pretty close to a dead center you can

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.330 
pretty close to a dead center you can
without<00:01:51.990> much<00:01:52.200> effort<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:52.890> get<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.189> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
without much effort you can get that to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.590 
without much effort you can get that to
a<00:01:53.369> neutral<00:01:53.820> black<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:55.790> I'll<00:01:56.790> test<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.420> by

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
a neutral black and I'll test that by

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.330 
a neutral black and I'll test that by
putting<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.990> little<00:01:58.020> bit<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.439> white<00:01:58.680> into<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.159> to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
putting a little bit of white into it to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.990 
putting a little bit of white into it to
see<00:01:59.549> how<00:02:00.090> pure<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:00.899> impure<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:02.520> color<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.880> it

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
see how pure or impure the color is it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.580 
see how pure or impure the color is it
looks<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.210> little<00:02:03.270> Brown<00:02:03.570> that's<00:02:04.320> close<00:02:04.560> enough

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
looks a little Brown that's close enough

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.950 
looks a little Brown that's close enough
for<00:02:04.860> me<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.790> then<00:02:05.909> I'll<00:02:06.000> take<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.360> wax<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.810> I'm

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
for me so then I'll take the wax and I'm

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.600 
for me so then I'll take the wax and I'm
going<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> look<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> percentage<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.429> so

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
going to look for a percentage here so

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.720 
going to look for a percentage here so
my<00:02:09.179> goal<00:02:09.390> isn't<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.780> make<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.080> waxy<00:02:10.770> paint<00:02:11.129> it's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
my goal isn't to make a waxy paint it's

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.070 
my goal isn't to make a waxy paint it's
to<00:02:11.970> make<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.420> paint<00:02:12.780> that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
to make a paint that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.370 
to make a paint that
has<00:02:13.260> enough<00:02:14.540> viscosity<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.660> my<00:02:15.810> brushstroke

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
has enough viscosity that my brushstroke

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.800 
has enough viscosity that my brushstroke
will<00:02:16.530> stand<00:02:16.830> up<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.730> I'll<00:02:17.850> mix<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.300> paint<00:02:18.540> in

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
will stand up so I'll mix the paint in

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.870 
will stand up so I'll mix the paint in
and<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.530> can<00:02:19.710> see<00:02:19.950> instantly<00:02:20.490> when<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.670> have

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
and you can see instantly when you have

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.300 
and you can see instantly when you have
enough<00:02:21.180> because<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.080> natural<00:02:22.470> sheen<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
enough because the natural sheen of the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.940 
enough because the natural sheen of the
oil<00:02:23.490> dies<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.420> see<00:02:24.600> kind<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.020> wax

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
oil dies and you see kind of a wax

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.600 
oil dies and you see kind of a wax
surface<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.060> then<00:02:27.570> I<00:02:27.600> use<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.610> fairly

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
surface to it and then I use a fairly

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.360 
surface to it and then I use a fairly
broad<00:02:29.910> brush<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> Richardson<00:02:31.980> wash

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
broad brush this is a Richardson wash

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.020 
broad brush this is a Richardson wash
brush<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.210> number<00:02:33.540> two<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.700> I'll<00:02:35.700> scoop

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
brush it's a number two and I'll scoop

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.240 
brush it's a number two and I'll scoop
the<00:02:36.210> paint<00:02:36.450> up<00:02:36.630> now<00:02:36.870> get<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.740> on<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.920> tip<00:02:38.220> of

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
the paint up now get it on the tip of

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.430 
the paint up now get it on the tip of
the<00:02:38.430> brush<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.030> I'll<00:02:39.570> come<00:02:39.810> across<00:02:40.140> and

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
the brush and I'll come across and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.830 
the brush and I'll come across and
create<00:02:40.740> a<00:02:40.770> on<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.340> surface<00:02:41.550> I'll<00:02:42.240> create<00:02:42.750> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
create a on the surface I'll create a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.290 
create a on the surface I'll create a
rhythm<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.710> is<00:02:44.130> going<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.400> simulate<00:02:44.700> bark

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
rhythm to that is going to simulate bark

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.110 
rhythm to that is going to simulate bark
at<00:02:45.540> another<00:02:45.840> stage<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.680> I'm<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:47.400> building

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
at another stage and I'm just building

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.199 
at another stage and I'm just building
up<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.450> surface<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.990> that<00:02:49.110> paint<00:02:49.640> at<00:02:50.640> my<00:02:51.180> eye

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
up the surface of that paint at my eye

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.890 
up the surface of that paint at my eye
level<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.980> line<00:02:53.280> will<00:02:53.459> be<00:02:53.580> dead<00:02:54.480> across

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
level that that line will be dead across

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.080 
level that that line will be dead across
but<00:02:55.290> as<00:02:55.410> we<00:02:55.560> go<00:02:55.680> above<00:02:55.950> my<00:02:56.160> eye<00:02:56.190> level<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.850> arc

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
but as we go above my eye level that arc

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.350 
but as we go above my eye level that arc
is<00:02:57.270> going<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.620> will<00:02:58.620> turn<00:02:59.040> down<00:02:59.700> with<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> arc

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
is going to will turn down with the arc

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.390 
is going to will turn down with the arc
and<00:03:00.600> below<00:03:00.870> my<00:03:01.020> eye<00:03:01.050> level<00:03:01.410> will<00:03:01.709> turn<00:03:01.980> up<00:03:02.220> so

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
and below my eye level will turn up so

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.420 
and below my eye level will turn up so
we're<00:03:02.580> giving<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.940> kind<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:04.130> volume<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
we're giving a kind of a volume to the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.850 
we're giving a kind of a volume to the
tree<00:03:05.730> while<00:03:05.940> we're<00:03:06.209> putting<00:03:07.020> in<00:03:07.140> some<00:03:07.350> surface

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
tree while we're putting in some surface

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.310 
tree while we're putting in some surface
I've<00:03:08.430> already<00:03:08.850> done<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.510> some<00:03:09.750> extent<00:03:10.170> on

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
I've already done that to some extent on

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.990 
I've already done that to some extent on
some<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.680> these<00:03:10.770> trees<00:03:11.130> like<00:03:11.370> here<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.820> can

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
some of these trees like here you can

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.180 
some of these trees like here you can
see<00:03:12.270> I've<00:03:12.510> gotten<00:03:13.170> some<00:03:13.350> those<00:03:13.709> vertical

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
see I've gotten some those vertical

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.310 
see I've gotten some those vertical
stripes<00:03:14.520> across<00:03:14.910> using<00:03:15.240> that<00:03:15.570> wax<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.290> that

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
stripes across using that wax and that

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.800 
stripes across using that wax and that
lets<00:03:17.190> me<00:03:17.310> then<00:03:17.550> come<00:03:17.790> across<00:03:17.970> I'll<00:03:18.510> give<00:03:18.690> you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
lets me then come across I'll give you

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.420 
lets me then come across I'll give you
one<00:03:19.050> stroke<00:03:19.530> with<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.550> softer<00:03:21.209> brush<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:22.400> tend<00:03:23.400> to

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
one stroke with a softer brush I tend to

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.070 
one stroke with a softer brush I tend to
use<00:03:23.519> filbert's<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.420> I'll<00:03:24.660> go<00:03:24.840> over<00:03:24.959> that

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
use filbert's and I'll go over that

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.040 
use filbert's and I'll go over that
later<00:03:25.440> but<00:03:25.850> my<00:03:26.850> feel<00:03:27.300> Burt<00:03:27.450> say<00:03:27.660> it's<00:03:27.810> stay

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
later but my feel Burt say it's stay

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.800 
later but my feel Burt say it's stay
very<00:03:28.230> long<00:03:28.590> because<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.130> tend<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.610> roll<00:03:30.450> them

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
very long because I tend to roll them

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.960 
very long because I tend to roll them
and<00:03:31.050> work<00:03:31.440> with<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.860> edges<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.550> filbert

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
and work with the edges of the filbert

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.000 
and work with the edges of the filbert
rather<00:03:33.209> than<00:03:33.480> draw<00:03:34.170> with<00:03:34.410> them<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.680> use<00:03:34.800> the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
rather than draw with them and use the

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.030 
rather than draw with them and use the
tip<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:36.180> I'll<00:03:36.269> pick<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.570> color<00:03:37.410> that'll<00:03:37.680> stand

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
tip so I'll pick a color that'll stand

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.280 
tip so I'll pick a color that'll stand
out<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.459> these<00:03:38.610> birches<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.390> without<00:03:40.110> any

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
out on these birches and without any

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.310 
out on these birches and without any
medium<00:03:40.739> I'll<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.400> come<00:03:41.940> across<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.660> let

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
medium I'll just come across and let

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.710 
medium I'll just come across and let
that<00:03:43.500> surface<00:03:44.130> pull<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.700> paint<00:03:44.970> off<00:03:45.209> so<00:03:45.239> with

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
that surface pull the paint off so with

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.880 
that surface pull the paint off so with
a<00:03:45.750> single<00:03:46.230> stroke<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.890> have<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.670> multitude<00:03:48.150> of

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
a single stroke I have a multitude of

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.199 
a single stroke I have a multitude of
references<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.070> look<00:03:50.220> like<00:03:50.400> bark<00:03:50.790> across

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
references that look like bark across

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.090 
references that look like bark across
the<00:03:51.450> surface<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:52.230> that's<00:03:52.650> one<00:03:52.830> of<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.980> ways

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
the surface and that's one of the ways

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.310 
the surface and that's one of the ways
I'll<00:03:53.310> use<00:03:53.489> wax<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.090> here<00:03:54.300> I'm<00:03:54.420> putting<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.230> in

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
I'll use wax so here I'm putting it in

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.089 
I'll use wax so here I'm putting it in
for<00:03:55.560> as

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
for as

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.920 
for as
so<00:03:56.219> at<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.400> later<00:03:56.519> date<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.060> can<00:03:57.359> come<00:03:57.540> back<00:03:57.689> and

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
so at a later date I can come back and

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.849 
so at a later date I can come back and
make<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.650> reference<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.670> bar
