00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello everyone so today 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.100
 we will make the dough dirty family 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.030
 so to do this you will need to 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.519
 2 worms of flour for a glass of water and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.440
 of course the opposite of that but I 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.790
 want to allow an entire glass of salt that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.580
 would be too wasteful 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.640
 so we'll see how much I m 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.400
 so I'm already going m but verses from 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:30.029
 flour but crazy people everywhere 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.900
 here you have a background music 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.900
 it's diego 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.829
 you will put the salt 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.710
 So that's quite enough 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:54.160
 but you do not need it either 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:54.160
 entire glass and then gradually batch 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.510
 really little by little I took 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.510
 Luke warm water 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.580
 and concert becomes more consistent you 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.580
 take the fingers to mix 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.150
 here it is too liquid to add 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.020
 the flour every time so it makes a 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.530
 small quantity 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.650
 it really does 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.220
 by who 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.480
 that was not needed precisely 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.590
 of all the glass of water a game of 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.640
 roulette of flour that's what he 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.810
 must really stick to the finger 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.720
 that's it once I'm done 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.010
 shows what it looks like so if that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.190
 glue do not hesitate to put some 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:02:00.990
 flour to hoist at the microphone formats 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.460
 my job but you must not crush it 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.450
 as it takes the first job and 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.709
 dylan and if it sticks again you add 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.560
 a little bit of flour schools had 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.320
 flour one rolls in the flour and you 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.730
 rolls and you knead it like that you have 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.140
 otherwise conducted no map 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.140
 look more broadcast 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:37.850
 we go wrong we counted more at home 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.850
 me 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.230
 we will be able to do something 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.350
 well to do another time on the 20th and 25th 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.080
 for which we saw them I do not have 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.220
 does a lot a lot are expecting a 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.170
 once again at extracurricular 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.170
 we did it did not but it 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.300
 does not give us what you write 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.610
 had it before the little ones 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.060
 okay so that's the patel hand and 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.950
 warns nicole more we have not scored 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.970
 we will be able to start making 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.870
 things here so here we put our 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.820
 little baked stuff so mafia makes a 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.590
 hedgehog me I made a snake in 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.970
 twice because it was not so 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.940
 we'll see what it looks like it looks like 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.170
 nothing but we will see when it will be painted 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.810
 and everything and everything 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.300
 so here is our little creation our 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.680
 small creations in salt dough 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.239
 so I just came back because 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.239
 that I did not have enough bahts so 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.260
 my daughter decided to make a hedgehog 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:08.110
 penne with that here it is not 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.069
 no bread nor worms nor did my son 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.650
 a snail 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.989
 you will find the echo that in all 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.109
 leclerc style stores and all that 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.930
 empty shells they are 3 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.320
 euros the game pack it's more me 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.139
 I had taken to do some DIY 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.160
 so it's empty snails 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:36.520
 then that's the little hedgehog of 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:39.430
 my son and spoke of heaven and it 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.410
 it is my snake precisely that I you 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.500
 had presented in two ways I stuck 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:51.340
 the head I paint them I varnish them here 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:54.130
 and then there this tax you take a pot 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:59.590
 of glass yoghurt you put the dough to 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:02.560
 salt on the turn and you can do for the 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.120
 deform and it makes you a burden for 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.610
 tidy up a bit of everything and anything 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.160
 an empty pocket here for our little 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.690
 creation I hope you like it and 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.710
 we meet again for 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.729
