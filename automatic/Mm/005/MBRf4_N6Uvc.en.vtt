the image actually goes to a different
location<00:01:19.670> that's<00:01:20.670> opposed<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> Dreamweaver

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
more noticeable if you put it on the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.530 
more noticeable if you put it on the

window now let me show you what you can
do<00:02:03.570> your<00:02:04.409> rows<00:02:04.649> will<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.100> basically<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.030> rows

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
do your rows will be basically the rows

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.510 
do your rows will be basically the rows
you<00:02:06.509> know<00:02:06.659> how<00:02:07.200> many<00:02:07.350> rows<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.399> you

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
you know how many rows you have as you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.910 
you know how many rows you have as you
see<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.879> have<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.390> one<00:02:09.629> two<00:02:10.080> three<00:02:10.590> four

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
see we have you know one two three four

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.500 
see we have you know one two three four
that'll<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.730> basically<00:02:12.030> how<00:02:12.180> many<00:02:12.360> rows

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that'll be it basically how many rows

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.490 
that'll be it basically how many rows
you<00:02:12.660> have

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you have

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.530 
you have
the<00:02:13.800> columns<00:02:14.250> are<00:02:14.400> how<00:02:14.550> many<00:02:14.610> boxes<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.510> have

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the columns are how many boxes you have

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.590 
the columns are how many boxes you have
inside<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.470> row<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.210> have<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.510> know

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
inside the row so you can have you know

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.260 
inside the row so you can have you know
three<00:02:18.960> four<00:02:18.990> five<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:20.400> if<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.670> had<00:02:20.790> two<00:02:21.060> rows

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
three four five so if you had two rows

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.140 
three four five so if you had two rows
you'd<00:02:21.540> have<00:02:21.720> five<00:02:22.310> columns<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.460> each<00:02:23.580> row<00:02:23.910> or

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
you'd have five columns in each row or

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.700 
you'd have five columns in each row or
if<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.330> had<00:02:24.420> one<00:02:24.570> row<00:02:24.840> you'd<00:02:25.080> have<00:02:25.260> two

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
if you had one row you'd have two

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.170 
if you had one row you'd have two
columns<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.220> each<00:02:26.310> row<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.610> know<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.820> works

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
columns in each row you know it works

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.360 
columns in each row you know it works
like<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:28.470> can<00:02:28.620> change<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.890> table<00:02:29.250> with

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
like that you can change the table with

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.990 
like that you can change the table with
the<00:02:30.120> border<00:02:30.450> thickness<00:02:31.100> cell<00:02:32.100> padding<00:02:32.340> cell

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the border thickness cell padding cell

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.560 
the border thickness cell padding cell
spacing<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:34.410> also<00:02:34.830> have<00:02:35.330> four<00:02:36.330> header

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
spacing and you also have four header

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.720 
spacing and you also have four header
options<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.350> none<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:38.250> have<00:02:38.280> left

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
options you have a none you have left

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.430 
options you have a none you have left
this<00:02:38.850> works<00:02:39.090> with<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.600> know<00:02:39.690> tabs<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.260> stuff

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
this works with you know tabs and stuff

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.150 
this works with you know tabs and stuff
same<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:40.740> top<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:42.030> both<00:02:42.270> let<00:02:43.080> me<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.620> keep

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
same with top and both let me just keep

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.070 
same with top and both let me just keep
it<00:02:44.310> at<00:02:44.400> none<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:45.300> also<00:02:45.450> just<00:02:45.690> put<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> summary

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
it at none can also just put a summary

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.930 
it at none can also just put a summary
if<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.500> want<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.710> like<00:02:46.830> have<00:02:47.190> your<00:02:47.370> own<00:02:47.490> table

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
if you want to like have your own table

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.260 
if you want to like have your own table

and we're going to be brought up with

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.000 
and we're going to be brought up with
the<00:02:52.740> table<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:54.090> can<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.510> know<00:02:54.570> make<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:55.020> any

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
see we can go to both editing boxes

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.400 
see we can go to both editing boxes
right<00:03:05.280> here<00:03:05.420> now<00:03:06.420> if<00:03:06.510> we<00:03:06.660> click<00:03:06.960> on<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.230> right

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
right here now if we click on the right

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.050 
right here now if we click on the right
hand<00:03:07.680> side<00:03:07.920> we<00:03:08.400> can<00:03:08.520> go<00:03:08.640> down<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.850> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
hand side we can go down to the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.560 
hand side we can go down to the
properties<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.690> this<00:03:10.250> table<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.570> change

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
properties of this table and change

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.240 
properties of this table and change
anything<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.170> we<00:03:13.260> had<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.860> original

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
anything that we had in the original

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.640 
anything that we had in the original
table<00:03:14.460> editing<00:03:14.970> box<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:16.050> if<00:03:16.170> we<00:03:16.290> wanted<00:03:16.530> this

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
table editing box so if we wanted this

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.880 
table editing box so if we wanted this
to<00:03:16.710> be<00:03:16.950> one<00:03:17.390> we<00:03:18.390> can<00:03:18.540> change<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.870> one<00:03:19.140> if<00:03:19.739> you

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
to be one we can change it to one if you

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.620 
to be one we can change it to one if you
wanted<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.370> be<00:03:20.400> three<00:03:22.520> 2350<00:03:23.630> continue

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
wanted this to be three 2350 continue

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.670 
wanted this to be three 2350 continue
350<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.370> also<00:03:26.520> I<00:03:26.670> think<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.150> most

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
350 you can also I think the most

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.170 
350 you can also I think the most
important<00:03:28.680> tool<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.950> use<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.670> border<00:03:30.000> I

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
important tool to use is the border I

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.449 
important tool to use is the border I
really<00:03:31.020> like<00:03:31.170> this<00:03:31.350> being<00:03:31.620> at<00:03:31.709> zero<00:03:31.739> because

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
really like this being at zero because

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.920 
really like this being at zero because
basically<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:33.060> shows<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.480> can<00:03:33.630> put<00:03:33.810> an<00:03:33.870> image

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
basically it shows you can put an image

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.160 
basically it shows you can put an image
anywhere<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:35.670> know<00:03:35.870> no<00:03:36.870> one<00:03:36.989> would<00:03:37.050> even

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
anywhere and you know no one would even

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.050 
anywhere and you know no one would even
know<00:03:37.500> or<00:03:37.830> even<00:03:38.100> have<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.459> hint<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:38.850> you're

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
know or even have a hint that you're

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.550 
know or even have a hint that you're
using<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.390> table<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:40.470> it's<00:03:40.590> really<00:03:40.739> helpful<00:03:41.340> um

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
using a table so it's really helpful um

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.820 
using a table so it's really helpful um
so<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.830> we<00:03:43.980> were<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.340> insert<00:03:44.730> an<00:03:44.910> image<00:03:45.030> now

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
so if we were to insert an image now

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.900 
so if we were to insert an image now
insert<00:03:46.830> a<00:03:46.890> different<00:03:47.220> image<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:50.580> see<00:03:50.790> the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
insert a different image you see the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.060 
insert a different image you see the
image<00:03:51.239> goes<00:03:51.450> inside<00:03:51.989> of<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.440> table<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.010> you

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
image goes inside of the table and you

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.509 
image goes inside of the table and you
can<00:03:53.580> make<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.790> smaller<00:03:54.650> just<00:03:55.650> like<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.220> and

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
can make it smaller just like that and

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.530 
can make it smaller just like that and
you<00:03:57.120> can<00:03:57.269> also<00:03:58.250> align<00:03:59.250> this<00:03:59.519> left<00:04:00.180> center<00:04:00.510> or

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
you can also align this left center or

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.350 
you can also align this left center or
right<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:01.410> gives<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.830> three<00:04:02.280> main<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:03.330> know

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
right it gives you three main you know

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.240 
right it gives you three main you know
directions<00:04:04.140> unlike<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.709> other<00:04:04.860> ones<00:04:04.950> that

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
directions unlike the other ones that

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.180 
directions unlike the other ones that
don't<00:04:05.310> even<00:04:05.489> work<00:04:07.010> left<00:04:08.570> right<00:04:09.570> center<00:04:10.350> the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
don't even work left right center the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.350 
don't even work left right center the
other<00:04:11.820> ones<00:04:12.239> I<00:04:12.450> mean<00:04:13.220> like<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.610> know<00:04:14.670> baseline

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
other ones I mean like you know baseline

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.900 
other ones I mean like you know baseline
top<00:04:15.780> stuff<00:04:16.410> like<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.830> doesn't<00:04:17.370> really<00:04:17.640> work

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
top stuff like that doesn't really work

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.469 
top stuff like that doesn't really work
so<00:04:19.190> I'll<00:04:20.190> keep<00:04:20.459> that<00:04:20.640> in<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:20.790> center<00:04:21.090> now

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
so I'll keep that in the center now

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.670 
so I'll keep that in the center now
let's<00:04:21.690> say<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.870> wanted<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.109> move<00:04:22.260> this<00:04:22.380> image

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
go back into the table properties and

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.350 
go back into the table properties and
change<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.370> columns<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:27.030> two

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
change the columns to two

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.899 
change the columns to two
