tracking cable that comes with your fat

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.950 
tracking cable that comes with your fat
shark<00:00:09.960> attitudes<00:00:10.849> with<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> spectrum<00:00:12.690> or

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
shark attitudes with a spectrum or

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.060 
shark attitudes with a spectrum or
junior<00:00:13.530> type<00:00:14.389> transmitter<00:00:15.619> so<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> issue<00:00:16.859> we

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
junior type transmitter so the issue we

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.189 
junior type transmitter so the issue we
have<00:00:17.220> here<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.270> fat<00:00:18.420> sharks<00:00:18.690> come<00:00:18.960> with

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
have here is the fat sharks come with

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.070 
have here is the fat sharks come with
this<00:00:20.100> cable<00:00:20.539> for<00:00:22.070> head<00:00:23.070> tracking<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:24.080> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
this cable for head tracking and the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.849 
this cable for head tracking and the
connector<00:00:25.439> type<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.800> only<00:00:25.980> compatible<00:00:26.279> with

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
connector type is only compatible with

connector type is only compatible with
the<00:00:28.859> EZ<00:00:29.449> UHF<00:00:30.449> cable<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:32.279> end<00:00:32.460> goes<00:00:32.610> in

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
the EZ UHF cable so this end goes in

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.970 
the EZ UHF cable so this end goes in
your<00:00:32.850> goggles<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:34.170> other<00:00:34.320> end<00:00:34.559> goes<00:00:34.649> into

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
your goggles and the other end goes into

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.760 
your goggles and the other end goes into
your<00:00:35.100> transmitter<00:00:36.530> both<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.680> these

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
your transmitter both of these

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.459 
your transmitter both of these
connectors<00:00:38.250> are<00:00:38.899> incompatible<00:00:39.899> with<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
connectors are incompatible with the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.130 
connectors are incompatible with the
spectrum<00:00:41.040> type<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.430> connector<00:00:41.760> which<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.719> just

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
spectrum type of connector which is just

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.130 
spectrum type of connector which is just
three-and-a-half<00:00:44.010> millimeter<00:00:44.460> audio<00:00:44.670> jack

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.389 
three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack
so<00:00:46.760> this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.270> follow-up<00:00:48.660> video<00:00:48.899> on

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
so this is a follow-up video on

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.450 
so this is a follow-up video on
something<00:00:50.399> pulsar<00:00:51.410> had<00:00:52.410> already<00:00:52.530> posted<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
something pulsar had already posted and

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.529 
something pulsar had already posted and
I<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.969> wanted<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> give<00:00:54.329> some<00:00:54.480> extra

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
I just wanted to give some extra

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.569 
I just wanted to give some extra
information<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:55.829> help<00:00:56.039> clarify<00:00:56.250> any

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
information to help clarify any

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.639 
information to help clarify any
questions<00:00:56.730> people<00:00:57.270> might<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.480> about<00:00:57.649> color

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
questions people might have about color

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.200 
questions people might have about color
of<00:00:58.829> wires<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.809> pin<00:01:00.809> outs<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:02.149> using<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
of wires and pin outs so using the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.700 
of wires and pin outs so using the
information<00:01:03.359> pulsar<00:01:04.080> posted<00:01:05.540> excuse<00:01:06.540> me

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
information pulsar posted excuse me

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.520 
information pulsar posted excuse me
this<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.030> cables<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:10.110> came<00:01:10.380> with

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
this is one of the cables that came with

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380 
this is one of the cables that came with
the<00:01:10.619> fat<00:01:10.799> shark<00:01:11.040> attitudes<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.790> what<00:01:12.299> I've

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the fat shark attitudes and what I've

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.410 
the fat shark attitudes and what I've
done<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:13.140> clipped<00:01:13.799> off<00:01:14.030> this<00:01:15.030> end<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
done is just clipped off this end of the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.210 
done is just clipped off this end of the
cable<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.020> expose<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> wires<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:19.100> looking<00:01:20.100> at

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
cable and expose the wires so looking at

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.690 
cable and expose the wires so looking at
the<00:01:20.310> pin<00:01:20.490> out<00:01:20.580> from<00:01:20.759> pulsars<00:01:21.150> post<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.700> bottom

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the pin out from pulsars post the bottom

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.590 
the pin out from pulsars post the bottom
left<00:01:23.939> wire<00:01:24.320> on<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.770> connector<00:01:26.189> here<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:27.299> ground

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
left wire on a connector here is ground

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.080 
left wire on a connector here is ground
and<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.829> bottom<00:01:29.130> right<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:30.689> PPM<00:01:31.229> signal

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
and the bottom right is the PPM signal

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.420 
and the bottom right is the PPM signal
so<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.119> probe<00:01:33.600> these<00:01:33.810> wires<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.530> found<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so I probe these wires and found that

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.679 
so I probe these wires and found that
the<00:01:35.880> ground<00:01:36.150> corresponds<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.220> black<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.689> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the ground corresponds to black and the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.310 
the ground corresponds to black and the
PPM<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.700> actually<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> red<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.810> green<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
PPM is actually the red so green and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.210 
PPM is actually the red so green and
white<00:01:43.680> won't<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:45.090> needed<00:01:45.450> for

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
white won't really be needed for

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.350 
white won't really be needed for
converting<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.939> three-and-a-half

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
converting this to a three-and-a-half

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.120 
converting this to a three-and-a-half
millimeter<00:01:48.750> audio<00:01:48.840> jack<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:52.040> went<00:01:53.040> to

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
millimeter audio jack so went to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.920 
millimeter audio jack so went to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
and a half millimeters this is the screw

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.469 
and a half millimeters this is the screw
on<00:02:03.390> type<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:04.290> I'm<00:02:04.380> actually<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.100> be

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
on type but I'm actually going to be

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.839 
on type but I'm actually going to be
soldering<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:07.680> wires<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.369> each<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.759> these

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
soldering the wires to each of these

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.820 
soldering the wires to each of these
terminals<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.509> then<00:02:10.110> putting<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> screw<00:02:10.739> on

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
terminals and then putting the screw on

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.050 
terminals and then putting the screw on
top<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.940> provide<00:02:12.209> extra

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
top to provide extra

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.530 
top to provide extra
Nicolle<00:02:13.360> security<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.560> let's<00:02:17.680> go<00:02:17.770> ahead<00:02:17.890> and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
Nicolle security so let's go ahead and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.250 
Nicolle security so let's go ahead and
walk<00:02:19.540> around<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.840> wire<00:02:21.270> all<00:02:22.270> right<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:22.630> let's

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
walk around the wire all right so let's

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.990 
walk around the wire all right so let's
be<00:02:23.410> sure<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.830> put<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.130> insulating<00:02:24.550> jacket<00:02:24.580> on

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
be sure to put the insulating jacket on

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.100 
be sure to put the insulating jacket on
first<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:27.489> now<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:27.790> can<00:02:28.000> solder<00:02:28.209> a<00:02:28.330> wires<00:02:28.599> back

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.160 

so<00:02:35.110> again<00:02:35.319> black<00:02:35.590> goes<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.920> ground<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
so again black goes to ground on the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.830 
so again black goes to ground on the
connector<00:02:38.530> which<00:02:38.739> is<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:40.030> pin<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.300> goes<00:02:40.630> to

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
connector which is the pin that goes to
