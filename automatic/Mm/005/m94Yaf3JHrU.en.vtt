military-style rehearsal for that we

know we had one rehearsal room that we

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.900 
know we had one rehearsal room that we
rented<00:00:41.110> so<00:00:41.860> recently<00:00:42.250> come<00:00:42.399> in<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.579> morning

rented so recently come in the morning

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.610 
rented so recently come in the morning
and<00:00:43.149> then<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.539> Scott<00:00:43.870> and<00:00:43.899> John<00:00:44.230> were<00:00:44.379> coming

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
and then the Scott and John were coming

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.200 
and then the Scott and John were coming
later<00:00:44.739> then<00:00:45.100> we<00:00:45.370> start<00:00:45.550> to<00:00:45.640> come<00:00:45.760> back<00:00:45.789> to<00:00:46.090> the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
later then we start to come back to the

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.740 
later then we start to come back to the
whole<00:00:46.420> band<00:00:46.660> and<00:00:47.649> we'd<00:00:48.039> spend<00:00:48.340> you<00:00:49.180> know<00:00:49.239> all

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
whole band and we'd spend you know all

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.229 
whole band and we'd spend you know all
our<00:00:49.899> waking<00:00:50.140> hours<00:00:50.350> there<00:00:50.770> and<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.710> record

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
our waking hours there and that record

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.790 
our waking hours there and that record
actually<00:00:55.239> is<00:00:55.359> I<00:00:55.690> think<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.350> thing<00:00:56.769> that<00:00:56.800> that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
actually is I think the thing that that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.920 
actually is I think the thing that that
it<00:00:59.800> was<00:00:59.920> but<00:01:00.190> both<00:01:00.370> in<00:01:00.640> this<00:01:00.940> to<00:01:01.329> two<00:01:01.510> sides<00:01:01.750> of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
it was but both in this to two sides of

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.880 
it was but both in this to two sides of
the<00:01:02.050> coin<00:01:02.079> on<00:01:02.440> this<00:01:02.530> one<00:01:02.710> where<00:01:02.949> I<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.890> no

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
the coin on this one where I really no

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.740 
the coin on this one where I really no
matter<00:01:06.040> how<00:01:06.310> crazy<00:01:06.670> something<00:01:07.060> was<00:01:07.330> I<00:01:07.570> would

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
matter how crazy something was I would

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.399 
matter how crazy something was I would
still<00:01:07.990> try<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.740> I<00:01:09.640> think<00:01:09.880> that's<00:01:10.060> admirable

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
still try and I think that's admirable

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.780 
still try and I think that's admirable
except<00:01:11.409> that<00:01:11.619> I<00:01:11.770> would<00:01:11.950> try<00:01:12.159> things<00:01:12.400> that<00:01:12.460> that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
except that I would try things that that

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.590 
except that I would try things that that
were<00:01:13.600> generally<00:01:13.900> impractical<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:15.600> system

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
were generally impractical and system

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.060 
were generally impractical and system
like<00:01:16.810> when<00:01:16.960> I<00:01:16.990> go<00:01:17.170> back<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.530> I<00:01:17.590> play<00:01:17.799> any<00:01:17.920> of

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
like when I go back and I play any of

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.700 
like when I go back and I play any of
that<00:01:18.189> stuff<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.700> lot<00:01:19.570> of<00:01:19.630> times<00:01:19.750> I'll<00:01:19.990> refigure

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
that stuff a lot of times I'll refigure

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.990 
that stuff a lot of times I'll refigure
it<00:01:20.770> or<00:01:20.860> we<00:01:21.009> work<00:01:21.220> we<00:01:21.400> work<00:01:21.430> it<00:01:21.729> so<00:01:21.880> it's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
it or we work we work it so it's

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.350 
it or we work we work it so it's
actually<00:01:22.540> playable<00:01:23.200> because<00:01:24.240> some<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.270> that

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
actually playable because some of that

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.440 
actually playable because some of that
stuff<00:01:25.600> is<00:01:25.689> just<00:01:25.720> so<00:01:26.140> difficult<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:27.450> when

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
stuff is just so difficult and when

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.109 
stuff is just so difficult and when
something<00:01:28.720> is<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:28.960> difficult<00:01:29.140> in<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:29.799> it<00:01:30.579> makes

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
something is so difficult in it it makes

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.109 
something is so difficult in it it makes
it<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:31.509> you<00:01:31.930> can't<00:01:32.439> get<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.369> kind<00:01:33.549> of<00:01:33.610> clarity

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
it so you can't get the kind of clarity

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.130 
it so you can't get the kind of clarity
and<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:35.670> control<00:01:36.670> musically<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:37.990> might

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
and and control musically that you might

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.630 
and and control musically that you might
one<00:01:38.350> down<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.700> think<00:01:39.790> that's<00:01:40.180> as<00:01:40.869> I<00:01:41.220> as<00:01:42.220> I

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
one down and I think that's as I as I

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.069 
one down and I think that's as I as I
played<00:01:42.909> more<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.360> more<00:01:43.509> and<00:01:43.630> more<00:01:43.780> that's

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
played more and more and more that's

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.780 
played more and more and more that's
become<00:01:44.619> more<00:01:44.799> of<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:44.920> priority<00:01:45.100> for<00:01:45.460> me<00:01:45.610> but<00:01:45.729> I

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
become more of a priority for me but I

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.359 
become more of a priority for me but I
think<00:01:45.850> then<00:01:46.240> my<00:01:47.020> priority<00:01:47.350> was<00:01:47.380> intensity<00:01:48.100> and

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
think then my priority was intensity and

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.249 
think then my priority was intensity and
now<00:01:48.909> my<00:01:49.060> priorities<00:01:49.509> is<00:01:49.719> much<00:01:49.899> more<00:01:50.079> having

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
now my priorities is much more having

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.760 
now my priorities is much more having
Clara<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:50.890> be<00:01:51.040> able<00:01:51.219> to<00:01:51.310> really<00:01:51.960> get<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.680> know

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
Clara to be able to really get you know

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.950 
Clara to be able to really get you know
the<00:01:53.890> idea<00:01:54.130> from<00:01:54.369> my<00:01:54.610> brain<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.329> guitar<00:01:55.630> to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
the idea from my brain to the guitar to

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.700 
the idea from my brain to the guitar to
listener<00:01:56.409> without<00:01:56.829> a<00:01:57.040> lot<00:01:57.189> mess<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.590> know

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
listener without a lot mess and you know

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.230 
listener without a lot mess and you know
this<00:01:59.799> it's<00:02:00.040> not<00:02:00.159> a<00:02:00.189> horribly<00:02:00.610> messy<00:02:00.789> record

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
this it's not a horribly messy record

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.060 
this it's not a horribly messy record
but<00:02:01.390> it's<00:02:01.750> messier<00:02:02.110> than<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.380> would<00:02:02.740> like<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:03.039> to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
but it's messier than I would like it to

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:41.850 
but it's messier than I would like it to
be

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860
