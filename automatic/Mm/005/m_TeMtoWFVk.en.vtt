00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.280
 From the same day with the service of Studio Ghibli 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.350
 About the story of the brush you are using 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.170
 Mr. Tanaka, the director, talks about being able to participate 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.979
 doing 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.629
 Marije wave 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.820
 What is the summary of the village center of cosmos? 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.779
 I wanted to 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.400
 What is the brush used by technology by using two steals in the previous week 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.050
 It's a bit like earth and life 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.080
 I mainly use sheep, heels and raccoon dogs 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:32.739
 The feeling of the horse is taken in the thing that I want to grow 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:33.310
 You 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.730
 The people who play an important role here 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.430
 I like 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.740
 After all it is high 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.440
 Lhasa I might be surprised for a moment 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.070
 It is not quite something to eat in large quantities recently 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.870
 Animal protection- 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.270
 I'm going to talk 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.800
 There is also a decrease in the number of individuals and it is quite easy to obtain 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.340
 It is likely to disappear 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.040
 Even if there is the bottom in around 10 years in the future even if it is village village of brush pen 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.010
 But 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.010
 Well I'm a little worried about what will happen in the future 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.720
 Above all, the art department of Studio Ghibli 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.440
 It seems to use a lot of touch 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.440
 In this brush's village workshop's writing 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.550
 alone 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.400
 I think I use 67 brushes but 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 Otherwise, it seems to be ruined in a week 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.300
 After all that 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.590
 Flexible master background 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.370
 What to say using a busy medium-sized brush as part of the defect 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.080
 Will be 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.770
 2 ago 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.570
 I have a funny story 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.110
 Katsuya Kondo who was the unsold graphic director of the day was a real director 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.410
 It is good to Mr. Naoya's place, is it not alive? 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.040
 It seems that you came to say and get a brush 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.590
 It is also because 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.880
 Next time Kato usually comes with a pre-work feeling and wears 10 work 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.670
 Though 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.800
 Himeji Riot 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.800
 It is released and used in the machine 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.370
 Katsura's home is nearby 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.900
 I also feel a bit 20 years ago 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.270
 I used the same brush for 20 years 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.540
 I think that there are times when the quality of Manohama work is different 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.459
 But 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.530
 Still, it was said that the old scenery wanted to leave 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.099
 Is 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.099
 What I said is that there is 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.819
 That's because recently 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.269
 In the world of animation after reading a book 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:26.929
 is not it 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:28.249
 Discarded waste 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.099
 It is 80 to write on a computer 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.989
 On a brush post 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.269
 It is a foot minority group in the decision with high poster color and it is whole 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.329
 I think that is good 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.360
 80% or more 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.680
 Meanwhile, nearly 90% are computerized 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.679
 I guess 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.260
 It is a tablet using remodeling software in the personal computer 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.109
 It is mainstream to add hand 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.229
 Well I've been thinking about this 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.789
 Studio Ghibli too 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:54.279
 How long 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.519
 Above and 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.209
 With poster color 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.529
 Mountain with paint 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.619
 It may be said that you add your hand with a brush and say 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.539
 It is not only a problem at the time of delivery, but a poster built also 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:06.409
 Even color 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:07.400
 I was distracted 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.989
 How long the company is 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.170
 I do not know there 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.880
 It also means that stable supply may be difficult 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.649
 Not 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:17.629
 That's why Ghibli will also be computerized in the future 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.629
 It may not be necessary to put it in view 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.869
 Madonna's this 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.499
 1994 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.189
 It was a remark 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:28.779
 In that 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:30.029
 This date 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:32.649
 I talked about art
