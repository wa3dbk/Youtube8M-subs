development<00:01:21.389> that<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.539> like<00:01:21.719> from<00:01:21.899> this<00:01:22.049> issue

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240

development that I like from this issue
one<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.329> the<00:01:24.420> best<00:01:24.569> but<00:01:24.780> probably<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.319> best<00:01:25.499> is

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
one of the best but probably the best is

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.499 
one of the best but probably the best is
at<00:01:25.829> the<00:01:25.950> end<00:01:26.069> where<00:01:26.249> we<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.609> see<00:01:26.789> moderate

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
exactly what happened in the other

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.520

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
but you know what did you do just leave

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.569 
but you know what did you do just leave
because<00:03:49.079> he<00:03:49.410> had<00:03:49.530> his<00:03:49.650> clones<00:03:50.010> there<00:03:50.340> for<00:03:50.549> a

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
because he had his clones there for a

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.909 
because he had his clones there for a
bit<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.329> forget<00:03:51.840> exactly<00:03:51.959> what<00:03:52.440> happened

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
bit and I forget exactly what happened

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.879 
bit and I forget exactly what happened
but<00:03:53.040> uh<00:03:53.449> somehow<00:03:54.449> he's<00:03:54.690> gone<00:03:54.720> away<00:03:55.560> from<00:03:55.769> there

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
but uh somehow he's gone away from there

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.319 
but uh somehow he's gone away from there
and<00:03:56.040> now<00:03:56.129> he's<00:03:56.280> over<00:03:56.549> here<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:56.970> maybe<00:03:57.120> he<00:03:57.299> used

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
and now he's over here so maybe he used

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.240 
and now he's over here so maybe he used
his<00:03:57.599> clones<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.109> then<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.410> bounced<00:03:58.859> because

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
his clones and then just bounced because

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.830 
his clones and then just bounced because
he<00:03:59.489> wasn't<00:03:59.669> having<00:03:59.879> much<00:04:00.060> fun<00:04:00.209> he<00:04:00.540> didn't<00:04:00.720> want

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
he wasn't having much fun he didn't want

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.080 
he wasn't having much fun he didn't want
to<00:04:00.930> kill<00:04:01.049> him<00:04:01.169> or<00:04:01.410> maybe<00:04:02.010> they're<00:04:02.250> all<00:04:02.430> dead<00:04:02.819> I

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090
