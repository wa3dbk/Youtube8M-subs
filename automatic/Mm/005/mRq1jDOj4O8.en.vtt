00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:13.439
 welcome to this tutorial where we will see how you can download a video 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:18.469
 from youtube to in our little ones you see a way to see it again in any 

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:20.970
 moment also not connected to the internet 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.810
 then the first thing to do is to go to the famous site of course 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.220
 video-sharing and youtub 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.550
 in this case toast selected a particular video that the speech of 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.760
 robert kennedy on the pil 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.180
 American in general on American society 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.210
 this video is also dubbed in Italian a little to be a lot 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.860
 interesting also for example history lessons 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.860
 let's see for a moment now 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.310
 here I am at this point so we launch the program axew but the girl 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.680
 that the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.820
 but that we must have installed for 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.000
 this operation and we will find ourselves in front of very simple wave panel 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.800
 where we will find on the top download video from the internet in the source field we will insert 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.170
 simply illy address 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.060
 of the youtube page where is silent 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.860
 and save as and the destination where the program will save the video at that point 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.760
 we press download 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.930
 and as you see below 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.469
 now the video download 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:48.620
 will start 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.610
 in this part and where file extension is written 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.830
 of where now I act the cursor there are many video file extensions 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.100
 for example aldino or intend o vmv 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.240
 ie windows media video or even 3gp for video notices mobile devices 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.659
 like aifon or others 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.689
 and then then we can choose the extension that more 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.449
 it is also useful for a possible revision 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:25.779
 now in the meantime that the program as you can see reworks the file let's say others 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.400
 two words below 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.439
 are other people we haven't used now 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:35.169
 which one calls instead source save with name and as you see there is written convert 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:40.150
 flv files in other formats this serves opposite thesis help in case 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.150
 we had a youtube video file that has an extension 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.109
 flv 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.989
 typical of many other formats we can insert the video here and convert it to 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.290
 another format 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.979
 that which most suits us as for example to preach god 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:58.979
 here's how you see the operation completed 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.670
 and at this point we will find the video in the folder 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.030
 in this case in my case xd video youtube where we specified 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.760
 to insert it here is what I told you are the possible extensions are 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.329
 really a lot of harley 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:19.439
 grows track intends windows media video mp4 which is a compressed video format 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:26.359
 m4a me 4 book and many others much like mp3 sn we want to download only 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:27.369
 sound 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:32.579
 even free formats like today or even hallo files 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.649
