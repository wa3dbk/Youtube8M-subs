00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
I'll say by mounting that on top instead

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.160 
I'll say by mounting that on top instead
not<00:01:13.799> having<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.369> capacity<00:01:14.970> we're<00:01:15.780> gonna<00:01:15.930> go

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
not having that capacity we're gonna go

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.770 
not having that capacity we're gonna go
with<00:01:16.350> trying<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.650> make<00:01:16.740> our<00:01:16.950> own<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.790> getting

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
with trying to make our own so getting

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.649 
with trying to make our own so getting
some<00:01:19.020> old<00:01:19.200> soda<00:01:19.439> boxes<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.060> cut<00:01:21.060> out<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> got

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
some old soda boxes we cut out and got

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.149 
some old soda boxes we cut out and got
an<00:01:21.780> idea<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.080> what<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.290> wanted<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> tank

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
an idea of what we wanted for the tank

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.590 
an idea of what we wanted for the tank
is<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:23.970> they<00:01:24.150> are<00:01:24.180> kind<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> just

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
is what you see they are kind of just

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.800 
is what you see they are kind of just
matching<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.049> lines<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> frame<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
matching the lines of the frame and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.600 
matching the lines of the frame and
probably<00:01:27.810> believe<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.170> up<00:01:28.439> about<00:01:29.100> 3/8<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
probably believe about up about 3/8 of

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.730 
probably believe about up about 3/8 of
an<00:01:29.729> inch<00:01:29.820> gap<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.420> way<00:01:30.509> around<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.530> what

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
an inch gap all the way around is what

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.069 
an inch gap all the way around is what
you're<00:01:31.860> gonna<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.869> cut<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
you're gonna see and cut out the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.630 
you're gonna see and cut out the
sections<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> frame<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.890> were<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
sections of the frame that were in the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.020 
sections of the frame that were in the
way<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.240> regular<00:01:36.509> bike<00:01:36.689> had<00:01:37.350> these<00:01:37.530> guys<00:01:38.030> kind

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
way the regular bike had these guys kind

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.670 
way the regular bike had these guys kind
of<00:01:39.180> uh<00:01:39.210> running<00:01:39.990> something<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.350> that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
of uh running something like that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.460 
of uh running something like that
through<00:01:40.950> there<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:42.030> they're<00:01:42.990> cut<00:01:43.200> off<00:01:43.229> with<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
through there so they're cut off with a

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.249 
through there so they're cut off with a
whizz<00:01:43.680> wheel<00:01:44.329> axes<00:01:45.329> all<00:01:45.479> said<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.840> done<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
whizz wheel axes all said and done I

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.630 
whizz wheel axes all said and done I
think<00:01:46.409> we're<00:01:46.710> gonna<00:01:46.829> go<00:01:47.009> with<00:01:47.040> another<00:01:47.310> bar

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
think we're gonna go with another bar

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160 
think we're gonna go with another bar
probably<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.149> thicker<00:01:48.390> bar<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.810> goes<00:01:48.840> right

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
probably a thicker bar that goes right

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
probably a thicker bar that goes right
underneath<00:01:49.470> kind<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.890> matches<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.850> there

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
underneath kind of matches it to there

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.760 
underneath kind of matches it to there
and<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:54.299> my<00:01:54.450> project<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:55.110> took<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> piece<00:01:55.740> of

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and to do my project I took a piece of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.850 
and to do my project I took a piece of
TIG<00:01:56.009> wire<00:01:56.540> took<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> TIG<00:01:57.840> wire<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.380> bend<00:01:58.740> it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
TIG wire took the TIG wire and bend it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.730 
TIG wire took the TIG wire and bend it
to<00:01:58.979> match<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.930> upper<00:02:00.930> tube<00:02:01.170> has<00:02:01.710> a

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
to match that that upper tube has a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.969 
to match that that upper tube has a
slight<00:02:02.100> bend<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.680> if<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.829> would<00:02:04.920> have

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
slight bend to it and if you would have

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.499 
slight bend to it and if you would have
run<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> straight<00:02:05.460> line<00:02:05.700> right<00:02:05.729> across<00:02:06.090> there

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
run a straight line right across there

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.660 
run a straight line right across there
you<00:02:07.110> would<00:02:07.200> probably<00:02:07.500> see<00:02:07.649> about<00:02:07.950> an<00:02:08.250> inch<00:02:08.459> gap

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
you would probably see about an inch gap

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.699 
you would probably see about an inch gap
in<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> center<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.530> whole<00:02:10.679> thing

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
in the center of it and the whole thing

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.730 
in the center of it and the whole thing
I<00:02:10.950> think<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.480> 22<00:02:12.480> inches<00:02:12.780> long<00:02:12.840> something<00:02:13.319> like

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
I think is 22 inches long something like

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.980 
I think is 22 inches long something like
so<00:02:14.740> it's<00:02:15.610> kind<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:16.000> more<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.630> keeping<00:02:16.780> with

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
so it's kind of more in keeping with

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.690 
so it's kind of more in keeping with
what<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.410> style<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.770> tanks<00:02:18.070> they<00:02:18.250> had<00:02:18.460> on

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
what the style of the tanks they had on

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.420 
what the style of the tanks they had on
them<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:20.140> if<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.590> can<00:02:20.740> see<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.950> on<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.190> top

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
them and if you can see it on the top

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.280 
them and if you can see it on the top
the<00:02:21.850> front<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.600> it's<00:02:22.870> not<00:02:22.960> centered

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
the front of it and it's not centered

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.400 
the front of it and it's not centered
the<00:02:23.890> front<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.610> five<00:02:25.600> inches<00:02:25.810> wide<00:02:26.080> and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
the front of it is five inches wide and

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.340 
the front of it is five inches wide and
it<00:02:26.590> tapers<00:02:26.920> back<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.430> three<00:02:27.880> inches<00:02:28.090> wide

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
it tapers back to three inches wide

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.300 
it tapers back to three inches wide
towards<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.500> back<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:31.980> again<00:02:32.980> kind<00:02:33.250> of

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
towards the back and again kind of

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.820 
towards the back and again kind of
keeping<00:02:33.550> with<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.820> style<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.240> it<00:02:34.830> I'm

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
keeping with the style of it I'm

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.510 
keeping with the style of it I'm
probably<00:02:36.160> gonna<00:02:36.370> come<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:36.850> with<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:39.220> piece<00:02:39.490> of

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
probably gonna come up with a piece of

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.430 
probably gonna come up with a piece of
pipe<00:02:39.760> probably<00:02:40.120> about<00:02:40.240> that<00:02:40.570> tall<00:02:40.900> with<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.200> gas

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
pipe probably about that tall with a gas

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.340 
pipe probably about that tall with a gas
cap<00:02:41.710> on<00:02:41.890> top<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.810> don't<00:02:43.900> know<00:02:44.050> maybe

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
cap on top of it and I don't know maybe

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.930 
cap on top of it and I don't know maybe
a<00:02:44.470> little<00:02:44.530> cycle<00:02:45.100> it's<00:02:45.310> like<00:02:45.430> glass<00:02:45.640> for<00:02:45.880> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
a little cycle it's like glass for the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.300 
a little cycle it's like glass for the
piece<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.240> clear<00:02:46.500> clear<00:02:47.500> plastic<00:02:47.710> tubing<00:02:48.160> on

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
piece of clear clear plastic tubing on

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.010 
piece of clear clear plastic tubing on
the<00:02:48.340> side<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:48.970> kind<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.240> show<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.720> how

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
the side of it to kind of show the how

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.050 
the side of it to kind of show the how
much<00:02:50.170> fuels<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.740> tank<00:02:50.980> whether<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:51.880> get

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
much fuels in the tank whether I get

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.480 
much fuels in the tank whether I get
into<00:02:52.270> that<00:02:52.390> or<00:02:52.450> not<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.690> don't<00:02:52.840> know<00:02:53.080> but<00:02:53.490> never

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
into that or not I don't know but never

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.690 
into that or not I don't know but never
done<00:02:54.700> one<00:02:54.820> before<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.660> figure<00:02:56.550> there's<00:02:57.550> a

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
done one before so I figure there's a

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.090 
done one before so I figure there's a
always<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.450> time<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.720> start<00:02:58.930> this<00:02:59.710> haven't<00:03:00.010> try

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
always a time to start this haven't try

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.560 
always a time to start this haven't try
to<00:03:00.160> clear<00:03:00.550> all<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.790> linkages<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.300> everything

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
to clear all the linkages and everything

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.780 
to clear all the linkages and everything
underneath<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.200> had<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.830> had<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.190> deeper<00:03:03.670> I

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
underneath it I had it I had it deeper I

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.580 
underneath it I had it I had it deeper I
had<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.210> down<00:03:04.450> probably<00:03:04.990> about<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.380> much

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
had it down probably about this much

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.380 
had it down probably about this much
more<00:03:05.860> but<00:03:06.520> it<00:03:06.580> was<00:03:06.670> gonna<00:03:06.760> interfere<00:03:07.060> with

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
more but it was gonna interfere with

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.820 
more but it was gonna interfere with
this<00:03:07.540> linkage<00:03:07.930> not<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.380> I<00:03:08.440> couldn't<00:03:08.620> cut

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
this linkage not that I couldn't cut

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.830 
this linkage not that I couldn't cut
that<00:03:08.980> down<00:03:09.160> but<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:10.360> was<00:03:10.450> getting<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.720> little

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
that down but it was getting a little

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.100 
that down but it was getting a little
too<00:03:11.020> bulky<00:03:11.260> for<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.710> bike<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:13.780> seems<00:03:13.990> to

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
too bulky for the bike and this seems to

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.090 
too bulky for the bike and this seems to
work<00:03:14.260> out<00:03:14.410> better<00:03:15.780> went<00:03:16.780> around<00:03:16.990> yard<00:03:17.740> saleing

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
work out better went around yard saleing

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.490 
work out better went around yard saleing
on<00:03:18.580> Saturday<00:03:19.000> actually<00:03:19.330> went<00:03:19.480> around<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:20.380> on

yard sales cuz I couldn't pick anything
up<00:03:24.550> that<00:03:24.790> was<00:03:25.750> more<00:03:26.050> than<00:03:26.170> five<00:03:26.350> pounds<00:03:26.790> but

I'm riding around I came across someone

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.160 
I'm riding around I came across someone
cleaning<00:03:30.550> out<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.760> house<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.270> they<00:03:31.840> had<00:03:31.990> one<00:03:32.140> of

cleaning out a house and they had one of
those<00:03:32.290> old<00:03:32.440> exercise<00:03:33.100> bikes<00:03:33.580> you<00:03:34.000> know<00:03:34.060> the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
those old exercise bikes you know the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.810 
those old exercise bikes you know the
speedometer<00:03:34.660> on<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.960> made<00:03:35.320> by<00:03:35.470> Schwinn<00:03:35.820> from

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.440 
to flop around it's kind of hard to tape
it<00:04:26.260> together<00:04:26.380> from<00:04:26.790> when<00:04:27.790> it's<00:04:27.940> totally<00:04:28.240> boxed

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
in so we're just gonna cut this pattern

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.580 
in so we're just gonna cut this pattern
apart<00:04:31.540> and<00:04:31.660> then<00:04:31.780> when<00:04:31.900> we<00:04:32.020> get<00:04:32.139> to<00:04:32.290> that<00:04:32.410> I'll

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
apart and then when we get to that I'll

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.040 
apart and then when we get to that I'll
just<00:04:32.740> make<00:04:33.100> that<00:04:33.250> one<00:04:33.460> piece<00:04:33.840> trace<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:34.990> out

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
just make that one piece trace it out

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.570 
just make that one piece trace it out
and<00:04:35.230> lay<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.380> over<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.650> top<00:04:35.770> of<00:04:35.889> it<00:04:36.130> there's<00:04:36.460> my

mom<00:04:40.530> no<00:04:41.530> I'm<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.830> second<00:04:42.300> system<00:04:43.300> it's<00:04:43.600> art<00:04:43.810> I

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
mom no I'm a second system it's art I

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.770 
mom no I'm a second system it's art I
take<00:04:45.639> a<00:04:45.729> walk<00:04:45.850> over<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.180> other<00:04:46.330> side<00:04:46.510> gonna

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
take a walk over the other side gonna

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.830 
take a walk over the other side gonna
give<00:04:47.290> you<00:04:47.350> an<00:04:47.410> idea<00:04:47.500> from<00:04:47.740> further<00:04:48.040> away<00:04:48.840> what

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
give you an idea from further away what

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.760 
give you an idea from further away what
we're<00:04:49.960> working<00:04:50.110> with

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.629 

looks<00:04:53.770> something<00:04:53.950> like<00:04:54.100> that<00:04:56.490> so<00:04:57.490> I<00:04:57.520> think

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
looks something like that so I think

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.070 
looks something like that so I think
with<00:04:57.820> the<00:04:57.910> bar<00:04:58.090> underneath<00:04:58.419> it<00:04:58.720> you<00:04:59.020> know

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
with the bar underneath it you know

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.900 
with the bar underneath it you know
it'll<00:04:59.500> kind<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.040> tie<00:05:00.250> it<00:05:00.310> all<00:05:00.490> together

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
it'll kind of tie it all together

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.690 
it'll kind of tie it all together
and<00:05:01.240> I<00:05:02.229> know<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:02.889> kind<00:05:03.130> of<00:05:03.220> like<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.430> looks<00:05:03.610> of

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
and I know I kind of like the looks of

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.920 
and I know I kind of like the looks of
that<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.030> I<00:05:04.090> always<00:05:04.270> wanted<00:05:04.479> to<00:05:04.540> try<00:05:04.690> to<00:05:04.750> make

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
one so she's gonna be a total piece of

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.529 
one so she's gonna be a total piece of
crap<00:05:07.090> or<00:05:07.479> a<00:05:07.870> partial<00:05:08.560> piece<00:05:08.680> of<00:05:08.800> crap<00:05:08.979> but<00:05:09.539> you
