00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the LG optimus g pro so this is a big

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.970 
the LG optimus g pro so this is a big
phone<00:00:42.329> no<00:00:42.629> doubt<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> Galaxy<00:00:43.829> Note

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
phone no doubt just like the Galaxy Note

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.950 
phone no doubt just like the Galaxy Note
2<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.430> has<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> lot<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> similarities<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.780> its

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
2 and has a lot of similarities with its

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.260 
2 and has a lot of similarities with its
Samsung<00:00:46.410> counterpart<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:47.550> each<00:00:47.789> aspect

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
Samsung counterpart but then each aspect

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.410 
Samsung counterpart but then each aspect
is<00:00:48.600> slightly<00:00:49.320> improved<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.280> slightly<00:00:50.760> so

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
is slightly improved just slightly so

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.970 
is slightly improved just slightly so
you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.750> start<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.110> build<00:00:52.320> both<00:00:52.770> phones

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you can start with the build both phones

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.709 
you can start with the build both phones
are<00:00:53.160> made<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> plastic<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> optimus<00:00:54.539> g

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
camera up there which we'll get to in

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.960 
camera up there which we'll get to in
just<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.500> second<00:01:43.860> other<00:01:44.340> than<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.640> though

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
just a second other than that though

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.550 
just a second other than that though
just<00:01:45.329> about<00:01:45.479> everything<00:01:45.750> about<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.200> Optimus

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
just about everything about the Optimus

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.920 
just about everything about the Optimus
G<00:01:46.740> Pro's<00:01:47.040> build<00:01:47.430> quality<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.880> nearly<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:48.630> good

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
G Pro's build quality is nearly as good

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.539 
G Pro's build quality is nearly as good
as<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.200> gets<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> phone<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.130> size<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
as it gets on a phone of this size I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.100 
as it gets on a phone of this size I
mean<00:01:50.670> we've<00:01:50.790> never<00:01:50.970> seen<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.270> phablet<00:01:51.899> that's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
mean we've never seen a phablet that's

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.560 
mean we've never seen a phablet that's
made<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.470> metal<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.460> obviously<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.390> as

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
made of metal so obviously this is as

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.270 
made of metal so obviously this is as
well<00:01:54.810> built<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.530> phone<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> can

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
well built as a phone that you can

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.280 
well built as a phone that you can
probably<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.820> from<00:01:57.090> top<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.299> bottom<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.869> that

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
probably get from top to bottom in that

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.319 
probably get from top to bottom in that
form<00:01:58.530> factor<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.070> also<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.939> home<00:02:00.119> button

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
form factor and also the home button

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.179 
form factor and also the home button
that<00:02:00.509> doubles<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.930> notification<00:02:01.259> LED<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
that doubles as a notification LED is a

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.609 
that doubles as a notification LED is a
nice<00:02:02.549> touch<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.149> LED<00:02:03.479> colors<00:02:03.810> are<00:02:03.990> great<00:02:04.290> now

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
nice touch the LED colors are great now

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.709 
nice touch the LED colors are great now
flanking<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.219> home<00:02:05.430> button<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.270> menu

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
flanking that home button are the menu

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.229 
flanking that home button are the menu
and<00:02:06.960> back<00:02:07.320> buttons<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.950> LG's<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.670> flip<00:02:09.060> them

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
and back buttons but LG's just flip them

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.880 
and back buttons but LG's just flip them
around<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.899> they're<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> opposite<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.649> all

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
around so they're the opposite of all

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.559 
around so they're the opposite of all
those<00:02:11.069> Samsung<00:02:11.489> devices<00:02:11.760> out<00:02:12.000> there<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.480> it

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
those Samsung devices out there so it

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.220 
those Samsung devices out there so it
took<00:02:12.660> me<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.840> little

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
took me a little

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.229 
took me a little
get<00:02:13.409> used<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.769> but<00:02:14.099> there's<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.730> back<00:02:15.000> button

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
get used to but there's the back button

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.089 
get used to but there's the back button
on<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.510> left<00:02:15.659> and<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.050> menu<00:02:16.440> button<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.860> the

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
on the left and the menu button on the

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.130 
on the left and the menu button on the
right<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.700> guess<00:02:18.510> if<00:02:18.629> you're<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.930> change

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
right I guess if you're going to change

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.420 
right I guess if you're going to change
something<00:02:19.349> just<00:02:19.650> for<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.830> sake<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.010> changing

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
something just for the sake of changing

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.979 
something just for the sake of changing
it<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.670> might<00:02:20.819> as<00:02:20.909> well<00:02:20.940> be<00:02:21.180> something<00:02:21.599> small

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
it it might as well be something small

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.660 
it it might as well be something small
like<00:02:22.019> that<00:02:22.470> but<00:02:22.980> all<00:02:23.099> around<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.489> phone

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
like that but all around this phone

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.250 
like that but all around this phone
feels<00:02:23.879> about<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.330> same<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.659> the<00:02:24.750> galaxy<00:02:24.870> note

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
feels about the same as the galaxy note

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.589 
feels about the same as the galaxy note
2<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.769> slightly<00:02:26.190> different<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.299> a<00:02:27.390> lot<00:02:27.420> of

2 just slightly different in a lot of

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.300 
2 just slightly different in a lot of
ways<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.170> then<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.590> get<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.739> turning<00:02:29.129> it<00:02:29.220> on

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.130 
ways and then you get to turning it on
and<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.760> first<00:02:29.970> thing<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.299> notice<00:02:30.660> even<00:02:30.870> more

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
and the first thing you notice even more

about the panel's impact on battery life

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.690 
about the panel's impact on battery life
thinking<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.470> different<00:03:13.920> display<00:03:14.459> would

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
have a very different battery life but

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.050 
have a very different battery life but
like<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.010> said<00:03:17.069> before<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.579> one<00:03:17.730> had<00:03:17.880> no

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
experience was using it probably a

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.100 
experience was using it probably a
little<00:05:16.219> bit<00:05:16.400> snappier<00:05:16.969> than<00:05:17.030> at<00:05:17.599> a<00:05:17.659> galaxy

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
little bit snappier than at a galaxy

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.140 
little bit snappier than at a galaxy
note<00:05:18.289> 2<00:05:18.560> so<00:05:18.979> that's<00:05:19.129> definitely<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.580> good<00:05:19.849> sign

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
note 2 so that's definitely a good sign

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.629 
note 2 so that's definitely a good sign
but<00:05:20.539> overall<00:05:20.810> this<00:05:21.199> is<00:05:21.259> definitely<00:05:22.159> an<00:05:22.250> LG

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
but overall this is definitely an LG

and you can see how many q's they took

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.619 
and you can see how many q's they took

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
the hardware of course the note 2 has

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.089 
the hardware of course the note 2 has
one<00:05:32.539> of<00:05:32.599> the<00:05:32.690> best<00:05:32.840> 8<00:05:33.080> megapixel<00:05:33.620> cameras<00:05:33.979> in

one of the best 8 megapixel cameras in

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.219 
one of the best 8 megapixel cameras in
any<00:05:34.219> smartphone<00:05:34.669> but<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.479> option<00:05:35.630> is<00:05:35.810> G<00:05:35.990> Pro

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
any smartphone but the option is G Pro

any smartphone but the option is G Pro
shooter<00:05:36.620> is<00:05:36.770> 13<00:05:37.190> megapixels<00:05:37.759> so<00:05:37.969> it<00:05:38.090> takes

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
shooter is 13 megapixels so it takes

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.450 
shooter is 13 megapixels so it takes
slightly<00:05:38.990> more<00:05:39.319> detailed<00:05:39.710> shots<00:05:40.039> thanks<00:05:40.370> to

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
slightly more detailed shots thanks to

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.159 
slightly more detailed shots thanks to
that<00:05:40.610> extra<00:05:40.909> resolution<00:05:41.060> but<00:05:41.569> nothing<00:05:41.930> all

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
that extra resolution but nothing all

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.779 
that extra resolution but nothing all
that<00:05:42.199> crazy<00:05:42.800> it's<00:05:43.340> also<00:05:43.490> not<00:05:43.729> very

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
that crazy it's also not very

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.580 
that crazy it's also not very
contrasting<00:05:44.509> so<00:05:44.840> you<00:05:44.930> lose<00:05:45.139> a<00:05:45.169> bit<00:05:45.409> of<00:05:45.469> that

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
contrasting so you lose a bit of that

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.860 
contrasting so you lose a bit of that
dynamic<00:05:45.800> range<00:05:46.340> and<00:05:46.580> it's<00:05:47.029> not<00:05:47.330> quite<00:05:47.690> as

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
dynamic range and it's not quite as

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.110 
dynamic range and it's not quite as
vibrant<00:05:48.289> as<00:05:48.469> Samsung's<00:05:49.039> color<00:05:49.370> in<00:05:49.610> photos<00:05:50.090> and

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
videos from this camera you also don't

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.640 
videos from this camera you also don't
get<00:05:52.639> the<00:05:52.759> same<00:05:53.000> interface<00:05:53.509> or<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.840> same<00:05:54.080> crazy

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650

features that Samsung throws in there

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.059 
features that Samsung throws in there
