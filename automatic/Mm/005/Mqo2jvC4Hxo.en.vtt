on the bottom most of the newer style
bulbs<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.769> been<00:00:29.429> engineered<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> light

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
bulbs have been engineered so the light

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.190 
bulbs have been engineered so the light
is<00:00:30.990> cast<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.859> all<00:00:32.040> directions<00:00:32.719> versus<00:00:33.719> mostly

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
is cast in all directions versus mostly

is cast in all directions versus mostly
up<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.100> sideways<00:00:35.340> with<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:37.170> it

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
up and sideways with this one you see it

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.840 
up and sideways with this one you see it
was<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> lot<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.649> newer<00:00:37.829> bulbs<00:00:38.250> how<00:00:38.640> they

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
was a lot of newer bulbs how they

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.330 
was a lot of newer bulbs how they
allowed<00:00:39.239> wide<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:39.899> fall<00:00:40.140> down<00:00:40.340> which

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
allowed wide to actually fall down which

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.650 
allowed wide to actually fall down which
is<00:00:41.460> more<00:00:41.640> conventional<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.510> an

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
is more conventional like an

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.410 
is more conventional like an
incandescent<00:00:42.960> bulb<00:00:43.460> so<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:44.789> will<00:00:45.239> be

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
incandescent bulb so this one will be

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.510 
incandescent bulb so this one will be
better<00:00:45.450> seated<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.170> maybe<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.800> fixture<00:00:47.219> where

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
better seated for maybe a fixture where

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
better seated for maybe a fixture where
it<00:00:47.640> points<00:00:47.940> down<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> specific

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it points down or in a specific

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.520 
it points down or in a specific
direction<00:00:50.210> if<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.270> turn<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> bulb<00:00:51.809> around<00:00:51.930> we

direction if we turn the bulb around we
can<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.920> has<00:00:53.100> some<00:00:53.820> information<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.420> here

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
one claim this Bowl makes is that it has

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
over to power factor mode we can see

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.310 
over to power factor mode we can see
that<00:02:25.520> it's<00:02:25.670> reporting<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.210> power<00:02:26.870> factor<00:02:27.290> of

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
about 0.8 which is basically the same as

about 0.8 which is basically the same as

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
a few like the philips l price bulb

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.750 
a few like the philips l price bulb

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760

which is has a CRI of 0.9 to the color
rendering<00:03:29.030> is<00:03:29.209> obviously<00:03:29.630> better<00:03:29.810> than<00:03:30.019> just

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
rendering is obviously better than just

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.050

about<00:03:30.860> any<00:03:31.130> fluorescent<00:03:31.670> bulb<00:03:31.820> you're<00:03:31.940> gonna

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
about any fluorescent bulb you're gonna

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.810 
about any fluorescent bulb you're gonna
find<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:33.440> color<00:03:33.680> temperature<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:34.040> 3000<00:03:34.700> which

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
find the color temperature is 3000 which

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.039 
find the color temperature is 3000 which
means<00:03:35.030> it's<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.209> fairly<00:03:35.420> warm<00:03:35.810> color

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
means it's a fairly warm color

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.350 
means it's a fairly warm color
temperature<00:03:36.440> not<00:03:37.040> quite<00:03:37.310> incandescent<00:03:37.730> but

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
temperature not quite incandescent but

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.140 
temperature not quite incandescent but
then<00:03:38.450> again<00:03:38.570> it's<00:03:38.780> not<00:03:38.810> like<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:39.320> 6000k

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
then again it's not like a 6000k

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.150 
then again it's not like a 6000k
daylight<00:03:41.150> color<00:03:41.360> either<00:03:41.570> so<00:03:42.560> it's<00:03:42.680> fine<00:03:42.890> for

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
daylight color either so it's fine for

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.960 
daylight color either so it's fine for
interior<00:03:43.910> lighting<00:03:45.700> overall<00:03:46.700> it's<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.940> pretty

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
interior lighting overall it's a pretty

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.060 
interior lighting overall it's a pretty
good<00:03:47.269> bulb<00:03:47.480> at<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.840> decent<00:03:48.200> price<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:48.709> it's

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
good bulb at a decent price and it's
