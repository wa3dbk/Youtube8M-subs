00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.029
 i 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.820
 and those of extreme beige coach as 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.790
 I hope they are excellent and so 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.119
 this time I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.460
 famous big three the famous big three that 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.489
 maybe a lot we do this listened 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.110
 but maybe not many of us know why 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.110
 it's actually the big three 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.390
 The main objective of the big three is 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.300
 earn as much as possible of 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.370
 ambers from the battery to our 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.850
 amplifiers and from the alternator 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.040
 towards our battery so this way 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.530
 have more charge on our battery and 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.239
 greater this 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.740
 with fur also in our 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:12.230
 amplifiers so with that we avoid 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.870
 the lights flicker as much when 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.060
 when we turned on our our team 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.580
 good audio friends first 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.380
 I'm going to talk to you about what is the 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:28.910
 victory the big-three is that 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.500
 let's add two cables this for the 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.540
 ground or negative as you want 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.670
 call that goes from from the battery 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.750
 to the chassis of your car 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.030
 and others from the same from the negative of 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.520
 the battery towards 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.490
 towards some screw that we have there 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.220
 of the engine or whether that of train 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.570
 normal agency that takes it away or puts 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.560
 on the other cable and then the third cable 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.600
 x is called big three what would be change 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.090
 this the positive cable that goes from 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.119
 the alternator towards our battery that 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.310
 is the one who charges our battery and 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.890
 Well, that's basically what 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.739
 consists of the big-three in changing those 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.709
 three cables for ones of caliber still 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.950
 greater to thus have this greater 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.440
 Averaging for our amplifiers 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.980
 well then this with the victor we are going to 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:32.680
 occupy a bit of logic because because 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.680
 for example if you are this 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.220
 for example in your matter of your 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.480
 automobile from agency to brings a cable 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.950
 that goes from the battery to its chassis 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.110
 6 gauge and then we to improve 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.150
 supposedly 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.290
 the current that reaches our 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.300
 amplifier we put a cable 0 gauge 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.090
 but for example if when we 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.010
 We put our land in our chassis 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:08.090
 it's as if we were bringing a 6-gauge cable 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.160
 because since the as I mentioned the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.480
 cable that goes from the battery to the 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.530
 chassis is caliber 6 so what do you like 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.200
 I told them in 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.100
 in the previous video that the cable between 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.590
 the thinner the more opposition you have to 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.270
 drive the current so it is that 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.690
 by logic we have to change ourselves 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.709
 also the negative cable of the 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.959
 land to a larger caliber since it does not 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.690
 It serves that we put a battery 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.180
 bigger to our car and have a 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.460
 thin wire because it will not let 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.830
 all all that amperage that 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.440
 in our battery has to offer us 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.250
 for our audio team friends and the 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.020
 third cable that mentioned this that 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.170
 they have to change what is going 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.200
 from the alternator to the positive 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.930
 the battery is also this is 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.480
 It is recommended that you change it for a 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.390
 a cable of greater caliber since in 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.159
 some cars more than anything in the 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.890
 small cars that are very 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:17.620
 compact ones that I do not know if they have 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.259
 seen that they have little space to put 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.220
 the battery this are designed more than 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:27.090
 nothing to charge batteries girls 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.960
 putting a thicker cable has the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.259
 possibility of 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.080
 to gain a little more amperage for 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.330
 charge your battery but in some cases 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.750
 It is also advisable to change the 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.000
 alternator since you can maybe that 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.120
 you change the cable but send you the 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.699
 same campers as with the other cable as well 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.830
 is that it would have no case but in some 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.560
 I tell you that if it is recommended 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.780
 change the physical is something else they 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.060
 I also recommend that if you go and 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.220
 they want to install their showcase 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.110
 I recommend you start installing it 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.490
 with a good quality cable for 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.620
 have them 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.319
 good results from the beginning 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.940
 something that I can recommend you so that 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.240
 begin to do your installation of 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.220
 district 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.949
 If you do not have all the money to buy 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.310
 all the meters of cable that they need 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:22.789
 this value I recommend you so 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.530
 least buy this first they put 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.530
 one first of all the earth 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.980
 put it like this on your chassis already after 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.020
 you can come it replaces in 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.300
 the other the other earth wire 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.190
 also and so too if you want to put 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.860
 also positive the alternator 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.960
 also so little by little so that it does not 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.600
 I'm doing them so much 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.660
 so heavy and this 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.050
 and you are going to get better with the earth 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.300
 what are you going to put at the beginning 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.069
 good friends of extreme see me I think that 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.620
 that has been everything I hope there is 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:01.750
 solved some of your doubts if not 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.789
 speak to solve all your doubts 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.320
 please leave me in the comments 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:10.260
 and I gladly answer them 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.830
 Well thanks for watching the video if 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.560
 you like me please give you a like 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:19.580
 share it and this one we give then by 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.580
 more audio 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:44.310
 or not
