I<00:00:16.440> mean<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.740> concepts<00:00:17.130> pretty<00:00:17.310> simple<00:00:17.730> it's

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
I mean the concepts pretty simple it's

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.880 
I mean the concepts pretty simple it's
just<00:00:18.150> having<00:00:18.690> fun<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.380> split<00:00:19.650> screen

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
just having fun with the split screen

just having fun with the split screen
and<00:00:20.310> seeing<00:00:20.550> what<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.760> can<00:00:20.850> do<00:00:20.939> with<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
and seeing what you can do with the

images connecting and disconnecting

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.710 
images connecting and disconnecting
across<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> split<00:00:23.369> yeah<00:00:24.119> we're<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.330> sort<00:00:24.660> of

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
across the split yeah we're just sort of

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.060 
across the split yeah we're just sort of
trying<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.170> we're<00:00:25.410> kind<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.619> weighing<00:00:25.830> it

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
trying to we're kind of weighing it

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.330 
trying to we're kind of weighing it
actually<00:00:26.640> well<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.180> filmmakers<00:00:27.930> are<00:00:28.340> they

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
actually well the filmmakers are they

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.800 
actually well the filmmakers are they
really<00:00:29.519> think<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.910> terms<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.269> camera<00:00:30.599> shots

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
really think in terms of camera shots

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.720 
really think in terms of camera shots
and<00:00:31.019> angles<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.619> technical<00:00:32.160> aspect<00:00:32.579> of

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
and angles and the technical aspect of

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.790 
and angles and the technical aspect of
how<00:00:33.149> we're<00:00:33.329> creating<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> split<00:00:34.590> screen

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
how we're creating the split screen

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.280 
how we're creating the split screen
effect<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.850> band<00:00:36.329> spins<00:00:36.690> all<00:00:36.870> our<00:00:37.050> time

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
effect and the band spins all our time

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.580 
effect and the band spins all our time
trying<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.100> figure<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.610> ways<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.410> insert<00:00:40.410> our

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
trying to figure out ways to insert our

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.319 
trying to figure out ways to insert our
personalities<00:00:41.160> into<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.000> think<00:00:42.059> that's

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
personalities into it and I think that's

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.940 
personalities into it and I think that's
the<00:00:42.629> why<00:00:42.930> they<00:00:43.110> could<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.350> stuffs<00:00:43.620> kind<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the why they could be stuffs kind of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.069 
the why they could be stuffs kind of
happening<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.460> between<00:00:44.820> all<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.300> sort<00:00:46.050> of

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
happening in between all of the sort of

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.229 
happening in between all of the sort of
technical<00:00:46.610> camera<00:00:47.610> moves<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.000> everything

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
technical camera moves and everything

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.590 
technical camera moves and everything
like<00:00:48.329> that

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.400 

basically<00:00:53.600> we<00:00:53.690> have<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.899> put<00:00:54.140> as<00:00:54.260> much

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
basically we have to put as much

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.410 
basically we have to put as much
absurdity<00:00:55.039> into<00:00:55.280> it<00:00:55.370> without<00:00:55.489> messing<00:00:56.300> up

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
absurdity into it without messing up

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.770 
absurdity into it without messing up
their<00:00:56.629> technical<00:00:58.030> storyboard<00:00:59.030> yeah<00:00:59.149> so<00:00:59.660> the

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
their technical storyboard yeah so the

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.439 
their technical storyboard yeah so the
ban<00:01:00.019> was<00:01:00.260> not<00:01:00.469> really<00:01:00.800> into<00:01:01.360> doing<00:01:02.360> anything

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
ban was not really into doing anything

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:03.939 
ban was not really into doing anything
it<00:01:02.690> was<00:01:02.809> like<00:01:02.899> a<00:01:02.930> straight<00:01:03.289> a<00:01:03.320> narrative<00:01:03.710> or

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
it was like a straight a narrative or

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.710 
it was like a straight a narrative or
was<00:01:04.100> too<00:01:04.250> literal<00:01:04.729> but<00:01:05.330> was<00:01:05.449> something<00:01:05.690> that

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
was too literal but was something that

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.139 
was too literal but was something that
was<00:01:05.840> kind<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.049> more<00:01:06.229> abstract<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:07.520> after

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
was kind of more abstract and so after

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:09.700 
was kind of more abstract and so after
going<00:01:08.570> through<00:01:08.780> several<00:01:08.990> ideas<00:01:09.170> we<00:01:09.500> spent

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
going through several ideas we spent

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.219 
going through several ideas we spent
landed<00:01:10.009> on<00:01:10.100> this<00:01:10.220> I<00:01:10.550> think<00:01:10.940> we<00:01:11.060> spent<00:01:11.300> our<00:01:11.420> $99

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
landed on this I think we spent our $99

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.740 
landed on this I think we spent our $99

one day demand speeds up to 50 megabits

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.520 
one day demand speeds up to 50 megabits
per<00:01:19.549> second<00:01:20.149> I<00:01:20.420> mean<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:20.960> band<00:01:21.170> has<00:01:21.380> been

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
per second I mean the band has been

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.340 
per second I mean the band has been
great<00:01:22.539> they've<00:01:23.539> brought<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:23.780> lot<00:01:24.020> of<00:01:24.050> their<00:01:24.229> own

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
great they've brought a lot of their own

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.320 
great they've brought a lot of their own
ideas<00:01:24.770> but<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:24.979> think<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:25.460> far<00:01:25.490> today<00:01:25.940> they're

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
ideas but I think so far today they're

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.430 
ideas but I think so far today they're
just<00:01:26.509> like<00:01:26.630> they<00:01:26.750> understand<00:01:27.200> that<00:01:27.259> we<00:01:27.410> have

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
just like they understand that we have

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.109 
just like they understand that we have
to<00:01:27.530> move<00:01:27.770> quickly<00:01:28.039> and<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:28.759> like<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.090> know

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
to move quickly and so like you know

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.149 
to move quickly and so like you know
whatever<00:01:29.479> you<00:01:29.539> need<00:01:29.780> we'll<00:01:30.080> do<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.920> funny

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
whatever you need we'll do it the funny

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.919 
whatever you need we'll do it the funny
thing<00:01:31.250> is<00:01:31.429> when<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.880> plan<00:01:32.179> and<00:01:32.509> plan<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.720> plan

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
thing is when you plan and plan and plan

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:34.450 
thing is when you plan and plan and plan
as<00:01:33.170> much<00:01:33.320> as<00:01:33.440> you<00:01:33.530> can<00:01:33.740> when<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.070> get<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.369> the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
as much as you can when you get to the

as much as you can when you get to the

there's<00:01:41.780> like<00:01:41.899> one<00:01:42.110> or<00:01:42.200> two<00:01:42.229> elements<00:01:42.710> in

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
there's like one or two elements in

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.899 
there's like one or two elements in
every<00:01:42.979> shot<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:43.250> has<00:01:43.550> to<00:01:43.640> kind<00:01:43.729> of<00:01:43.819> be

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
every shot that has to kind of be

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.340 
every shot that has to kind of be
consistent<00:01:44.450> as<00:01:44.509> we're<00:01:44.630> about<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.810> go<00:01:45.020> inside

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
consistent as we're about to go inside

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.279 
consistent as we're about to go inside
and<00:01:45.619> film<00:01:46.220> some<00:01:46.280> more<00:01:46.460> stuff<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:48.110> then

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
and film some more stuff and and then

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.809 
and film some more stuff and and then
and<00:01:48.800> then<00:01:48.920> otherwise<00:01:49.159> like<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:49.729> with

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
and then otherwise like it with

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.100 
and then otherwise like it with
happening<00:01:50.119> in<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.270> background<00:01:50.360> is<00:01:50.750> totally

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
happening in the background is totally

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.710 
happening in the background is totally
up<00:01:51.200> in<00:01:51.319> the<00:01:51.380> air<00:01:51.440> well<00:01:52.159> we<00:01:52.670> have<00:01:52.880> 24<00:01:53.450> hours<00:01:53.690> to

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
up in the air well we have 24 hours to

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.749 
up in the air well we have 24 hours to
shoot<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.140> video<00:01:54.289> we've<00:01:54.950> been<00:01:55.100> shooting<00:01:55.310> out

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
shoot the video we've been shooting out

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.130 
shoot the video we've been shooting out
on<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.090> roof<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.450> then<00:01:56.509> we're<00:01:56.719> matching<00:01:56.899> it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
on the roof and then we're matching it

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.560 
on the roof and then we're matching it
to<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.290> performance<00:01:57.799> in<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.310> studio<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.060> we

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
to a performance in the studio and we

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.120 
to a performance in the studio and we
decided<00:01:59.840> that<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.380> lighting<00:02:00.799> inside<00:02:01.009> the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
decided that the lighting inside the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.249 
decided that the lighting inside the
studio<00:02:01.369> looks<00:02:01.610> best<00:02:01.909> in<00:02:02.210> natural<00:02:03.049> daylight

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
studio looks best in natural daylight

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.440 
studio looks best in natural daylight
and<00:02:04.040> we<00:02:04.219> only<00:02:04.399> have<00:02:04.640> access<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.240> studio

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
and we only have access to the studio

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.120 
and we only have access to the studio
for<00:02:05.479> one<00:02:05.750> day<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.049> that<00:02:06.350> means<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:06.649> essentially

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
for one day so that means we essentially

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.400 
for one day so that means we essentially
have<00:02:07.539> seven<00:02:08.539> hours<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.899> shoot<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.289> whole

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
have seven hours to shoot the whole

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.050 
have seven hours to shoot the whole
thing<00:02:09.739> I'd<00:02:10.130> say<00:02:10.280> we<00:02:10.399> spent<00:02:10.610> about<00:02:10.670> seventy

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
thing I'd say we spent about seventy

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.880 
thing I'd say we spent about seventy
dollars<00:02:11.390> on<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.660> dolly<00:02:12.110> which<00:02:12.440> we<00:02:12.530> ran<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.769> from

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
dollars on a dolly which we ran it from

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.500 
dollars on a dolly which we ran it from
hot<00:02:13.040> lights<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.579> we<00:02:14.120> spent<00:02:14.390> around

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
hot lights and we spent around

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.240 
hot lights and we spent around
twenty-five<00:02:14.989> dollars<00:02:15.170> on<00:02:15.470> action<00:02:15.950> figurines

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
twenty-five dollars on action figurines

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.390 
twenty-five dollars on action figurines
to<00:02:17.030> do<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.930> little<00:02:18.260> moving<00:02:18.680> video<00:02:18.829> storyboard

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
to do a little moving video storyboard

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.390 
to do a little moving video storyboard
because<00:02:19.850> it<00:02:19.970> was<00:02:20.090> hard<00:02:20.299> to<00:02:20.390> visualize

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
because it was hard to visualize

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.890 
because it was hard to visualize
essentially<00:02:22.400> two<00:02:22.820> videos<00:02:23.269> going<00:02:23.570> on<00:02:23.690> at<00:02:23.810> the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
essentially two videos going on at the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.810 
essentially two videos going on at the
same<00:02:24.079> time<00:02:24.380> basically<00:02:25.010> think<00:02:25.430> about<00:02:25.640> this

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
same time basically think about this

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.610 
same time basically think about this
shot<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.720> it's<00:02:26.840> like<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:26.989> can<00:02:27.079> just<00:02:27.109> show<00:02:27.410> them

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
shot so it's like we can just show them

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.770 
shot so it's like we can just show them
right<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.609> see<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.120> what<00:02:29.239> we're<00:02:29.359> doing<00:02:29.630> I

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
right you see this is what we're doing I

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.840 
right you see this is what we're doing I
think<00:02:30.200> figuring<00:02:31.160> out<00:02:31.280> what<00:02:31.549> is<00:02:31.820> actually

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
think figuring out what is actually

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.580 
think figuring out what is actually
happening<00:02:32.180> with<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.930> little<00:02:33.320> preparation

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
happening with the little preparation

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.819 
happening with the little preparation
that<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:34.250> had<00:02:34.420> yeah<00:02:35.420> but<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.440> seems<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.769> be

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
that we had yeah but it seems to be

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.280 
that we had yeah but it seems to be
going<00:02:37.010> pretty<00:02:37.130> well<00:02:37.340> we<00:02:37.880> we're<00:02:38.870> just<00:02:39.049> having

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
going pretty well we we're just having

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.140 
going pretty well we we're just having
fun<00:02:39.320> it's<00:02:39.709> like<00:02:39.799> a<00:02:40.070> really<00:02:40.489> Nick<00:02:40.790> knows<00:02:41.000> what

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
fun it's like a really Nick knows what

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.309 
fun it's like a really Nick knows what
he's<00:02:41.239> doing

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319
