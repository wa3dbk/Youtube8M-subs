00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850

and boost on it volume obviously makes

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.330 
and boost on it volume obviously makes
it<00:01:37.109> louder<00:01:37.289> or<00:01:37.409> quieter

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
and the boost what that does is adds or

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.620 
and the boost what that does is adds or
takes<00:01:59.410> away<00:01:59.770> the<00:02:00.370> amount<00:02:00.640> of<00:02:00.730> fuzz<00:02:00.970> check<00:02:01.480> it

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
so you can tell is you can either put a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.050 
so you can tell is you can either put a

so<00:03:38.460> I<00:03:38.790> mean<00:03:39.000> for<00:03:39.210> us<00:03:39.390> kind<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.320> music<00:03:40.590> we<00:03:40.680> like

to<00:03:40.950> play<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.130> think<00:03:41.220> probably<00:03:41.760> anywhere<00:03:42.150> from

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
to play I think probably anywhere from

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.130

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
somewhere it's about here once you get

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.530 
somewhere it's about here once you get
up<00:03:48.660> into<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.680> know<00:03:49.860> peg<00:03:50.370> in<00:03:50.520> it<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:51.360> gets

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
up into the you know peg in it it gets

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.500 
up into the you know peg in it it gets
kind<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.840> ridiculous<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.680> mean<00:03:53.100> it's<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.510> to

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
kind of ridiculous I mean it's like to

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.170 
kind of ridiculous I mean it's like to
me<00:03:54.690> it's<00:03:54.870> way<00:03:55.680> more<00:03:55.710> than<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.280> could<00:03:56.490> ever<00:03:56.610> use<00:03:56.940> I

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
me it's way more than I could ever use I

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.870 
me it's way more than I could ever use I
mean<00:03:57.600> depends<00:03:58.470> on<00:03:58.560> what<00:03:58.710> you're<00:03:58.890> striving<00:03:59.460> for

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.330 
mean depends on what you're striving for
I<00:03:59.910> guess<00:04:00.030> but<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.690> definitely<00:04:01.380> got<00:04:01.980> plenty<00:04:02.220> of

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
I guess but I definitely got plenty of

we're<00:04:05.220> going<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.400> look<00:04:05.520> at<00:04:05.700> is<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:05.970> octave

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
we're going to look at is the octave

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.720 
we're going to look at is the octave
it's<00:04:06.660> really<00:04:07.020> cool<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.860> kind<00:04:08.130> of<00:04:08.220> puts<00:04:08.640> the

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
it's really cool it kind of puts the

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.730 
it's really cool it kind of puts the

the<00:04:11.640> only<00:04:12.060> downside<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:12.690> this<00:04:13.200> is<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:14.340> you

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
the only downside to this is it you

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.300 
the only downside to this is it you
can't<00:04:14.970> get<00:04:15.270> any<00:04:15.570> articulation<00:04:16.560> if<00:04:17.190> you're

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
can't get any articulation if you're

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.860 
can't get any articulation if you're

playing too many notes at once like

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.259 
playing too many notes at once like
chords<00:04:19.380> it's<00:04:19.890> got<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.370> be<00:04:20.459> single<00:04:20.850> notes<00:04:21.030> when

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
chords it's got to be single notes when

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.970 
chords it's got to be single notes when
you<00:04:21.390> engage<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.870> octave<00:04:22.230> for<00:04:22.380> sure<00:04:22.590> or<00:04:22.860> you're

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
you engage the octave for sure or you're

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.700 
you engage the octave for sure or you're
just<00:04:23.040> going<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.310> it's<00:04:23.730> all<00:04:23.910> going<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.120> become

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
just going to it's all going to become

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.090 
just going to it's all going to become
inaudible<00:04:25.710> mud<00:04:26.250> but<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.780> that's<00:04:28.620> what<00:04:28.920> the

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
inaudible mud but and that's what the

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.100 
inaudible mud but and that's what the
case<00:04:29.340> with<00:04:29.550> a<00:04:29.580> lot<00:04:29.820> of<00:04:29.850> octave<00:04:30.300> pedals<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:30.810> think

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
case with a lot of octave pedals I think

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.270 
case with a lot of octave pedals I think
there's<00:04:31.260> only<00:04:31.380> one<00:04:31.530> or<00:04:31.770> two<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:32.010> them<00:04:32.130> out

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.500 
there's only one or two of them out
there<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.610> actually<00:04:32.730> allows<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.330> do

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.620 
there that actually allows you to do
