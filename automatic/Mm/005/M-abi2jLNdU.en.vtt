00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.120
 who resolved to fall in a different way and the procession left the tracks

 two people who even with the medication 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.200

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.700
 run on kart tracks 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.700
 winning titles and even competing in motor racing events 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.970

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.720
 after this year I can say 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.230
 all the people who walked all the time 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.010

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.470

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.380

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.960

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.140
 Assembly 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.270
 patience to fit the pieces 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.870

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.440

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.200
 basically we put a category that is kart with a motorcycle engine 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.040
 outside the United States and here in the United States. 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.780
 Brazil 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.140
 signed it in need of a cost category cheaper than I 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.949
 discard itself 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.949
 we developed all the ifra kit to adapt the motor of the motorcycle to note that this 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:14.659

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.579
 I play kart in your life today. 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.109
 to kick everything 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.109
 fully 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.560
 is a good example and not only have I tried to prove 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.890
 successful 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.000
 on the morrow, where it ended up being punished
