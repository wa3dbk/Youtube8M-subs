00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.810
 hi jeff what are you a few 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.779
 tips to improve the launch of 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.010
 bullet in the service is geoffroy 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.309
 actually some tips that I have 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.360
 could glean left and right on 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.860
 the old bullet at the service 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.599
 actually this is an important point 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.930
 why because the water they see 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.279
 all the other courses when I see a 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.680
 forehand for example the ball comes 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.960
 at the positions of his body with respect to 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.939
 the wave whose strike is the reverse 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.880
 similar to the plugs to stand for 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.219
 hit the ball at the service at the places 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.140
 naval a place where to hit his 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.820
 service so it's important to have a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.550
 good pitch are worth to have a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.930
 bob 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.899
 you have to understand also big second 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.489
 a cold game is that at the service there 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.860
 has no tension nor in the arm that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.710
 launches downstream best booth rakia la 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.390
 racket locates intentions at the level of 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.640
 the hand that holds the racket for 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.010
 throwing a ball will not be accurate with 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.510
 the side effects of the ball which 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.699
 pave the readership also a tension 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.100
 symmetrical at the level of the cat mcit the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.379
 racket a tension at the level of the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.900
 mcit ya the racket will have a tension at 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.490
 level hand them a good mare 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.670
 type the instruments baule for there 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.210
 did it cost cheap to tumble in 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.210
 plastic 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.420
 why I pass that plastic kobe 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.430
 has two effects it easily deforms 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.229
 and in addition he makes a noise 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.619
 characteristic that makes it possible to measure the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.740
 lower voltage in the downstream place a 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.860
 ball inside I hold my ball 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.009
 as I will stand by and I launch my 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.009
 ball 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.020
 if I have the slightest tension budget 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.109
 so it's interesting to work on 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:53.200
 these bins with a cup and a ball 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:55.659
 second tips of France regardless 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.280
 his service there is an ideal point where there 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.590
 down to find himself to be able to hit 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:06.310
 his justice ball will see what remarks 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.719
 I am placed by placing myself at the place I 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.929
 would like to put the ball to catch it 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.929
 place the racket and then this radar 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.180
 over there fell on the sieve alan cross of the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.180
 field the ball 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.260
 my friend 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.260
 we talked more 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.840
 so here I believe for that weight 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.480
 last point often you had to see I 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.610
 will do club when we throw the ball 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.470
 people consider that the launch of 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.660
 ball stops when we let go 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.140
 ball so that translates if your share to 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.390
 to grind on contact with the hand it stops 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.630
 to what he will have to do down then 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.110
 that the arm has to go up even after having 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.510
 dropped vertically 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.420
 we think that to meet again when 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.320
 what is called the trophy position 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.940
 famous because there are a lot of 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.040
 couples who are with players who 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.070
 are in this position so that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.750
 the armed bracelet is also here at the 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.800
 vertical 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.360
 it's very important to find each other 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.890
 in this position that's what will put 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.810
 Stability of speed in service 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.310
 per share if you're like that this 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.900
 is not a strong position and 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.820
 dynamic and what makes that there will be 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.080
 no strength and dynamism 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.750
 hi it's so important to 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.750
 practice letting go of the ball ja 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.430
 here I think a lot of French in 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.050
 view to work on ball throws 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.210
 but it works 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.210
 try ok thanks for your advice of m
