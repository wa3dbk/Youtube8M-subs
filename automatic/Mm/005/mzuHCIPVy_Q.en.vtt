00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
our iPad at a straight angle then versus

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.830 
our iPad at a straight angle then versus
if<00:02:36.740> we<00:02:36.890> have<00:02:37.100> our<00:02:37.280> iPad<00:02:37.730> up<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.360> we're<00:02:38.540> doing

if we have our iPad up and we're doing
this<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.440> we're<00:02:39.560> trying<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:40.100> get<00:02:40.580> into<00:02:40.730> the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
this and we're trying to get into the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.790 
this and we're trying to get into the
port<00:02:41.180> we're<00:02:41.420> missing<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.960> where<00:02:42.140> we're<00:02:42.650> going

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
port we're missing it where we're going

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.240

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
to break bend or disable the headphone

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.460 
to break bend or disable the headphone
port<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.940> we've<00:02:47.240> seen<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.630> many<00:02:47.720> times<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.380> so

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
port and we've seen it many times and so

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.590 
port and we've seen it many times and so
we're<00:02:48.710> just<00:02:48.860> trying<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.190> come<00:02:49.370> up<00:02:49.400> with<00:02:49.520> a<00:02:49.640> more

safer<00:02:51.230> way<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:52.030> entering<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.480> headphone<00:02:54.520> into

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
safer way of entering the headphone into

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.330 
safer way of entering the headphone into
the<00:02:55.640> headphone<00:02:55.850> jack<00:02:56.090> so<00:02:56.930> if<00:02:57.560> we<00:02:57.740> lay<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.100> flat

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
the headphone jack so if we lay it flat

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.250 
the headphone jack so if we lay it flat
