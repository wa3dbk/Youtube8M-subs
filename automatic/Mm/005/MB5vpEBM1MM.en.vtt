00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
solve flick that word up onto the screen

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.330 
solve flick that word up onto the screen
now<00:01:54.570> with<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> bit<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.020> practice<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:56.189> this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
now with a bit of practice I think this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.399 
now with a bit of practice I think this
would<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.909> lot<00:01:57.000> more<00:01:57.210> intuitive<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> lot

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
would be a lot more intuitive and a lot

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.429 
would be a lot more intuitive and a lot
quicker<00:01:58.799> than<00:01:59.399> typing<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:00.810> example<00:02:01.259> my

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
quicker than typing on for example my

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.550 
quicker than typing on for example my
iPhone<00:02:01.890> 5<00:02:02.189> or<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.640> Lumia<00:02:02.969> 920<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.899> think<00:02:04.469> it

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
iPhone 5 or the Lumia 920 I think it

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.050 
iPhone 5 or the Lumia 920 I think it
just<00:02:04.590> takes<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.950> little<00:02:05.040> bit<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.280> practice<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
just takes a little bit of practice to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.660 
just takes a little bit of practice to
get<00:02:06.719> used<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.110> wear<00:02:07.259> these<00:02:07.439> words<00:02:08.280> are<00:02:08.489> going

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
get used to wear these words are going

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.089 
get used to wear these words are going
to<00:02:08.729> actually<00:02:08.849> pop<00:02:09.209> up<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.660> actually<00:02:10.080> use<00:02:10.890> it

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
to actually pop up and actually use it

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.880 
to actually pop up and actually use it

a lot of options here we've got some

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.430 
a lot of options here we've got some
nice<00:03:18.060> things<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.810> choose<00:03:19.019> from<00:03:19.260> for

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
expect from a premium phone and then

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.150 
expect from a premium phone and then
moving<00:03:30.480> on<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.720> blackberry<00:03:31.410> maps<00:03:31.590> now<00:03:31.860> this<00:03:32.010> is

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
moving on to blackberry maps now this is

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.710 
moving on to blackberry maps now this is
something<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.760> blackberry<00:03:33.420> really

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.140 
something that blackberry really
excelled<00:03:34.110> out<00:03:34.350> with<00:03:35.160> previous<00:03:35.640> versions<00:03:35.670> of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
excelled out with previous versions of

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.660 
excelled out with previous versions of
their<00:03:36.299> operating<00:03:36.660> system<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:38.250> nice<00:03:38.459> and

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
their operating system it is nice and

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.360 
their operating system it is nice and
fast<00:03:38.880> search<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.750> find<00:03:40.200> things<00:03:40.470> but<00:03:41.160> when<00:03:41.280> you

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
fast search and find things but when you

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.069 
fast search and find things but when you
actually<00:03:41.519> want<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.180> map<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.450> populate<00:03:42.930> with

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
actually want the map to populate with

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.400 
actually want the map to populate with
data<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.579> over<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:44.850> Wi-Fi<00:03:45.060> network<00:03:45.410> it's

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
data this is over a Wi-Fi network it's

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.819 
data this is over a Wi-Fi network it's
very<00:03:46.769> very<00:03:47.100> slow<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.209> can't<00:03:48.690> even<00:03:48.959> really

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
very very slow so I can't even really

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.069 
very very slow so I can't even really
understand<00:03:50.459> how<00:03:50.700> much<00:03:51.120> slower<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.660> would<00:03:51.870> be

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
understand how much slower it would be

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.319 
understand how much slower it would be
if<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.380> were<00:03:52.560> on<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.769> 3g<00:03:53.310> or<00:03:53.340> an<00:03:53.549> LTE<00:03:53.880> network

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
if you were on a 3g or an LTE network

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.750 
if you were on a 3g or an LTE network
what<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.079> see<00:03:55.230> now<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.590> really<00:03:56.250> fast<00:03:56.459> Wi-Fi

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
what you see now is a really fast Wi-Fi

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.740 
what you see now is a really fast Wi-Fi
connection<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:58.739> screen<00:03:59.310> drawer<00:03:59.610> and<00:03:59.820> the

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
connection and the screen drawer and the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.360 
connection and the screen drawer and the
rate<00:04:01.079> at<00:04:01.260> which<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.500> put<00:04:01.709> in<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.890> data<00:04:02.100> in

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
rate at which is put in the data in

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.759 
rate at which is put in the data in
really<00:04:02.970> unacceptable<00:04:03.360> in<00:04:03.720> my<00:04:03.750> opinion<00:04:04.140> so

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
really unacceptable in my opinion so

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.580 
really unacceptable in my opinion so
again<00:04:05.100> I<00:04:05.340> think<00:04:05.700> blackberry<00:04:06.090> need<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.720> work<00:04:07.320> on

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
again I think blackberry need to work on

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.800 
again I think blackberry need to work on
their<00:04:08.130> Maps<00:04:08.430> application<00:04:08.640> for<00:04:09.239> blackberry<00:04:09.299> 10

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
their Maps application for blackberry 10

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.590 
their Maps application for blackberry 10
to<00:04:10.350> really<00:04:10.739> enhance<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.459> code<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.420> it

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
to really enhance the code so that it

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.319 
to really enhance the code so that it
gives<00:04:12.930> us<00:04:13.140> what<00:04:13.590> we<00:04:13.620> need<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.579> see<00:04:15.090> on<00:04:15.209> the

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329
