the<00:01:03.250> features<00:01:03.730> are<00:01:04.680> now<00:01:05.680> I<00:01:05.740> can<00:01:06.009> use<00:01:06.040> this

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
the features are now I can use this

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.410 
the features are now I can use this
little<00:01:06.820> blueprint<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:09.400> start<00:01:09.729> developing<00:01:09.910> a

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
little blueprint to start developing a

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.950 
little blueprint to start developing a
pose<00:01:10.890> taking<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.979> marker<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.640> just<00:01:12.880> trying<00:01:13.840> to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
pose taking a marker and just trying to

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.270 
pose taking a marker and just trying to
create<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.290> nice<00:01:14.590> loose<00:01:15.130> gesture<00:01:17.280> I've

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
create a nice loose gesture I've

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.180 
create a nice loose gesture I've
basically<00:01:18.970> blocked<00:01:19.300> in<00:01:19.509> a<00:01:19.800> proportion<00:01:20.800> for<00:01:21.039> my

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
basically blocked in a proportion for my

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.980 
basically blocked in a proportion for my
head<00:01:21.460> so<00:01:21.759> I<00:01:21.789> know<00:01:21.970> approximately<00:01:22.509> what

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
head so I know approximately what

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.070 
head so I know approximately what
proportion<00:01:23.619> to<00:01:23.890> make<00:01:24.039> my<00:01:24.250> fashion<00:01:24.700> figure<00:01:25.090> you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
proportion to make my fashion figure you

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.990 
proportion to make my fashion figure you
can<00:01:26.229> see<00:01:26.440> I'm<00:01:26.560> changing<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.340> arm<00:01:27.550> because

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
can see I'm changing the arm because

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.550 
can see I'm changing the arm because
that<00:01:28.180> was<00:01:28.300> a<00:01:28.330> little<00:01:28.600> bit<00:01:28.750> boring<00:01:29.020> down<00:01:29.289> to

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
that was a little bit boring down to

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.740 
that was a little bit boring down to
arms<00:01:29.979> down

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.840 

using<00:01:33.050> my<00:01:33.230> sharper<00:01:33.770> prism<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.220> pencil<00:01:34.700> I'm

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
using my sharper prism a pencil I'm

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.940 
using my sharper prism a pencil I'm
going<00:01:34.910> to<00:01:35.090> start<00:01:36.820> drawing<00:01:37.820> in<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.330> pose<00:01:38.950> again

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
going to start drawing in the pose again

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.860 
going to start drawing in the pose again
trying<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.430> keep<00:01:40.610> it<00:01:40.760> nice<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.030> loose<00:01:41.540> this<00:01:41.720> is

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
trying to keep it nice and loose this is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.500 
trying to keep it nice and loose this is
your<00:01:42.050> first<00:01:42.350> stab<00:01:42.740> at<00:01:43.040> it<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:43.580> it's<00:01:44.150> better<00:01:44.360> to

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
your first stab at it so it's better to

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.900 
your first stab at it so it's better to
be<00:01:44.660> loose<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:46.100> can<00:01:46.160> always<00:01:46.400> put<00:01:46.700> another

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
be loose you can always put another

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.240 
be loose you can always put another
piece<00:01:47.150> of<00:01:47.210> tracing<00:01:47.510> paper<00:01:47.720> over<00:01:48.080> and<00:01:48.650> make

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
piece of tracing paper over and make

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.630 
piece of tracing paper over and make
corrections<00:01:50.440> I'm<00:01:51.440> trying<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:51.920> make<00:01:52.220> sure<00:01:52.460> that

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
corrections I'm trying to make sure that

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.620 
corrections I'm trying to make sure that
I<00:01:52.670> am<00:01:53.390> aware<00:01:53.720> of<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.960> angles<00:01:55.420> that<00:01:56.420> my

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
I am aware of the angles that my

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.040 
I am aware of the angles that my
blueprint<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:58.510> indicating<00:01:59.510> for<00:01:59.720> me<00:01:59.840> now<00:01:59.990> you

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
blueprint is indicating for me now you

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.050 
blueprint is indicating for me now you
can<00:02:00.230> see<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.470> connection<00:02:01.010> of<00:02:01.130> ribcage<00:02:01.700> going

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
can see the connection of ribcage going

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.210 
can see the connection of ribcage going
in<00:02:02.180> one<00:02:02.360> direction<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.290> pelvis<00:02:03.800> going<00:02:04.100> in

in one direction to the pelvis going in

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.790 
in one direction to the pelvis going in
the<00:02:04.340> other<00:02:04.490> direction<00:02:05.020> I'm<00:02:06.020> going<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.380> shorten

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
the other direction I'm going to shorten

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.710 
the other direction I'm going to shorten
up<00:02:06.979> that<00:02:07.040> torso<00:02:07.729> slightly<00:02:07.790> it<00:02:08.360> was<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.510> little

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
up that torso slightly it was a little

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.130 
up that torso slightly it was a little
bit<00:02:08.929> too<00:02:09.110> long<00:02:10.060> I'm<00:02:11.060> making<00:02:11.450> sure<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:11.750> I've

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
bit too long I'm making sure that I've

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.790 
bit too long I'm making sure that I've
got<00:02:12.790> my<00:02:13.790> plumb<00:02:14.120> line<00:02:14.450> accurate<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.470> that<00:02:15.650> my

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
got my plumb line accurate so that my

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.120 
got my plumb line accurate so that my
wait<00:02:16.250> leg<00:02:16.459> is<00:02:16.640> coming<00:02:16.850> underneath<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.720> body

and then my play leg I'm looking at the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.610 
and then my play leg I'm looking at the
negative<00:02:22.040> space<00:02:22.430> in<00:02:23.030> order<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.480> make<00:02:23.690> that

relaxing on her hip and then for a
little<00:02:41.170> bit<00:02:41.500> more<00:02:41.709> gesture<00:02:42.310> I'm<00:02:42.549> putting

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
little bit more gesture I'm putting

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.890

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
another arm on to the hip and I'm

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.720 
another arm on to the hip and I'm
turning<00:02:47.349> that<00:02:47.469> hand<00:02:47.769> out<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.280> it's<00:02:48.430> not<00:02:48.579> going

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
turning that hand out so it's not going

00:02:48.730 --> 00:03:06.110 
turning that hand out so it's not going
to<00:02:48.819> interfere<00:02:48.969> with<00:02:49.299> my<00:02:49.629> design

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.750 

I'm<00:03:07.120> using<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.719> front<00:03:08.109> pose<00:03:08.409> as<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.040> basis<00:03:09.730> for

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
I'm using a front pose as a basis for

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.280 
I'm using a front pose as a basis for
developing<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:11.109> side<00:03:11.560> pose<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.120> have<00:03:13.540> the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
developing a side pose so I have the

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.990 
developing a side pose so I have the
same<00:03:14.560> proportions<00:03:16.709> just<00:03:17.709> helps<00:03:18.459> me<00:03:18.609> speed<00:03:18.969> up

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
same proportions just helps me speed up

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.370 
same proportions just helps me speed up
because<00:03:19.359> I<00:03:19.450> already<00:03:19.629> have<00:03:20.019> the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
because I already have the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.270 
because I already have the
slant<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.730> ribcage<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:24.710> proportion

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
slant of the ribcage and the proportion

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.120 
slant of the ribcage and the proportion
of<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.520> ribcage<00:03:25.930> but<00:03:26.930> I'm<00:03:27.020> turning<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.740> now<00:03:27.920> in

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
of the ribcage but I'm turning it now in

this<00:04:11.690> is<00:04:12.250> way<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.430> think<00:04:13.700> of<00:04:13.820> using<00:04:14.000> one<00:04:14.420> pose

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
this is way to think of using one pose

this is way to think of using one pose
to<00:04:14.750> quickly<00:04:15.350> develop<00:04:15.740> another<00:04:16.370> if<00:04:16.580> you're

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
to quickly develop another if you're

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.020 
to quickly develop another if you're
