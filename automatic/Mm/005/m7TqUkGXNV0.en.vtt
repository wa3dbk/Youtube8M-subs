earth so air so you could use the ghost

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.810 
earth so air so you could use the ghost
dragon<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.840> air<00:01:55.020> dragon<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.790> a

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
cold section to see if we miss anything

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.040 
cold section to see if we miss anything
that<00:02:27.910> we<00:02:28.910> already<00:02:29.030> talked<00:02:29.390> about<00:02:29.480> glacier

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.000 

the<00:02:41.209> snow<00:02:41.569> dragon<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.260> earth<00:02:42.440> dragon<00:02:42.860> that's

the snow dragon the earth dragon that's

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.130 
the snow dragon the earth dragon that's
also<00:02:43.340> another<00:02:43.910> combination<00:02:44.450> let's<00:02:44.930> head<00:02:45.110> on

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
also another combination let's head on

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.410 
also another combination let's head on
over<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.459> air<00:02:46.700> section<00:02:47.269> we<00:02:47.390> already

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
over to the air section we already

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.470 
over to the air section we already
talked<00:02:47.870> about<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.260> dodo<00:02:48.470> dragon<00:02:49.060> we<00:02:50.060> already

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
talked about the dodo dragon we already

dragon<00:03:00.560> all<00:03:01.489> right<00:03:01.640> so<00:03:01.819> that's<00:03:02.299> pretty<00:03:02.480> much

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
dragon all right so that's pretty much

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.539 
dragon all right so that's pretty much
it<00:03:03.080> but<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.470> can<00:03:03.650> probably<00:03:03.980> find<00:03:04.250> more

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
it but you can probably find more

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.199 
it but you can probably find more
combinations<00:03:06.310> but<00:03:07.310> those<00:03:07.549> are<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.849> best

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
combinations but those are the best

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.229 
combinations but those are the best
combinations<00:03:09.019> in<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.440> game<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:10.730> can<00:03:10.910> try<00:03:11.180> to

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
combinations in the game you can try to

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.680 
combinations in the game you can try to
I<00:03:11.900> guess<00:03:12.410> look<00:03:13.250> for<00:03:13.489> another<00:03:13.849> combination<00:03:14.299> if

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
I guess look for another combination if

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.110 
I guess look for another combination if
you<00:03:14.780> want<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.260> breeding<00:03:15.590> time<00:03:15.799> is<00:03:16.010> 48<00:03:16.549> hours

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
you want the breeding time is 48 hours

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.180 
you want the breeding time is 48 hours
and<00:03:17.329> then<00:03:17.420> hatching<00:03:17.930> times<00:03:18.109> also<00:03:18.350> 48<00:03:18.859> hours

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
and then hatching times also 48 hours

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.789 
and then hatching times also 48 hours
anyways<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.209> is<00:03:20.390> all<00:03:20.600> that<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:21.049> how<00:03:21.320> you<00:03:21.380> get

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
anyways that is all that is how you get

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.810 
anyways that is all that is how you get
the<00:03:22.040> lunar<00:03:22.400> eclipse<00:03:22.850> dragon<00:03:23.299> in<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.630> game
