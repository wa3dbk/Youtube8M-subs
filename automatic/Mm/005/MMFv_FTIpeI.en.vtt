 handicap of deauville france to load 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.429

 course 1600 meters straight line 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.989
 challenging course and terrain 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.440
 probably sticky if not heavy they 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.820

 glasses but if you meant that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.670
 even say it wahib on the 11th

 ali set designer the 6 3 yann pride on the 13th 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.410
 coast into the rock 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.840
 the 14 aldabra the Cantabrian 12 to the lace 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.170
 yong jo and the haifa fund they 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.270
 stop before listening to you and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.410
 to know why you like wahiba in 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.600
 head of your selection 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.570
 we're going to listen to a rispoli hammer in 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.700
 our minute pitch umberto you 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.020
 find wiper horse that you 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.460
 know well since it's you who 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.500
 have almost climbed to each of his 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.850
 races he finds the category of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.049
 disabilities in which he failed 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.189
 what do you think of his candidacy ben I 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.710
 see the choice the choice correio he goes 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.619
 to have a little worry taxes of your 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.020
 if on horseback we hoped a lot 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.470
 last year I won a race to 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.200
 longchamp 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.020
 it is a very green horse he was tense 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.390
 where we take it back in handicap 1 on the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.070
 field I think it can be a little 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.740
 if his pennies for it's going to be better for 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.860
 him 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.329
 the last time and what is it running super 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.009
 well I think the ground he has 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.540
 disturbed a little bit he took issue 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.470
 of the day 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.450
 unfortunately with the water 15 honoring 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.000
 the greenhouses we had said had a good 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.030
 course and let 's leave two 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.930
 trojans back and then finish for the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.100
 first time he goes to see hedges 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.270
 the Australian is what you think 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
 that it can really improve it 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.200
 yes that's exactly it knowing that he 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.729
 there is a lot of character even the year 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.100
 last when I won he made me 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.660
 a big gap on the pole and even 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.890
 the morning water he showed he has a lot 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.519
 of character I think it's going to be 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.049
 much he needs as first time 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.690
 and this Australian behind that to be 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.549
 well and at least we will try even if 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.580
 it will not hit with schedules 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.370
 Australian maybe even a little bit of 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.700
 smile thanks 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.380
 berthod at rispoli umberto talked about 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.000
 Australian blinds 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.980
 I think it was a choice 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.390
 preponderant for you but that's what 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.680
 made me put it at the top of my 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.290
 selection officially I had chosen 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.950
 the number 11 alice and nohra but when 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.959
 I saw that they had ears 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.519
 Australian I suspected that this 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.690
 could be his goal and what is 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.640
 very funny in this story is that 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.049
 humberto rispoli last year in this 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.700
 same race had fallen at the opening 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.060
 stalls he was associated with konig 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.500
 bernard 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.910
 he has a revenge to certainly take 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.410
 in this race he was upset he had 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.370
 threw his whip away like that in a 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.079
 rage 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.180
 so this year I'm sure he's going 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.220
 take revenge we see it raining 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.720
 is the terrain going to benefit web 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.519
 so contrary to what could 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.200
 to imply its origins are 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.250
 origin of good riding grounds which 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.810
 did its best performance in 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.340
 very flexible terrain so that's the 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.280
 mysteries of genetics 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.660
 we do not explain the favorite will be 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.269
 certainly number 11 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.200
 alice onera who comes from very well 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.150
 run to the crust 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.709
 yes and who also has a revenge to 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.269
 take a revenge to take on the 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.579
 fate because that day it was wrong 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.019
 past was completely closed behind 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.500
 a curtain of a competitor at the beginning the 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.690
 straight line 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.639
 the passage that opens 200 meters from 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.690
 the arrival she gushes she ends up strong 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.290
 with a take the second the third 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.340
 square 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.840
 a few meters further then was at 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.880
 less second it was too late for 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.380
 worry the winner who had made the 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.370
 difference for a long time but this 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.230
 end of race has undoubtedly left 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.549
 some regrets to his supporters and 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.870
 she indicated that she may yield 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.160
 largely the size of a race of this 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.229
 kind then I see her waiting well in 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.150
 removal of boxes and in full track and 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:53.010
 finish very strong very strong but second 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.080
 behind yes that's it's my scenario 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.030
 then in third position of the scenario 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.459
 favorite of offers in social this is the 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.840
 number 6 royal prize that starts at 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.909
 acclimatize to French races 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.200
 8 he began his career in 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.150
 England in the handicaps 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.390
 it's the brother of gold medalist who 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.879
 had removed a price kergolay mi6 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.290
 deauville so it was the other 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.909
 will play in a handicap at chantilly he 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.380
 is very close beaten little I even thought a 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.769
 moment he was going to be able to argue 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.570
 victory 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.449
 he will certainly still progressed on 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.400
 this attempt according to myriam bollack them 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.570
 it's not a big special 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.340
 heavy ground but it will not be 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.820
 unduly disadvantage by a track 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.050
 very flexible 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.729
 I think he has the shoe size 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.169
 a good horse and who must win doctor 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.919
 a race of this player the problem 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.960
 is that there are still good 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.669
 customers in this race is that you 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.229
 like 12 well Cantabria started 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.100
 evidence it was the chantilly note 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.060
 never say it's a little bit all the time 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.220
 the standard then notes the worst that alice and 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.760
 nohra because that day they were stuck 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.229
 obliged to change delisle right to 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.830
 league repeatedly he finished 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.690
 in a bang 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.710
 I prefer alice and nora deficiency in the 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.250
 mare on the rising which has 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.830
 potential 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.330
 there is an old a good horse who is 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.380
 health poems that comes back well 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.380
 is good that the world so on its momentum 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.760
 he can succeed something but good alice 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.930
 and nora it seems safer I prefer 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.229
 the brand new horses that are on the 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.760
 same time you have it no to you have it 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.550
 also passed in seven sections 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.720
 there we go to the top of the table they 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.099
 stay on a nice performance at 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.780
 houses-laffitte I found - yes and 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.490
 this study does interesting performance 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.110
 because it was established on a course 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.160
 in all respects comparable to this one but 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.990
 600 meters straight to houses 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.310
 laffitte there are only two racetracks 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.940
 moulias 1600 meters straight line to 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.530
 houses laffitte 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.620
 it's deauville and aimed the fit so 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.599
 it was on this course that he showed a 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.520
 regain of form that he reassure me because I 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.740
 seemed a little less brave 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.690
 season last year he had done well 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.580
 proof of exemplary regularity while 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.169
 throughout the year from 1200 to 1600 meters 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.639
 at the beginning of the season he was a little fumbled 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.080
 meas and and many others play so 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.690
 it's a good horse 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.280
 I know that research author says he 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:52.190
 well and that it counts before 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.750
 from Iran to see our viewers we are going 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.490
 watch your selection françois 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.530
 charles and your game board in all 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.090
 thank you thank you thank you everyone 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.070
 to have followed we are soon 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.580
