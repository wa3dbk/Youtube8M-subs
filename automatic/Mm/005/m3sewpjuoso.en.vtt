five questions we got some good ones and
let's<00:00:44.840> keep<00:00:45.050> these<00:00:45.170> questions<00:00:45.620> coming<00:00:45.770> first

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
let's keep these questions coming first

YouTube and he asks whey isolate is

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.940 
YouTube and he asks whey isolate is
expensive<00:00:52.910> is<00:00:53.149> it<00:00:53.420> really<00:00:53.810> necessary<00:00:53.950> we're

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
expensive is it really necessary we're

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.680 
expensive is it really necessary we're
not<00:00:55.130> dieting<00:00:55.579> i<00:00:55.760> like<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:56.030> use<00:00:56.060> regular<00:00:56.570> way

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
not dieting i like to use regular way

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.900 
not dieting i like to use regular way
and<00:00:56.870> other<00:00:56.960> types<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.410> protein<00:00:57.829> well<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.489> very

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
and other types of protein well a very

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.910 
and other types of protein well a very
good<00:00:59.149> hydrolyzed<00:01:00.079> whey<00:01:00.290> isolate<00:01:00.470> i<00:01:00.770> don't

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
good hydrolyzed whey isolate i don't

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.319 
good hydrolyzed whey isolate i don't
know<00:01:00.980> that<00:01:01.010> i<00:01:01.160> would<00:01:01.280> say<00:01:01.430> it's<00:01:01.550> necessary<00:01:02.149> but

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
know that i would say it's necessary but

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.630 
know that i would say it's necessary but
i<00:01:02.390> think<00:01:02.630> it's<00:01:02.780> important<00:01:03.350> enough<00:01:03.440> that<00:01:04.070> you

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
i think it's important enough that you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.249 
i think it's important enough that you
want<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:04.879> budget<00:01:05.149> if<00:01:05.539> you<00:01:05.719> don't<00:01:05.899> have<00:01:06.020> any

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
want to budget if you don't have any

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.319 
want to budget if you don't have any
other<00:01:06.439> time<00:01:06.649> a<00:01:06.710> day<00:01:06.950> at<00:01:07.219> least<00:01:07.490> budget<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:08.210> have

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
other time a day at least budget to have

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.539 
other time a day at least budget to have
a<00:01:08.359> high-quality<00:01:08.689> whey<00:01:09.350> protein<00:01:09.740> isolate<00:01:09.859> post

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
a high-quality whey protein isolate post

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.399 
a high-quality whey protein isolate post
workout<00:01:11.149> because<00:01:11.359> we<00:01:11.600> know<00:01:11.719> enough<00:01:11.869> evidence

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
workout because we know enough evidence

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.109 
workout because we know enough evidence
to<00:01:12.560> show<00:01:12.770> of<00:01:13.039> its<00:01:13.490> muscle<00:01:13.819> building

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
to show of its muscle building

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.690 
to show of its muscle building
capabilities<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.469> again<00:01:16.100> for<00:01:16.280> my<00:01:16.399> money<00:01:16.609> I

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
capabilities and again for my money I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.730 
capabilities and again for my money I
think<00:01:16.969> there's<00:01:17.090> known<00:01:17.270> better<00:01:17.539> than<00:01:17.749> vp2<00:01:18.109> whey

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
think there's known better than vp2 whey

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.099 
think there's known better than vp2 whey

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
isolate by AST sports science so again

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.749 
isolate by AST sports science so again
if<00:01:21.469> there's<00:01:21.679> only<00:01:21.829> one<00:01:22.100> time<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.399> day<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:22.520> can

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
if there's only one time of day you can

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.669 
if there's only one time of day you can
take<00:01:22.909> it<00:01:23.060> budget<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.600> way<00:01:23.869> ice<00:01:24.079> hydrolyzed

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
take it budget that way ice hydrolyzed

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.169 
take it budget that way ice hydrolyzed
by<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:24.829> slept<00:01:25.100> for<00:01:25.310> directly<00:01:25.670> post<00:01:25.909> training

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
by I slept for directly post training

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:27.669 
by I slept for directly post training
and<00:01:26.659> then<00:01:26.780> if<00:01:26.869> you<00:01:26.990> will<00:01:27.109> need<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:27.259> use<00:01:27.439> other

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
and then if you will need to use other

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.230 
and then if you will need to use other
protein<00:01:28.130> sources<00:01:28.429> throughout<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.909> rest<00:01:29.090> of

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
protein sources throughout the rest of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.480 
protein sources throughout the rest of
the<00:01:29.359> day<00:01:29.389> then<00:01:29.990> that<00:01:30.229> would<00:01:30.350> be<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.799> different

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
the day then that would be a different

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.569 
the day then that would be a different
and<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.939> better<00:01:32.090> option<00:01:32.920> question<00:01:33.920> 2<00:01:34.219> comes

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
and a better option question 2 comes

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.399 
and a better option question 2 comes
from<00:01:34.819> call<00:01:35.359> master<00:01:35.810> me<00:01:35.929> and<00:01:36.109> this<00:01:36.200> came

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
from call master me and this came

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.649 
from call master me and this came
through<00:01:36.619> YouTube<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.759> he<00:01:37.850> says<00:01:38.029> I<00:01:38.149> understand

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
through YouTube and he says I understand

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.870 
through YouTube and he says I understand
that<00:01:38.899> in<00:01:39.020> max<00:01:39.229> 40<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:40.130> should<00:01:40.310> do<00:01:40.399> a<00:01:40.429> working

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
that in max 40 you should do a working

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.300 
that in max 40 you should do a working
set<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.270> muscular<00:01:41.749> failure<00:01:42.109> did<00:01:42.979> you<00:01:43.100> really

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
set to muscular failure did you really

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.730 
set to muscular failure did you really
do<00:01:43.549> all<00:01:43.729> those<00:01:43.909> squats<00:01:44.270> sets<00:01:44.599> to<00:01:44.779> failure<00:01:45.200> that

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
do all those squats sets to failure that

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.289 
do all those squats sets to failure that
would<00:01:45.920> mean<00:01:46.039> that<00:01:46.099> you<00:01:46.279> did<00:01:46.429> every<00:01:46.729> set<00:01:46.999> so

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
would mean that you did every set so

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.580 
would mean that you did every set so
that<00:01:47.329> you<00:01:47.569> couldn't<00:01:47.779> get<00:01:48.020> up<00:01:48.139> from<00:01:48.170> out<00:01:48.409> of<00:01:48.439> the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
that you couldn't get up from out of the
