00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.009
 Good day to you Anastasia 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.259
 today we will cook with you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.320
 orange muffins for cooking 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.380
 we need wheat flour 190 grams 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.350
 eggs three pieces sugar 150 to 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.720
 butter 150 grams baking powder 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.660
 one and a half teaspoons and 1 orange 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.330
 ingredients for 10-12 muffins 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.400
 medium sized butter and eggs 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.529
 should be room temperature so 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.349
 what is best delivered from the fridge 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.660
 before cooking 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.820
 forget to turn on the oven and prepare 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.890
 Bakeware 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.329
 for a start, wash the orange well and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.489
 give it to boiling water 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.550
 this will make it much easier for us 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.829
 take it to the center I remind you that the center 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.989
 This is the dyed part of the orange skin 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.129
 so try to shoot the top 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.020
 orange part 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.840
 it contains all essential 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.340
 oils but the white part of the skin is capable 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.100
 give the dish only bitterness 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.500
 with the help of a special grater 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.120
 or just a sharp knife remove the zest with 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.560
 oranges we need 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.270
 about 1 tablespoon zest 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.790
 then cut the orange in half and 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.760
 squeeze the juice from one half to us 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.650
 need about 50 milliliter juice in order 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.780
 to make it easier to squeeze the juice out 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.030
 orange can you guess a little 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.340
 the table naturally has to do this before 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.710
 you present to him cutting 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.390
 palm orange and slightly pressing on 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.670
 roll it on the table 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.350
 this procedure will destroy the fibers in 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.079
 the middle and the court will be much easier 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.270
 squeeze deep bowl put 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.439
 softened butter and add 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.600
 sugar to it 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.360
 if desired, it can be replaced by sugar 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.759
 powder then warm up carefully from with 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.909
 oiled in a uniform mind for convenience 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.939
 You can use a separate mixer 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.009
 capacity break the egg then add 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.360
 its to sugar with butter and whip until 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.909

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.370
 state then added the following 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.180

 Kiev is not worth Kielce immediately in the dough 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.740
 best broken has a little to do 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.870
 and then add to the dough and even here 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.540
 appears come across infrequently but if 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.320

 add orange zest and juice to it 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.610
 from the clutches it is mixed but this stage 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.840
 most often the rest is stratified but 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.180
 it should not scare you 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.230
 besides muffins oranges you can 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.060
