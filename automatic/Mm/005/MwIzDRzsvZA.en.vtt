00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.730
 the truth that we give a lot 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.980
 much importance to what the league 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.470

 the tournament in addition to having a title 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.650
 international of being a champion gives you the 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.039
 possibility of playing the World Cup 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.859
 clubs 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.990
 good as meaning a lot not many 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.359
 we know that blue is used ago 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.780
 many years lacking titles 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.090
 it's 16 years since I did not win a league but 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.370
 in this circumstance any tournament or 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.350
 any title comes to be this one 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.850
 support important and mentally the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.579
 team is fine because it has already 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.170
 talked about studies are the first 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.239
 be aware of the importance that 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.010
 This tournament has the first 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.530
 they feel like winning such a tournament 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.870
 important and the first to understand the 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.850
 Importance of going to a club world cup 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.789
 what mentally the eight teams are going 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.179
 to be very motivated but rivalry 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.649
 what is between the Mexican teams and 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.460
 Americans has grown a lot 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.570
 American football has improved 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.000
 in a considerable way nowadays 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.680
 they are in a position to be a very 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.570
 globally important not know 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.600
 us who teams out there 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.720
 They come Elian or less height you 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.009
 costs the blue is not a stadium not only 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.619
 for the height of the city of mexico 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.960
 but it's also heavy not then there 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.610
 we also have an advantage us more 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.380
 beyond football conditions and 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.840
 the team that we have that can play 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.540
 please our I believe that in the end in 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.600
 a two- leg eliminator the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.369
 first party is the most important me 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.690
 I think the first game you can have 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.690
 certain clarity of what will be the 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.000
 second that's why it's very important I hope 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.860
 can add and be able to add well today in the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.030
 soccer we all know each other we know 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.700
 what are the strengths weaknesses 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.830
 from the rival I think there are few secrets 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.740
 in football but who cares bad 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.020
 details are usually the teams that most 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.179
 things get there are not many 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.920
 factors to be so even all I 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.569
 I think first the handling of the ball 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.009
 playing football well after the 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.140
 intensity and of course the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.970
 dosage that each team gives 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.880
 because obviously we are 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.910
 playing the league tournament the ms and 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.500
 he will also be playing his tournament and coast 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.319
 rich also in panama in order that 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.030
 dosage may be given to the establishment 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.120
 to be in the best moment of the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.520
 important matches first we 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.010
 We thought we would give up a blue cross not 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.170
 must do a great tournament of power 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.080
 consecrated and also in that way you go to 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.209
 leave high the name of the country not 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.780
 in this case mexico I think we are a 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.390
 strong team a strong team a team 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.830
 that has received few goals and that 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.739
 We are working to have a 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.390
 strongest offensive we pose create is 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.160
 what we have a solid team that 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.560
 we can fight with any rival in 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.080
 any field we are very excited 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.730
 of doing things well of being a good 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.980
 group to be a solid team and 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.360
 obviously we will look for it to do the same in 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.620
 the league of champions and we will look 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.620
 advance to the next phase
