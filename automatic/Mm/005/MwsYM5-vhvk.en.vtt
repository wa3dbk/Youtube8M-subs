logging<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:58.099> night<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.579> was<00:02:58.700> just<00:02:58.730> really

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
logging the night it was just really

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.949 
logging the night it was just really
really<00:02:59.829> noisy<00:03:00.829> and<00:03:01.069> extremely<00:03:01.939> dark<00:03:02.329> so<00:03:02.750> I

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959

there I hope it is that was someone with
like<00:06:34.339> a<00:06:34.370> tan<00:06:34.729> would<00:06:35.330> be<00:06:35.539> amazing<00:06:36.379> I<00:06:36.500> would<00:06:36.680> not

like a tan would be amazing I would not

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.170

be<00:06:36.979> able<00:06:37.069> to<00:06:37.219> wear<00:06:37.370> it<00:06:37.490> now<00:06:37.610> that<00:06:37.819> maybe<00:06:37.940> during

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
be able to wear it now that maybe during

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.420 
be able to wear it now that maybe during
the<00:06:38.270> summer<00:06:38.569> time<00:06:38.839> for<00:06:39.229> some<00:06:39.409> weddings<00:06:39.860> I

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430
