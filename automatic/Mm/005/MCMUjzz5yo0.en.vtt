00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
for you go for the VH 11 if you have the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.010 
for you go for the VH 11 if you have the
right<00:01:53.070> drum<00:01:53.550> module<00:01:53.820> check<00:01:54.660> out<00:01:54.840> the

description<00:01:55.410> for<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.790> reason<00:01:57.150> for<00:01:57.270> my

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
description for this the reason for my

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.930 
description for this the reason for my
decision<00:01:57.900> is<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.380> VH<00:01:58.680> 11<00:01:59.250> gives<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.729> much<00:01:59.910> more

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
decision is the VH 11 gives a much more

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.810 
decision is the VH 11 gives a much more
realistic<00:02:00.630> feeling<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.920> basically<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
realistic feeling so it's basically the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.690 
realistic feeling so it's basically the
same<00:02:02.850> as<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.330> real<00:02:03.570> hi-hat<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.470> cy<00:02:04.890> 5<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
same as a real hi-hat the cy 5 is the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.940 
same as a real hi-hat the cy 5 is the
more<00:02:05.880> affordable<00:02:06.300> pet<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.500> feels<00:02:07.770> just

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
more affordable pet but it feels just

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.130 
more affordable pet but it feels just
not<00:02:08.580> as<00:02:08.820> good<00:02:09.090> as<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.390> other<00:02:09.570> one<00:02:09.869> while

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
not as good as the other one while

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.560 
not as good as the other one while
playing<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.800> thanks<00:02:11.580> for<00:02:11.640> watching<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:12.480> you
