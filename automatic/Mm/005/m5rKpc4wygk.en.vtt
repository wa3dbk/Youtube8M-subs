you know I am I mean because it was one

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.240 
you know I am I mean because it was one
eight<00:00:30.630> last<00:00:30.869> year<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.830> didn't<00:00:32.040> talk<00:00:32.189> about

everybody<00:00:34.620> went<00:00:34.829> crazy<00:00:35.100> when<00:00:35.309> golden<00:00:35.640> stage

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
everybody went crazy when golden stage

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.340 
everybody went crazy when golden stage
being<00:00:36.059> Dallas<00:00:36.390> but<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.600> thought<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.989> Memphis

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
being Dallas but I thought the Memphis

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.049 
being Dallas but I thought the Memphis
Grizzlies<00:00:37.590> without<00:00:38.040> rudy<00:00:38.370> Gay<00:00:38.550> arguably

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
Grizzlies without rudy Gay arguably

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.790 
Grizzlies without rudy Gay arguably
probably<00:00:39.390> their<00:00:39.510> best<00:00:39.629> player<00:00:39.960> him<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.649> Zach

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
probably their best player him in Zach

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.740 
probably their best player him in Zach
Randolph<00:00:41.250> rudy<00:00:41.700> Gay<00:00:41.730> not<00:00:42.030> planned<00:00:42.300> they<00:00:42.510> went

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
Randolph rudy Gay not planned they went

at<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.140> Spurs<00:00:43.410> I'm<00:00:43.680> looking<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.309> Memphis

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
at the Spurs I'm looking for the Memphis

at the Spurs I'm looking for the Memphis
Grizzlies<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.600> team<00:00:45.780> will<00:00:45.899> even

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
an interesting game from the simple fact

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.390 
an interesting game from the simple fact
that<00:01:19.020> I'm<00:01:19.110> sure<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.920> blower's<00:01:20.250> are

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
that I'm sure that the blower's are

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.670 
that I'm sure that the blower's are
somehow<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.240> regroup<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> figure<00:01:22.500> out

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
somehow going to regroup and figure out

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
what what kind of broke down late in

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.810 
what what kind of broke down late in
this<00:01:24.810> series<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.130> think<00:01:26.580> they're<00:01:26.700> just

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this series and I think they're just

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.760 
this series and I think they're just
gonna<00:01:27.060> add<00:01:27.240> another<00:01:27.420> guy<00:01:27.840> they<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.560> add<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
gonna add another guy they have to add a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.010 
gonna add another guy they have to add a
two<00:01:29.430> guard<00:01:29.640> who<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.180> relieve<00:01:30.780> some<00:01:30.990> pressure

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
two guard who can relieve some pressure

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.350 
two guard who can relieve some pressure
and<00:01:31.680> make<00:01:32.159> sure<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.119> they're

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
well I think the big three is obviously

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.969 
well I think the big three is obviously
gonna<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> spotlight<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.470> think<00:01:55.829> those

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
gonna have the spotlight I think those

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.160 
gonna have the spotlight I think those
three<00:01:56.250> guys<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.790> think<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> focus<00:01:57.780> gonna<00:01:58.020> have

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
three guys I think the focus gonna have

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.600 
three guys I think the focus gonna have
to<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.439> for<00:01:58.619> those<00:01:58.740> three<00:01:59.009> we<00:01:59.130> all<00:01:59.280> know<00:01:59.460> they

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
to be for those three we all know they

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.940 
to be for those three we all know they
can<00:01:59.790> score<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.299> out<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.840> those<00:02:01.049> three<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.890> of

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
can score but out of those three all of

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.800 
can score but out of those three all of
them<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> think<00:02:02.520> have<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> mindset<00:02:03.689> is

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
them I think have to get the mindset is

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.300 
them I think have to get the mindset is
we<00:02:04.020> don't<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.469> able<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.680> defend<00:02:05.040> teams

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
we don't have to be able to defend teams

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.520 
we don't have to be able to defend teams
and<00:02:05.610> shut<00:02:05.909> guys<00:02:06.149> down<00:02:06.509> with<00:02:06.840> their<00:02:07.049> athletic
