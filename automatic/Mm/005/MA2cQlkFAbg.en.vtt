this is organic cocoa butter this one

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.190 
this is organic cocoa butter this one
smells<00:00:35.600> like<00:00:35.690> chocolate

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
smells like chocolate

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.200 
smells like chocolate
it<00:00:36.320> hasn't<00:00:36.470> been<00:00:36.649> deodorized<00:00:37.220> this<00:00:38.000> is<00:00:38.180> a

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
it hasn't been deodorized this is a

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.110 
it hasn't been deodorized this is a
organic<00:00:39.050> virgin<00:00:39.649> coconut<00:00:40.010> oil<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:40.670> it<00:00:40.850> still

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
organic virgin coconut oil and it still

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.020 
organic virgin coconut oil and it still
smells<00:00:41.450> like<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.780> coconut<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:42.440> then<00:00:43.370> these

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
smells like the coconut and then these

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.709 
smells like the coconut and then these
are<00:00:44.239> organic<00:00:45.200> semi-sweet<00:00:46.450> chocolate<00:00:47.450> chips

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
are organic semi-sweet chocolate chips

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.060 
are organic semi-sweet chocolate chips
that<00:00:47.930> are<00:00:47.989> high<00:00:48.649> in<00:00:48.950> cocoa<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.110> so<00:00:51.110> this<00:00:51.890> is

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
that are high in cocoa and so this is

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.850 
that are high in cocoa and so this is
going<00:00:52.190> to<00:00:52.250> make<00:00:52.460> three<00:00:53.030> little<00:00:53.210> pots<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:54.530> it's

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
going to make three little pots so it's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.240 
going to make three little pots so it's
really<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.340> good<00:00:56.210> idea<00:00:56.539> if<00:00:56.809> you<00:00:57.289> want<00:00:57.440> it<00:00:57.590> to<00:00:57.739> set

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
really a good idea if you want it to set

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.740 
really a good idea if you want it to set
up<00:00:58.370> faster<00:00:58.850> if<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.059> have<00:00:59.239> like<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.450> little

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
up faster if you have like a little

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.979 
up faster if you have like a little
frozen<00:01:00.910> you<00:01:01.910> know<00:01:01.940> thing<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.660> keeps<00:01:02.840> your

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
frozen you know thing that keeps your

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.499 
frozen you know thing that keeps your
boot<00:01:03.379> cold<00:01:04.039> just<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.430> put<00:01:04.610> that<00:01:04.759> on<00:01:04.969> top<00:01:05.000> here

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
boot cold just to put that on top here

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.889 
boot cold just to put that on top here
and<00:01:05.659> then<00:01:06.649> all<00:01:06.920> you're<00:01:07.100> going<00:01:07.399> to<00:01:07.490> do<00:01:07.789> is<00:01:08.090> just

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
and then all you're going to do is just

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.719 
and then all you're going to do is just
first<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:09.380> need<00:01:09.529> to<00:01:09.560> melt<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.249> cocoa<00:01:10.459> butter

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
first you need to melt the cocoa butter

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.010 
first you need to melt the cocoa butter
so<00:01:11.179> I've<00:01:11.659> already<00:01:11.899> done<00:01:12.020> that<00:01:12.409> of<00:01:13.179> the<00:01:14.179> cocoa

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
so I've already done that of the cocoa

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:23.980 
so I've already done that of the cocoa
butter<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:20.740> then<00:01:21.740> you're<00:01:22.189> just<00:01:22.369> going<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:22.990> put

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
butter and then you're just going to put

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.899 
butter and then you're just going to put
your<00:01:24.170> your<00:01:24.740> virgin<00:01:25.639> coconut<00:01:26.270> oil<00:01:26.630> in<00:01:26.929> here<00:01:27.909> and

stove if you don't you know if if you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.489 
stove if you don't you know if if you
don't<00:01:46.189> need<00:01:46.429> to<00:01:46.700> because<00:01:47.569> you<00:01:47.599> really<00:01:48.169> want<00:01:48.380> to

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
don't need to because you really want to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.069 
don't need to because you really want to
just<00:01:48.649> barely<00:01:49.069> melt<00:01:49.489> these<00:01:49.969> oils<00:01:50.419> and<00:01:50.630> not<00:01:50.749> ruin

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
just barely melt these oils and not ruin

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.199 
just barely melt these oils and not ruin
them<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.439> if<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.429> are<00:01:52.579> going<00:01:52.759> to<00:01:52.819> use<00:01:52.969> your

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
them and if you are going to use your

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:54.940 
them and if you are going to use your
just<00:01:53.509> on<00:01:53.749> the<00:01:53.899> stove<00:01:54.139> just<00:01:54.380> stay<00:01:54.529> right<00:01:54.709> by<00:01:54.889> it

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
just on the stove just stay right by it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.549 
just on the stove just stay right by it
because<00:01:55.249> they<00:01:55.369> burn<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:55.909> fast

00:01:59.549 --> 00:01:59.559 

00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:06.580 

just<00:02:00.559> pour<00:02:00.799> it<00:02:00.829> into<00:02:01.009> your<00:02:01.219> containers

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.260 

and<00:02:07.590> then<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.340> don't<00:02:08.550> want<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.790> disturb<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and then you don't want to disturb the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.270 
and then you don't want to disturb the
containers<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.320> want<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.740> have

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
containers because you want to have

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.680 
containers because you want to have
smooth<00:02:11.610> top<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.150> actually<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.570> could

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
smooth top so actually you could

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.860 
smooth top so actually you could
probably<00:02:12.870> get<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:14.310> know<00:02:14.430> only<00:02:15.120> one<00:02:15.450> more<00:02:15.660> out

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
probably get you know only one more out

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.500 
probably get you know only one more out
of<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.250> allow<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:18.000> set<00:02:18.330> up

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
of this and you just allow it to set up

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.610 
of this and you just allow it to set up
and<00:02:18.720> then<00:02:19.380> after<00:02:19.770> it's<00:02:19.890> done<00:02:20.130> then<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:21.210> just

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
and then after it's done then you just

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.050 
and then after it's done then you just
cap<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:24.050> it's<00:02:25.050> just<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.350> simple<00:02:25.760> lip<00:02:26.760> gloss

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
cap it and it's just a simple lip gloss

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.350 
cap it and it's just a simple lip gloss
