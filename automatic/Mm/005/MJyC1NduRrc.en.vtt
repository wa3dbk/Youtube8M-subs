00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
um well it's mainly a design phone if

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:16.940 
um well it's mainly a design phone if
you<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.720> design<00:02:15.840> there's<00:02:16.560> nothing<00:02:16.829> wrong

you like to design there's nothing wrong
with<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.280> but<00:02:17.629> it's<00:02:18.629> certainly<00:02:18.810> not<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.200> top

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
with it but it's certainly not the top

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.460 
with it but it's certainly not the top
of<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.680> bill<00:02:19.860> phone<00:02:20.420> which<00:02:21.420> everyone<00:02:21.840> should
