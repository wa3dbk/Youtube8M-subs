00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.619
 hello today look at the mural 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.050
 with 30 books marvel official collection 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.250
 comic book last time I did when 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.220
 there were 20 rooms 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.689
 but there is not confused 14 in my 15 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.310
 my release is therefore some kind of curve 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.859
 the fresco turned out only later 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.500
 noticed not for how when shot did not see 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.840
 this well today this will not happen today 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.540
 all exactly well let's see how 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:43.200
 it all looks and actually like this 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.600
 it all looks here 30 releases already 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.289
 half of the collection gathered in mind those 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.399
 who buys all issues don't miss either 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.219
 I don't know if I will collect all 60 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.250
 but up to 35 I will collect exactly and there 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.829
 let's see it this way it all looks 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.710
 let's get a little closer first see 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.530
 on the hulk but still it seems to me i am 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.549
 watched overseas collection there by 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.880
 my brazil 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.979
 here they are all matte color issues and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.650
 There are no these numbers in front 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.979
 It seems to me somehow matte looks for 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:27.270
 more solid than glossy here is such a halg he 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.490
 still closer still somehow not a sign 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.960
 looks crooked though they cost 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.540
 numbering but do not know unevenly as in these 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.020
 I do not like do not bring foam 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.579
 iron man here is such an iron 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.470
 man is also some kind he doesn't know 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:49.290
 unevenly still who looks see 21 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.540
 and number 22 is somehow one above the other a little 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.360
 is obtained and therefore uneven fresco is not 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.820
 I know why maybe because of the thickness 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.600
 books is that it never once not know 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.939
 It looks like abroad 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.259
 let's look at now 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:10.319
 so say roots with icons 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.989
 heroes again say what most 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.150
 while probably on the captain's roots 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.550
 America I do not remember whether five or 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.230
 six roots with the captain of the first we 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.599
 as always was the spiderman 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:29.900
 now closer here are spiderman people 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.900
 x iron man and gone 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.620
 and this all ends with us halk 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.620
 Planet Hulk Book 2 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.670
 the next one i remember is captain 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.920
 America again will be that is again 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.769
 captain will be even more on the spines 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.379
 but this way it all looks out of 30 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.940
 issues for those who do not collect 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:14.400
 we will see everything completely 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.569
 may still be then see how from 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.730
 forty books 50-60 but let's see it all 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.730
