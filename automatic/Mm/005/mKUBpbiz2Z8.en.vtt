 Hi there, this is the channel of your body's shadow 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.530
 coach Denis meladze and today 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.570
 I am telling you how to pump up the press as the same 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.779
 make these chic 6 cubes on your belly 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.699
 and it all starts with the fact that you come 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.039
 gym 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:31.109
 find a bench and start doing 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:33.480
 so here so here you think 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.730
 housing as many times as you can 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.340
 make a hundred reps can do 200 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.309
 reps the more the better 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.230
 and this of course does not help you, but all 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.989
 for some reason, because you need to eat less 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.809
 need to eat right yet no one 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.340
 pumped up his press here we do 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.559
 exercise for the press it does not help 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.449
 this is a huge misconception that people 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.899
 I think that I will come to the gym 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.649
 I'll start doing you brought my huge 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.870
 burden 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.460
 will go away from them this 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.130
 prejudice and for all some fantasies 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.260
 there is no such thing to make a press 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.990
 need to eat right about 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.229

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.180
 I sometimes do there once a month 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.939
 when i have something nice i shake my press 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.700
 and only do without poke enthusiasm 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.579

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.799
