00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.879
 understated car everything is clear new when 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.429
 it's about changing the ground clearance to 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.740
 speak not only its decrease you its 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.540
 increase owners of arrested 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.370
 SUVs for example were very surprised 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.490
 having learned that their favorite all-terrain vehicles are now 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.560
 may be outlawed in one of 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.140
 garages where cars are born ready 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.330
 drive along any roads and even with them 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.830
 no one was wary of saying 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.500
 what's the ground clearance of these cars 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.449
 changing means to say nothing in 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.040
 deep tuning process he 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.899
 increases at times 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.680
 often at the very beginning of construction 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.899
 vehicle for any road or by machine 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.600
 my puts 6000 rubles guys are 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.510
 take two thousand rubles 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.520
 the lift kit itself all start at 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.420
 really because you want wheels on 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.270
 wheels buy it budget and budgets 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.559
 comparable to understating a car 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.239
 air suspension, then the trouble they can 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.859
 be common therefore with adepts 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.430
 opposite approach to tuning 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.689
 jeepers at the moment solidarity 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.880
 call there division at the start 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.979
 guys limit return nice to us 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.280
 a little simpler it is not yet clear how 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.930
 to act but roughly a guy 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.050
 if not the former 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.980
 1 lift the car we run run 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.930
 welded for those who forgot to remind the prince 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.970
 measured from the road surface to 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.770
 the lowest point of the central part 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.600
 car that is the owner of the jeep in 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.610
 last resort can solve the problem 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.979
 hope for one of the bridges pad 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.720
 required height as an exit 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.400
 obey with planks or 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.100
 air suspension Krasnoyarsk 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.500
 motorists still do not need news 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.450
 circled internet is that now everything 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.160
 DPS crews equip special 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.810
 ruler with which they will 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.180
 measure ground clearance 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.950
 turned out to be only narrow no law 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.810
 really accepted but only in 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 selected regions of the Canary region 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.250
 for example, Krasnoyarsk can continue 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.530
 quietly ride and quietly embed in not 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.479
 folk air for example such by the way 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.070
 perfectly obtained from old 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.709
 Nissan tyrant was very successful 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.170
 model by the way recently appeared nissan 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.700
 third generation terrano and some of 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.500
 first Krasnoyarsk with this machine 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.900
 would meet about the features of the new 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.500
 SUV will tell our constant 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.500
 heading test drive 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.370
 legends come alive again and on Russian 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.319
 the market comes new nissan terrano 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.050
 truth from that very legendary 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.650
 equal rogue with ship diesel 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.610
 under the hood there is only a name 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.100
 today in our test drive hit 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.400
 car in a truly legendary name 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.620
 nissan terrano really guess from 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.290
 old well familiar to all nissan 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.450
 the tyrant on which Krasnoyarsk in that 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.950
 number have been passed 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.470
 many kilometers without health here 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.769
 there is little left since Nissan remember 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.680
 friends now co-authored 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.360
 in one concern with the company market and so 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.459
 on the SUV test already by starodub 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.260
 be born and we invited the organizer 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.600
 diverse and road trips in 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.180
 particularly the eshkin Irie Mikhail Bochkarev 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.400
 on the road to the new tyrants no complaints 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.750
 for two-liter SUV with a gun 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.910
 albeit with front wheel drive 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.680
 car behaves well to find fault 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.090
 vehicle weight dynamics 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.470
 A little bit reaching 2 tone is difficult 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.360
 Here I am now reconstructed moment 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.250
 the feeling that this puzoterka cheese sat on 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.200
 huge jeep and don't understand its size 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.180
 what am I here now a little bit of gas well and 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.070
 crush something ahead going priory 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.190
 understated well because it is understated 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.680
 you understand everything is good car 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.329
 although on the other hand it still gives 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.030
 a bit of that feeling that you're still 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.820
 drive more serious 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.769
 after all, no crossover 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.019
 that is, especially water in the rearview mirror 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.880
 kind of watching and understand that you are superfluous 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.579
 the driver's face from the car behind 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.650
 the roof of this car is still there 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.269
 a certain height well due to clearance 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.790
 agree well with you here 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.709
 new tyrant feel confident like 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.140
 in city traffic and on the highway 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.430
 despite the 4-speed automatic on 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.250
 car can be quite comfortable 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.530
 maintain speed above 90 kilometers 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.269
 in an hour the freeway for example is gaining 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.380
 normal speed itself does not feel 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.019
 you know a little city ​​traffic 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.700
 failure at the very start I think it is 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.400
 traction control gives us not 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.539
 allows wheels to slip as 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.039
 still front-wheel drive 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:34.229
 but then a tangible jerk goes 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.940
 further right good this acceleration well 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.159
 that is, for an adequate person when 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.099
 need it to speed up and make it 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:43.080
 worthy of the highway will spend well 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.960
 despite the 4-speed automatic 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.780
 very long gears therefore but not 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.610
 I will say that she will spend there 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.330
 the wildest amount of fuel on high 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.490
 speeds 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.680
 remember which car owned the name 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.479
 tyrant before and try yourself then 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.000
 move with front wheel drive of course 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.889
 off road will not build but try 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.380
 drive the car on the harsh paths to the dacha 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.700
 plot can be exactly 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.940
 people i went to many different 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.490
 cars and so far this is the first 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.020
 which with this one on this road behaves 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.850
 so comfortable that is here already 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.160
 you can even gossip a little and even 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.710
 somewhere add speed and still 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.780
 quite comfortable and not the board 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:29.180
 drags and Misha know even taking into account 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.790
 that we are already here directly say hooligans 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.250
 we have such a pillar or a huge and 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.580
 somewhere we can even afford 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.850
 spin the steering wheel a little bit 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.850
 demolishing 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.759
 and by the way the system works 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.469
 traction as soon as we started 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:52.039
 like this hooligan immediately caught fire 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:56.300
 badge 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:58.089
 immediately caught fire icon yes and when we here 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.379
 so returned 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:02.869
 he immediately relieves 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:06.529
 that is, says guys what are you doing 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:09.319
 let's move around 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:11.629
 gravel quickly helps espen system 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.529
 anti slip does not give a new tyrant 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.360
 go into a skid 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:16.669
 invisibly watching the driver and 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.259
 getting involved in dangerous moments by the way 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.779
 disable it on the front wheel drive version 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:22.579
 with a gun you can not but the reason for the revan and 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:24.919
 tyrant with mechanics and locks 

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:26.959
 wheel drive ready to let the driver 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.209
 fumble back on the asphalt after 

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:30.930
 fence on the verge of even somehow sad 

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:33.000
 then 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.160
 enough despite the fact that the body has become 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.139
 carrying a suspension and independent 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.060
 ground clearance for example makes 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:40.979
 envy many classmates to 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.289
 power consumption of the suspension at the height of a 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:45.240
 quality tyrant's freight hint that 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:47.820
 for transportation of holiday homestead or for 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.250
 travel this car fits like 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.240
 no other see what's from 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:57.509
 front-drive trunk expect a 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.840
 by the way yes the trunk is quite large 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:03.810
 but wiped off she has a big name 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.479
 historical tyrant but this is not the same 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.099
 the tyrant is accustomed to 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:10.440
 which we knew which was harsh and 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:12.770
 cruel SUV equal good 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.770
 easy 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:19.410
 small and inexpensive for providing 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.690
 Thank you for the test car 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.789
 official dealership nissan leader

 not the center leader is a new dealership 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:27.539
