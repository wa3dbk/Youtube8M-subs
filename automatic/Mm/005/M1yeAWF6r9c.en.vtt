00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
was throwing so much metal away is and

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.820 
was throwing so much metal away is and
it<00:03:27.780> was<00:03:27.870> also<00:03:28.080> eating<00:03:28.650> into<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.790> bill<00:03:30.000> because

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
it was also eating into the bill because

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.350 
it was also eating into the bill because
when<00:03:31.830> they<00:03:31.950> charge<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.400> they<00:03:32.550> charge<00:03:32.819> by<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
when they charge you they charge by the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.470 
when they charge you they charge by the
tonnage<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:35.459> course<00:03:35.730> it's<00:03:35.910> metal<00:03:36.360> so

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
tonnage and of course it's metal so

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.120 
tonnage and of course it's metal so
that's<00:03:36.690> that's<00:03:36.989> really<00:03:37.230> going<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.560> add<00:03:37.739> up<00:03:37.769> to

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
that's that's really going to add up to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:45.680 
that's that's really going to add up to
quite<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.120> bit<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:43.610> landfill<00:03:44.610> charges<00:03:45.330> filled

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
quite a bit of landfill charges filled

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.600 
quite a bit of landfill charges filled
up<00:03:45.870> fees<00:03:46.190> stuff<00:03:47.190> lighting<00:03:47.489> like<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:49.610> yeah

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.820 
up fees stuff lighting like that so yeah
even<00:03:50.970> if<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.209> gotta<00:03:51.420> just<00:03:51.750> take<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.500> metal

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
even if you gotta just take the metal

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.180 
even if you gotta just take the metal
and<00:03:53.489> set<00:03:54.300> it<00:03:54.450> aside<00:03:54.680> until<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.800> have<00:03:56.010> enough

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
and set it aside until you have enough

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.490 
and set it aside until you have enough
to<00:03:56.370> turn<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.300> in

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
to turn it in

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.369 
to turn it in
it<00:03:58.620> will<00:03:58.890> be<00:03:59.070> well<00:03:59.340> worth<00:03:59.580> it

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.150

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
many thousands of metal that we're going

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.289 
many thousands of metal that we're going
but<00:04:16.750> it's<00:04:16.870> well<00:04:17.079> worth<00:04:17.349> it<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:18.220> just<00:04:19.120> save

your electrical cables you don't have to
strip<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.509> wire<00:04:31.750> it's<00:04:32.020> it's<00:04:32.919> more<00:04:33.130> profitable

anyway<00:05:00.659> we're<00:05:01.659> just<00:05:01.840> about<00:05:02.050> at<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.259> scrapyard

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
anyway we're just about at the scrapyard

00:05:03.069 --> 00:06:01.380 
anyway we're just about at the scrapyard
so<00:05:03.360> I'll<00:05:04.360> see<00:05:04.569> you<00:05:04.659> in<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.780> bit

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.430 

here's<00:06:02.390> a<00:06:02.450> motor<00:06:02.660> that<00:06:02.780> I

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
here's a motor that I

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.890 
here's a motor that I
I<00:06:03.470> figured<00:06:04.010> I'd<00:06:04.190> just<00:06:04.400> turn<00:06:05.330> it<00:06:05.450> in<00:06:05.630> and<00:06:05.750> see

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
I figured I'd just turn it in and see

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.350 
I figured I'd just turn it in and see
what<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.170> weight<00:06:06.350> is<00:06:06.380> on<00:06:06.740> that<00:06:07.090> because<00:06:08.090> you

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
what the weight is on that because you
