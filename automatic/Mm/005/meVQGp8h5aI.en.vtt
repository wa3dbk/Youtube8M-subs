but<00:01:48.340> this<00:01:48.490> is<00:01:48.640> another<00:01:48.880> mechanism<00:01:49.120> allows<00:01:49.780> us

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
but this is another mechanism allows us

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.980 
but this is another mechanism allows us
to<00:01:50.650> gain<00:01:50.890> secondary<00:01:51.550> benefit<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.180> what<00:01:52.960> a

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
to gain secondary benefit and what a

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.840 
to gain secondary benefit and what a
better<00:01:53.140> place<00:01:53.230> to<00:01:53.530> do<00:01:53.650> that<00:01:53.860> then<00:01:54.400> learn<00:01:54.700> from

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
better place to do that then learn from

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.280 
better place to do that then learn from
that<00:01:55.030> right<00:01:55.210> here<00:01:55.450> at<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.660> moment<00:01:56.020> Buffalo
