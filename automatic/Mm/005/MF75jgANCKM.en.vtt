video I absolutely love draw my life
videos<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.129> I<00:00:11.250> thought<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.940> would<00:00:12.030> be<00:00:12.150> fun<00:00:12.360> to

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
videos and I thought it would be fun to

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.379 
videos and I thought it would be fun to
see<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:13.110> draw<00:00:13.469> my<00:00:13.679> life<00:00:13.710> robbing<00:00:14.429> acne<00:00:14.880> person's

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.540 
point of view or from a pimples point of
view<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.660> why<00:00:18.960> do<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.200> get<00:00:19.349> acne<00:00:19.590> nobody<00:00:20.279> it

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
view so why do we get acne nobody it

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.190 
view so why do we get acne nobody it
really<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.970> completely<00:00:21.210> sure<00:00:21.660> what<00:00:21.960> causes

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
really is completely sure what causes

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.620 
really is completely sure what causes
acne<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:23.430> here's<00:00:23.669> some<00:00:23.880> stuff<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.239> is<00:00:24.300> known

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
acne but here's some stuff that is known

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.530 
acne but here's some stuff that is known
for<00:00:24.930> causing<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.300> when<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.329> go<00:00:27.509> through

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
for causing it so when we go through

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.720 
for causing it so when we go through
puberty<00:00:27.989> we<00:00:28.649> go<00:00:28.800> through<00:00:29.009> a<00:00:29.040> lot<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.369> hormonal

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
puberty we go through a lot of hormonal

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.790 
puberty we go through a lot of hormonal
changes<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.570> when<00:00:31.200> we<00:00:31.290> go<00:00:31.410> through<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.649> was

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
changes and when we go through that was

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.590 
changes and when we go through that was
hormonal<00:00:32.130> changes<00:00:32.640> our<00:00:32.820> hormones<00:00:33.300> are<00:00:33.480> going

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
hormonal changes our hormones are going

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.139 
hormonal changes our hormones are going
crazy<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.350> they<00:00:35.070> increase<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.820> production

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
crazy and they increase the production

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.870 
crazy and they increase the production
of<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:37.050> substance<00:00:37.440> called<00:00:37.680> sebum<00:00:38.220> and<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
of a substance called sebum and that is

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.380 
of a substance called sebum and that is
basically<00:00:39.090> oil<00:00:39.630> on<00:00:39.960> our<00:00:39.990> skin<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:42.030> sebum

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
basically oil on our skin so the sebum

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.050 
basically oil on our skin so the sebum
comes<00:00:42.720> from<00:00:43.140> within<00:00:43.320> pores<00:00:43.850> containing<00:00:44.850> hair

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
comes from within pores containing hair

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.930 
comes from within pores containing hair
follicles<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.620> secreted<00:00:47.040> by<00:00:47.310> glands

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
follicles and it's secreted by glands

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.380 
follicles and it's secreted by glands
called<00:00:48.500> sebaceous<00:00:49.500> glands<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.880> basically

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
called sebaceous glands so basically

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.680 
called sebaceous glands so basically
your<00:00:52.020> skin<00:00:52.410> uses<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> lot<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.310> oil<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.060> then<00:00:54.450> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
your skin uses a lot of oil and then the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.590 
your skin uses a lot of oil and then the
bacteria<00:00:55.380> and<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.950> extra<00:00:56.400> sebum<00:00:57.030> gets

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
bacteria and that extra sebum gets

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.569 
bacteria and that extra sebum gets
infected<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.620> creates<00:00:59.040> that<00:00:59.180> pimple<00:01:01.579> so

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
infected and it creates that pimple so

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.240 
infected and it creates that pimple so
too<00:01:02.670> much<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.450> sebum<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.409> infection

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
too much of the sebum in this infection

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.910 
too much of the sebum in this infection
can<00:01:05.489> cause<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.420> gland<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.200> expand<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
can cause that gland to expand and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.800 
can cause that gland to expand and
breakdown<00:01:08.370> cellular<00:01:08.940> walls<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.390> your<00:01:09.510> pores

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
breakdown cellular walls in your pores

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.350 
breakdown cellular walls in your pores
allowing<00:01:10.409> bacteria<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.220> grow<00:01:11.370> and<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
allowing bacteria to grow and as that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.560 
allowing bacteria to grow and as that
grows<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.720> creates<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.590> pimple<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
grows that creates a pimple and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.170 
grows that creates a pimple and
sometimes<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.020> pimple<00:01:16.470> will<00:01:16.710> pop<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
sometimes the pimple will pop and that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.680 
sometimes the pimple will pop and that
kind<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.600> destroys<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.010> walls<00:01:20.760> along<00:01:21.420> your

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
kind of destroys the walls along your

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.130 
kind of destroys the walls along your
skin<00:01:22.760> so<00:01:23.760> that<00:01:23.940> is<00:01:24.120> why<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.479> try<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.960> pop

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
skin so that is why we try not to pop

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.330 
skin so that is why we try not to pop
pimples<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.920> sometimes<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:27.030> happens

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
pimples but sometimes it happens

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.620 
pimples but sometimes it happens
so<00:01:29.340> usually<00:01:29.930> genetics<00:01:30.930> are<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.440> blame<00:01:31.680> for

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
so usually genetics are to blame for

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.490 
so usually genetics are to blame for
getting<00:01:33.630> acne<00:01:33.979> nobody<00:01:34.979> exactly<00:01:35.250> knows<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
getting acne nobody exactly knows the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.830 
getting acne nobody exactly knows the
sole<00:01:37.500> root<00:01:37.830> of<00:01:38.010> what<00:01:38.369> causes<00:01:38.640> acne<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.510> if

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
sole root of what causes acne but if

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.140 
sole root of what causes acne but if
your<00:01:40.200> parents<00:01:40.710> had<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.340> you're<00:01:41.610> probably<00:01:41.820> more

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
your parents had it you're probably more

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.260 
your parents had it you're probably more
likely<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.780> develop<00:01:42.900> oily<00:01:43.470> skin<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:44.850> kind

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
likely to develop oily skin and get kind

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.270 
likely to develop oily skin and get kind
of<00:01:45.330> clogged<00:01:45.659> pores<00:01:46.049> from<00:01:46.260> that<00:01:46.470> bacteria<00:01:47.040> or

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
of clogged pores from that bacteria or

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.160 
of clogged pores from that bacteria or
if<00:01:47.850> your<00:01:48.000> brothers<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.420> sisters<00:01:48.750> might<00:01:48.990> have

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
if your brothers and sisters might have

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.330 
if your brothers and sisters might have
it<00:01:49.350> you're<00:01:49.560> probably<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.950> little<00:01:50.040> bit<00:01:50.220> more

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it you're probably a little bit more

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.280 
it you're probably a little bit more
likely<00:01:51.150> to<00:01:51.330> have<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.920> however<00:01:52.920> there<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.250> no

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
likely to have it however there is no

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.289 
likely to have it however there is no
causation<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.650> is<00:01:55.950> scientifically<00:01:56.729> proven

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
causation that is scientifically proven

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.719 
causation that is scientifically proven
so<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:58.500> don't<00:01:58.710> really<00:01:58.770> know<00:01:59.010> exactly<00:01:59.430> how<00:01:59.670> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
so we don't really know exactly how to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.430 
so we don't really know exactly how to
avoid<00:02:00.090> acne<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.720> am<00:02:00.840> sorry

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.010 

but<00:02:06.440> we<00:02:06.560> do<00:02:06.740> know<00:02:06.950> why<00:02:07.160> acne<00:02:07.670> scars<00:02:08.000> form<00:02:08.420> so

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
but we do know why acne scars form so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.230 
but we do know why acne scars form so
acne<00:02:09.380> scars<00:02:09.710> happen<00:02:10.160> due<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.729> your<00:02:10.850> body's

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
acne scars happen due to your body's

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.510 
acne scars happen due to your body's
natural<00:02:11.480> reaction<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.320> stop<00:02:12.710> an<00:02:12.950> infection

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
natural reaction to stop an infection

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.580 
natural reaction to stop an infection
when<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.240> have<00:02:14.330> acne<00:02:14.540> white<00:02:14.990> blood<00:02:15.260> cells

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
when you have acne white blood cells

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.130 
when you have acne white blood cells
rush<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.430> infected<00:02:16.730> area<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.480> kill<00:02:17.990> the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
rush to the infected area and kill the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.400 
rush to the infected area and kill the
bacteria<00:02:18.740> there<00:02:19.100> by<00:02:19.700> using<00:02:19.970> enzymes<00:02:20.660> these

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
bacteria there by using enzymes these

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.260 
bacteria there by using enzymes these
enzymes<00:02:21.470> kill<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.310> bacteria<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.030> create

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
enzymes kill the bacteria and create

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.300 
enzymes kill the bacteria and create
puss<00:02:23.570> but<00:02:24.170> they<00:02:24.350> also<00:02:24.500> damage<00:02:25.100> the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
puss but they also damage the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.000 
puss but they also damage the
surrounding<00:02:25.490> tissue<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.420> your<00:02:26.450> skin<00:02:26.990> so<00:02:27.260> with

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
surrounding tissue in your skin so with

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.100 
surrounding tissue in your skin so with
these<00:02:28.190> damages<00:02:28.730> collagen<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.510> elastin

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
these damages collagen and elastin

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.260 
these damages collagen and elastin
cannot<00:02:30.770> regenerate<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.550> heal<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:32.060> wound

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
cannot regenerate and heal the wound

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.110 
cannot regenerate and heal the wound
leaving<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.870> scar<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:33.610> we<00:02:34.610> have<00:02:34.730> all<00:02:35.090> different

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
leaving a scar so we have all different

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.750 
leaving a scar so we have all different
types<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.810> scarring<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.650> can<00:02:36.890> occur<00:02:37.400> but<00:02:37.640> we

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
types of scarring that can occur but we

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.890 
types of scarring that can occur but we
also<00:02:37.910> develop<00:02:38.510> something<00:02:38.750> called

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
also develop something called

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.770 
also develop something called
hyperpigmentation<00:02:40.090> hyperpigmentation<00:02:41.090> is

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
hyperpigmentation hyperpigmentation is

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.960 
hyperpigmentation hyperpigmentation is
when<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.110> skin<00:02:42.380> starts<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.920> turn<00:02:43.160> red<00:02:43.459> purple

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
when the skin starts to turn red purple

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.030 
when the skin starts to turn red purple
or<00:02:44.060> brown<00:02:44.270> after<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:45.110> acne<00:02:45.440> is<00:02:45.530> gone<00:02:45.620> and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
or brown after the acne is gone and

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.860 
or brown after the acne is gone and
tends<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.730> stay<00:02:46.940> there<00:02:47.180> if<00:02:47.330> there's<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.600> scar

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
tends to stay there if there's a scar

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.290 
tends to stay there if there's a scar
along<00:02:48.140> with<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:49.160> pigmentation<00:02:49.670> occurs<00:02:50.120> at

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
along with it the pigmentation occurs at

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.140 
along with it the pigmentation occurs at
the<00:02:50.390> bottom<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.959> epidermis<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.880> then

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
the bottom of the epidermis and then

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.410 
the bottom of the epidermis and then
also<00:02:53.420> indentations<00:02:54.380> occur<00:02:55.370> when<00:02:55.910> someone

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
also indentations occur when someone

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.729 
also indentations occur when someone
picks<00:02:56.660> up<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.900> blemish<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.560> leaves

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
picks up the blemish and it leaves

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:08.229 
picks up the blemish and it leaves
behind<00:02:57.890> these<00:02:58.340> kind<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:58.820> scars

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.300 

so<00:03:09.239> there<00:03:09.420> are<00:03:09.540> two<00:03:09.780> main<00:03:10.469> different<00:03:10.920> kinds<00:03:11.189> of

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
so there are two main different kinds of

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.979 
so there are two main different kinds of
scars<00:03:11.609> there<00:03:12.599> is<00:03:14.180> hypertrophic<00:03:15.180> scars<00:03:15.599> and

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
scars there is hypertrophic scars and

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.110 
scars there is hypertrophic scars and
those<00:03:16.230> look<00:03:16.499> like<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.680> thick<00:03:17.069> bump<00:03:17.430> on<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:17.790> skin

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
those look like a thick bump on the skin

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.720 
those look like a thick bump on the skin
so<00:03:18.480> those<00:03:18.659> occur<00:03:19.019> outwards<00:03:19.560> but<00:03:20.249> the<00:03:20.489> most

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
so those occur outwards but the most

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.910 
so those occur outwards but the most
common<00:03:21.209> scars<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.719> people<00:03:22.379> have<00:03:22.620> our

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
common scars that people have our

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.009 
common scars that people have our
atrophic<00:03:23.340> scars<00:03:23.849> they're<00:03:24.480> deep<00:03:24.780> and

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
atrophic scars they're deep and

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.709 
atrophic scars they're deep and
sometimes<00:03:25.469> called<00:03:25.859> ice<00:03:26.189> pick<00:03:26.549> scars<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.510> those

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:27.719 
sometimes called ice pick scars so those

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.039 
sometimes called ice pick scars so those
are<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.989> scars<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.349> I<00:03:28.670> developed<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.969> I<00:03:30.569> had

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
are the scars that I developed and I had

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.409 
are the scars that I developed and I had
a<00:03:31.260> lot<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.590> scars<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.639> had<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:33.030> lot<00:03:33.389> of

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
a lot of scars and I had a lot of

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.339 
a lot of scars and I had a lot of
pigmentation<00:03:34.139> or<00:03:34.590> hyperpigmentation<00:03:36.139> so<00:03:37.139> I'm

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
pigmentation or hyperpigmentation so I'm

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.170

couple ways of getting rid of nasty

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.920 
couple ways of getting rid of nasty
scars<00:03:49.280> glycolic<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.430> salicylic<00:03:50.599> acids<00:03:51.599> help

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
scars glycolic and salicylic acids help

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.409 
scars glycolic and salicylic acids help
to<00:03:52.139> exfoliate<00:03:52.319> these<00:03:52.799> areas<00:03:53.280> by<00:03:53.819> helping<00:03:54.209> them

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
to exfoliate these areas by helping them

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.689 
to exfoliate these areas by helping them
remove<00:03:54.870> pigmentation<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.799> dead<00:03:56.010> skin<00:03:56.370> cells

first<00:04:36.560> layer<00:04:36.980> of<00:04:37.040> skin<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:38.120> they<00:04:38.690> can<00:04:38.900> be

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
first layer of skin and they can be

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.950 
first layer of skin and they can be
pretty<00:04:39.230> costly<00:04:39.770> with<00:04:40.190> an<00:04:40.280> average<00:04:40.490> about

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
pretty costly with an average about

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.950 
pretty costly with an average about
$2,000<00:04:41.960> per<00:04:42.800> treatment<00:04:43.640> basically<00:04:44.540> what

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
$2,000 per treatment basically what

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.320 
$2,000 per treatment basically what
these<00:04:45.080> lasers<00:04:45.560> do<00:04:45.830> is<00:04:46.100> they<00:04:46.370> damage<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:46.820> scar

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
these lasers do is they damage the scar

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.410 
these lasers do is they damage the scar
and<00:04:47.600> they<00:04:48.140> damage<00:04:48.590> that<00:04:49.070> whole<00:04:49.370> layer<00:04:49.760> of<00:04:49.790> skin

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
and they damage that whole layer of skin

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.570 
and they damage that whole layer of skin
and<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.900> really<00:04:51.290> stimulates<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.190> healing

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
and that really stimulates the healing

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.060 
and that really stimulates the healing
process<00:04:53.120> by<00:04:53.390> the<00:04:53.420> skin<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:54.320> help<00:04:54.500> heal<00:04:54.890> the

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
process by the skin to help heal the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.150 
process by the skin to help heal the
scar

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.490 

so<00:05:00.160> retinoid<00:05:00.700> products<00:05:01.180> that<00:05:01.390> are<00:05:01.510> sold<00:05:01.810> for

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
so retinoid products that are sold for

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.320 
so retinoid products that are sold for
retinoid<00:05:02.920> products<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.580> need<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:03.850> get<00:05:04.300> a

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
retinoid products you need to get a

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.200 
retinoid products you need to get a
prescription<00:05:04.710> from<00:05:05.710> your<00:05:05.800> doctor<00:05:05.950> to<00:05:06.850> get<00:05:07.090> it

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
prescription from your doctor to get it

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.750 
prescription from your doctor to get it
but<00:05:07.360> basically<00:05:07.510> what<00:05:08.080> they<00:05:08.200> do<00:05:08.260> is<00:05:08.760> they

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
but basically what they do is they

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.030 
but basically what they do is they
increase<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.510> cell<00:05:10.720> turnover<00:05:11.050> in<00:05:11.500> your<00:05:11.680> skin

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
increase the cell turnover in your skin

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.370 
increase the cell turnover in your skin
or<00:05:12.070> try<00:05:12.640> to<00:05:12.670> sloth<00:05:13.150> off<00:05:13.390> that<00:05:13.600> dead<00:05:13.810> skin<00:05:14.020> cell

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
or try to sloth off that dead skin cell

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.040 
or try to sloth off that dead skin cell
so<00:05:14.950> that<00:05:15.130> way<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.790> new<00:05:15.940> skin<00:05:16.270> forms<00:05:16.810> and

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
so that way the new skin forms and

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.170 
so that way the new skin forms and
hopefully<00:05:17.680> kind<00:05:17.920> of<00:05:18.010> covers<00:05:18.370> up<00:05:18.580> those<00:05:18.850> scars

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
hopefully kind of covers up those scars

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.440 
hopefully kind of covers up those scars
or<00:05:19.650> lessen<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:20.830> hyperpigmentation<00:05:21.460> caused

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
or lessen the hyperpigmentation caused

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:31.080 
or lessen the hyperpigmentation caused
with<00:05:22.750> it<00:05:28.530> so<00:05:29.530> your<00:05:29.680> best<00:05:29.920> bet<00:05:30.100> is<00:05:30.490> if<00:05:30.700> you<00:05:30.820> don't

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
with it so your best bet is if you don't

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.240 
with it so your best bet is if you don't
want<00:05:31.330> something<00:05:31.630> super<00:05:32.260> invasive<00:05:32.590> on<00:05:33.070> your

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
want something super invasive on your

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.190 
want something super invasive on your
skin<00:05:33.610> meaning<00:05:33.940> you<00:05:34.150> don't<00:05:34.390> want<00:05:34.630> to<00:05:34.780> burn<00:05:34.990> off

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
skin meaning you don't want to burn off

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.090 
skin meaning you don't want to burn off
the<00:05:35.800> whole<00:05:36.210> epidermis<00:05:37.210> of<00:05:37.420> your<00:05:37.600> skin<00:05:37.960> is<00:05:38.170> to

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
the whole epidermis of your skin is to

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.020 
the whole epidermis of your skin is to
use<00:05:39.340> this<00:05:39.760> roller<00:05:40.180> with<00:05:40.750> a<00:05:41.050> serum<00:05:41.910> that<00:05:42.910> will

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
use this roller with a serum that will

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.810 
use this roller with a serum that will
help<00:05:43.210> stimulate<00:05:43.570> those<00:05:44.530> walls<00:05:45.340> all

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
help stimulate those walls all

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.720 
help stimulate those walls all
underneath<00:05:46.600> your<00:05:46.960> skin<00:05:47.200> so<00:05:47.950> if<00:05:48.190> you<00:05:48.280> remember

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
underneath your skin so if you remember

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.880 
underneath your skin so if you remember
from<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.180> beginning<00:05:49.480> of<00:05:49.780> the<00:05:50.050> video<00:05:50.230> we<00:05:50.620> said

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
from the beginning of the video we said

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.390 
from the beginning of the video we said
that<00:05:51.160> acne<00:05:51.700> happens<00:05:52.150> and<00:05:52.480> when<00:05:53.320> acne<00:05:54.040> and<00:05:54.340> a

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
that acne happens and when acne and a

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.270 
that acne happens and when acne and a
pimple<00:05:54.820> happens<00:05:55.300> it<00:05:55.810> kind<00:05:56.110> of<00:05:56.230> breaks<00:05:56.920> the

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
pimple happens it kind of breaks the

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.520 
pimple happens it kind of breaks the
cellular<00:05:57.760> walls<00:05:58.030> of<00:05:58.360> your<00:05:58.420> skin<00:05:59.020> underneath

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
cellular walls of your skin underneath

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.550 
cellular walls of your skin underneath
and<00:06:00.160> because<00:06:00.880> of<00:06:00.910> that<00:06:01.210> break<00:06:01.570> we<00:06:02.200> need<00:06:02.350> to

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
and because of that break we need to

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.060 
and because of that break we need to
repair<00:06:03.160> it<00:06:03.310> and<00:06:03.460> so<00:06:03.640> how<00:06:03.850> we<00:06:03.880> repair<00:06:04.390> it<00:06:04.570> is<00:06:05.070> we

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
repair it and so how we repair it is we

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.370 
repair it and so how we repair it is we
roll<00:06:06.340> this<00:06:06.520> roller<00:06:06.790> along<00:06:07.300> our<00:06:07.510> skin<00:06:07.990> and<00:06:08.290> it

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
roll this roller along our skin and it

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:16.559 
roll this roller along our skin and it
goes<00:06:08.620> along<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.880> epidermis<00:06:10.690> of<00:06:10.930> our<00:06:11.350> skin

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:16.569 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.230 

so<00:06:17.569> when<00:06:17.750> you<00:06:17.870> roll<00:06:18.110> this<00:06:18.349> roller<00:06:18.889> the<00:06:19.639> fibers

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
so when you roll this roller the fibers

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.170 
so when you roll this roller the fibers
underneath<00:06:20.690> your<00:06:21.110> skin<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:22.580> elastin<00:06:23.060> and

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
underneath your skin the elastin and

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.170 
underneath your skin the elastin and
collagen<00:06:23.270> fibers<00:06:24.139> will<00:06:24.680> respond<00:06:25.250> to<00:06:25.550> that<00:06:25.699> and

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
collagen fibers will respond to that and

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.140 
collagen fibers will respond to that and
produce<00:06:26.900> even<00:06:27.410> more<00:06:27.590> this<00:06:28.310> is<00:06:28.370> why<00:06:28.729> the<00:06:28.789> roller

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
produce even more this is why the roller

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.120 
produce even more this is why the roller
is<00:06:29.330> so<00:06:29.539> good<00:06:29.780> for<00:06:29.810> acne<00:06:30.349> scarring<00:06:30.650> because

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
is so good for acne scarring because

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.339 
is so good for acne scarring because
usually<00:06:31.610> for<00:06:31.849> acne<00:06:32.120> scars<00:06:32.419> we<00:06:33.110> have

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
usually for acne scars we have

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:35.800 
usually for acne scars we have
indentation<00:06:33.800> Zhou<00:06:34.430> run<00:06:34.729> smooth<00:06:35.060> surface<00:06:35.569> in

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
indentation Zhou run smooth surface in

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.430 
indentation Zhou run smooth surface in
our<00:06:36.110> skin<00:06:36.620> also<00:06:37.389> the<00:06:38.389> roller<00:06:38.690> is<00:06:38.870> also<00:06:39.229> really

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
our skin also the roller is also really

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.930 
our skin also the roller is also really
good<00:06:39.710> for<00:06:39.979> those<00:06:40.130> with<00:06:40.340> fine<00:06:40.550> lines<00:06:40.789> and

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
good for those with fine lines and

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.150 
good for those with fine lines and
wrinkles<00:06:41.300> because<00:06:41.990> again<00:06:42.319> it<00:06:42.500> will<00:06:42.620> produce

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
wrinkles because again it will produce

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.860 
wrinkles because again it will produce
more<00:06:43.280> skin<00:06:43.729> underneath<00:06:44.120> and<00:06:44.360> push<00:06:44.599> it<00:06:44.750> out

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
more skin underneath and push it out

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.379 
more skin underneath and push it out
creating<00:06:45.259> plumper<00:06:45.650> skin<00:06:45.680> as<00:06:46.220> we<00:06:46.880> age<00:06:46.909> we

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
creating plumper skin as we age we

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.870 
creating plumper skin as we age we
produce<00:06:47.630> less<00:06:47.990> collagen<00:06:48.319> elastin<00:06:49.039> fibers<00:06:49.099> so

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
produce less collagen elastin fibers so

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.240 
produce less collagen elastin fibers so
we<00:06:50.449> want<00:06:50.930> to<00:06:50.990> do<00:06:51.139> what<00:06:51.259> we<00:06:51.380> can<00:06:51.650> to<00:06:52.009> keep

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
we want to do what we can to keep

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.930 
we want to do what we can to keep
producing<00:06:52.940> those<00:06:53.509> fibers<00:06:54.110> at<00:06:54.289> the<00:06:54.319> same<00:06:54.620> rate

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
producing those fibers at the same rate
