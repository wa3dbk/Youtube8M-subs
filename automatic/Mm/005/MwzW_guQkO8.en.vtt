00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.990 
and today I'm going to explain a little
bit<00:00:04.049> about<00:00:04.290> something<00:00:04.740> that<00:00:04.859> we're<00:00:05.100> doing<00:00:05.339> in

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
bit about something that we're doing in

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.360 
bit about something that we're doing in
almost<00:00:06.629> every<00:00:06.930> single<00:00:07.109> kitchen<00:00:07.529> we<00:00:07.649> put<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:07.980> in

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
almost every single kitchen we put in in

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.860 
almost every single kitchen we put in in
today's<00:00:08.910> kitchen<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.769> LED<00:00:11.370> lighting

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
today's kitchen and that is LED lighting

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.299 
today's kitchen and that is LED lighting
for<00:00:12.870> years<00:00:13.170> we've<00:00:13.349> been<00:00:13.440> able<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.710> use<00:00:13.950> under

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
for years we've been able to use under

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.740 
for years we've been able to use under
cabinet<00:00:14.880> lighting<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.480> have<00:00:15.599> been

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
cabinet lighting that have been

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.859 
cabinet lighting that have been
fluorescents<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:17.190> also<00:00:17.340> get<00:00:17.670> very<00:00:17.880> hot<00:00:18.210> or

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
fluorescents that also get very hot or

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.080 
fluorescents that also get very hot or
halogen<00:00:19.439> lights<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.100> get<00:00:20.310> very<00:00:20.340> hot<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
halogen lights that get very hot and

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.300 
halogen lights that get very hot and
they<00:00:21.869> use<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> lot<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.410> energy<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.980> they<00:00:23.070> don't

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
they use a lot of energy and they don't

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.390 
they use a lot of energy and they don't
do<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.000> very<00:00:24.090> good<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.869> efficient<00:00:25.350> job<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.949> so

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
do a very good and efficient job and so

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.689 
do a very good and efficient job and so
in<00:00:26.789> today's<00:00:27.029> kitchens<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.529> using<00:00:28.859> LED

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
in today's kitchens we are using LED

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.420 
in today's kitchens we are using LED
lights<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> thin<00:00:31.470> strip<00:00:31.949> that

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
lights and this is the thin strip that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.760 
lights and this is the thin strip that
has<00:00:32.610> these<00:00:32.790> little<00:00:33.000> light<00:00:33.840> emitting<00:00:34.320> diodes

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
has these little light emitting diodes

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.889 
has these little light emitting diodes
on<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.090> do<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.450> this

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
on it and this is all we do is we this

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.310 
on it and this is all we do is we this
thin<00:00:37.290> little<00:00:37.440> strip<00:00:37.860> gets<00:00:38.160> peeled<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.320> stuck

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
thin little strip gets peeled and stuck

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.500 
thin little strip gets peeled and stuck
onto<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.829> bottom<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> cabinet<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.480> that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
onto the bottom of the cabinet so that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.720 
onto the bottom of the cabinet so that
it's<00:00:42.840> very<00:00:43.170> thin<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.800> cannot<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.550> unless

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
it's very thin you cannot see it unless

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.670 
it's very thin you cannot see it unless
you<00:00:44.969> look<00:00:45.239> underneath<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.469> course

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
you look underneath and then of course

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.700 
you look underneath and then of course
you'll<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.450> it's<00:00:48.450> ran<00:00:48.750> off<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> simple

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
you'll see it and it's ran off a simple

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.000 
you'll see it and it's ran off a simple
12<00:00:50.070> volt<00:00:50.750> transformer<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.739> transformer

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
12 volt transformer the transformer

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.790 
12 volt transformer the transformer
plugs<00:00:53.550> into<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.910> 110<00:00:54.449> plug<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:55.649> in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
plugs into a 110 plug as you see here in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.860 
plugs into a 110 plug as you see here in
the<00:00:55.860> wall<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> transformer<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the wall and this is a transformer that

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.540 
the wall and this is a transformer that
gets<00:00:58.079> mounted<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> kitten<00:00:59.129> up<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
gets mounted up in the kitten up in the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.220 
gets mounted up in the kitten up in the
top<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.879> your<00:01:00.000> cabinet<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.629> don't<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:01.109> it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
top of your cabinet so you don't see it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.110 
top of your cabinet so you don't see it
and<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.829> running<00:01:02.129> with<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.309> little<00:01:02.579> tiny<00:01:02.789> wire

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and it's running with a little tiny wire

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.090 
and it's running with a little tiny wire
that<00:01:03.539> goes<00:01:03.600> down<00:01:03.989> between<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.530> cabinets<00:01:04.920> so

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that goes down between the cabinets so

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.980 
that goes down between the cabinets so
again<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.700> don't<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.119> those<00:01:06.299> wires<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
again you don't see those wires and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.550 
again you don't see those wires and
that's<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:07.830> turns<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.610> LED<00:01:08.760> lights<00:01:09.560> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
that's what turns on the LED lights and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.250 
that's what turns on the LED lights and
makes<00:01:10.890> them<00:01:11.130> come<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.180> off<00:01:12.299> there's<00:01:13.080> also

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
makes them come on and off there's also

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.710 
makes them come on and off there's also
a<00:01:13.409> little<00:01:13.680> switch<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.090> either<00:01:15.330> add

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
a little switch that we can either add

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
a little switch that we can either add
here<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.470> we're<00:01:16.770> doing<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.659> remodel<00:01:18.659> where<00:01:19.560> we

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.929 
here if we're doing a remodel where we
don't<00:01:19.860> want<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.310> an<00:01:20.400> electrician<00:01:20.759> come
