00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.329
 welcome etarras my name is 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.860
 fernando and let's see how to play the 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.989
 main rail of communication 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.250
 breakdown of led zeppelin in this case 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.890
 we are not going to focus only on the three 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.360
 main a new section and we're going to 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.310
 do the main riffs of the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.470
 songs 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.150
 If you have more interest or 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.760
 they want to know how the song is played 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.830
 whole can like the video or 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.990
 comment based on the amount of 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.910
 visits and I like them from the video 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.070
 for good to know that people 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.560
 interested or want to learn that song and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.240
 let's do the whole version but for 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.740
 now only the rif follows a 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.560
 Remember that you can go through the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.760
 double-double page of orb you 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.400
 terra.com.ar can follow us on 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.420
 facebook twitter or google plus 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.980
 You can also subscribe to our 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.920
 channel on youtube that helped us a lot 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.970
 to continue like this new videos so 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.560
 good let's start with the risk 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.170
 good the demonstration that a couple of 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.750
 more notes but good but still 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.000
 so it will not be so true to the version 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.970
 original but I think it is understood 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.740
 let's go to the sixth string as several 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.590
 sometimes we do for the meeting I know that 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.380
 we are family the sixth string so that 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:52.170
 do not sound so much what we're going to do is 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.330
 play on the seventh of the fifth forgiveness of 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.670
 the fifth string that put as in the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.850
 seventh of the 4th 7th of the back and the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.230
 first and the second we play in the 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.080
 fifth fret as it is only once 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.990
 with attitude a good accent of what 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.180
 we are is to go to the fifth fifth of the 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.320
 sixth seventh of the fifth seventh of the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.430
 fourth sixth of the third and the first 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.750
 second we continue on the fifth fret and 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.750
 we return to the same note as before 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.910
 we'll see 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.939
 and basically the rif is repeated several 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.939
 times 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.790
 is what we're going to do I added it 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.140
 it's part of the gray but good because 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.170
 what can we do is a typical movement 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.670
 of light 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.710
 let's for example in this case we're going to 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.980
 give the fifth fret of the sixth string 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.480
 and the seventh and we're going to play twice 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.790
 and then the third time we played 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.819
 we play in the ninth of here of the fifth 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.360
 fret if it's a typical movement of 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.360
 rock plus 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.740
 as twice once explaining the 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.890
 nineth 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.010
 and we play once more and we go back to 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.010
 start 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.590
 after we repeat several times 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.530
 that part what we do is touch on the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.920
 fifth fret of the sixth string we play 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.410
 on the seventh of the fifth string 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.569
 we play in the fifth on the fifth string 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.980
 in the fifth fret forgiveness in the fourth 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.030
 rope 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.250
 sixth of the back five and five in the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.849
 first and the second we leave it the same 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.849
 we play once 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.250
 we repeat the same movement 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.250
 three more times 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.420
 but we can make the same movement 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.060
 we are doing but we do 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.319
 from the seventh fret playing on the 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.450
 eleven of the fifth string 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.239
 and on the same note 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.900
 we do it we start with the section the 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.900
 seventh fret 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.920
 and we start again with the same rhythm
