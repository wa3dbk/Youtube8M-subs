00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.629
 this time we are in wildlife crime fighters 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.580
 are there still big criminals or 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.160
 criminal organizations that are so corrupt 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.349
 are so rich and so powerful 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.820
 they always spring the dance 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.289
 wild animals are becoming it more often 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.410
 victim of terrible and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.640
 pointless crime wildlife crime 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.710
 and because they do not oppose themselves 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 Poachers can defend going people 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.680
 compete globally for this 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.320
 stop 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.970
 also in the netherlands i am freek spark and 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.970
 this is wildlife crime fighters 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.140
 these rhinos are filmed in their 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.840
 natural environment in South Africa but 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.100
 unfortunately lives far from safe in it 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.750
 people believe in vietnam 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.700
 medicinal effect of the horn of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.219
 the rhino and its possession 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.110
 so a status symbol due to increasing 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.800
 question is the number of poached 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.340
 African rhinos in a short time with 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.690
 9,000 percent up 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.219
 as a conservationist of the world 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.820
 nature fund is christiaan van der 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.250
 hooves 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.960
 regularly present in problem areas 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.909
 he brings organizations together 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.619
 joining forces together for it 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.880
 conservation of rhino and others 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.229
 endangered animals 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.299
 actually most important with the approach 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.560
 of wildlife crime the limitation in the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.490
 approach to demand 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.380
 this is an example of one 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.970
 behavioral change campaign that wants to leave 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.110
 and shaves have in vietnam with one 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.700
 famous vietnamese singer 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.860
 there is a rumor of one 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.299
 politician who claim that the cure 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.310
 was from cancer through the use of 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.509
 rhino horn by this dish 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.430
 Man thought this product works 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.840
 actually and they started buying it 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.759
 because they are buying, the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.290
 price went up and it is one 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.070
 product has become more attractive for the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.240
 one left 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.399
 to show that they are rich 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.540
 for wildlife crime to be effective 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.490
 we have to fight a lot 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.020
 collaborate and especially with governments 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.820
 other conservationists their 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.780
 civil society organizations and with it 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.890
 business 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.869
 for example, we have concluded a covenant 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.880
 with the largest internet trade in china 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.500
 Ali Baba and we agreed 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.570
 will not allow the illegal 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.140
 wildlife trade takes place on their own 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.140
 website 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.840
 the global poaching crisis and 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.000
 illegal trade requires a new one 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.500
 course in nature conservation and therefore 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.630
 there are now advanced plans 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.119
 for setting up the wildlife 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.610
 justice commission an independent 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.019
 commission against wildlife crime that occurred 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.790
 will settle in the hague 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.010
 so we work anti-poaching we work 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.540
 try to smuggle home 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.160
 reduce demand but there are still 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.069
 always big criminals or criminal 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.140
 organizations that are so corrupt and all that 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.340
 are rich and so powerful that they are always the 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.140
 dance spring 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.860
 we have an initiative for that 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.840
 started and that is called your address committee 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.730
 that just the one that gives extra bite 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.400
 to try those elusive criminals 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.080
 to really tackle that to really that 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.720
 to break the chain 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.209
 wall of crime is now top 4 of van 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.130
 illegal acts in addition to the 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.480
 drug trafficking arms trade so you must too 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.450
 take it one step higher in the fight 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.739
 of it and that includes it 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.989
 we are always looking for new ones 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.220
 solutions to tackle wildlife crime 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.260
 Grab an example where I recently 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.030
 right time for was the france location 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.530
 of the black rhino in south africa 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.510
 it will be just like that we are only 5,000 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.680
 from and to take care of it 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.319
 we try to protect populations 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.090
 to split up and new populations 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.380
 close so that they grow faster and 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.510
 be better protected 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.359
 And here you can see the commitment that we make 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.160
 really works and it shows hope and 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.109
 you that can sort of ruin 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.250
 save as long as you really bet 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.430
 and collaborates with everyone else 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.430
 concerned 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.610
 the rhino has been running for 65 million years 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.310
 around the earth 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.069
 but of the 165 species from the primeval times 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.450
 now only five are left 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.390
 to prevent even more species 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.129
 disappearance must be fought 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.450
 by christians and by all others 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.450
 wildlife crime fighters 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.450
 view the other stories and become now 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.450
 crime fighter
