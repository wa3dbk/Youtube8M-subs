00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.370
 hey boys your and denniscee second 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.230
 eske and today a new place 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.290
 two bowls of terry and today is it 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.809
 view rings aka studio and i am with 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.740
 rpg with science ' external macs and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.910
 quick draw 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.800
 that in itself not so interesting I had 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.810
 just need a short game play and it 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.189
 a fairly short gameplay is also pretty far away 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.140
 person i am afraid this video 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.180
 even shortage is because probably had 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.560
 you already read in the title where this 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.230
 video is about the playstation 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.030
 4 and a lot more is known 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.829
 got over the place i 4 especially the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.030
 release date and for that you will 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.280
 is likely to come to this beer 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.480
 wait a minute I'll come on soon 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.879
 not all as you may know 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.980
 there was event yesterday and game 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.260
 come to games and that is in Germany the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.030
 Europe's largest city and it during 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.950
 the event is a solid release date of 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.210
 the playstation 4 announced and me 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.530
 can all turn something around it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.010
 don't do it right there we say this 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.250
 lease is the release is November 29 in 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.289
 Europe and November 15 in America and 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.449
 as you can see america is again 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.640
 pre-emptied america 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.799
 places near two weeks earlier and the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.420
 personally that I had huge bales 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.799
 hoped for a world where the release 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.799
 he thinks that is not the case then 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.570
 I'm really sorry because yes they will 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.490
 very many things than two weeks from 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.020
 see it on the internet in advance and that is 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.450
 a shame because yes I want something like that 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.100
 actually from poland myself but i can 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.170
 it probably doesn't resist like me 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.759
 all of youtube suffice with these four om 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.150
 anyway to click so I think so 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.270
 Unfortunately 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.400
 but yes a level is a donor 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.740
 that trains come out for the holidays 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.000
 also for or not won before the end 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.409
 this year around the like you 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.799
 maybe know the xbox one 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.939
 Resistance to 2014 and I was afraid that she 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.470
 there at the place or maybe that too 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.840
 they would do that, so luckily they do 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.970
 not and have you done smart because if they do 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.720
 had done that they would quite 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.420
 a lot of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.840
 yes revenue wrong because before the end 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.729
 of the year 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.409
 of course I still have all those holidays and 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.509
 then you just do a lot in sweden 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.500
 between huge tactical to another to 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.759
 to lose 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.680
 level for the rest they also said 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.170
 that the playstation vita mprise line 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.000
 get something is 200 euros and the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.030
 playstation 3 the 12i building model 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.679
 the 12th model must say that is too 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.690
 john terry they are alone 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.500
 is so I've seen that at media market 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.030
 he even 100 no 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.380
 Acting is so you want to buy him 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.960
 Buying at the media market is still you 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.970
 cheaper and yes I don't know much 12 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.040
 gigabyte is really useful is huge 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.450
 little but you were only allowed to calvi 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.340
 to play or if so then it is enough 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.930
 Mark you want to go well, for example 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.880
 Then you think you are playing alone 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.590
 calling fit installs that 12 year 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.570
 by Paul is full to the game that is really 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.340
 huge so I don't understand anyway 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.980
 why have its 12 gigabyte version 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.750
 but ok he is the man I am going 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.459
 just quickly watch this video for the 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.840
 video is very short so I do my best 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.550
 to put all the shoe in this video 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.739
 Cram so sorry if it's a little too fast 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.970
 then you polish the video and the three 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.040
 see if they are fascinating 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.720
 but otherwise there is a little funnel places 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.209
 buy here you get two free 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.640
 weeks playstation plus when that is free 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.350
 logical because yes that I am close to the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.600
 xbox it too so then you have to get me 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.680
 a week or a month you look like that 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.730
 xbox live 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.080
 that is of course already neat and tidy 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.970
 also logical for the people who have to 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.970
 know what it is before it 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.040
 are going to buy so yes very well 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.170
 buoys and traveled far and you say if you 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.000
 now an annual subscription for places bus 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.220
 buy then you get on the annual subscription 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.769
 or 19 days extra so you get a year 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.330
 plus kinetic days and we summer school 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.040
 think why place so quickly is the plus 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.500
 come before the PlayStation 4 from 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.910
 but it is so read plus works for 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.940
 the playstation vita 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.040
 so the playstation 3 and the playstation 4 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.660
 yes you have everything to the boil 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.880
 you would like to get in part anyway 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.470
 a big games the gimp that this month 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.239
 that even get assassin's 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.010
 creed 3 so it's not the worst 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.459
 especially the bad games that cream 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.010
 gets 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.680
 they are always games that have a rating of 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.209
 the 80 out of 100 or higher have this is 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.130
 always something nice to know 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.130
 so it's always good titles that you 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.890
 but I immediately go through how much 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.720
 her tone subject and that's her 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.640
 have done new option and that's that 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.600
 you can always listen to music 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.640
 in a game 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.590
 and that works as follows you have become you 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.630
 playstation 4 pulleys and there is one 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.310
 just buttons the places button if you like 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.400
 and you usually get a screen 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.239
 Switch controller Hoeksma 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.620
 controller close vibration function a night 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.150
 And then there will also be an extra thing 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.620
 and that will help him and music too 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.039
 and just take a course to 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.200
 select music you can just next 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.760
 previous play I don't know anything about it 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.500
 and that is possible 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.620
 and from that minute you so you don't have to 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.690
 all back because yes xmb she did 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.490
 first xmb about throwing at something else 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.810
 yes so it may just speed 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.000
 hands i don't know you much music 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.320
 listen if you have a game design 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.550
 personally I actually never prefer 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.170
 not if i play online maybe if i do 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.300
 washing up seemed like a playful fun 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.180
 then it can do but actually online 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.220
 never for the rest did they say that 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.390
 The option is to stream live 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.890
 via twitch and that is a nice load 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.900
 because will first say it is a nice too 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.490
 are ustream again and I know you are ustream 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.020
 but ustream is actually one 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.240
 bit of a twist or rip 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.370
 and twitch is simply many times better 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.540
 sure i will try but i will 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.730
 always and try it anyway 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.470
 livestreamen through my 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.620
 PVR or perhaps even a future milk 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.330
 but then I often have a Catholic 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.130
 to new tram marrum 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.990
 yes that we kinda big things that 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.880
 I just talk about those games because maybe 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.920
 you didn't hear it but the coming 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.810
 loads of free titles to the places 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.340
 here and I'll just always something 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.050
 to mention it may not be the 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.360
 best titles but you have to check 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.150
 he they are free and that is something 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.850
 which was very neat so December was in it 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.400
 the we have planetside 2 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.190
 then under the name 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.510
 dc universe online then we have 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.430
 blacklight routeyou 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:49.290
 reed for fusion really cunt names 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.990
 afterwards start the outlast secret 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.330
 ponchos the playroom 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.150
 drive club what really so my whole fat 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.080
 game and then have littlebigplanet 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.970
 hub 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.710
 and I do n't know if my the place 4 is coming 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.630
 who comes so there are three my find it 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.400
 Weird for just the place and it 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.720
 bring three for free then think he 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.210
 also a square so that we are there 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.030
 wait and by the way not funny either 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.950
 minecraft comes to the places 4 to the 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.140
 place and three and so on to the vita 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.970
 something funny to know 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.800
 I don't know if it's just that exactly 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.900
 cell version if it is on the xbox 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.190
 then I think it is not really whole 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.260
 ideally I do not think anyway 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.880
 minecraft a gaming score on the console 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.470
 they play but it might be 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.970
 funny for you to know what's quite 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.470
 many people simply minecraft in order 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.740
 find fat so the thinks will meet 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.510
 and lastly we will china 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.430
 see on screen and that is 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.710
 the new places here only the trolls 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.110
 then come up with a nice color say 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.760
 new place that four control site and 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.650
 the target group 4 so 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.450
 and they come in blue and in red 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.610
 and I would say late in the comments 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.980
 find out if you are interested
