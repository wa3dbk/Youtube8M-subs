pink pulp or if I wanted to use summer
flowers<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.940> decided<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.600> didn't<00:00:30.900> want<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
flowers and I decided I didn't want to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.139 
flowers and I decided I didn't want to
incorporate<00:00:31.500> any<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.340> orange<00:00:32.789> so<00:00:33.030> I'm

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
incorporate any of that orange so I'm

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.689 
incorporate any of that orange so I'm
going<00:00:33.539> with<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.440> pink<00:00:34.710> pulp<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.160> think<00:00:35.399> that'll

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
going with the pink pulp I think that'll

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.630 
going with the pink pulp I think that'll
look<00:00:35.820> pretty<00:00:36.110> when<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.140> drop<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:37.800> into<00:00:38.460> my

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
along the edge I know that that will

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.519 
along the edge I know that that will
give<00:02:01.979> me<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> nice<00:02:02.539> look<00:02:03.539> when<00:02:03.749> I'm<00:02:03.929> finished

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
and what will happen is because I I

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.800 
and what will happen is because I I
passed<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.859> tension<00:02:08.369> when<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.149> put<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.599> into

passed the tension when I put it into

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.589 
passed the tension when I put it into
the<00:02:10.140> bobbin<00:02:10.349> it's<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.489> going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.730> loop<00:02:12.120> then

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599

on the top and I'll show you that in

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.050 
on the top and I'll show you that in
just<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.680> minute

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
up to the back side here's our little

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.780 
up to the back side here's our little
quilt<00:03:27.940> all<00:03:29.459> stitched<00:03:30.569> with<00:03:31.569> that<00:03:31.810> pretty

quilt all stitched with that pretty
bobbin<00:03:33.790> work<00:03:35.280> binding<00:03:36.280> on<00:03:36.489> there<00:03:36.819> let's<00:03:37.180> see

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
bobbin work binding on there let's see

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.379 
bobbin work binding on there let's see
if<00:03:37.449> we<00:03:37.599> can<00:03:37.780> get<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:37.959> little<00:03:38.109> close-up<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:39.010> some

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
if we can get a little close-up of some

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.129 
if we can get a little close-up of some
of<00:03:40.389> that<00:03:40.680> binding<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:43.239> can<00:03:43.389> see<00:03:43.659> how<00:03:43.900> pretty

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
of that binding you can see how pretty

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.379 
of that binding you can see how pretty
it<00:03:44.440> just<00:03:44.709> kind<00:03:44.949> of<00:03:45.069> loops<00:03:45.340> on<00:03:45.639> the<00:03:45.819> surface

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
it just kind of loops on the surface

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.839 
it just kind of loops on the surface
there<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:47.440> just<00:03:47.470> kind<00:03:47.889> of<00:03:47.979> sits<00:03:48.250> there<00:03:48.400> and

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
there it just kind of sits there and

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.969 
there it just kind of sits there and
it's<00:03:49.030> nice<00:03:49.299> to<00:03:49.629> have<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.229> same<00:03:51.099> color<00:03:52.979> thread

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:53.979 
it's nice to have the same color thread

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.069 
it's nice to have the same color thread
so<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.639> you<00:03:54.790> don't<00:03:55.030> even<00:03:55.180> see<00:03:55.629> it<00:03:55.659> when

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
so that you don't even see it when

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.909 
so that you don't even see it when
you're<00:03:56.669> up<00:03:57.669> close<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.389> hope<00:03:59.139> that<00:03:59.409> you<00:03:59.560> will<00:03:59.709> try

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919

doing<00:04:00.430> some<00:04:00.699> bobbin<00:04:01.090> work<00:04:01.329> it's<00:04:02.049> a<00:04:02.290> good<00:04:02.650> way

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
doing some bobbin work it's a good way

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.599 
doing some bobbin work it's a good way
to<00:04:02.889> use<00:04:03.280> really<00:04:03.579> heavy<00:04:04.000> threads<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:05.609> those

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
to use really heavy threads and those

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.490 
to use really heavy threads and those
that<00:04:06.939> won't<00:04:07.180> fit<00:04:07.510> through<00:04:07.540> your<00:04:07.989> needle<00:04:08.199> and

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
that won't fit through your needle and

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.740 
that won't fit through your needle and
it<00:04:09.220> gives<00:04:09.400> really<00:04:09.639> pretty<00:04:10.030> effects<00:04:10.419> you<00:04:10.569> can

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
it gives really pretty effects you can

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.869 
it gives really pretty effects you can
do<00:04:10.900> all<00:04:11.139> kinds<00:04:11.739> of<00:04:11.799> different<00:04:11.979> threads<00:04:12.489> in<00:04:12.699> the

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
do all kinds of different threads in the

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:21.960 
do all kinds of different threads in the
bobbin

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.030 

you
