00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.889
 Good people, now you have to learn how to do it. 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.109
 This is everything today is the last day of our 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.310
 week from dna to sao paulo 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.619
 so I'll show you how 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.140
 make the lips of life glitter is not 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.090
 pretty novice who works in gradient 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.550
 It's super easy to go together not only 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.160
 mouth pencil can be done with button and 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 even with shadow if you do not have more 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.030
 more indicated along with the pencils of mouth 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.649
 that point easier to work than 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.280
 It's good to learn, just keep on 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.320
 watch 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.300
 well then I'll start using three 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.040
 pencil you can use the three that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.649
 You wanted me to choose these three things. 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.160
 here is the pink bochum and an almost pink 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.140
 very clear they are purple the magenta is 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.090
 a body is at present purple the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.460
 Only magenta that he is very purple is a 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.670
 rose ax has the magenta process that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.770
 this one and has 15 this here three 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.449
 jackson can use the machine 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.250
 you are at home do not feed 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.600
 hope otherwise we will make the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.369
 darker for the lighter does not strip 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.369
 So we're going to make it darker. 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.229
 here on the edges where it's going to be dark and I 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.600
 This one's clear inside the sides. 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.460
 I'll play a little more basic 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.409
 corrective and I'm using it just for 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.439
 to create a base leaves the mouth very dry 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.880
 start with more merck gasket and I'll go 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.060
 go around my lips all over the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.060
 extension 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.710
 all this is already good let's get the pink the 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.780
 process is slow and now I go 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.530
 to spend there on top of that 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.530
 example 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.040
 the last one is the fire and believe 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.590
 such a great secret of these labs in 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.409
 gradient and you do not make it very evident 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.210
 which is so contoured but not end 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.880
 need so subtle because after all it is 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.000
 Mardi Gras I'm going to get this lapel 804 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.880
 Cabaret Daniks I'll give a light if not 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.209
 told nothing in the right line to stay 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.209
 more defined 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.480
 and then I'll come with a cotton swab cleaning 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.690
 here and now I'll pass a concealer 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.580
 the lightest pencil around everything that is 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.280
 to light the mouth even more 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.290
 being to her I'll use the cause pencil 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.040
 feminist to cover the same Joseph who 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.040
 low eyebrow 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:47.170
 done that you see containing with blender 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.940
 it is also called samin the question of smoking 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.940
 and I'll do the same thing over 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.520
 and then when the grader is ready 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.010
 and it 's all lit up I'm going to use it 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.860
 transparent gloss it does not go coo 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.540
 live from I'm going to flip it over with my finger 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.330
 because otherwise I'm going to dirty my brush and 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:12.460
 I'll never have it again then. 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:17.830
 A little bit on your finger and coming back 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:19.840
 always a little baffle and that's cool like that 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.970
 this blog is that it gives a very 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.320
 and looks much more natural than 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.570
 great and go people this was our 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.220
 Carnival week I hope you 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.470
 have liked the idea I showed here 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.720
 You do not have to use them all together. 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.630
 Just like I did here in the square does not allocate 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.510
 which in rome only each time what you 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.880
 I would rather use lip than eyebrow at 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.420
 eyebrow that is already forming type I 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.550
 green and blue and 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.190
 pink there was super cool here 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.830
 continuing mine that will not leave you 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.850
 you can let go of your creativity and 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.470
 your little way 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.240
 so this is it folks, everybody wants 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.160

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.870
