00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
there's a record audio here so if I go

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.990 
there's a record audio here so if I go
ahead<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.890> start<00:02:06.160> that<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:06.850> starts<00:02:07.210> recording

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
ahead and start that it starts recording
