 this 3 is being high very high I would say 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.070

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.680
 realistic and attentive because he assured 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.800

 I hope more the 7 that is the truth is 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.190
 that ubisoft knows that division is one 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.750
 of their strengths and as they have 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.020

 what ubisoft creates in the saga 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.000
 assassin's creed and is without any doubt 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.990
