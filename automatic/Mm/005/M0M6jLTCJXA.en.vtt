00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
that at the early on in a game until

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.520 
that at the early on in a game until
people<00:03:46.530> start<00:03:46.919> finding<00:03:47.189> sods<00:03:47.519> but<00:03:48.479> you<00:03:49.379> know

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
people start finding sods but you know

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.009 
people start finding sods but you know
once<00:03:49.739> you<00:03:49.859> get<00:03:49.979> that<00:03:50.069> end<00:03:50.220> chun<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:51.780> pretty

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
once you get that end chun you pretty
