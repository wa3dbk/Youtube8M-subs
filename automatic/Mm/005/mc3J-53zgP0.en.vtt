that Merkel floated in the run-up to the

election and this is also in the
coalition<00:03:16.160> agreement<00:03:16.640> now<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.269> idea<00:03:17.569> of

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
coalition agreement now is this idea of

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.319 
coalition agreement now is this idea of
reform<00:03:18.200> contracts<00:03:18.739> whereby<00:03:19.610> struggling

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329

eurozone<00:03:20.720> countries<00:03:21.260> will<00:03:21.739> get<00:03:21.980> aid<00:03:22.269> but<00:03:23.269> only

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
eurozone countries will get aid but only

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.199 
eurozone countries will get aid but only
if<00:03:24.049> they<00:03:24.230> agree<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.700> legally<00:03:25.700> enforceable

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
if they agree to legally enforceable

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.720 
if they agree to legally enforceable
structural<00:03:27.200> reforms<00:03:27.799> so<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.579> is

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
structural reforms so this is

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.339 
structural reforms so this is
politically<00:03:29.269> viable<00:03:29.510> for<00:03:29.840> Germany<00:03:30.140> because

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
politically viable for Germany because

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.500 
politically viable for Germany because
it<00:03:30.440> involves<00:03:30.769> less<00:03:31.010> cash<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.819> more<00:03:32.090> control

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
it involves less cash and more control

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.690 
it involves less cash and more control
so<00:03:32.540> Jeremy<00:03:33.170> will<00:03:33.379> want<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.829> make<00:03:34.340> sure<00:03:34.549> that
