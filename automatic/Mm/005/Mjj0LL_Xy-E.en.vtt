00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
all right AC is right down here and you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.590 
all right AC is right down here and you
see<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.430> tensioner<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.940> goes<00:00:42.059> around<00:00:42.360> there

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
see the tensioner it goes around there

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.790 
see the tensioner it goes around there
and<00:00:42.780> then<00:00:42.899> back<00:00:43.079> up<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> tensioner<00:00:43.710> all

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
and then back up to the tensioner all

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.729 
and then back up to the tensioner all
that's<00:00:44.010> out<00:00:44.690> we<00:00:45.690> want<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.140> go<00:00:46.289> from<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that's out we want it to go from the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.799 
that's out we want it to go from the
tensioner<00:00:47.250> right<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.390> pulley<00:00:48.600> right

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
tensioner right to this pulley right

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.720 
tensioner right to this pulley right
here<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.590> straight<00:00:49.980> from<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.160> pulley<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
here so straight from that pulley to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.369 
here so straight from that pulley to
detention<00:00:51.000> room<00:00:51.210> back<00:00:51.449> there<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.260> you're
