00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.750
 Hello dear friends today 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:19.439
 there was a question about what kind of general 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.490
 now there are real people chances to them 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.490

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:30.369
 the question is pretty not easy what am i 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.650
 I can say in my opinion there is 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.730
 the eternal moment why what 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.950
 federal project you really 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.780
 tighten the screws and 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:45.750
 really tightening my migration 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:48.160
 politics there are two options really 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.580
 immigrate but this is again my 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.760
 sight 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.910
 option one is through the program 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.809

 this is through the students that is people 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.750
 Canada invites young people 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:16.299
 students so that they have turned 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:19.090
