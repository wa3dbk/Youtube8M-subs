00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 so hello it's him everyone 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.540
 cdx m today to offer you this 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.880
 unboxing of the ps vita of the capture kit 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.269
 from ps vita that I just received 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.190
 I bought them on 3ds video capture 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.750
 points like finally the manufacturer these 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.510
 four sous kitty so we go men 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.760
 boxer it's a verb that together and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.039
 see what this new ps looks like 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.570
 vita it's gone so basic I get 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.710
 the package in this box but as 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.150
 you can imagine she is fast 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.230
 because I took care to go out 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.760
 already the other box in which is the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.370
 ps vita but we get it in there 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.290
 it's always interesting to note this 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.270
 we are interested in this little baby 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.079
 who was inside then the box 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.730
 is not very big 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.899
 barely bigger than your hand 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.340
 finally look if I pose 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.440
 now like that next you have a 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.270
 small a small element of comparison I 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.730
 also want to emphasize that the doc man 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.350
 singh it's not blind I already know to 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.309
 what is the ps vita frozen test a 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.079
 little bit but I thought it was 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.250
 better to test it in advance for you 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.920
 to say if it worked well 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.680
 so in there there is the ps vita of 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.460
 paperwork and cables but for you 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.210
 show what the interior looks like 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.250
 I left the box first 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.750
 in absolutely perfect condition it was in 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.610
 bubble wrap and as you can the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.490
 find out I ordered the ps vita at 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.060
 unique color of japan black color and 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.130
 pink 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.890
 the united states and europe are not entitled 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.810
 only in the white and black colors of the ps 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.890
 vita 2000 then ps vita 2000 she has 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.750
 some peculiarities 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.009
 I will not come back so much in this 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.630
 video is the goal but frozen 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.659
 would mention it's gone we're going to open 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.890
 this one this box already you're going 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.280
 see that it's pretty well done and 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.049
 interesting up to give rise to those 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.450
 Here is a nice box 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.979
 compact filled with paperwork the ps vita 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.270
 is not inside and reads them to 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.770
 side there on my left 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.600
 so what is beautiful in 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.259
 this box we will start with 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.060
 of three things 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.770
 these up it's about the adapter that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.200
 you will receive to load it 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.790
 obviously you may know it ps 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.560
 vita 2000 dropped the chargers 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.920
 in proprietary format sony so we 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.990
 can load his ps vita usb usb 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.479
 re micro usb so that's great 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.250
 their share in case he gives you that but 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.390
 there is another cable that we receive and I 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.190
 believe she has there is a problem for 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.930
 I who live in Europe it is inevitably 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.330
 these electrical outlets that are 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.310
 Japanese and American it seems to me 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.680
 it's worrying why are not you doing 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.780
 camera focus of my butt that 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.220
 it's a problem it's not a big problem 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.900
 problem because we can load via usb 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.220
 but still know that I am there 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.260
 did not expect it's absolutely not the 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.819
 fault of the builders far from there 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.290
 gets a lot of little paperwork 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.480
 inside I do not have much of what 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.069
 serves then if I push all this we have a 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.170
 which seem to me to be points 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.670
 cumulative to scratch there is a code 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.030
 I imagine I will certainly use it 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.350
 not here we have square smileys on 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.850
 sides it must be for reality 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.920
 augmented to bring up some 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.780
 thing with the camera of the ps vita for 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.760
 to train I do not know anything 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.290
 recovers classic textbooks 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.640
 I imagine it's new but you 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.040
 see the quantity of small papers 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.069
 we have this thing I do not know what 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.019
 is that airplay ps vita look this is 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.660
 not finished there is still paperwork there 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.730
 there are still and always and for 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.940
 eternity and on the part of the builder 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.070
 we receive this little paper in which he 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.959
 is registered 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.780
 I'm going to unfold this if you 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.060
 in which is written a whole 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.540
 lots of information about the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.579
 nobody 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.560
 about the product you see it i've 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.750
 bought at nice is too much catch so 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.760
 that's another name their site they 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.870
 are called 3ds video capture hate 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.220
 make known under the name of three 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.420
 kitty and now it's nice is too 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.010
 capture all that's the same person 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.549
 would like to emphasize that it got complicated 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.079
 to understand 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.250
 there are miss is too much capture while 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.200
 go there what are we sorry for 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.190
 3ds video capture shadow makes the bet 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.800
 to the point 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.020
 that's about pretty good there 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.190
 in there you're going to have your key for 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.950
 activate software that allows you to 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.390
 capture what would happen ps vita 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.760
 it's a shame that a v cap system 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.190
 de claix finally good the activity of my 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.550
 side and now look inside 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.770
 of the box 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.020
 but the ps vita that was included in 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.940
 underneath has been removed but do not have 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.340
 fear 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.400
 this ps lives very well packaged already has 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.910
 been unpacked to test things 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.310
 and watch out and here is the beast ps vita 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.590
 2000 colors black and pink exclusive to 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.150
 Japan I love it's really too stylish 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.700
 she is lighter 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.650
 there are some changes related to 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.840
 model number 2000 before anything 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.700
 the screen to change to be a lcd screen 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.530
 classic me it did not bother me at all 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.120
 in return the autonomy is 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.680
 increased by an average of three hours 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.270
 obviously we do not see well with the 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.470
 camera since it's only black what 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.060
 you can see meanwhile that's that 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.860
 I played like 10 minutes and already 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.440
 fingerprints everywhere it's not 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.940
 supplied with a protective screen so 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.680
 fake pace we buy a 27 come a 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.350
 little too dirty think it's going to be the 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.850
 priority of this moment so what we 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.070
 interested here is a little bit the port 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.480
 which has been added beyond the loader 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.300
 convoy is in who in the middle of a small 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.040
 pink cute smiley and jack us 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.050
 what interests us is this place 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.520
 right in the middle of the bar code they have 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.470
 inserted a hole they added 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.050
 look at this a place that allows you to 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.940
 capture the video it's the weld 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.830
 complexes that they did and that's fine 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.680
 discreet so it is very appreciable 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.200
 I have not yet tested angle software 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.090
 but I tested the game I tested the ps 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.800
 did not live then why not show you a 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.729
 little bit how it works in beach 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.559
 pressed the button 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.509
 anne please turn on again you 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.710
 here I am going to hold the button then 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.259
 that in fact it was simply necessary to support 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.249
 one shot and what are my 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.059
 impressions for now it's happening 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.979
 very good 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:30.860
 the system was in English when I 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.819
 received although it's a ps vita 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.379
 Japanese 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.610
 the colors are very nice breasts 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:36.960
 not believe so there the focus is 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.249
 very badly I'm sorry I'm going 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.629
 stay like that at the beginning what's needed 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.009
 know that since it is a ps 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:45.150
 Japanese vita and I do not know if we 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.370
 can change the laws in 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.379
 comments is that circle is 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.539
 the cross equivalent here is the 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:53.490
 validation japan and grow and the 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.659
 back we need to adapt because 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.789
 what do we imagine we play a game 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.319
 virtuoso dasri world that comes from 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.729
 united kingdom of the coup it's reversed 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.099
 when you are in the menu the ps vita 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.569
 to go back is x for 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.800
 validate if circle and when one is in 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.930
 game it's reversed 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.159
 you understand a little bit sometimes 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.569
 difficulties in navigating between 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.649
 menus and games sometimes but that's the 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.180
 only thing that I blame 

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:13.319
 and again it's a minor rebuke because 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.360
 that I must confess that I prefer 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.199
 press circle to validate I 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.550
 think it's a lot more 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.089
 ergonomic like that I do not know 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.249
 Why 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:22.709
 in any case it really works great 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:25.229
 and that we will stop the video you 

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:26.879
 will be entitled to direct capture for 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:28.430
 the led this country of this game the down one 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:30.389
 little bit the center was a bit strong 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.399
 that's very responsive 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.399
 in any case it's over for this 

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:35.729
 video on boxing of the kit of capture ps 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:37.499
 vita 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.719
