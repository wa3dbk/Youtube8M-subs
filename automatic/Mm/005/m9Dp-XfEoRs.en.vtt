good sized hammer there what well when
we<00:01:10.800> break<00:01:11.009> them<00:01:11.250> down<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> beat<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
we break them down you have to beat the

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.399 
we break them down you have to beat the
tire<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.920> outside<00:01:14.819> lip<00:01:15.090> down<00:01:15.360> far<00:01:15.810> enough<00:01:16.080> so

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
tire and outside lip down far enough so

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.740 
tire and outside lip down far enough so
you<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.679> pop<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.159> outside<00:01:17.580> lip<00:01:17.819> off<00:01:18.060> because

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
you can pop the outside lip off because

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.380 
you can pop the outside lip off because
it's<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:19.380> oval-shaped<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.270> could

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
it's like oval-shaped so if you could

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.600 
it's like oval-shaped so if you could
imagine<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.960> got<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> circle<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:23.399> got<00:01:23.520> an

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
imagine we got a circle and we got an

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.789 
imagine we got a circle and we got an
outside<00:01:24.060> lip<00:01:24.659> that's<00:01:24.930> oval-shaped

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
outside lip that's oval-shaped

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.609 
outside lip that's oval-shaped
so<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:27.420> means<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:27.869> touching<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
so that means it's not touching all the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.160 
so that means it's not touching all the
way<00:01:28.799> around<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.729> Center<00:01:30.420> pop<00:01:30.659> off<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
way around so that Center pop off and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.139 
way around so that Center pop off and
hit<00:01:31.439> people<00:01:31.649> down<00:01:31.979> yeah<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> lot<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.640> times<00:01:32.880> this

reassembled<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.519> looks<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.060> we've<00:02:09.269> got<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
reassembled it looks like we've got the

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.190 
reassembled it looks like we've got the
you<00:02:10.739> powder-coated<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.519> wheels<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.180> think<00:02:13.079> you

you powder-coated the wheels I think you
did<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.560> where'd<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.100> take<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.790> well

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
did that where'd you take that to well

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.120 
did that where'd you take that to well

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
they're centered so that's crazy so now

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.440 
they're centered so that's crazy so now
that<00:02:34.560> we've<00:02:34.680> got<00:02:34.830> these<00:02:35.070> painted<00:02:35.670> we're<00:02:36.330> going

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
that we've got these painted we're going

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.790 
that we've got these painted we're going
to<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.780> installation<00:02:37.470> what<00:02:37.650> does<00:02:37.770> that

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
to do the installation what does that

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.820 
to do the installation what does that
entail<00:02:38.130> well<00:02:39.060> what<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:39.870> do<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.080> we<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.320> slide

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
entail well what we do is we just slide

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.790 
entail well what we do is we just slide
it<00:02:41.010> over<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.370> hub<00:02:41.700> now<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.440> not<00:02:43.590> like<00:02:43.770> a

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
it over the hub now this is not like a

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.310 
it over the hub now this is not like a
normal<00:02:44.220> car<00:02:44.400> setup<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.030> has<00:02:45.480> little<00:02:45.780> wedges

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
that go all the way around it and it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.750 
that go all the way around it and it
centers<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:49.770> right<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.280> you've<00:02:50.430> got<00:02:50.460> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
centers it just right so you've got to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.990 
centers it just right so you've got to
spin<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.510> wheel<00:02:51.540> okay<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.560> tighten<00:02:53.370> one<00:02:53.580> up<00:02:53.790> a

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
spin the wheel okay and tighten one up a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.670 
spin the wheel okay and tighten one up a
little<00:02:54.270> bit<00:02:54.390> at<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.570> time<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.870> make<00:02:55.200> sure<00:02:55.260> it's

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
little bit at a time to make sure it's

so the poor driver doesn't get sucked
shook<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.320> death<00:04:01.940> so<00:04:02.940> what<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.180> do<00:04:04.670> they<00:04:05.670> use<00:04:05.820> my

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
shook to death so what I do they use my

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.430 
shook to death so what I do they use my
hammer<00:04:06.180> because<00:04:06.420> I'll<00:04:06.630> probably<00:04:06.840> have<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.320> out

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
hammer because I'll probably have it out

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.470 
hammer because I'll probably have it out
cuz<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.620> just<00:04:07.650> changed<00:04:08.130> some<00:04:08.250> wheels<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:09.390> I'll

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
cuz I just changed some wheels and I'll

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.630 
cuz I just changed some wheels and I'll
set<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.810> I'll<00:04:10.320> start<00:04:10.650> out<00:04:10.800> about<00:04:11.040> an<00:04:11.190> inch<00:04:11.370> from

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
set it I'll start out about an inch from

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.960 
set it I'll start out about an inch from
the<00:04:11.820> wheel<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.560> I'll<00:04:13.560> spin<00:04:13.860> it<00:04:13.890> just<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.790> see

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
the wheel and I'll spin it just to see

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.170 
the wheel and I'll spin it just to see
how<00:04:15.090> bad<00:04:15.330> it<00:04:15.360> is<00:04:16.340> so<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.730> highest

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
how bad it is so this is the highest

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.449 
how bad it is so this is the highest
spot<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:18.840> sticks<00:04:19.140> out<00:04:19.350> so<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.980> go<00:04:20.160> ahead<00:04:20.250> and

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
spot that sticks out so I go ahead and

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.270 
spot that sticks out so I go ahead and
put<00:04:20.609> this<00:04:20.730> a<00:04:21.090> little<00:04:21.419> bit<00:04:21.570> closer<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.350> then

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
put this a little bit closer and then

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.220 
put this a little bit closer and then
I'll<00:04:23.370> go<00:04:23.520> ahead<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:24.030> tighten<00:04:24.690> one<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.080> these

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
I'll go ahead and tighten one of these

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.130 
I'll go ahead and tighten one of these
up<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.560> little<00:04:25.620> bit<00:04:25.950> at<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.130> time<00:04:26.160> until<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:27.840> get<00:04:28.080> it
