University<00:04:06.470> is<00:04:07.099> working<00:04:07.280> on<00:04:07.579> breaking<00:04:07.760> their

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
University is working on breaking their

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.780 
University is working on breaking their
own<00:04:08.239> record<00:04:08.750> with<00:04:08.780> Felix<00:04:09.410> 4<00:04:09.889> I'm<00:04:10.340> holding<00:04:10.669> a

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
own record with Felix 4 I'm holding a

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.430 
own record with Felix 4 I'm holding a
standard<00:04:11.269> chain<00:04:11.480> in<00:04:11.599> my<00:04:11.690> hand<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:12.049> special

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
standard chain in my hand a special

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.740 
standard chain in my hand a special
chain<00:04:12.680> developed<00:04:13.160> by<00:04:13.280> DSM<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:14.090> rollers<00:04:14.480> are

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
chain developed by DSM the rollers are

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.529 
chain developed by DSM the rollers are
made<00:04:15.440> out<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.829> Stan<00:04:16.280> old<00:04:16.430> plastic<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:17.359> lower

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
made out of a Stan old plastic to lower

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.930 
made out of a Stan old plastic to lower
the<00:04:17.720> friction<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.349> steel<00:04:19.039> to<00:04:19.250> steel<00:04:19.280> friction

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
the friction and steel to steel friction

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.460 
the friction and steel to steel friction
is<00:04:20.120> higher<00:04:20.329> than<00:04:20.599> the<00:04:20.750> steel<00:04:20.930> to<00:04:21.049> plastic

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
is higher than the steel to plastic

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.339 
is higher than the steel to plastic
friction<00:04:21.859> so<00:04:22.039> we<00:04:22.280> have<00:04:22.580> one<00:04:23.090> like<00:04:23.539> 1%<00:04:23.930> in

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
friction so we have one like 1% in

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.540 
friction so we have one like 1% in
efficiency<00:04:24.860> this<00:04:25.130> will<00:04:25.310> contribute

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
efficiency this will contribute

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.580 
efficiency this will contribute
definitely<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.599> getting<00:04:26.900> higher<00:04:27.020> speeds<00:04:27.349> I'm

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
definitely to getting higher speeds I'm

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.839 
definitely to getting higher speeds I'm
gonna<00:04:27.800> leave<00:04:27.950> you<00:04:28.039> with<00:04:28.070> a<00:04:28.190> virtual<00:04:28.430> reality

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
gonna leave you with a virtual reality

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.080 
gonna leave you with a virtual reality
game<00:04:29.240> inspired<00:04:29.990> by<00:04:30.349> lucid<00:04:30.860> dreaming<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.669> as

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
game inspired by lucid dreaming and as

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.530 
game inspired by lucid dreaming and as
always<00:04:32.360> thanks<00:04:33.320> for<00:04:33.380> watching
