00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.570
 room entered 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:12.140
 they beat me on a motorcycle 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.660
 exercise or this word death when we 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.269
 prepared for you training on this 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.749
 question we tried to show it 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.880
 the professional they became brian when the pen on 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:25.550
 best we will show you a number 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.460
 preparatory exercises step by step 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.180
 how is it better done frame by frame and 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.970
 I think this video lesson will teach you 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.630
 do long and beautiful and led on your 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.630
 motorcycle 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.719
 Brian and we'll show you how to do were 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.309
 in slow motion, and tell all 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:01:00.850
 more detail from the very beginning and so come on 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.570
 this is the most important thing is to find a point 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.089
 of balance 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.610
 find and can even be on earth 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.340
 just put the bike on the back 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.259
 the wheel and see how your weight is gone 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.049
 motorcycle but the fun begins 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.880
 after that you try to play leverage 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.789
 controls hold on this shaky 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.399
 positions as long as possible but in this and 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.729
 there is all the complexity you need perfect 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:31.810
 point gas brake stick control 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:32.470
 acceleration balance is pretty hard 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.869
 at first 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.979
 and can pass years of training hours 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.200
 to do it well, its lightness 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.789
 best way to apache or 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.729
 me and me and why you are based on it 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.460
 precise control of daughter balance instead 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.780
 order to do and on or 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.689
 exclusively on the motor that is due to 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.530
 speeding up your motorcycle find the point 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.909
 of balance 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.469
 let your eyes shift to the wing 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:08.470
 unloading the front wheel and lower legs 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:11.320
 to the ground and if the front wheel of your 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.870
 the motorcycle began to fall down then feeding 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.209
 short pulses on the throttle return 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.370
 to its original position and if the motorcycle 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:26.260
 will tip over just get up in 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:28.390
 full length after we can 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.549
 drive confidently in first gear in 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.069
 this position we put the right foot on 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.019
 foot rear brake and let the left 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.519
 dragging on the ground let you understand that 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:42.430
 . it was found later what we do next 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.690
 further we ride down the street forward back 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.230
 back and forth 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:53.730
 back again and again until you have 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.730
 a perfect sense of balance will appear 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.610
 the idea is not to go on then for 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:08.500
 account acceleration she go. st balance 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:10.360
 and the balance is well understood they say that 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.140
 this method can learn to ride 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.160
 introduced 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.170
 after two or three weeks so william can 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.530
 do on any surface and it will 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.520
 last in years also perfect control 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.070
 gas and brakes 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.370
 impossible I started driving in the back with 12 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.090
 years and the next two decades 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.070
 improved his skills 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:37.540
 wallace sitting at low high speed 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:41.220
 well if you have a low motorcycle it 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.220
 allows you to touch the ground with your feet 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.870
 on this bike legs are pretty high 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.150
 from the earth you know as soon as you 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.190
 master control with gas and brake and 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.150
 balance points you can start doing 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.860
 Willie will try to shift gears to 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.480
 movement but it's all after stubborn 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:04.510
 workouts yes yes control years of hours and 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.370
 workout workouts and then you can 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:12.430
 feel very thin pen gas 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.739
 well let's summarize our lesson so 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.140
 okay real motorcycle control 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.140
 will not appear until you fall 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.390
 if you have a 2-stroke motorcycle you 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.080
 harder to control the exit point 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.010
 of balance 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.930
 slightly opened the flap and lips much 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.390
 easier to learn on the four stroke 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:38.080
 motorbike there the power out is controlled 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:40.150
 there respect is much more comfortable you all 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.420
 you will still be wrong for example you 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.580
 caught a balance on the road and the road went 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.850
 down or the wind blew perfectly flat 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.780
 the surface is not included or you do not 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.180
 there is a transfer 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.870
 what difference do you just have to always be 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.870
 ready to fall
