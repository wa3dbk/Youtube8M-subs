or South Africa obviously I'm hoping

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.810 
or South Africa obviously I'm hoping
that<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> be<00:02:05.219> new<00:02:05.369> zealand<00:02:05.670> that's

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
that it's going to be new zealand that's

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.219 
that it's going to be new zealand that's
why<00:02:05.909> I've<00:02:05.969> got<00:02:06.119> my<00:02:06.210> new<00:02:06.329> jersey<00:02:06.570> land<00:02:07.049> on

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
why I've got my new jersey land on

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.029 
why I've got my new jersey land on
to<00:02:07.590> date<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.959> think<00:02:09.959> either<00:02:10.170> way<00:02:10.440> whoever<00:02:10.709> goes

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
to date I think either way whoever goes

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.100 
to date I think either way whoever goes
through<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.849> will<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:12.270> nice<00:02:12.480> because<00:02:12.750> neither

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
through it will be nice because neither

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.640 
through it will be nice because neither
of<00:02:13.230> those<00:02:13.410> two

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
of those two

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.100 
of those two
names<00:02:13.909> happen<00:02:14.909> to<00:02:15.180> walk<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:15.659> phone<00:02:15.870> as<00:02:16.049> a

suited is going to be the day before one

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.789 
suited is going to be the day before one
of<00:02:17.730> them<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.120> both<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.140> them<00:02:19.379> played<00:02:19.590> very

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
of them and both of them played very

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.110 
of them and both of them played very
good<00:02:19.829> cricket<00:02:20.220> like<00:02:20.340> New<00:02:20.519> Zealand<00:02:20.849> probably

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
good cricket like New Zealand probably

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.449 
good cricket like New Zealand probably
over<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> last<00:02:21.720> 12-18<00:02:22.260> months<00:02:22.799> have<00:02:23.189> really

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
over the last 12-18 months have really

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.360 
over the last 12-18 months have really
developed<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.510> am<00:02:24.659> an<00:02:24.930> attacking<00:02:25.500> philosophy

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
developed a am an attacking philosophy

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.100 
developed a am an attacking philosophy
when<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:26.849> comes<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.269> one<00:02:27.420> day<00:02:27.569> cricket<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.049> I

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
when it comes to one day cricket and I

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.770 
when it comes to one day cricket and I
guess<00:02:28.519> McCallum<00:02:29.519> kind<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:30.060> typifies<00:02:30.359> that

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
guess McCallum kind of typifies that

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.949 
guess McCallum kind of typifies that
because<00:02:31.340> his<00:02:32.340> captaincy<00:02:32.819> kind<00:02:33.299> of<00:02:33.480> rubs<00:02:33.750> off

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
because his captaincy kind of rubs off

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.360 
because his captaincy kind of rubs off
and<00:02:33.989> his<00:02:34.260> playing<00:02:34.500> style<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:35.010> he's<00:02:35.129> always

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
and his playing style like he's always

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.770 
and his playing style like he's always
been<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.519> very<00:02:35.790> aggressive<00:02:36.000> player<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:36.599> since

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
been a very aggressive player but since

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.420 
been a very aggressive player but since
he's<00:02:36.870> got<00:02:37.019> captain<00:02:37.379> seeing<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.920> lately<00:02:38.280> he's

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
he's got captain seeing and lately he's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.750 
he's got captain seeing and lately he's
just<00:02:38.760> gone<00:02:38.939> and<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.900> being<00:02:40.170> very<00:02:40.439> aggressive

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
just gone and just being very aggressive

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.890 
just gone and just being very aggressive
and<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:42.209> go<00:02:42.359> when<00:02:42.599> you're<00:02:42.689> game<00:02:42.870> so

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and that can go when you're game so

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.430 
and that can go when you're game so
hopefully<00:02:43.409> he<00:02:43.590> comes<00:02:43.829> off<00:02:44.099> while<00:02:44.370> he<00:02:44.489> came<00:02:44.790> off

30<00:05:00.180> runs<00:05:00.360> on<00:05:00.539> three<00:05:00.780> overs<00:05:01.020> now<00:05:01.139> a<00:05:01.169> t20<00:05:01.740> that<00:05:01.889> is

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
30 runs on three overs now a t20 that is

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.610 
30 runs on three overs now a t20 that is
very<00:05:02.250> good<00:05:02.449> but<00:05:03.449> we<00:05:03.599> just<00:05:03.750> I<00:05:04.050> don't<00:05:04.110> know<00:05:04.289> just

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
very good but we just I don't know just

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.309 
very good but we just I don't know just
haven't<00:05:05.009> really<00:05:05.310> had<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.900> chances<00:05:06.900> at<00:05:07.080> the

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319 
haven't really had the chances at the

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:08.510 
haven't really had the chances at the
wickets<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:07.800> it<00:05:07.889> was<00:05:08.039> quite<00:05:08.190> funny<00:05:08.460> actually

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
wickets and it was quite funny actually

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.270 
wickets and it was quite funny actually
in<00:05:08.940> my<00:05:09.060> video<00:05:09.330> that<00:05:09.509> I<00:05:09.569> first<00:05:10.069> recorded<00:05:11.069> to<00:05:11.159> be

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
in my video that I first recorded to be

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.629

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
uploaded yesterday it was real funny

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.999 
uploaded yesterday it was real funny
because<00:05:14.789> I<00:05:14.940> recorded<00:05:15.300> my<00:05:15.389> first<00:05:15.449> spell<00:05:16.009> didn't

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
because I recorded my first spell didn't

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.249 
because I recorded my first spell didn't
get<00:05:17.129> any<00:05:17.370> wickets<00:05:17.789> at<00:05:18.030> all<00:05:18.330> like<00:05:18.629> I<00:05:18.750> could<00:05:19.020> just

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
get any wickets at all like I could just

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.709 
get any wickets at all like I could just
could<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.770> just<00:05:20.279> struggled<00:05:20.669> so<00:05:20.819> much<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.330> then

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
could I just struggled so much and then

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.149

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:42.029 
through these bold are these batsman

through these bold are these batsman
sorry<00:05:42.300> and<00:05:42.919> just<00:05:43.919> not<00:05:44.129> really<00:05:44.430> giving<00:05:44.580> them

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
sorry and just not really giving them

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.909 
sorry and just not really giving them
too<00:05:44.909> much<00:05:44.940> of<00:05:45.240> a<00:05:45.300> chance<00:05:45.539> but<00:05:45.870> these<00:05:46.770> guys

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
too much of a chance but these guys

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.110 
too much of a chance but these guys
going<00:05:47.190> pretty<00:05:47.339> well<00:05:47.400> it's<00:05:47.550> looking<00:05:47.969> like

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
going pretty well it's looking like

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.820 
going pretty well it's looking like
they're<00:05:48.240> going<00:05:48.360> to<00:05:48.479> come<00:05:48.719> up<00:05:48.900> to<00:05:49.650> a<00:05:49.680> pretty

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
they're going to come up to a pretty

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.769 
they're going to come up to a pretty
comfortable<00:05:50.339> victory<00:05:50.759> and<00:05:51.029> I<00:05:51.089> think<00:05:51.449> that<00:05:51.659> was

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:51.779 
comfortable victory and I think that was

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:54.019 
comfortable victory and I think that was
due<00:05:51.960> to<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.080> fact<00:05:52.169> of<00:05:52.529> us<00:05:53.009> not<00:05:53.370> scoring<00:05:53.729> enough

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:54.029 
due to the fact of us not scoring enough

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:58.430 
due to the fact of us not scoring enough
runs<00:05:54.330> so<00:05:56.509> but<00:05:57.509> you<00:05:57.629> never<00:05:57.839> know<00:05:58.110> you<00:05:58.139> know<00:05:58.409> a

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
runs so but you never know you know a

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.110

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120
