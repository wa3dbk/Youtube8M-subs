00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:33.149
 what's that here is a printer 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:35.590
 portable that does not use inca brazil ink 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.630
 of polaroid should work in the same 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.790
 mechanism of those impressions of 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.280

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.339
 $ 23 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.159
 I found this fucking thing today in the box for 4 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.629
 99 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.790
 she had some sheets inside 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.970
 pressure I bought any more costs 9 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.510
 dollars and 90 per 50 sheets 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.140
 basically what it does promises the little leaf 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 from the inside 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.240
 it connects via the USB cable or 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.670
 bluetooth 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.770
 What a wonder, do not let 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.140
 so table 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:36.340
 I'll call her back a company and 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.870
 a picture for testing live already made a 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:45.010
 I think it's not even 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:49.290
 alive that leaves always caught leaving 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.290
 team does connects you on your cell phone 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.810
 I already have her here 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:17.160
 Polaroid I bought that I said oh one 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:29.320
 box of 50 by us 90 come several among 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:33.610
 five 10 occasion turn around boxes 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.120
 catch a photo, see god, no 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.120
 load 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.200
 I sent you to teacher. 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.270
 It takes a while to send 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.250
 exactly the size of the file I do not 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:24.250
 I mistake is going from a paper 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:29.260
 laptop wall is heavy to send 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:40.000
 business is getting the kitchen is sign 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:41.440
 that you leave the file is waiting to see the 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:54.489
 real time even though it will lead to 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:56.470
 print the noise 20 seconds I think nÃ© 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.560
 I'll always send another one to test 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.560
 new 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.480
 for 4 99 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.660
 I came to see the usb cable has the cable of 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.310
 charge the battery and do not see the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.980
 usb cable do not know if well together really 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:37.150
 because it all connects with 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:45.760
 any cell phone and puts it raw 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:47.500
 exactly the quality of the photo that I 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.600
 I took a test on her photo here. 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.600
 I just took the picture with my cell phone. 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:04.840
 the other xata lack of commitment me 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.230
 charging charging is over the battery 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.050
 it gives a prime time to the 15 photos 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.690
 and I'm not wrong with a charged battery 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.060
 so it's not much but break twig 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.010
 even command the new photo that arrived 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.010
 see you later 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:40.009
 Sending the photo is going 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:40.009
 I think it was there at the request of the favela 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:44.190
 It's a picture just like the picture I 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:45.900
 I took it cool, there's nothing cool about it. 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.670
 I thought it was cheap here. 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.890
 will probably be given to a lottery 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:54.500
 reality of the american carlos lobby of the 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.500
 gameplay path back after
