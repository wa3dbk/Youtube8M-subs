00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.680
 if he likes you better 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.620
 revenue upwards 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.440
 the next week we want you 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.540
 today the simple variant of the 3d 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.480
 to show the only with three strands 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.070
 is closed when he does that 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.899
 have and you want now also like times 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.940
 the difficult variants with the four 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.739
 see strasps then write that 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.829
 below in the comments then make you 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.200
 as well as a tutorial we have now 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.760
 a high technical found easy 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.260
 By doing so you can see it better 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.079
 but you can also do it here at the 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.899
 Side braids just everywhere if 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.869
 her a normal braid with three 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:11.869
 strands of surfaces would be distributed so 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.399
 trained in the same when you are completely 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.869
 to begin to weave normally 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.819
 Now I start on the right side 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.530
 you can also start on the left that it 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.440
 no matter in any case you have to now 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.740
 always the outer strands in the middle 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.929
 part of it goes with the finger 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.679
 thumb and forefinger works best 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:37.039
 take your middle strand and see 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:39.709
 the through and two-part strands 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.200
 you take one in the middle together 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:46.780
 so you have three beaches again 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.610
 right center and left 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.789
 now it's the other side of it 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.509
 take your love streak divides the also 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:59.810
 take in almost the middle again characterized 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.580
 your middle strand and pull the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.830
 German and the two halves 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.729
 you put together in the middle again 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.170
 to a whole stress 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.090
 now the right side is your turn again 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:21.360
 in the middle part through the middle 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:23.460
 get packed and pervades the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.850
 both halves again in the middle 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.620
 So pack together your two halves 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.810
 are always in the middle together 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.840
 taken to a spot so we 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.330
 Now you have three again 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:43.350
 turn on the left side again 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:47.190
 in the middle share by grasp and in 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.080
 the middle stitch together again and now 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.480
 Do you already see how here is a whole 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.220
 Great 3d pattern gives the braid is so 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.990
 not just the top of it and one side 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.470
 below I'll show you later blemish 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.060
 have braided down more like that 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.230
 you keep on going until you are 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.230
 have arrived below 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.109
 if he arrived down here then 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.040
 can you do the tips again 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.200
 comb through 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.590
 perhaps again allude so 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.590
 You can better pull it off with it 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.599
 not so many knots but have 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.560
 Now you can really great that 3d 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.510
 recognize patterns 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.620
 this looks like you're here 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.790
 a pigtail on her side is up and 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:11.689
 Below is whether it is all around 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.689
 so braided and then closes 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.470
 and if you want you can 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.110
 individual strands a bit more 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.870
 then he pulls apart 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:37.150
 a little bit thicker that would have to be 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:40.889
 but on all four sides do it 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.889
 it looks uniform 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.980
 So update above right and left top 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.250
 and your brother is 3 dec
