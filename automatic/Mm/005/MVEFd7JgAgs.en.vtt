a few different angles of the shoe let
me<00:04:37.620> know<00:04:37.770> what<00:04:37.949> you<00:04:38.070> think<00:04:38.220> about<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.639> shoe

I<00:04:41.610> wish<00:04:42.419> I<00:04:42.540> could<00:04:42.720> have<00:04:42.780> got<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:42.960> few<00:04:43.320> extra

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
I wish I could have got a few extra

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.560 
I wish I could have got a few extra
pairs<00:04:43.919> maybe<00:04:44.639> I<00:04:44.729> could<00:04:44.970> have<00:04:45.060> hooked<00:04:45.150> somebody

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
pairs maybe I could have hooked somebody

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.640 
pairs maybe I could have hooked somebody
up<00:04:47.090> but<00:04:48.090> those<00:04:48.240> like<00:04:48.660> I<00:04:48.780> said<00:04:48.990> unless<00:04:49.229> you<00:04:49.440> have

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
up but those like I said unless you have

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.909 
up but those like I said unless you have
a<00:04:49.680> contact<00:04:50.460> on<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.330> inside<00:04:51.780> it's<00:04:52.590> hard<00:04:52.830> to

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
a contact on the inside it's hard to

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.670 
a contact on the inside it's hard to
pick<00:04:53.130> up<00:04:53.310> some<00:04:53.520> of<00:04:53.639> these<00:04:53.729> shoes<00:04:54.060> now<00:04:54.389> and<00:04:54.680> in

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
pick up some of these shoes now and in

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.230 
pick up some of these shoes now and in
some<00:04:55.860> ways<00:04:55.919> I<00:04:56.070> think<00:04:56.190> it<00:04:56.520> hurts<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:56.910> game

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
some ways I think it hurts the game

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.800 
some ways I think it hurts the game
because<00:04:58.080> like<00:04:58.620> I<00:04:58.800> said<00:04:58.860> I<00:04:59.340> just<00:05:00.000> want<00:05:00.300> certain

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
color ways not every outrageous colorway

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.750 
color ways not every outrageous colorway
