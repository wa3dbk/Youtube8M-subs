judgment<00:00:56.940> from<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.360> stripped<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.870> all<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
judgment from here we stripped on all of

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.340 
judgment from here we stripped on all of
that<00:00:58.559> away<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.910> idea<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.660> heavier

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that away so the idea of do it heavier

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.040 
that away so the idea of do it heavier
that<00:01:01.590> changes<00:01:02.100> Lester's<00:01:03.050> inspire<00:01:04.050> and<00:01:04.820> is<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
that changes Lester's inspire and is a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.300 
that changes Lester's inspire and is a
totally<00:01:07.050> different<00:01:07.350> image<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.039> it's<00:01:08.160> up<00:01:08.280> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
totally different image so it's up to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.160 
totally different image so it's up to
the<00:01:08.520> building's<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> interpret<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.750> my
