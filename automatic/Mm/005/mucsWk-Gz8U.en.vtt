00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
then simply just snap on the other side

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.270 
then simply just snap on the other side
and<00:01:06.360> that's<00:01:06.930> really<00:01:07.140> all<00:01:07.380> there<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:08.100> now

if<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:08.970> notice<00:01:09.510> here<00:01:09.840> you're<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> see

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
if you notice here you're going to see

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.560 
if you notice here you're going to see
there's<00:01:10.650> no<00:01:10.979> bubbling<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> screen<00:01:12.299> shield

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
there's no bubbling of the screen shield

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.270 
there's no bubbling of the screen shield
which<00:01:12.840> by<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> way<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.830> screen

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
which by the way I do have a screen

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.999 
which by the way I do have a screen
shield<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.790> no<00:01:15.360> lifting<00:01:15.810> no<00:01:16.049> bubbling<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.799> I

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
shield on no lifting no bubbling so I

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.130 
shield on no lifting no bubbling so I
would<00:01:17.490> venture<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.880> say<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.210> should<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.990> in

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
good shape for the most part I'm not

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.090 
good shape for the most part I'm not
sure<00:01:21.450> how<00:01:21.630> work<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.320> you've<00:01:22.470> got<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.979> those

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
sure how work if you've got one of those

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.640 
sure how work if you've got one of those
glass<00:01:23.490> type<00:01:23.880> screen<00:01:24.270> protectors<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.140> don't

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
down on the table or on a flat surface

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.010 
down on the table or on a flat surface
the<00:01:41.400> screen<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.180> phones<00:01:42.450> not<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.930> be

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the screen of the phones not going to be

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.289 
the screen of the phones not going to be
touching<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.770> surface<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.520> case<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:45.030> so

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
touching the surface the case is so

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.330 
touching the surface the case is so
that's<00:01:45.479> what<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> mean<00:01:45.869> by<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.200> down<00:01:47.040> below

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
that's what I mean by that down below

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.060 
that's what I mean by that down below
this<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.240> how<00:01:48.420> everything<00:01:48.720> looks<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.439> there's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
this is how everything looks and there's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.660 
this is how everything looks and there's
no<00:01:50.610> distortion<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:51.840> issues<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.619> mic<00:01:53.220> pickup

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
no distortion or issues with mic pickup

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.719 
no distortion or issues with mic pickup
or<00:01:53.820> sound<00:01:54.720> coming<00:01:55.049> out<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> speakers<00:01:55.950> you

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
or sound coming out of the speakers you

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.249 
or sound coming out of the speakers you
can<00:01:56.759> see<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> Lightning<00:01:57.570> port<00:01:57.780> there<00:01:58.079> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
can see the Lightning port there and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.219 
can see the Lightning port there and
that<00:01:58.350> should<00:01:58.560> work<00:01:59.240> with<00:02:00.240> pretty<00:02:00.750> much<00:02:00.990> all

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that should work with pretty much all

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.080 
that should work with pretty much all

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
bolts in the back of this case but it's

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.890 
bolts in the back of this case but it's
just<00:02:52.890> part<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.430> material<00:02:54.030> it's<00:02:54.720> not

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
just part of the material it's not

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.080 
just part of the material it's not
actual<00:02:55.230> bolts<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.830> kind<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.160> cool<00:02:56.310> look<00:02:56.580> you

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
actual bolts a kind of a cool look you

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.930 
actual bolts a kind of a cool look you
got<00:02:57.240> some<00:02:57.450> UAG<00:02:57.870> logo<00:02:58.740> right<00:02:59.520> there<00:02:59.730> in<00:02:59.820> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
got some UAG logo right there in the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.790 
got some UAG logo right there in the
middle<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.360> then<00:03:00.780> there<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:01.230> your<00:03:01.380> camera

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
middle and then there is your camera

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.980 
middle and then there is your camera
cutout<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:02.940> lined<00:03:03.180> with<00:03:03.300> black<00:03:03.660> and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
cutout and it is lined with black and

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.050 
cutout and it is lined with black and
I've<00:03:04.170> tested<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.800> there's<00:03:05.010> no<00:03:05.340> issue<00:03:05.550> with

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
I've tested it there's no issue with

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.540 
I've tested it there's no issue with
whiteout<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.750> your<00:03:06.930> photos<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.370> don't

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
whiteout and your photos so you don't

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.220 
whiteout and your photos so you don't
have<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.700> worry<00:03:08.880> about<00:03:09.030> that<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.840> all<00:03:09.930> works

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
have to worry about that it all works

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.110 
have to worry about that it all works
really<00:03:10.350> well<00:03:10.800> it's<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.250> very<00:03:11.340> nice<00:03:11.610> case<00:03:11.910> to

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
really well it's a very nice case to

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.380 
really well it's a very nice case to
hold<00:03:12.330> it's<00:03:13.040> surprisingly<00:03:14.040> light<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.209> can

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
hold it's surprisingly light and you can

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.780 
hold it's surprisingly light and you can
see<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:15.870> really<00:03:16.110> doesn't<00:03:16.410> add<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.740> ton<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.340> bulk

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
see it really doesn't add a ton of bulk

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.180 
see it really doesn't add a ton of bulk
you<00:03:18.690> would<00:03:18.810> think<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.110> case<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.620> would

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
you would think a case like this would

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.610 
you would think a case like this would
but<00:03:20.820> it's<00:03:20.940> not<00:03:21.209> all<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.420> bad<00:03:21.600> yeah<00:03:22.320> you're

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
but it's not all that bad yeah you're

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.259

going<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.830> get<00:03:22.950> some<00:03:23.250> bulk<00:03:23.489> with<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.850> but<00:03:24.090> not

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
going to get some bulk with this but not

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.680 
going to get some bulk with this but not
too<00:03:24.510> bad<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.110> again<00:03:26.040> surprisingly<00:03:27.030> light<00:03:27.360> so

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
too bad and again surprisingly light so

too bad and again surprisingly light so
I<00:03:27.900> am<00:03:28.230> very<00:03:28.470> impressed<00:03:28.590> by<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.310> let<00:03:29.670> me<00:03:29.700> go

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
I am very impressed by this let me go

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.210 
I am very impressed by this let me go
ahead<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.030> show<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.450> just<00:03:31.200> four<00:03:31.500> colors<00:03:31.920> sake

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
ahead and show you just four colors sake

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.040 
ahead and show you just four colors sake
what<00:03:32.519> these<00:03:32.730> others<00:03:33.060> are<00:03:33.360> going<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.840> look<00:03:33.989> like

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
what these others are going to look like

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.259 
what these others are going to look like
and<00:03:34.590> usually<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.040> take<00:03:35.280> these<00:03:35.489> cases<00:03:35.880> off<00:03:36.030> I

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
and usually I take these cases off I

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.590 
and usually I take these cases off I
would<00:03:36.510> kind<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.440> push<00:03:37.680> down<00:03:37.709> on<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:39.209> corners

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
would kind of push down on the corners

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.150 
would kind of push down on the corners
like<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.900> saw<00:03:40.080> me<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.320> do<00:03:40.380> there<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.680> remove<00:03:40.980> it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
like you saw me to do there to remove it

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.970 
like you saw me to do there to remove it
and<00:03:41.390> then<00:03:42.390> of<00:03:42.510> course<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.989> also<00:03:43.380> like<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.739> put

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
and then of course I also like to put

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.350 
and then of course I also like to put
the<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:45.320> switch<00:03:46.320> in<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.680> mute<00:03:46.920> position<00:03:47.489> just

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
the the switch in the mute position just

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.940 
the the switch in the mute position just
something<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.780> usually<00:03:48.959> would<00:03:49.290> do<00:03:49.440> there<00:03:49.650> so

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
something I usually would do there so

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.030 
something I usually would do there so
here<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:51.000> what<00:03:51.630> that<00:03:51.660> blueish<00:03:52.470> one<00:03:52.709> is<00:03:52.830> going

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
here is what that blueish one is going

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.949 
here is what that blueish one is going
to<00:03:53.160> look<00:03:53.489> like<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.360> I'll<00:03:54.510> just<00:03:54.660> show<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.840> to

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
to look like and I'll just show it to

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.660 
to look like and I'll just show it to
you<00:03:55.080> rather<00:03:55.410> quickly<00:03:55.830> err<00:03:56.130> so<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.459> get<00:03:56.580> an

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
you rather quickly err so you get an

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.870 
you rather quickly err so you get an
idea<00:03:56.760> for<00:03:57.269> that<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:58.440> it's<00:03:59.220> kind<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.489> that<00:03:59.610> blue

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
idea for that and it's kind of that blue

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.110 
idea for that and it's kind of that blue
and<00:04:00.060> black<00:04:00.739> real<00:04:01.739> nice<00:04:02.010> case<00:04:02.340> again<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:02.790> then

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
and black real nice case again and then

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.170 
and black real nice case again and then
we'll<00:04:03.269> round<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.720> out<00:04:03.810> with<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.560> gunmetal<00:04:05.180> and

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
we'll round it out with the gunmetal and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.090 
we'll round it out with the gunmetal and
as<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.510> can<00:04:06.660> see<00:04:06.989> here<00:04:07.350> it's<00:04:07.530> not<00:04:07.830> too

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
as you can see here it's not too

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.400 
as you can see here it's not too
difficult<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.820> take<00:04:09.000> off<00:04:09.239> requires<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.200> little

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
difficult to take off requires a little

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.670 
difficult to take off requires a little
bit<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:10.709> effort<00:04:10.830> but<00:04:11.370> certainly<00:04:11.910> not<00:04:12.650> not<00:04:13.650> a

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
bit of effort but certainly not not a

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.729 
bit of effort but certainly not not a
difficult<00:04:14.280> thing<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.549> do<00:04:15.260> let's<00:04:16.260> go<00:04:16.470> ahead<00:04:16.560> and

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
difficult thing to do let's go ahead and

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.599 
difficult thing to do let's go ahead and
put<00:04:16.830> this<00:04:16.979> gunmetal<00:04:17.400> one<00:04:17.729> on<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:20.160> I'll<00:04:20.310> snap

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
put this gunmetal one on and I'll snap

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.110 
put this gunmetal one on and I'll snap
this<00:04:20.850> corner<00:04:21.239> into<00:04:21.510> place<00:04:21.830> and<00:04:22.970> here<00:04:23.970> we<00:04:24.090> are

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
this corner into place and here we are

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.000 
this corner into place and here we are
and<00:04:24.390> again<00:04:24.630> all<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.020> buttons<00:04:25.289> are<00:04:25.470> very

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
and again all the buttons are very

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.350 
and again all the buttons are very
responsive<00:04:26.849> on<00:04:26.970> that

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
responsive on that

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.969 
responsive on that
so<00:04:27.509> you<00:04:27.569> can<00:04:27.900> see<00:04:28.110> what<00:04:28.259> this<00:04:28.379> one's<00:04:28.650> going<00:04:28.860> to

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
so you can see what this one's going to

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.240 
so you can see what this one's going to
look<00:04:29.129> like<00:04:29.310> very<00:04:30.199> nice<00:04:31.199> case<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.919> know<00:04:32.039> I'm

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
look like very nice case you know I'm

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.179 
look like very nice case you know I'm
going<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.460> give<00:04:32.699> this<00:04:32.969> one<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.650> four<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.919> half

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:35.189 
going to give this one a four and a half

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:37.490 
going to give this one a four and a half
out<00:04:35.490> of<00:04:35.550> five<00:04:35.789> I<00:04:36.389> think<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:36.900> provides<00:04:37.110> a

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
out of five I think it provides a

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.149 
out of five I think it provides a
wonderful<00:04:38.009> level<00:04:38.580> of<00:04:38.759> protection<00:04:39.509> from<00:04:39.780> drops

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:40.159 
wonderful level of protection from drops

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.159 
wonderful level of protection from drops
it's<00:04:41.159> going<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.400> absorb<00:04:41.849> impact<00:04:42.060> really<00:04:42.930> well

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
it's going to absorb impact really well

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.040 
it's going to absorb impact really well
and<00:04:43.610> I'm<00:04:44.610> quite<00:04:44.879> pleased<00:04:45.240> with<00:04:45.389> it<00:04:45.599> especially

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
and I'm quite pleased with it especially

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.899 
and I'm quite pleased with it especially
considering<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.680> doesn't<00:04:47.189> weigh<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.520> whole

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
considering it doesn't weigh a whole

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.330 
considering it doesn't weigh a whole
heck<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.210> a<00:04:48.479> lot<00:04:48.509> it's<00:04:48.930> very<00:04:49.379> nice<00:04:49.620> indeed<00:04:49.919> it

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
heck of a lot it's very nice indeed it

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.149 
heck of a lot it's very nice indeed it
is<00:04:50.789> the<00:04:50.909> urban<00:04:51.330> armor<00:04:51.689> gear<00:04:51.870> case<00:04:52.500> it's
