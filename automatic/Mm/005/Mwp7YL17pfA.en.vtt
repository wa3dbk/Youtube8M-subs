00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello my name is guÃ¨ye the bouquet 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.340
 lime I am a technical adviser to 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.230
 the French federation of the mountains 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.500
 and climbed and today I you 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.630
 presents the husband does double the navy in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.789
 doublets 1 halyard which allows 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.470
 shoot very heavy loads and 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.949
 also put tremendous tension on 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.570
 the horns 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.619
 the husband does redouble actually is a 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.300
 quite complex technique we can 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.869
 set up with a minimum of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.699
 equipment 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.140
 but there you have to know a lot of them 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.070
 but now there are tools 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.590
 mechanical can be easily used 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.510
 so at the top of the molding we put 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.410
 always a brake system that blocks 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.129
 automatically 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.989
 so that's for example that so for 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.329
 to set up the husband does not redouble one has 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.680
 need self blocking names that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.239
 can make self locking knots with 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.160
 cords or otherwise we can 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.980
 use mechanical self-locking 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.340
 that's how it is for this haul 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.020
 to use an asson body of 4.5 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.879
 m it's much simpler at the level 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.439
 of his achievement of having two strings 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.470
 different of different colors 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.110
 I use to look at the top of the molding 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.650
 at the head of hauling a mechanical tool 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.780
 with a pulley integrate so there I 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.810
 place the rope in the mechanical tool 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.560
 I close his flask I put it in 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.610
 blocking position and I put in addition 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.610
 that all of security 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.320
 so here we will put self-blocking 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.840
 mechanics on the ropes 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.450
 so I'm going to purposely use it 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.580
 a mechanical and a with a cord 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.800
 the first self-locking I'm going to 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.140
 put on the rope that is soft by the 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.860
 rope stretched soft rope is expected 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.860
 brake systems 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.979
 the second one puts it on the rope 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.149
 stretched with the cord 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.789
 and here I choose to put a 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.789
 cord with a chartres mast and that's 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.160
 now that both self-blocking 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.330
 are in place 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.519
 we will fix the body of asson on the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.680
 self-locking so first did 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:26.140
 a cow's tail that we will fix on 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.480
 the autoblocker that is near the system 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.370
 francs so I take the end of a 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.760
 rope to his and the egg is passed in 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.959
 the carabiner of the lower self-locking 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.299
 I make a cow's tail never the 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.989
 carabiner in the cow's tail and there 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.900
 I pass 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:48.519
 the yellow accord and now here is the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.630
 navy hours doublets up and there 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.849
 I can shoot you must not forget when 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.579
 we come to a stop to go down 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.100
 camp hotels and bring them back the most 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.880
 far possible to win the stick 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.000
 here 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.380
 and we leave and here you are 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.959
 know put up a husband does not 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.730
 redoubles this system allows to get out of 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.530
 people from a crevasse or put some 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.980
 very very strong strings on strings 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.980
 climbed to
