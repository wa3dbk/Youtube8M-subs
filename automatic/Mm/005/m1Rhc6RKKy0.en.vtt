00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 for all this is a quick video of 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.770
 let's talk in a way 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.139
 counteract the pass to the hole by 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.259
 up a triangle we have known 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.450
 let's go to a personal practice of 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.880
 club 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.090
 let's go the defense part and let's 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.070
 leave the pressure 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.740
 back because back because the players 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.990
 They do not go crazy hero and pressure 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.210
 hurried and do not leave spaces for 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.740
 pass over 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.280
 in aggressiveness leaves me the impression 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.260
 because pressure because not to mark that 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.940
 the players wait because when 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.340
 they hope a lot give much time to the rival 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.960
 to make those passes so long to the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.489
 ball tendency and send a pass 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.690
 complicated that you can create a hand to 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.000
 hand there is a clear goal situation 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.000
 then we leave it under pressure 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.530
 and width of the team we will leave it in 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.290
 normal because not in wide that also 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.630
 I would leave 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.830
 would not leave space would be no but let 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.180
 more space in the middle of the court 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.570
 for the rival have time to create their 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.570
 own plays 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.910
 and we leave it to cover 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.440
 in narrow pardon the whole team was 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.110
 runs to the side and leaves many spaces 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.460
 many then the key would be to leave it 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.460
 in normal equipment 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 and this option is always important 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.939
 always have to be 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.039
 by the default it has to be 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.619
 in cover because some tactics that 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.420
 brings the game by default is in this 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.159
 option out of the game instead if 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.369
 we let cover what I recommend 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.259
 the games are never complicated 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.119
 both an advance pass a pass by 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.399
 up because they are always ready 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.840
 to to cover the player already when 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.810
 one brand of the other leaves them closed by 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.909
 back and that pass is not that complicated 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.979
 then this would be the configuration that 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.439
 I recommend myself at the beginning it may be that 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.880
 it gets a bit complicated because they would come out 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.009
 the players to press so fast if 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.899
 we are used to level goes out 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.159
 playing on the back rivals in defense at 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.780
 have a picture that comes out both 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.090
 press me with this configuration on 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.729
 team does not do that the team rather 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.069
 wait even if you have pressure here either 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.049
 is that the truth that is 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.280
 very good I use it almost all my 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.740
 matches and the truth that serves me 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.450
 quite 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.040
 that's why I recommend that you use it well 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.750
 to keep it we have to go back and 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.630
 here are several spaces that 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.990
 we can save we have four in the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.990
 match 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.140
 we have the four arrows that we are going to 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.590
 be able to choose during the game we are going to 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.660
 this blog we will customize the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.390
 professional and we had activated 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.750
 what we would do would be during the match 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.220
 he will throw down date will be right 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.220
 we already have that defense activated 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.159
 The good thing about this is that we can also 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.870
 activate them in ultimate team that is very 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.849
 useful where the pass is also complicated 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.099
 in a triangle and pass over 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.349
 it also complicates us a lot so 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.120
 This is a very good option for 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.480
 temperamental in everything that would be the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.010
 organization of game positioning 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.469
 or the opportunities other options that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.099
 has in addition to the defense that is already what 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:15.510
 we configure in our style what the 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.219
 configuration that I am giving me to 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.170
 the defense would be something more global 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.450
 so it could go well with any 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.430
 practice any style of game 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.810
 each one if they like a style of play 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.269
 of possession I made a video of where 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.950
 configured the tactics to maintain a 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.500
 position and let him see link in 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.599
 description is good nothing to say that by 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.060
 please the proof that if you get used to 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.579
 to play like this is going to serve them well and 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.859
 van are going to counteract a lot but a lot 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:48.019
 those complicated passes of fifa 14 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.019
 thank you very much and see you
