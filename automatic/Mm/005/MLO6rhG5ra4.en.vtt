 we cut both ends up just 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.410
 on the edge then we will choose the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.149
 junction between two neighborhoods and we will 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.570
 cut out the skin and then we insert 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.290
 the fingers and gently one opens

 super fast that allowed you to 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.619

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.009
 but this time both sides are laying 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.890
 are rather sweat have gone around 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.350
 the skin the idea being to cut only the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.530
 skin is to try as much as possible 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.979
 not to touch the neighborhoods at all 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.880
