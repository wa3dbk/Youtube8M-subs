00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
I wonder if that's my first glimpse of

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.999 
I wonder if that's my first glimpse of
the<00:01:32.100> Sierra<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:33.979> see<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.159> mountain<00:01:35.520> range<00:01:37.009> up

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009

to<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.399> north<00:01:38.640> up<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:41.149> then<00:01:42.149> behind<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
to the north up there and then behind it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.919 
to the north up there and then behind it
I<00:01:42.869> see<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.399> other<00:01:44.399> peak<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:47.250> guy<00:01:47.929> right

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
I see that other peak that guy right

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.350 
I see that other peak that guy right
there<00:01:51.350> that'd<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.560> cool<00:01:52.800> if<00:01:53.009> I'm<00:01:53.360> getting

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
there that'd be cool if I'm getting

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.660 
there that'd be cool if I'm getting
within<00:01:54.570> range<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.470> really<00:01:56.100> don't<00:01:56.280> know<00:01:56.429> when<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
within range I really don't know when I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:18.540 
within range I really don't know when I
