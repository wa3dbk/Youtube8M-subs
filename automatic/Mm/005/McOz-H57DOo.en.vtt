we've<00:00:14.469> seen<00:00:14.920> an<00:00:15.930> evolution<00:00:16.930> in<00:00:17.140> the<00:00:17.279> way

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
we've seen an evolution in the way

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.950 
we've seen an evolution in the way
aircraft<00:00:20.140> parts<00:00:20.860> are<00:00:21.070> designed<00:00:21.360> the<00:00:22.360> over<00:00:22.810> the

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
aircraft parts are designed the over the

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.260 
aircraft parts are designed the over the
years<00:00:22.990> they've<00:00:23.590> taken<00:00:23.800> these<00:00:24.130> simple<00:00:24.939> parts

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
years they've taken these simple parts

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.200

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.660 
those features those those work together
in<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.870> way<00:02:53.900> that's<00:02:54.079> sort<00:02:54.829> of<00:02:54.950> amazing<00:02:55.280> we've

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
in a way that's sort of amazing we've

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.020 
in a way that's sort of amazing we've
machined<00:02:55.910> some<00:02:56.450> big<00:02:57.140> complex<00:02:57.920> hard<00:02:58.640> metal

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
machined some big complex hard metal

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.900 
machined some big complex hard metal
parts<00:02:59.450> that<00:03:00.170> they<00:03:00.859> go<00:03:01.069> together<00:03:01.250> into<00:03:01.790> an

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
parts that they go together into an

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.559 
parts that they go together into an
assembly<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.780> what<00:03:03.680> we<00:03:03.829> found<00:03:04.129> is<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:05.090> very

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
assembly and what we found is the very

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.920 
assembly and what we found is the very
first<00:03:06.170> hard<00:03:06.739> metal<00:03:07.220> set<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.269> parts<00:03:08.599> that<00:03:08.810> we

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
first hard metal set of parts that we

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.770 
first hard metal set of parts that we
assembled<00:03:09.470> together<00:03:09.970> where<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.299> tolerances

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
assembled together where the tolerances

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.930 
assembled together where the tolerances
were<00:03:11.900> very<00:03:12.140> close<00:03:12.530> they<00:03:13.190> only<00:03:13.310> used<00:03:13.549> half<00:03:13.910> the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
were very close they only used half the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.920 
were very close they only used half the
tolerances<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:15.440> can<00:03:15.620> do<00:03:15.799> more<00:03:16.190> now<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:17.660> parts

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
tolerances you can do more now the parts

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.839 
tolerances you can do more now the parts
can<00:03:18.049> be<00:03:18.109> much<00:03:18.410> more<00:03:18.799> complex<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.579> can<00:03:19.730> have

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
can be much more complex you can have

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.180 
can be much more complex you can have
deeper<00:03:20.269> pockets<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:21.560> can<00:03:21.709> get<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.010> features

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
deeper pockets you can get the features

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.660 
deeper pockets you can get the features
you<00:03:22.519> never<00:03:22.730> were<00:03:22.849> able<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.120> get<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.569> before<00:03:23.750> and

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
you never were able to get to before and

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.009 
you never were able to get to before and
the<00:03:25.670> cost<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:27.099> much<00:03:28.099> lower<00:03:28.510> it's<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.810> think

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
the cost is much lower it's I think

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.920 
the cost is much lower it's I think
really<00:03:30.769> it's<00:03:31.310> all<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.940> features<00:03:32.359> it's<00:03:32.810> the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
really it's all the features it's the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.970 
really it's all the features it's the
HSK<00:03:33.560> holder<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.870> rigidity<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.769> the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
HSK holder and the rigidity of the

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.870 
HSK holder and the rigidity of the
machine<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:37.639> it's<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.530> Makino<00:03:39.880> advantage

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
machine but it's the Makino advantage

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.629 
machine but it's the Makino advantage
technology<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:42.230> sorta<00:03:42.859> is<00:03:43.010> behind<00:03:43.340> the

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
technology that sorta is behind the

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.659 
technology that sorta is behind the
scenes<00:03:43.880> but<00:03:44.440> that's<00:03:45.440> not<00:03:45.739> visible<00:03:46.130> that's

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
scenes but that's not visible that's

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.390 
scenes but that's not visible that's
really<00:03:47.000> playing<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.419> part<00:03:47.660> in<00:03:47.720> helping<00:03:47.930> us

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
really playing a part in helping us

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.500 
really playing a part in helping us
develop<00:03:49.959> more<00:03:50.959> precise<00:03:51.560> parts<00:03:52.280> than<00:03:53.269> ever

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
develop more precise parts than ever

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.409 
develop more precise parts than ever
before<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:54.290> think<00:03:54.769> what<00:03:55.130> matters<00:03:55.459> most<00:03:55.970> our

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
before I think what matters most our

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.300 
before I think what matters most our
clients<00:03:57.079> is<00:03:58.359> consistency<00:03:59.859> they<00:04:00.859> want<00:04:01.130> a

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
clients is consistency they want a

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.750 
clients is consistency they want a
quality<00:04:01.940> part<00:04:02.180> delivered<00:04:03.169> on<00:04:03.380> time<00:04:03.769> all<00:04:04.400> the

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
quality part delivered on time all the

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.059 
quality part delivered on time all the
time<00:04:04.940> they<00:04:05.450> just<00:04:05.510> they<00:04:06.169> just<00:04:06.200> need<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.889> be<00:04:06.980> able

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
time they just they just need to be able

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.099 
time they just they just need to be able
to<00:04:07.280> count<00:04:07.519> on<00:04:07.669> that<00:04:08.000> with<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:09.109> new<00:04:09.769> t<00:04:10.370> two's

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
to count on that with the new t two's

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.349 
to count on that with the new t two's
that<00:04:12.109> we<00:04:12.349> have<00:04:12.680> in<00:04:13.010> conjunction<00:04:13.790> with<00:04:14.150> the

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
that we have in conjunction with the

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.120 
that we have in conjunction with the
faster<00:04:14.900> system

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
faster system

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.479 
faster system
we'll<00:04:17.030> be<00:04:17.180> able<00:04:17.299> to<00:04:17.419> have<00:04:17.690> single<00:04:18.620> piece<00:04:18.979> flow

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
we'll be able to have single piece flow

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.120 
we'll be able to have single piece flow
of<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.060> most<00:04:20.269> complex<00:04:20.870> parts<00:04:21.410> we<00:04:21.620> intend<00:04:22.039> to

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
of the most complex parts we intend to

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.570 
of the most complex parts we intend to
leave<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.490> parts<00:04:22.789> set<00:04:23.330> up<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:23.810> so<00:04:24.650> when<00:04:25.430> we

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
leave the parts set up and so when we

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.400 
leave the parts set up and so when we
need<00:04:25.729> another<00:04:26.000> part<00:04:26.360> we'll<00:04:26.570> just<00:04:26.810> cycle<00:04:27.260> in

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
need another part we'll just cycle in

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.850 
need another part we'll just cycle in
that<00:04:27.440> pallet<00:04:28.190> run<00:04:28.699> it<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.240> if<00:04:30.080> there's<00:04:30.320> so<00:04:30.740> if

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
that pallet run it and if there's so if

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.610 
that pallet run it and if there's so if
there's<00:04:31.070> ever<00:04:31.310> any<00:04:31.849> sort<00:04:32.719> of<00:04:32.810> mistake

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
there's ever any sort of mistake

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.540 
there's ever any sort of mistake
downstream<00:04:34.340> after<00:04:34.909> the<00:04:35.060> machine

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
downstream after the machine

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.260 
downstream after the machine
we'll<00:04:36.090> be<00:04:36.240> able<00:04:36.389> to<00:04:36.539> recover<00:04:37.020> quickly<00:04:37.910> so<00:04:38.910> and

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
we'll be able to recover quickly so and

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.510 
we'll be able to recover quickly so and
that<00:04:39.750> will<00:04:39.960> mean<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.169> lot<00:04:40.259> to<00:04:40.650> our<00:04:40.680> customers

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
that will mean a lot to our customers

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.089 
that will mean a lot to our customers
because<00:04:41.879> what's<00:04:42.569> most<00:04:42.900> important<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.560> them<00:04:43.740> is

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
because what's most important to them is

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.909 
because what's most important to them is
getting<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.520> quality<00:04:45.030> part<00:04:45.419> on<00:04:45.720> time<00:04:46.319> all<00:04:46.710> the

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
getting a quality part on time all the

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.659 
getting a quality part on time all the
time<00:04:47.159> and<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:48.300> with<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.319> system<00:04:49.770> that<00:04:49.800> we<00:04:50.250> have

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
time and so with the system that we have

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.469 
time and so with the system that we have
it's<00:04:51.509> going<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:52.229> allow<00:04:53.099> us<00:04:53.129> to<00:04:53.520> do<00:04:53.669> that<00:04:53.879> it's<00:04:54.360> a

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
it's going to allow us to do that it's a

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.119 
it's going to allow us to do that it's a
perfect<00:04:54.870> complement<00:04:55.409> to<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.740> rest<00:04:55.979> of

perfect complement to the rest of

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.559 
perfect complement to the rest of
machines<00:04:56.520> we<00:04:56.729> have<00:04:56.759> as<00:04:57.360> well<00:04:57.979> so<00:04:58.979> it's<00:04:59.569> there

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
machines we have as well so it's there

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.710 
machines we have as well so it's there
are<00:05:00.690> these<00:05:00.870> additional<00:05:01.550> benefits<00:05:02.550> beyond<00:05:02.940> say

are these additional benefits beyond say
maximum<00:05:04.199> removal<00:05:04.949> rate<00:05:05.129> there's<00:05:05.819> this

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
maximum removal rate there's this

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.680 
maximum removal rate there's this
confidence<00:05:06.960> that<00:05:07.080> we<00:05:07.530> have<00:05:07.889> as<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.690> supplier
