to<00:02:08.990> be<00:02:09.020> we<00:02:09.259> can<00:02:09.410> do<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.619> by<00:02:09.740> yourself<00:02:09.830> if<00:02:10.130> you

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
to be we can do this by yourself if you

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.920 
to be we can do this by yourself if you
lay<00:02:10.369> down<00:02:10.399> but<00:02:10.910> we<00:02:11.060> wanted<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.300> do<00:02:11.480> it<00:02:11.570> upright

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
lay down but we wanted to do it upright

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.960 
lay down but we wanted to do it upright
so<00:02:12.080> put<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.410> base<00:02:12.590> down<00:02:12.890> on<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.130> floor<00:02:13.370> it's<00:02:13.550> a

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
so put the base down on the floor it's a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.180 
so put the base down on the floor it's a
metal<00:02:14.209> base<00:02:14.390> as<00:02:14.810> Sam<00:02:15.260> sets<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.709> down<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.070> one

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
metal base as Sam sets it down it's one

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.440 
metal base as Sam sets it down it's one
I'm<00:02:16.280> just<00:02:16.490> gonna<00:02:16.670> bring<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:16.970> closer<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:17.360> you

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
I'm just gonna bring the closer so you

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.560 
I'm just gonna bring the closer so you
guys<00:02:17.630> can<00:02:17.840> take<00:02:17.989> a<00:02:18.290> closer<00:02:18.739> look<00:02:19.040> at<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.760> base

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
guys can take a closer look at that base

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.020 
guys can take a closer look at that base
you<00:02:21.020> can<00:02:21.170> see<00:02:21.200> here<00:02:21.680> it's<00:02:21.830> pretty<00:02:22.010> solid<00:02:22.280> also

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
you can see here it's pretty solid also

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.180 
you can see here it's pretty solid also

it's got plexiglass and then for sprouts

00:02:29.600 --> 00:03:18.240 
it's got plexiglass and then for sprouts
we're<00:02:29.810> actually<00:02:30.080> screen<00:02:30.620> or<00:02:30.920> your<00:02:32.440> your<00:02:33.440> TV<00:02:33.890> to

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
outside of the TV after we've had

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.350 
outside of the TV after we've had
everything<00:03:20.800> hooked<00:03:21.040> up<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.460> it's<00:03:21.790> all<00:03:22.000> white

it's got a nice white finish you can see
where<00:03:24.820> there's<00:03:25.030> four<00:03:25.270> sprouts<00:03:25.630> actually<00:03:26.230> go

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
where there's four sprouts actually go

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.550 
where there's four sprouts actually go
up<00:03:26.530> into<00:03:27.060> making<00:03:28.060> sure<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.540> TV<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:28.990> actually

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
up into making sure the TV is actually

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.790 
up into making sure the TV is actually
placed<00:03:30.220> solidly<00:03:31.170> across<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.320> base<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.710> you

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
placed solidly across the base and you

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.610 
placed solidly across the base and you
have<00:03:32.830> your<00:03:33.100> ports<00:03:33.550> at<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.790> back<00:03:34.000> side<00:03:34.620> the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
have your ports at the back side the

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.130 
have your ports at the back side the
power<00:03:36.490> port<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:36.970> actually<00:03:37.120> cables<00:03:37.780> connected

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
power port is actually cables connected

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.990 
power port is actually cables connected
directly<00:03:38.320> to<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.620> TV<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.520> what<00:03:39.700> we<00:03:39.820> have<00:03:39.970> here

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
directly to the TV so what we have here

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.800 
directly to the TV so what we have here
we<00:03:40.330> have<00:03:40.630> three<00:03:41.230> HDMI<00:03:41.440> ports<00:03:42.190> on<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.580> I<00:03:43.180> guess

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
we have three HDMI ports on the I guess

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.720 
we have three HDMI ports on the I guess
from<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.709> back<00:03:44.860> the<00:03:45.040> right-hand<00:03:45.340> side<00:03:45.550> from

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
from the back the right-hand side from

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.230 
from the back the right-hand side from
the<00:03:45.850> front<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.120> left<00:03:46.360> of<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:47.020> TV<00:03:47.410> two<00:03:48.280> USB<00:03:48.790> 2.0

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
the front the left of the TV two USB 2.0

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.050 
the front the left of the TV two USB 2.0
one<00:03:49.420> USB<00:03:49.780> 3.0<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.290> then<00:03:50.739> an<00:03:51.040> auxiliary<00:03:51.550> port

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
one USB 3.0 and then an auxiliary port

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.530 
one USB 3.0 and then an auxiliary port
for<00:03:52.560> audio<00:03:53.560> there<00:03:53.950> they<00:03:54.910> decided<00:03:55.150> go<00:03:55.390> with

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
for audio there they decided go with

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.090 
for audio there they decided go with
three<00:03:55.690> HDMI<00:03:56.110> is<00:03:56.170> not<00:03:56.440> forced<00:03:56.739> so<00:03:56.950> this

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
three HDMI is not forced so this

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.640 
three HDMI is not forced so this
actually<00:03:57.520> has<00:03:57.670> three<00:03:57.940> semi<00:03:58.209> ports<00:03:58.630> if<00:03:59.320> that's

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
actually has three semi ports if that's

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.080 
actually has three semi ports if that's
what<00:03:59.830> something<00:04:00.130> you're<00:04:00.250> looking<00:04:00.610> for<00:04:00.910> and

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
what something you're looking for and

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
like I said you do have three USB ports

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.810 
like I said you do have three USB ports
with<00:04:04.570> more<00:04:04.780> USB<00:04:05.140> 2.0<00:04:05.560> now<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.800> bottom<00:04:06.370> side<00:04:06.610> of

it<00:04:06.970> you<00:04:07.420> also<00:04:07.600> have<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:08.260> LAN<00:04:08.770> and<00:04:09.070> then<00:04:09.520> you<00:04:09.580> have

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
it you also have a LAN and then you have

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.070 
it you also have a LAN and then you have

you<00:04:36.160> how<00:04:36.310> fitting<00:04:36.790> TV<00:04:37.180> is<00:04:37.240> now<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.510> lower<00:04:37.840> base

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
you how fitting TV is now the lower base

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
you how fitting TV is now the lower base
is<00:04:38.290> thicker<00:04:38.560> because<00:04:38.680> it's<00:04:38.890> where<00:04:39.010> them

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
is thicker because it's where them

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.310 
is thicker because it's where them

components but the main screen itself is
really<00:04:41.800> really<00:04:42.729> thin<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.419> can<00:04:43.570> see<00:04:43.600> how<00:04:43.780> fit

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
really really thin you can see how fit

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.890 
really really thin you can see how fit
it<00:04:44.200> is<00:04:44.350> in<00:04:44.560> comparison<00:04:44.860> to<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.370> s6<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.540> think

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
it is in comparison to the s6 so I think

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.050 
it is in comparison to the s6 so I think
a<00:04:47.110> lot<00:04:47.229> of<00:04:47.320> people<00:04:47.560> will<00:04:47.770> like<00:04:48.130> that<00:04:48.190> with<00:04:48.820> this

mean<00:05:20.140> the<00:05:20.229> infinity<00:05:20.979> contrast<00:05:21.460> is<00:05:21.660> fantastic

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
mean the infinity contrast is fantastic

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.630 
mean the infinity contrast is fantastic
so<00:05:23.110> imagine<00:05:23.560> watching<00:05:23.740> shows<00:05:24.220> at<00:05:24.430> night

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
so imagine watching shows at night

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.089 
so imagine watching shows at night
watching<00:05:25.360> shows<00:05:25.750> with<00:05:25.960> darkest<00:05:26.380> scenes<00:05:26.650> you

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
watching shows with darkest scenes you

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.940 
watching shows with darkest scenes you
know<00:05:27.250> or<00:05:27.640> gaming<00:05:28.210> at<00:05:28.479> night

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
know or gaming at night

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.420 
know or gaming at night
and<00:05:29.040> you<00:05:29.300> literally<00:05:30.300> you<00:05:31.080> know<00:05:31.200> the<00:05:31.500> contrast

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
and you literally you know the contrast

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.790 
and you literally you know the contrast
ratio<00:05:32.700> and<00:05:32.730> the<00:05:32.880> infinity<00:05:33.590> contrast<00:05:34.590> ratio

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
ratio and the infinity contrast ratio

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.950 
ratio and the infinity contrast ratio
really<00:05:35.070> goes<00:05:35.460> a<00:05:35.490> long<00:05:35.820> way<00:05:36.030> and<00:05:36.090> I<00:05:36.390> think<00:05:36.630> a<00:05:36.690> lot
