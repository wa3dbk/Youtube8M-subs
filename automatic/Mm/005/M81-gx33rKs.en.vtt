00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:07.389 
hey guys it's mark with Northstar arrow

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:09.640 
hey guys it's mark with Northstar arrow
so<00:00:08.389> I'm<00:00:08.599> at<00:00:08.720> the<00:00:08.870> serious<00:00:09.139> factory<00:00:09.500> here

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
so I'm at the serious factory here

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.020 
so I'm at the serious factory here
waiting<00:00:09.860> on<00:00:09.920> the<00:00:10.010> weather<00:00:10.190> to<00:00:10.309> clear<00:00:10.429> up<00:00:10.700> it's

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
waiting on the weather to clear up it's

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.900 
waiting on the weather to clear up it's
about<00:00:11.650> 3/4<00:00:12.650> of<00:00:12.679> mile<00:00:12.830> right<00:00:13.040> now<00:00:13.190> and<00:00:13.400> a<00:00:13.610> couple

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
about 3/4 of mile right now and a couple

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.820 
about 3/4 of mile right now and a couple
hundred<00:00:14.120> feet<00:00:14.209> overcast<00:00:14.660> and<00:00:15.049> freezing

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
hundred feet overcast and freezing

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.650 
hundred feet overcast and freezing
drizzle<00:00:16.129> so<00:00:16.400> trying<00:00:17.330> to<00:00:17.390> get<00:00:17.480> an<00:00:17.539> airplane

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
drizzle so trying to get an airplane

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.960 
drizzle so trying to get an airplane
with<00:00:17.960> no<00:00:17.990> ice<00:00:18.619> protection<00:00:19.160> to<00:00:19.220> Connecticut<00:00:19.640> so

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
with no ice protection to Connecticut so

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.090 
with no ice protection to Connecticut so
it's<00:00:20.210> uh<00:00:20.300> not<00:00:21.260> working<00:00:21.560> out<00:00:21.620> real<00:00:21.830> well<00:00:21.920> right

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
it's uh not working out real well right

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.080 
it's uh not working out real well right
now<00:00:22.430> but<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:22.940> figured<00:00:23.720> I<00:00:23.780> would<00:00:24.790> tell<00:00:25.790> me<00:00:25.880> jump

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
now but I figured I would tell me jump

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.030 
now but I figured I would tell me jump
in<00:00:26.180> a<00:00:26.240> new<00:00:26.360> plane<00:00:26.690> and<00:00:27.020> show<00:00:27.230> you<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.470> updated

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
in a new plane and show you the updated

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.430 
in a new plane and show you the updated
software<00:00:28.220> for<00:00:28.700> the<00:00:28.790> Cirrus<00:00:29.090> perspective<00:00:29.690> this

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
software for the Cirrus perspective this

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.139 
software for the Cirrus perspective this
is<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.680> software<00:00:31.040> that<00:00:31.100> allows<00:00:31.370> you<00:00:31.400> to<00:00:31.760> build

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
is the software that allows you to build

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.240 
is the software that allows you to build
your<00:00:32.270> own<00:00:32.419> folds<00:00:32.899> or<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.770> autopilot<00:00:34.040> can

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
your own folds or the autopilot can

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.130 
your own folds or the autopilot can
actually<00:00:34.520> float<00:00:34.730> fly<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:35.329> entire<00:00:35.870> holding

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
actually float fly the entire holding

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.220 
actually float fly the entire holding
pattern<00:00:36.440> for<00:00:36.620> random<00:00:37.579> holds<00:00:37.809> put<00:00:38.809> in<00:00:38.899> a<00:00:38.989> flight

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
pattern for random holds put in a flight

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.319 
pattern for random holds put in a flight
from<00:00:39.469> Minneapolis<00:00:40.100> to<00:00:40.249> Duluth<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:41.149> I'm<00:00:41.210> just

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
from Minneapolis to Duluth so I'm just

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:49.189 
from Minneapolis to Duluth so I'm just
going<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.510> type<00:00:41.659> that<00:00:41.839> in

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.250 

and<00:00:49.769> we'll<00:00:49.980> put<00:00:50.129> Duluth<00:00:50.429> in<00:00:50.640> there<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:50.910> well

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.920 

all<00:00:55.260> right<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:56.329> we're<00:00:57.329> gonna<00:00:57.420> say<00:00:57.600> we're<00:00:57.750> doing

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
all right so we're gonna say we're doing

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.479 
all right so we're gonna say we're doing
a<00:00:58.019> flight<00:00:58.260> from<00:00:58.440> Minneapolis<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.890> Duluth<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
a flight from Minneapolis to Duluth and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.950 
a flight from Minneapolis to Duluth and
let's<00:00:59.670> say<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.879> agency<00:01:00.359> wants<00:01:00.600> us<00:01:00.659> to<00:01:00.690> hold

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
let's say that agency wants us to hold

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.999 
let's say that agency wants us to hold
it<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> Duluth<00:01:01.559> vor<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.820> eight<00:01:02.940> zero<00:01:02.969> radial

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
it the Duluth vor one eight zero radial

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.539 
it the Duluth vor one eight zero radial
left-hand<00:01:05.009> turns<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:06.409> one<00:01:07.409> minute<00:01:07.560> legs<00:01:07.890> so

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
left-hand turns and one minute legs so

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.580 
left-hand turns and one minute legs so
we're<00:01:08.640> gonna<00:01:08.729> go<00:01:08.850> ahead<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.090> put<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.590> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
we're gonna go ahead and put that in so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.999 
we're gonna go ahead and put that in so
normally<00:01:11.030> before<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.330> software<00:01:12.890> we<00:01:13.890> would

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
normally before the software we would

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.940 
normally before the software we would
have<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.369> ahead<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:18.110> use<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.289> auto<00:01:19.439> pod<00:01:19.710> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
have to go ahead and use the auto pod to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.320 
have to go ahead and use the auto pod to
fly<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.189> heading<00:01:20.549> mode<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> outbound

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
fly the heading mode and the outbound

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.649 
fly the heading mode and the outbound
and<00:01:21.539> fly<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.440> nav<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.039> inbound<00:01:23.399> and<00:01:23.659> it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and fly the nav on the inbound and it

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.880 
and fly the nav on the inbound and it
doesn't<00:01:24.929> do<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> whole<00:01:25.200> lot<00:01:25.319> to<00:01:25.470> reduce<00:01:25.590> pilot

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
doesn't do a whole lot to reduce pilot

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.770 
doesn't do a whole lot to reduce pilot
workload<00:01:26.149> so<00:01:27.149> if<00:01:27.210> we're<00:01:27.330> trying<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.539> set<00:01:27.690> up

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
workload so if we're trying to set up

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.350 
workload so if we're trying to set up
for<00:01:27.810> another<00:01:28.049> approach<00:01:28.259> check<00:01:28.679> the<00:01:28.830> weather

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
for another approach check the weather

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.399 
for another approach check the weather
you<00:01:30.360> know<00:01:30.450> look<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.780> another<00:01:30.899> good<00:01:31.080> airport

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you know look for another good airport

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.590 
you know look for another good airport
to<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.679> if<00:01:32.130> minimums<00:01:32.580> that<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.789> love<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.509> if

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to go to if minimums that you love or if

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.350 
to go to if minimums that you love or if
the<00:01:33.690> weather's<00:01:33.929> too<00:01:34.049> low<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.530> minimums

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
the weather's too low for the minimums

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.460 
the weather's too low for the minimums
you<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.569> pilot<00:01:36.720> workload<00:01:36.990> really

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
you know the pilot workload really

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.620 
you know the pilot workload really
didn't<00:01:37.679> reduce<00:01:37.830> very<00:01:38.459> much<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.240> what<00:01:39.539> we

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
didn't reduce very much so now what we

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.779 
didn't reduce very much so now what we
can<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.929> is<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.069> the<00:01:41.190> auto<00:01:41.340> pilot<00:01:41.549> we

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
can do is we can have the auto pilot we

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:42.919 
can do is we can have the auto pilot we
keep<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.970> little<00:01:42.119> random<00:01:42.330> hold<00:01:42.539> have<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.810> auto

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
keep a little random hold have the auto

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.279 
keep a little random hold have the auto
pilot<00:01:43.080> fly<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:44.030> what<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.149> essentially<00:01:46.110> figure

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
pilot fly it what we essentially figure

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.649 
pilot fly it what we essentially figure
out<00:01:46.409> what<00:01:46.530> our<00:01:46.560> next<00:01:46.649> game<00:01:47.220> plan<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.670> really

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
out what our next game plan is really

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.809 
out what our next game plan is really
simple<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.289> and<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.549> use<00:01:50.640> any

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
simple to do and you can use any

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.090 
simple to do and you can use any
Waypoint<00:01:51.209> doesn't<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.569> be<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.690> view<00:01:51.869> or

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
Waypoint doesn't have to be a view or

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.630 
Waypoint doesn't have to be a view or
all<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.579> hit<00:01:53.729> menu<00:01:53.969> and<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.520> where

all you do is hit menu and this is where

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.999 
all you do is hit menu and this is where
you<00:01:56.729> do<00:01:56.880> activate<00:01:57.270> leg<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.259> Airways

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
you do activate leg or you do Airways

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.529 
you do activate leg or you do Airways
things<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.579> there's<00:02:00.119> gonna<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.329> two

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
things like that there's gonna be two

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.569 
things like that there's gonna be two
new<00:02:00.689> functions<00:02:00.869> at<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.289> very<00:02:01.439> bottom<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:02.399> is

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
new functions at the very bottom one is

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.010 
new functions at the very bottom one is
hold<00:02:02.789> at<00:02:02.909> Waypoint<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.719> hold<00:02:03.930> at

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
hold at Waypoint and one is hold at

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.319 
hold at Waypoint and one is hold at
present<00:02:04.380> position<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.759> ahold<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.000> present

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
present position so ahold of present

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.639 
present position so ahold of present
positions<00:02:06.689> exactly<00:02:07.140> what<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.320> sounds<00:02:07.619> like

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
positions exactly what it sounds like

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.310 
positions exactly what it sounds like
just<00:02:08.070> builds<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> random<00:02:09.000> hold<00:02:09.209> from<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
just builds a random hold from the

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.810 
just builds a random hold from the
location<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.859> you're<00:02:10.979> at<00:02:11.100> so<00:02:11.640> we're<00:02:11.730> gonna

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
location that you're at so we're gonna

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.220 
location that you're at so we're gonna
do<00:02:11.910> hold<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.239> waypoint<00:02:12.420> because<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.019> want<00:02:13.170> to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
do hold a waypoint because we want to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.949 
do hold a waypoint because we want to
hold<00:02:13.350> it<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.530> Duluth<00:02:13.859> vor<00:02:14.450> I'm<00:02:15.450> hit<00:02:15.690> entered

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
hold it that Duluth vor I'm hit entered

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.750 
hold it that Duluth vor I'm hit entered
so<00:02:16.829> it's<00:02:16.920> gonna<00:02:17.010> bring<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.370> drop-down<00:02:17.579> box

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
so it's gonna bring this drop-down box

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.599 
so it's gonna bring this drop-down box
and<00:02:18.209> allows<00:02:19.079> us<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.350> set<00:02:19.470> our<00:02:19.500> course<00:02:19.829> so<00:02:20.549> I'm

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
and allows us to set our course so I'm

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.039 
and allows us to set our course so I'm
gonna<00:02:20.700> go<00:02:20.790> ahead<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.030> set<00:02:21.570> our<00:02:21.600> course<00:02:21.900> in

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
gonna go ahead and set our course in

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.110 
gonna go ahead and set our course in
here<00:02:22.230> we<00:02:22.350> said<00:02:22.530> we<00:02:22.709> want<00:02:22.859> to<00:02:22.920> do<00:02:23.040> one<00:02:24.030> eight

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
here we said we want to do one eight

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.590 
here we said we want to do one eight
zero<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:27.060> we're<00:02:27.150> gonna<00:02:27.239> hold<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
zero and we're gonna hold on the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.509 
zero and we're gonna hold on the
outbound

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.920 

all<00:02:32.519> right<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.849> one<00:02:33.209> minute<00:02:33.330> legs<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:33.840> we

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
all right and one minute legs so we

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.300 
all right and one minute legs so we
could<00:02:34.049> also<00:02:34.170> change<00:02:34.379> this<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.739> distance<00:02:35.099> if<00:02:35.220> we

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
could also change this to distance if we

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.539 
could also change this to distance if we
wanted<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.579> we'll<00:02:36.420> leave<00:02:36.599> it<00:02:36.689> on<00:02:36.780> time<00:02:37.549> would

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
wanted to we'll leave it on time would

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.360 
wanted to we'll leave it on time would
be<00:02:38.700> left-hand<00:02:39.150> turns<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:40.250> then<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:41.310> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
be left-hand turns and then at the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.130 
be left-hand turns and then at the
bottom<00:02:41.489> allows<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:42.000> put<00:02:42.150> your<00:02:42.299> UTC<00:02:42.750> time<00:02:42.959> in

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
bottom allows you put your UTC time in

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.229 
bottom allows you put your UTC time in
so<00:02:43.319> I'm<00:02:43.379> just<00:02:43.500> going<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.709> say<00:02:43.769> 5z<00:02:47.120> all<00:02:48.120> right

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
so I'm just going to say 5z all right

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.880 
so I'm just going to say 5z all right
now<00:02:48.750> puts<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.140> whole<00:02:49.260> inner<00:02:49.379> flight<00:02:49.560> plan<00:02:49.769> so

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
now puts the whole inner flight plan so

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.319 
now puts the whole inner flight plan so
if<00:02:49.980> we<00:02:50.040> go<00:02:50.159> look<00:02:50.340> at<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.489> map<00:02:50.700> here<00:02:53.209> you<00:02:54.209> can

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
if we go look at the map here you can

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.539 
if we go look at the map here you can
see<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.629> the<00:02:54.810> hold<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.349> now<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.370> flight

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
see that the hold is now in the flight

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.979 
see that the hold is now in the flight
plan<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.940> autopilot<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.420> fly<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.690> holding

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
plan the autopilot can fly the holding

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.470 
plan the autopilot can fly the holding
pattern<00:02:58.849> just<00:02:59.849> like<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.090> would<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.299> we<00:03:00.359> were

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
pattern just like it would if we were

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.479 
pattern just like it would if we were
doing<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.750> missed<00:03:00.930> approach<00:03:01.049> so<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.159> makes<00:03:02.340> it

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
doing a missed approach so it makes it

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.360 
doing a missed approach so it makes it
really<00:03:02.819> helpful<00:03:03.769> reduces<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.859> workload<00:03:04.980> it's

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
really helpful reduces the workload it's

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.220 
really helpful reduces the workload it's
just<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.579> fantastic<00:03:05.909> thing<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.420> do<00:03:06.569> you<00:03:07.079> can

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
just a fantastic thing to do you can

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.930 
just a fantastic thing to do you can
also<00:03:07.379> build<00:03:07.680> user-defined<00:03:08.400> waypoints<00:03:08.849> and

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
also build user-defined waypoints and

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.199 
also build user-defined waypoints and
utilize<00:03:09.299> those<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.750> do<00:03:10.170> your<00:03:10.290> hold<00:03:10.470> off<00:03:10.650> oh<00:03:11.209> so

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
utilize those to do your hold off oh so

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.910 
utilize those to do your hold off oh so
gives<00:03:12.389> you<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.480> lot<00:03:12.629> of<00:03:12.750> flexibility<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.530> know

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
gives you a lot of flexibility you know

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.289 
gives you a lot of flexibility you know
even<00:03:14.099> if<00:03:14.190> you're<00:03:14.310> via<00:03:14.489> far<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.120> want

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
even if you're via far and you just want

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.629 
even if you're via far and you just want
the<00:03:15.359> autopilot<00:03:15.659> to<00:03:16.069> maintain<00:03:17.069> an<00:03:17.190> area<00:03:17.430> while

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
the autopilot to maintain an area while

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.729 
the autopilot to maintain an area while
you're<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.450> know<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.810> mean<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.560> could<00:03:19.680> be

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
you're you know I mean you could be

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:20.780 
you're you know I mean you could be
looking<00:03:19.859> at<00:03:20.010> some<00:03:20.159> on<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.340> ground<00:03:20.549> there's<00:03:20.760> a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
looking at some on the ground there's a

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.460 
looking at some on the ground there's a
lot<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.090> different<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:21.720> know<00:03:21.810> functionality

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
lot of different you know functionality

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.720 
lot of different you know functionality
different<00:03:22.889> things<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.159> could<00:03:23.250> use<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.519> for

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
different things you could use it for

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.300 
different things you could use it for
that<00:03:24.109> it<00:03:25.109> makes<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.440> such<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.769> good<00:03:25.950> thing<00:03:26.129> but
