and egg white an apple is one it

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.240 
and egg white an apple is one it

problem<00:00:23.699> with<00:00:23.850> these<00:00:23.939> illustrations<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.930> that

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
problem with these illustrations is that

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.769 
problem with these illustrations is that
if<00:00:25.320> applied<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.740> God<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.519> suggests<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.539> there

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
if applied to God it suggests that there

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.900 
if applied to God it suggests that there
would<00:00:27.930> be<00:00:27.960> parts<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.740> God<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.670> each

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
would be parts to God and that each

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.950 
would be parts to God and that each
person<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> Trinity<00:00:31.080> wasn't<00:00:31.830> fully<00:00:32.070> God

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
person in the Trinity wasn't fully God

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.110 
person in the Trinity wasn't fully God
another<00:00:33.960> common<00:00:34.469> example<00:00:34.590> uses<00:00:35.430> water<00:00:35.700> ice

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
another common example uses water ice

another common example uses water ice
and<00:00:36.570> vapor<00:00:36.870> since<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:37.770> are<00:00:37.890> three<00:00:38.219> forms<00:00:38.640> of

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and vapor since they are three forms of

h2o yet this too falls short since a

every<00:00:49.140> illustration<00:00:49.920> breaks<00:00:50.219> down<00:00:50.460> at<00:00:50.730> some

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
every illustration breaks down at some

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.270 
every illustration breaks down at some
point<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> Trinity<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.770> simply

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
point because the Trinity is simply

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.600 
point because the Trinity is simply
unlike<00:00:53.699> anything<00:00:54.059> humans<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:55.489> that<00:00:56.489> the

unlike anything humans know that the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.660 
unlike anything humans know that the
Father<00:00:56.940> Son<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.780> Holy<00:00:58.140> Spirit<00:00:58.320> are<00:00:58.920> each<00:00:59.340> God

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
Father Son and Holy Spirit are each God

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.130 
Father Son and Holy Spirit are each God
it<00:01:00.210> God<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:01.109> seems<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.649> defy<00:01:02.100> logic

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.160 

one<00:01:05.770> plus<00:01:06.040> one<00:01:06.310> plus<00:01:06.370> one<00:01:06.729> can't<00:01:07.510> equal<00:01:07.930> one

one plus one plus one can't equal one

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.070 
one plus one plus one can't equal one
canid<00:01:08.650> so<00:01:09.310> some<00:01:09.610> have<00:01:09.790> tried<00:01:10.080> multiplication

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
canid so some have tried multiplication

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.530 
canid so some have tried multiplication
stating<00:01:11.800> one<00:01:12.130> times<00:01:12.430> one<00:01:12.670> times<00:01:13.000> one<00:01:13.090> equals

stating one times one times one equals

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.190 
stating one times one times one equals
one

one

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.830

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.750 
but once we plug in the real data this
