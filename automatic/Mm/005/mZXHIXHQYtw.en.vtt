times before I won my first year that I

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.959 
times before I won my first year that I

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
went actually my first year I competed

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.400

in<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.329> Miss<00:00:51.360> America<00:00:51.480> system<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.140> didn't<00:00:52.289> even

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
in the Miss America system I didn't even

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.130 
in the Miss America system I didn't even
make<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> miss<00:00:52.920> Arkansas<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.820> think<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.690> would

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
make it to miss Arkansas I think I would

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.660 
make it to miss Arkansas I think I would
have<00:00:55.260> had<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.440> any<00:00:55.770> other<00:00:55.800> way<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.129> that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
have had it any other way because that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.150 
have had it any other way because that
third<00:00:56.879> year<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.390> was<00:00:57.899> more<00:00:58.050> prepared<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.770> knew

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
third year I was more prepared I knew

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.490 
third year I was more prepared I knew
what<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> was<00:00:59.550> doing<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.239> felt<00:01:00.780> confident<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
what I was doing I felt confident that

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.869 
what I was doing I felt confident that
no<00:01:01.829> matter<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> outcome

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
no matter what the outcome

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.479 
no matter what the outcome
I<00:01:03.149> knew<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.930> gave<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> my<00:01:04.409> all<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.159> think

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
I knew I gave it my all and I think

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.120 
I knew I gave it my all and I think
until<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.939> get<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.450> point<00:01:06.950> it's<00:01:07.950> just

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
until you get to that point it's just

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.000 
until you get to that point it's just
not<00:01:08.549> even<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.240> worth<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
not even really worth it if when you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.230 
not even really worth it if when you
know<00:01:11.220> who<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.430> are<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.939> you're<00:01:12.030> ready<00:01:12.180> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
know who you are and you're ready to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.179

so much better

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.539 
so much better
so<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.960> competed<00:01:16.470> four<00:01:16.740> times<00:01:16.979> before<00:01:17.250> winning

really<00:02:39.510> think<00:02:39.750> it's<00:02:39.900> between<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.620> Mary

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
really think it's between you and Mary

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.430 
really think it's between you and Mary
Stewart<00:02:41.510> but<00:02:42.510> Mary<00:02:42.720> Stewart's<00:02:43.080> really<00:02:43.320> more

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
Stewart but Mary Stewart's really more

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.080 
Stewart but Mary Stewart's really more
talented<00:02:43.950> than<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.250> are<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.580> think<00:02:44.670> she's

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
talented than you are so I think she's

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.920 
talented than you are so I think she's
gonna<00:02:45.270> win<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:46.530> she<00:02:47.100> did<00:02:47.360> by<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.390> time<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.840> I

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
gonna win and she did by the time that I

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.510 
gonna win and she did by the time that I
won<00:02:49.140> Miss<00:02:49.290> Arkansas<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.770> think<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.160> was<00:02:50.310> really

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
won Miss Arkansas I think I was really

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.699 
won Miss Arkansas I think I was really
ready<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.570> I<00:02:51.600> think<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.959> point<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.680> just

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
ready so I think the point is that just

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.470 
ready so I think the point is that just
like<00:02:53.160> with<00:02:53.310> everything<00:02:53.700> maybe<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.150> don't<00:02:54.330> get

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
like with everything maybe you don't get

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.270 
like with everything maybe you don't get
it<00:02:54.600> -<00:02:54.720> first<00:02:54.930> time<00:02:55.140> in<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.410> second<00:02:55.770> time<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.190> you

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.370 
it - first time in a second time and you
may<00:02:56.790> not<00:02:56.970> even<00:02:57.030> get<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.600> your<00:02:57.750> third<00:02:57.989> or<00:02:58.170> fourth

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
may not even get it your third or fourth

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.180 
may not even get it your third or fourth
time<00:02:58.910> it's<00:02:59.910> not<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.720> winning<00:03:01.170> it's<00:03:01.830> in<00:03:02.070> the

time it's not in the winning it's in the

I<00:05:37.719> had<00:05:37.930> that<00:05:38.199> desire<00:05:38.710> and<00:05:39.129> that<00:05:39.550> determination

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
I had that desire and that determination

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.610 
I had that desire and that determination
I<00:05:40.449> think<00:05:40.659> that's<00:05:40.779> what<00:05:40.930> got<00:05:41.080> me<00:05:41.110> through<00:05:41.439> all

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
I think that's what got me through all

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.010 
I think that's what got me through all
six<00:05:41.919> years<00:05:42.219> and<00:05:42.460> you<00:05:42.909> have<00:05:43.029> to<00:05:43.150> realize<00:05:43.479> 2/3<00:05:43.990> of

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
six years and you have to realize 2/3 of

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.989 
six years and you have to realize 2/3 of
those<00:05:44.229> years<00:05:44.529> I<00:05:44.770> was<00:05:44.800> second<00:05:45.339> runner-up

00:05:45.989 --> 00:05:45.999 
those years I was second runner-up

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:50.219 
those years I was second runner-up
so<00:05:46.419> working<00:05:47.349> hard<00:05:47.800> and<00:05:48.159> the<00:05:48.819> time<00:05:49.629> I<00:05:49.659> spent<00:05:50.110> to

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
so working hard and the time I spent to

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.110 
so working hard and the time I spent to
achieve<00:05:50.529> my<00:05:50.740> goal<00:05:50.979> it<00:05:51.400> was<00:05:51.520> worth<00:05:51.759> every

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
achieve my goal it was worth every

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.360 
achieve my goal it was worth every
minute<00:05:52.270> every<00:05:52.569> every<00:05:53.529> workout<00:05:54.009> every

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
minute every every workout every

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.480 
minute every every workout every
sacrifice<00:05:54.639> every<00:05:55.539> every<00:05:56.319> benefit<00:05:56.800> is<00:05:57.009> worth

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
sacrifice every every benefit is worth

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.519 
sacrifice every every benefit is worth
it<00:05:57.729> to<00:05:58.059> be<00:05:58.180> Miss<00:05:58.360> Arkansas<00:05:58.839> and<00:05:59.020> to<00:05:59.110> have<00:05:59.319> this

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:03.869 
it to be Miss Arkansas and to have this
service<00:05:59.800> opportunity<00:06:00.580> I<00:06:02.370> was<00:06:03.370> a<00:06:03.430> trailblazer

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
service opportunity I was a trailblazer

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:06.389 
service opportunity I was a trailblazer
back<00:06:04.629> in<00:06:04.809> the<00:06:04.899> day<00:06:05.050> it<00:06:05.259> did<00:06:05.469> take<00:06:05.770> me<00:06:05.800> four

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:06.399 
back in the day it did take me four

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:09.149 
back in the day it did take me four
attempts<00:06:07.149> before<00:06:07.779> I<00:06:07.990> won<00:06:08.199> Miss<00:06:08.379> Arkansas<00:06:08.919> and

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
attempts before I won Miss Arkansas and

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:11.850 
attempts before I won Miss Arkansas and
that<00:06:09.279> was<00:06:09.430> before<00:06:09.849> it<00:06:10.360> was<00:06:10.499> habitual<00:06:11.499> for<00:06:11.680> that

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
that was before it was habitual for that

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.100 
that was before it was habitual for that
to<00:06:12.099> take<00:06:12.339> place<00:06:12.370> ever<00:06:12.909> and<00:06:12.999> remember<00:06:13.509> also<00:06:13.689> as

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
to take place ever and remember also as

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.350 
to take place ever and remember also as
Miss<00:06:14.349> Arkansas<00:06:14.830> all<00:06:15.309> the<00:06:15.669> children<00:06:16.059> that<00:06:16.240> we

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
Miss Arkansas all the children that we

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.269 
Miss Arkansas all the children that we
speak<00:06:16.539> to<00:06:16.749> the<00:06:16.870> students<00:06:17.229> across<00:06:17.409> Arkansas<00:06:18.039> a

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:18.279 
speak to the students across Arkansas a

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.909 
speak to the students across Arkansas a
few<00:06:18.430> of<00:06:18.789> them<00:06:18.969> can<00:06:19.180> relate<00:06:19.479> to<00:06:19.689> winning<00:06:20.020> but<00:06:20.860> a

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
few of them can relate to winning but a

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.309 
few of them can relate to winning but a
whole<00:06:21.339> lot<00:06:21.849> more<00:06:22.059> can<00:06:22.330> relate<00:06:22.599> to<00:06:22.779> losing<00:06:23.139> and

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 
whole lot more can relate to losing and

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.110 
whole lot more can relate to losing and
I<00:06:23.680> think<00:06:23.889> we've<00:06:24.009> got<00:06:24.189> a<00:06:24.219> lot<00:06:24.399> to<00:06:24.610> share<00:06:24.849> when<00:06:25.029> it

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
I think we've got a lot to share when it

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.999 
I think we've got a lot to share when it
took<00:06:25.270> us<00:06:25.419> more<00:06:25.599> than<00:06:25.719> one<00:06:25.899> effort<00:06:26.259> to<00:06:26.740> achieve

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009 
took us more than one effort to achieve

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.870 
took us more than one effort to achieve
the<00:06:27.370> crown<00:06:27.610> and<00:06:27.819> title<00:06:28.089> of<00:06:28.180> Miss<00:06:28.389> Arkansas
