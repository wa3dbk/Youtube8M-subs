if you say novembri putting them right
in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.560> middle<00:01:52.590> seems<00:01:53.159> pretty<00:01:53.340> obvious

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
in the middle seems pretty obvious

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.170 
in the middle seems pretty obvious
so<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.570> rumor<00:01:55.049> about<00:01:55.280> HTC<00:01:56.280> Chrome<00:01:56.610> OS<00:01:56.790> based

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
so this rumor about HTC Chrome OS based

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.510 
so this rumor about HTC Chrome OS based
tablet<00:01:57.659> doesn't<00:01:57.899> tell<00:01:58.079> us<00:01:58.110> anything<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.860> know

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
tablet doesn't tell us anything you know

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.249 
tablet doesn't tell us anything you know
that<00:01:59.700> we<00:01:59.759> did<00:01:59.880> not<00:01:59.969> know<00:02:00.390> other<00:02:00.810> than<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> fact

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that we did not know other than the fact

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.109 
that we did not know other than the fact
that<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.829> might<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.340> running<00:02:02.460> Chrome<00:02:02.729> OS<00:02:02.850> I

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
that it might be running Chrome OS I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.569 
that it might be running Chrome OS I
suppose<00:02:03.450> which<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.530> kind<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.860> unusual<00:02:05.040> because

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
suppose which is kind of unusual because

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.310 
suppose which is kind of unusual because
Chrome<00:02:05.820> OS<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.270> obviously<00:02:06.780> Google<00:02:07.020> but

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
Chrome OS is obviously Google but

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.469 
Chrome OS is obviously Google but
designed<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.710> work<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.069> low-end

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
notebooks and netbooks it's not really

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.870 
notebooks and netbooks it's not really
have<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.060> tablet<00:02:14.450> II<00:02:14.720> kind<00:02:15.020> of<00:02:15.110> based<00:02:15.530> LS<00:02:16.040> not

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
have a tablet II kind of based LS not

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.580 
have a tablet II kind of based LS not

first and foremost based around

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.220 
first and foremost based around
multi-touch<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:20.000> it's<00:02:20.360> kind<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.840> like<00:02:21.050> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
multi-touch so it's kind of like the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.500 
multi-touch so it's kind of like the

1080p media player how must be designed

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.520 
1080p media player how must be designed
for<00:02:37.670> under<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.420> television<00:02:38.600> use

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
for under the television use

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.910 
for under the television use
it's<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.830> MP<00:02:40.220> 5:01<00:02:40.940> what<00:02:41.840> makes<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.620> thing

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
it's the MP 5:01 what makes this thing

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.880 
it's the MP 5:01 what makes this thing
unique<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.730> its<00:02:44.510> form<00:02:44.780> factor<00:02:45.020> this<00:02:45.530> thing<00:02:45.769> is

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
unique is its form factor this thing is

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.580 
unique is its form factor this thing is
so<00:02:46.190> tiny<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.269> can't<00:02:47.630> be<00:02:47.810> much<00:02:47.989> bigger<00:02:48.260> than

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
so tiny it can't be much bigger than

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.880 
so tiny it can't be much bigger than
this<00:02:49.340> mouse<00:02:49.580> I<00:02:50.380> think<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.470> get<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.620> fair<00:02:51.860> idea

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
this mouse I think you get a fair idea

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.830 
this mouse I think you get a fair idea
of<00:02:52.370> just<00:02:52.580> how<00:02:52.670> small<00:02:52.910> this<00:02:53.090> thing<00:02:53.300> is<00:02:53.480> when<00:02:53.720> you

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
of just how small this thing is when you

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.740 
of just how small this thing is when you
look<00:02:54.110> at<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.800> USB<00:02:55.310> 2<00:02:55.610> port<00:02:55.640> on<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.269> SD<00:02:56.720> card

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
look at the USB 2 port on the SD card

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.830 
look at the USB 2 port on the SD card
slot<00:02:57.290> in<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.590> front<00:02:58.030> then<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.060> can<00:02:59.360> kind<00:02:59.660> of

slot in the front then you can kind of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.020 
slot in the front then you can kind of
gauge<00:03:00.470> exactly<00:03:01.250> what<00:03:01.430> you're<00:03:01.640> dealing<00:03:01.819> with

gauge exactly what you're dealing with

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.120 
gauge exactly what you're dealing with

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
as well

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.099 
as well
what<00:03:54.829> is<00:03:54.950> also<00:03:55.280> absent<00:03:55.730> here<00:03:55.970> is<00:03:56.180> Ethernet<00:03:56.810> add

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
what is also absent here is Ethernet add

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.259 
what is also absent here is Ethernet add
Wi-Fi<00:03:57.530> this<00:03:57.859> basically<00:03:58.340> means<00:03:58.489> no<00:03:58.579> networking

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
Wi-Fi this basically means no networking

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.720 
Wi-Fi this basically means no networking
so<00:03:59.450> you<00:03:59.540> can't<00:03:59.780> use<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:00.170> as<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.350> nas<00:04:00.590> box<00:04:00.950> which

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
so you can't use this as a nas box which

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.949 
so you can't use this as a nas box which
is<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:02.090> suppose<00:04:02.150> for<00:04:02.540> some<00:04:02.630> people<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:02.900> little

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
is I suppose for some people a little

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.120 
is I suppose for some people a little
bit<00:04:03.140> disappointing<00:04:03.680> because<00:04:03.739> they<00:04:03.920> want<00:04:04.100> to

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
bit disappointing because they want to

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.289 
bit disappointing because they want to
be<00:04:04.220> able<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.400> use<00:04:04.549> their<00:04:04.700> media<00:04:04.880> center<00:04:05.150> also

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
be able to use their media center also

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.170 
be able to use their media center also

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.789 
with a nice box on their network but I
can't<00:04:08.690> really<00:04:08.870> complain<00:04:09.049> too<00:04:09.320> much<00:04:09.350> it's<00:04:09.739> very

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
all I think a pretty good deal and also

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.060 
all I think a pretty good deal and also
as<00:04:18.260> a<00:04:18.440> side<00:04:18.680> note<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.930> future<00:04:21.260> of<00:04:21.349> Apple<00:04:21.680> TV

TV<00:04:28.819> to<00:04:28.970> ITV<00:04:29.479> which<00:04:29.689> i<00:04:29.780> think<00:04:29.960> is<00:04:30.050> completely

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
TV to ITV which i think is completely

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.679 
TV to ITV which i think is completely
offensive<00:04:30.830> against<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.400> British<00:04:32.210> television

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:32.689 
offensive against the British television

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.740 
offensive against the British television
network<00:04:32.990> but<00:04:33.919> the<00:04:34.009> fact<00:04:34.280> is<00:04:34.460> they<00:04:34.970> they<00:04:35.539> want

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
network but the fact is they they want

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.629 
network but the fact is they they want
to<00:04:35.870> decrease<00:04:36.169> its<00:04:36.379> size<00:04:36.409> down<00:04:37.099> to<00:04:37.280> something

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
to decrease its size down to something

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.490 
to decrease its size down to something
like<00:04:37.969> the<00:04:38.150> size<00:04:38.360> of<00:04:38.479> an<00:04:38.599> iPhone<00:04:38.719> but

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
like the size of an iPhone but

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.929 
like the size of an iPhone but
