00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
that and even these mushroom blocks work

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.810 
that and even these mushroom blocks work
is<00:04:31.720> kind<00:04:32.140> of<00:04:32.260> cool<00:04:32.440> so<00:04:33.070> that's<00:04:33.250> a<00:04:33.340> randomized

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
is kind of cool so that's a randomized

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.340 
is kind of cool so that's a randomized
image<00:04:34.180> oh<00:04:34.390> there<00:04:35.230> go<00:04:35.470> lighter<00:04:35.770> purposes<00:04:37.350> so

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
image oh there go lighter purposes so

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.140

this is a really cool little creative
mod<00:04:40.480> that<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:40.780> rather<00:04:41.080> like<00:04:41.350> ENIAC<00:04:41.860> of<00:04:42.070> course

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
mod that I rather like ENIAC of course

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.830 
mod that I rather like ENIAC of course
you<00:04:42.790> can<00:04:42.910> have<00:04:43.000> many<00:04:43.360> different<00:04:43.510> materials

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
you can have many different materials

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.830 
you can have many different materials
and<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:45.580> think<00:04:45.760> I<00:04:45.820> might<00:04:46.030> use<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:46.480> from<00:04:46.660> what

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
and I think I might use this from what

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.200 
and I think I might use this from what
my<00:04:47.320> next<00:04:47.710> upcoming<00:04:47.920> series<00:04:48.610> and<00:04:48.820> have<00:04:48.970> like
