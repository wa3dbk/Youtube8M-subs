many videos on this I'm sure there's a
bunch<00:02:11.340> out<00:02:11.430> there<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> ones<00:02:11.910> I've<00:02:12.060> watched

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
bunch out there the ones I've watched

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.350 
bunch out there the ones I've watched
I<00:02:13.250> haven't<00:02:13.610> seen<00:02:13.730> anyone<00:02:13.940> mentioned<00:02:14.300> that

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
I haven't seen anyone mentioned that

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.020 
I haven't seen anyone mentioned that
before<00:02:14.480> although<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.500> heard<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.490> couple<00:02:16.880> people

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
before although I heard a couple people

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.760 
before although I heard a couple people
mentioned<00:02:17.630> they'll<00:02:17.750> be<00:02:18.020> careful<00:02:18.440> they'll

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
mentioned they'll be careful they'll

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.490 
mentioned they'll be careful they'll
mail<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.220> et<00:02:19.340> cetera<00:02:19.490> et<00:02:19.610> cetera<00:02:19.820> so<00:02:20.320> I<00:02:21.320> just

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
mail to et cetera et cetera so I just

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.950 
mail to et cetera et cetera so I just
thought<00:02:21.590> I'd<00:02:21.770> do<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.550> quick<00:02:22.640> show<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.390> let<00:02:23.870> you

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
thought I'd do a quick show and let you

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.570 
thought I'd do a quick show and let you
know<00:02:24.080> that<00:02:24.110> that's<00:02:24.380> my<00:02:24.680> quick<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.430> easy

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
know that that's my quick and easy

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.580 
know that that's my quick and easy
solution<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.600> has<00:02:26.960> just<00:02:27.200> popped<00:02:27.350> them

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
solution to that has just popped them

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.820 
solution to that has just popped them
off<00:02:27.710> fairly<00:02:28.010> gently<00:02:29.200> now<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.350> course<00:02:30.590> if<00:02:30.740> you

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
off fairly gently now of course if you

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.780 
off fairly gently now of course if you
do<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.160> lot

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
do this a lot

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.820 
do this a lot
they<00:02:32.030> are<00:02:32.150> little<00:02:32.390> plastic<00:02:32.570> tabs<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.530> these

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
they are little plastic tabs and these

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.590 
they are little plastic tabs and these
little<00:02:34.010> things<00:02:34.280> have<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.610> tendency<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:35.420> break

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
little things have a tendency to break

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.140 
little things have a tendency to break
probably<00:02:36.200> fairly<00:02:36.620> easily<00:02:36.830> these<00:02:37.610> seem<00:02:37.850> fairly

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
probably fairly easily these seem fairly

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.300 
probably fairly easily these seem fairly
robust<00:02:38.740> but<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:39.770> wouldn't<00:02:40.070> count<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.460> so

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
robust but I wouldn't count on that so

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.260 
robust but I wouldn't count on that so
whether<00:02:43.310> or<00:02:43.370> not<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.610> take<00:02:43.640> them<00:02:43.940> off<00:02:44.060> is<00:02:44.240> up

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
whether or not you take them off is up

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.940 
whether or not you take them off is up
to<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.630> mean<00:02:44.960> if<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.530> can<00:02:45.680> just<00:02:45.710> be

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
to you I mean if you can just be

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.550 
to you I mean if you can just be
cautious<00:02:46.160> with<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.580> fine<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.440> personally<00:02:48.440> I'd

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
cautious with it fine but personally I'd

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.140 
cautious with it fine but personally I'd
rather<00:02:48.770> be<00:02:49.040> able<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.310> use<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.910> way<00:02:50.030> it

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
rather be able to use this the way it

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.570 
rather be able to use this the way it
was<00:02:50.240> intended<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.920> want<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.010> say<00:02:52.160> it's<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.370> bit<00:02:52.460> of

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
was intended I want to say it's a bit of

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.410 
was intended I want to say it's a bit of
a<00:02:52.640> design<00:02:52.940> flaw<00:02:54.640> unless<00:02:55.640> they<00:02:55.850> design<00:02:56.210> these

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
a design flaw unless they design these

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.720 
a design flaw unless they design these
in<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:57.500> slightly<00:02:57.770> different<00:02:57.890> way<00:02:58.280> where<00:02:58.610> you

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
in a slightly different way where you

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.070 
in a slightly different way where you
wouldn't<00:02:58.910> have<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.330> worry<00:02:59.510> about<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.870> darn

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
wouldn't have to worry about the darn

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.930 
wouldn't have to worry about the darn
things<00:03:00.350> these<00:03:01.100> little<00:03:01.310> tabs<00:03:01.490> break<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:01.880> I'm

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
things these little tabs break and I'm

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.280 
things these little tabs break and I'm
not<00:03:02.090> saying<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.450> these<00:03:02.570> tabs<00:03:02.810> are<00:03:03.020> going<00:03:03.050> to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
not saying that these tabs are going to

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.350 
not saying that these tabs are going to
break<00:03:03.530> they<00:03:04.340> haven't<00:03:04.520> on<00:03:04.760> me<00:03:04.880> yet<00:03:05.090> they<00:03:05.210> don't

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
break they haven't on me yet they don't

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.020 
break they haven't on me yet they don't
even<00:03:05.420> look<00:03:05.600> bent<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:06.080> any<00:03:06.140> way<00:03:06.290> but<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.640> always

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
even look bent in any way but I always

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.760 
even look bent in any way but I always
worry<00:03:08.330> about<00:03:08.390> plastic<00:03:08.990> because<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.620> can

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
worry about plastic because you can

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.740 
worry about plastic because you can
never<00:03:09.950> tell<00:03:10.190> but<00:03:10.460> so<00:03:11.000> far<00:03:11.180> they<00:03:11.330> seem<00:03:11.540> fairly

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
never tell but so far they seem fairly

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.090 
never tell but so far they seem fairly
robust<00:03:12.520> I've<00:03:13.520> taken<00:03:13.760> them<00:03:13.910> on<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.210> off<00:03:14.330> on<00:03:15.100> and

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
robust I've taken them on and off on and

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.770 
robust I've taken them on and off on and
off<00:03:16.160> being<00:03:16.490> one<00:03:16.670> time<00:03:16.910> probably<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.450> dozen

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
off being one time probably a dozen

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.890 
off being one time probably a dozen
times<00:03:18.760> around<00:03:19.760> there<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:21.200> far<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:21.560> good<00:03:21.739> and

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
times around there so so far so good and

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.150 
times around there so so far so good and
just<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.989> simple<00:03:24.170> pot<00:03:24.500> ban<00:03:24.770> I<00:03:24.800> mean<00:03:25.010> there's

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
just a simple pot ban I mean there's

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.699 
just a simple pot ban I mean there's
there's<00:03:25.640> nothing<00:03:25.910> much<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.270> I<00:03:26.709> guess

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
there's nothing much to it I guess

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.650 
there's nothing much to it I guess
that's<00:03:27.920> got<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.070> little<00:03:28.130> Bowl<00:03:28.400> little<00:03:28.700> dish<00:03:28.880> you

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
that's got a little Bowl little dish you

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.290 
that's got a little Bowl little dish you
could<00:03:29.780> always<00:03:29.900> use<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.680> boil<00:03:31.670> water<00:03:31.880> into

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
could always use this to boil water into

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.490 
could always use this to boil water into
pour<00:03:32.600> into<00:03:32.750> this<00:03:32.930> if<00:03:33.140> you're<00:03:33.260> without<00:03:33.440> a

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
pour into this if you're without a

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.640 
pour into this if you're without a
container<00:03:33.920> so<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.820> guess<00:03:35.030> it's<00:03:35.180> kind<00:03:35.360> of<00:03:35.390> a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
container so I guess it's kind of a

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.970 
container so I guess it's kind of a
piece<00:03:36.650> of<00:03:36.800> gear<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:36.950> lends<00:03:37.760> itself<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.150> that

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
piece of gear that lends itself to that

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.380 
piece of gear that lends itself to that
other<00:03:39.980> than<00:03:40.100> that<00:03:40.340> guys<00:03:40.580> that's<00:03:40.910> about<00:03:41.090> it

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
other than that guys that's about it

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.570 
other than that guys that's about it
pop<00:03:41.570> clips<00:03:41.840> back<00:03:42.019> on<00:03:42.230> you're<00:03:42.440> good<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.680> go<00:03:42.709> I'll

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
pop clips back on you're good to go I'll

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.520 
pop clips back on you're good to go I'll
do<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.090> full<00:03:44.390> review<00:03:44.630> about<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:45.200> little<00:03:45.440> bit

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
do a full review about a little bit

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.120 
do a full review about a little bit
later<00:03:45.730> but<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:47.030> just<00:03:47.209> wanted<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.510> show<00:03:47.660> that

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
later but I just wanted to show that

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.259 
later but I just wanted to show that
simple<00:03:49.130> solution<00:03:49.519> and<00:03:49.760> just<00:03:49.940> wanted<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.180> give

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
simple solution and just wanted to give

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.030 
simple solution and just wanted to give
you<00:03:50.300> a<00:03:50.390> quick<00:03:50.540> look<00:03:50.720> at<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.900> billy-bob<00:03:51.110> all

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
you a quick look at the billy-bob all
