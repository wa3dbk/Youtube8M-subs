with<00:01:57.409> short<00:01:58.409> natural<00:01:58.680> hair<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.520> when

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
with short natural hair because when

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.870 
with short natural hair because when
you're<00:01:59.969> trying<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> part<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.880> starts

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
you're trying to part like it all starts

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.649 
you're trying to part like it all starts
you<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:03.210> falling<00:02:03.570> back<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> other

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
you know falling back to the other

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.989 
you know falling back to the other
so<00:02:05.020> it<00:02:05.560> takes<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:05.950> little<00:02:06.039> bit<00:02:06.249> as<00:02:06.429> far<00:02:06.670> as<00:02:06.819> that

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
so it takes a little bit as far as that

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.509
