00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
the scabby parts start to heal up and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.779 
the scabby parts start to heal up and
I'll<00:00:20.910> start<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.330> massage<00:00:21.680> my<00:00:22.680> arms<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.550> this

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
at least twice a day and they seem to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.359 
at least twice a day and they seem to
think<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.449> it's<00:00:27.900> not<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.410> much<00:00:28.470> exactly<00:00:29.160> what

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
think that it's not so much exactly what

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.919 
think that it's not so much exactly what
you're<00:00:29.670> putting<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.390> as<00:00:30.539> long<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:30.840> you're

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.200 
you're putting on it as long as you're
teaching<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.410> moisturised<00:00:31.980> but<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:32.969> how

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
teaching of moisturised but it's how

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.080 
teaching of moisturised but it's how
often<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.020> how<00:00:34.079> well<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.680> massage<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.160> that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
often and how well you massage it that

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.110 
often and how well you massage it that
will<00:00:36.300> make<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.630> difference<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:37.370> how<00:00:38.370> well<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
will make the difference in how well it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.600

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
now I'm taking two capsules daily of 500

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.580 
now I'm taking two capsules daily of 500
milligrams

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
milligrams

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.009 
milligrams
and<00:03:49.680> after<00:03:50.310> surgery<00:03:50.610> I<00:03:50.819> will<00:03:51.000> be<00:03:51.269> taking<00:03:51.510> if<00:03:51.900> I

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
and after surgery I will be taking if I

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.250 
and after surgery I will be taking if I
read<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.410> correctly<00:03:52.650> for<00:03:53.780> take<00:03:54.780> one<00:03:55.019> capsule

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
read this correctly for take one capsule

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.479 
read this correctly for take one capsule
by<00:03:55.680> mouth<00:03:55.920> four<00:03:56.340> times<00:03:56.610> daily<00:03:57.450> for<00:03:57.690> seven<00:03:58.230> days

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
by mouth four times daily for seven days

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.559 
by mouth four times daily for seven days
on<00:03:59.489> 500<00:04:00.360> milligram<00:04:00.959> capsules<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:02.569> Catholics

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
on 500 milligram capsules of Catholics

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.229 
on 500 milligram capsules of Catholics
so<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.260> don't<00:04:05.010> think<00:04:05.430> that'd<00:04:05.730> be<00:04:05.819> an<00:04:05.910> issue<00:04:06.060> that

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
so I don't think that'd be an issue that

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.940 
so I don't think that'd be an issue that
it's<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.660> same<00:04:06.870> antibiotic<00:04:07.230> that<00:04:07.739> ongoing

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
it's the same antibiotic that ongoing

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.890 
it's the same antibiotic that ongoing
but<00:04:08.519> I'll<00:04:08.760> make<00:04:08.940> sure<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.239> surgeon<00:04:09.660> knows

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
but I'll make sure the surgeon knows

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.990 
but I'll make sure the surgeon knows
that<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.129> think<00:04:11.160> they<00:04:11.519> do<00:04:11.580> because<00:04:11.819> I

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
that and I think they do because I

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.729 
that and I think they do because I
mentioned<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.840> nurse<00:04:13.049> the<00:04:13.319> day<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.680> I

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
mentioned it to the nurse the day that I

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.280 
mentioned it to the nurse the day that I
was<00:04:15.260> in<00:04:16.260> for<00:04:16.680> my<00:04:16.799> pre-op<00:04:17.250> appointment<00:04:17.280> and

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.110 
was in for my pre-op appointment and
told<00:04:19.290> her<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:19.739> was<00:04:20.010> going<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.850> see<00:04:21.000> the

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
told her that I was going to see the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.120 
told her that I was going to see the
doctor<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.840> he<00:04:22.139> had<00:04:22.229> already<00:04:22.410> told<00:04:22.680> me<00:04:22.919> that

he<00:04:23.340> was<00:04:23.460> going<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.610> prescribe<00:04:23.880> an<00:04:24.150> antibiotic

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
he was going to prescribe an antibiotic

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330 
he was going to prescribe an antibiotic
and<00:04:24.840> did<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.110> matter<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.560> her<00:04:25.710> what<00:04:25.889> kind<00:04:25.919> and
