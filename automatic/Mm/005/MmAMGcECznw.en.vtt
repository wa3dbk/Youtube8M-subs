00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
look like go around the other side you

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.260 
look like go around the other side you
can<00:01:51.090> see<00:01:51.120> them<00:01:51.420> better<00:01:55.220> wrap<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.400> LEDs<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.090> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
can see them better wrap the LEDs on it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.000 
can see them better wrap the LEDs on it
they<00:01:57.420> change<00:01:57.720> colors<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.230> can<00:01:58.590> change<00:01:58.800> the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
they change colors you can change the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.230 
they change colors you can change the
motion<00:01:59.220> and<00:02:00.110> speed<00:02:01.110> them<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.350> slow<00:02:01.800> them<00:02:01.980> down

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
motion and speed them up slow them down

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.680 
motion and speed them up slow them down
and<00:02:04.490> make<00:02:05.490> them<00:02:05.520> go<00:02:05.790> little<00:02:06.060> faster<00:02:06.480> so<00:02:06.660> you

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
and make them go little faster so you

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:16.580 
and make them go little faster so you
have<00:02:07.110> an<00:02:07.290> idea<00:02:07.620> of<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> colors<00:02:15.290> there<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.440> go

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
have an idea of the colors there you go
