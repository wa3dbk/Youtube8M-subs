00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hey guys and welcome to DC gaming

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.530 
hey guys and welcome to DC gaming
legoboy<00:00:03.780> here<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.549> I'm<00:00:05.549> here<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.240> talk<00:00:06.480> about

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
legoboy here and I'm here to talk about

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.089 
legoboy here and I'm here to talk about
the<00:00:10.580> valedictorian<00:00:11.630> 944<00:00:12.630> legendary<00:00:13.590> rocket

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
the valedictorian 944 legendary rocket

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.880 
the valedictorian 944 legendary rocket
launcher<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.639> destiny<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.440> still<00:00:16.440> do<00:00:16.680> not<00:00:16.710> have

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
launcher and destiny I still do not have

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.609 
launcher and destiny I still do not have
a<00:00:17.190> capture<00:00:17.789> card<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.359> cannot<00:00:18.750> actually

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
a capture card so I cannot actually

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.590 
a capture card so I cannot actually
record<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.320> yeah<00:00:23.090> so<00:00:24.090> let's<00:00:24.330> take<00:00:24.539> a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
record this and yeah so let's take a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.939 
record this and yeah so let's take a
look<00:00:24.840> let's<00:00:26.689> a<00:00:27.689> solar<00:00:28.199> weapon<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
look let's a solar weapon and the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.220 
look let's a solar weapon and the
description<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.880> send<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.449> one's<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.990> front

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
description is send that one's the front

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.139 
description is send that one's the front
of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> class<00:00:32.270> it's<00:00:33.270> got<00:00:33.500> its<00:00:34.500> got<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.149> weight

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
of the class it's got its got a weight

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.569 
of the class it's got its got a weight
let's<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:37.440> gone<00:00:37.620> okay<00:00:38.219> rate<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.760> fire<00:00:40.579> well

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
let's it's gone okay rate of fire well

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.520 
let's it's gone okay rate of fire well
it's<00:00:41.969> rocket<00:00:42.690> launch<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.350> won't

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
it's rocket launch here so it won't

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.430 
it's rocket launch here so it won't
really<00:00:43.800> wouldn't<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.190> high<00:00:44.879> rate<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.149> fire

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
really wouldn't have high rate of fire

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.920 
really wouldn't have high rate of fire
it's<00:00:46.440> got<00:00:46.590> an<00:00:46.710> amazing<00:00:47.489> blast<00:00:48.000> radius<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.780> the
