00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.570
 days people here tidal bore today 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.410
 meet for a new video 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.210
 so episode 10 of the gta guide 5 and 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.739
 today it's going to be a pretty good guide 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.419
 interesting because it explains our 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.340
 hearts cover slipcovers pau us 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.809
 finally how to find it easily 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.480
 possible roles are truck roles 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.829
 So sports cars and enough 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.090
 stylish that everyone loves believes him 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.730
 so we went into the game a bit 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.570
 mocked the place the most several 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.700
 parkings 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.590
 basically the area where they spawn that's 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.870
 really where I would find myself 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.880
 turn then all the little ones all that 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.130
 is happening in the beach here so at 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.290
 provide a lunch to 2 in front of me so we 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.340
 has a big end of the euro the sixth to 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.260
 right so the first spot to rolls 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.170
 it's here then you'll think 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.000
 before servicing quietly 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.950
 not go back to see a 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.750
 power icon better towards the map 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.220
 then he's the second clown 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.299
 here so in the corner there are some 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.340
 cars that lands for galas and 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.940
 by you will see in return he will have 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.350
 maybe we have the mechanic there are less 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.430
 but we never know who is a good 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.130
 surprise and who is a good car 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.150
 here is me I often have rocks but 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.920
 everywhere with other cars like 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.500
 dean serenus and stuff like but 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.940
 good part of the round there are rolls here 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.729
 at the live car park made them a 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.340
 pretty sporty car too and there is the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.479
 parking here yes we also have all the time 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.970

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.770

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.540
 often roles happen or that you 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.740
 can there also intercept them there 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.230
 when we do not have to go to 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.030
 park so we'll go back once 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.670
 So sometimes it can be once they 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.370
 disappear to see here I believe no 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.440
 yes there are some who have disappeared and 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.030
 we can already see on the left that the swing that 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.410

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.440
