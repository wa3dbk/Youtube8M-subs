juices<00:00:17.449> the<00:00:18.449> problem<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.109> there's<00:00:20.039> lots

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
juices the problem is that there's lots

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.950 
juices the problem is that there's lots
of<00:00:20.310> different<00:00:20.369> types<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:21.000> juicer<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.600> unless

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
of different types of juicer and unless

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.109 
of different types of juicer and unless
you've<00:00:22.140> got<00:00:22.170> some<00:00:22.500> experience<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.279> using<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
you've got some experience in using the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.150 
you've got some experience in using the
different<00:00:24.240> types<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> bit<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.010> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
different types it can be a bit of a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.890 
different types it can be a bit of a
difficult<00:00:26.550> decision<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:27.000> make<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.599> go<00:00:27.750> for

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
difficult decision to make do you go for

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.750 
difficult decision to make do you go for
a<00:00:27.990> centrifugal<00:00:28.439> juicer<00:00:28.859> do<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.369> go<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.640> one

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
a centrifugal juicer do you go for one

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.460 
a centrifugal juicer do you go for one
of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.939> twin<00:00:30.150> gear<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:30.539> single<00:00:30.900> gear<00:00:31.019> deuces

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
of the twin gear or single gear deuces

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.639 
of the twin gear or single gear deuces
I'm<00:00:32.340> going<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.550> assume<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> type<00:00:34.620> of

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
I'm going to assume that the type of

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.790 
I'm going to assume that the type of
juicer<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.219> want<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:36.690> all<00:00:37.200> fruit<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
juicer you want is for all fruit and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.700 
juicer you want is for all fruit and
vegetables<00:00:38.660> rather<00:00:39.660> than<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.320> speciality

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
vegetables rather than a speciality

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.369 
vegetables rather than a speciality
juicer<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> wheatgrass<00:00:42.140> juicer<00:00:43.140> or<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
juicer like a wheatgrass juicer or a

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.490 
juicer like a wheatgrass juicer or a
citrus<00:00:43.980> juicer<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.750> short<00:00:46.020> video<00:00:46.110> I'm

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
citrus juicer so in this short video I'm

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500 
citrus juicer so in this short video I'm
going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.739> take<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.250> through<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.789> decisions

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
going to take you through the decisions

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.330 
going to take you through the decisions
you<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> make<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.379> by<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.950> end<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.190> it

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
you have to make and by the end of it

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.220 
you have to make and by the end of it
you'll<00:00:50.789> know<00:00:50.969> exactly<00:00:51.120> which<00:00:51.539> type<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.809> juices

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you'll know exactly which type of juices

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.100 
you'll know exactly which type of juices
to<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:54.210> first<00:00:54.420> decision<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to get the first decision you have to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.040 
to get the first decision you have to
make<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.649> your<00:00:56.460> budget<00:00:56.910> how<00:00:57.690> much<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
make is your budget how much you

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.349 
make is your budget how much you
prepared<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.469> spend<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.940> less<00:01:00.120> than<00:01:00.149> a

typically<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> fruit<00:02:04.799> will<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.430> cut

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
typically the fruit will have to be cut

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.900 
typically the fruit will have to be cut
up<00:02:05.640> into<00:02:05.909> much<00:02:06.149> smaller<00:02:06.180> pieces<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.580> fed<00:02:08.580> into

up into much smaller pieces and fed into
the<00:02:08.940> machine<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.200> slower<00:02:10.470> rate<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.550> whereas
