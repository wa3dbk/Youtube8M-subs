00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.840 
so first I'm gonna take all the hair
from<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.670> ears<00:02:16.000> down<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:17.280> separate<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.520> from

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
from the ears down and separate it from

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.290 
from the ears down and separate it from
the<00:02:19.570> other<00:02:19.990> parts<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.700> I'm<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:21.880> going<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.060> pop

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
the other parts so I'm just going to pop

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.040 
the other parts so I'm just going to pop
this<00:02:22.600> clip<00:02:23.410> here<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:23.950> hold<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.370> hair<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.790> place

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
so this is the size of the sections I'm

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.150 
so this is the size of the sections I'm
normally<00:02:28.210> going<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.390> be<00:02:28.540> working<00:02:28.990> with<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.770> I

I<00:03:30.940> like<00:03:31.940> about<00:03:32.090> this<00:03:32.390> tool<00:03:32.600> is<00:03:32.840> that<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.050> curls

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
I like about this tool is that it curls

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.220 
I like about this tool is that it curls
the<00:03:33.830> whole<00:03:34.100> bit<00:03:34.520> of<00:03:34.700> hair<00:03:34.940> not<00:03:35.600> just<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.990> top

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
the whole bit of hair not just the top

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.050 
the whole bit of hair not just the top
in<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.500> middle<00:03:36.800> it<00:03:36.920> curls<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.340> ends<00:03:37.730> as<00:03:37.850> well

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.059 
in the middle it curls the ends as well
which<00:03:38.660> is<00:03:38.810> something<00:03:39.020> that<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.350> struggle<00:03:39.770> to<00:03:39.890> do

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
which is something that I struggle to do

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.210 
which is something that I struggle to do
with<00:03:40.310> any<00:03:40.520> other<00:03:40.750> curling<00:03:41.750> tool<00:03:41.959> there's<00:03:42.950> any

with any other curling tool there's any
bits<00:03:43.550> that<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.910> feel<00:03:44.209> like<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.690> didn't<00:03:44.989> go

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
bits that you feel like it didn't go

00:03:45.170 --> 00:04:00.940 
bits that you feel like it didn't go
well<00:03:45.250> just<00:03:46.250> go<00:03:46.400> back<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:46.880> do<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.000> again

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.410 

so<00:04:01.950> I'm<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:02.160> going<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.370> carry<00:04:02.610> on<00:04:02.760> do<00:04:02.970> exactly

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
so I'm just going to carry on do exactly

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:20.540 
so I'm just going to carry on do exactly
the<00:04:03.600> same<00:04:03.630> thing<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.350> I'll<00:04:04.800> be<00:04:05.070> right<00:04:05.250> back

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
exactly the same thing all around the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.400 
exactly the same thing all around the
hair<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.340> get<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.210> front<00:04:34.480> bit<00:04:34.810> now<00:04:35.080> I'm

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
hair and get it to the front bit now I'm

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.980 
hair and get it to the front bit now I'm
just<00:04:35.710> sort<00:04:35.980> of<00:04:36.040> tailoring<00:04:36.970> where<00:04:37.480> I<00:04:37.510> want<00:04:37.870> the

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
just sort of tailoring where I want the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.050 
just sort of tailoring where I want the
curls<00:04:38.230> to<00:04:38.350> go<00:04:38.560> but<00:04:38.890> because<00:04:39.010> they<00:04:39.340> all<00:04:39.490> fall<00:04:39.880> to

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
curls to go but because they all fall to

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.620 
curls to go but because they all fall to
this<00:04:40.210> side<00:04:40.510> I've<00:04:40.870> changed<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.680> setting<00:04:42.160> to

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
this side I've changed the setting to

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.510 
this side I've changed the setting to
right<00:04:43.630> which<00:04:44.110> is<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.440> right<00:04:44.680> side<00:04:45.040> of<00:04:45.310> my<00:04:45.490> head

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
right which is the right side of my head

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.420 
right which is the right side of my head
so<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.240> curls<00:04:46.540> curl<00:04:46.900> away<00:04:47.170> from<00:04:47.590> my<00:04:47.770> face<00:04:48.010> and

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
so the curls curl away from my face and

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.880 
so the curls curl away from my face and
it<00:04:48.910> just<00:04:49.120> sort<00:04:49.270> of<00:04:49.360> frames<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:50.200> face<00:04:50.230> much

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
it just sort of frames the face much

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.600 
it just sort of frames the face much
nicer<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:53.590> as<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.800> can<00:04:53.950> see<00:04:54.130> I've<00:04:54.280> avoided

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
nicer and as you can see I've avoided

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.580 
nicer and as you can see I've avoided
sort<00:04:55.150> of<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.360> roots<00:04:55.630> because<00:04:56.050> I<00:04:56.140> don't<00:04:56.350> want

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
sort of the roots because I don't want

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.180 
sort of the roots because I don't want
to<00:04:57.040> be<00:04:57.190> killed<00:04:57.610> at<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.090> roots<00:04:58.890> yeah

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
to be killed at the roots yeah

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.130 
to be killed at the roots yeah
I<00:05:00.220> think<00:05:00.730> it<00:05:01.030> looks<00:05:01.240> really<00:05:01.510> nice<00:05:01.660> it<00:05:01.900> does
