00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
width and the height measurements

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.770 
width and the height measurements
independently<00:01:07.610> of<00:01:07.729> each<00:01:07.820> other<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:08.300> you<00:01:08.630> can

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
independently of each other so you can

independently of each other so you can
already<00:01:08.899> see<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.380> shape<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.680> stretching

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
already see that the shape is stretching

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.620 
already see that the shape is stretching
out<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.490> starting<00:01:10.790> to<00:01:10.910> look<00:01:11.030> more<00:01:11.090> like<00:01:11.330> a
