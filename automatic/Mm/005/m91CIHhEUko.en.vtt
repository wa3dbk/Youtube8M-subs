00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.890
 good organization this organization 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.800
 fights this virus and they gave me 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.020
 coordinates where is the vaccine when 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.210
 we will find her and bring her back 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.130
 then I will agree with them and they will you 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.929
 cure and now let's not lose 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.929
 Not a minute and we will go 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.900
 so sit in the back seat 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.180
 nothing will turn out 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.520
 we stopped so I checked the map 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.610
 looked how much we still have to go and 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.140
 where are we at all yes I am still very 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:46.700
 would get hungry more often 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:56.240
 have a little snack so we are all here if 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:57.320
 this is here so so well and ka if 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.410
 bridge over 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.510
 across the bridge you will need to go here 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.510
 still walk a little 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.730
 this surah is so but basically I figured it out 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.440
 in her according to my calculations we still 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.810
 20-30 minutes drive no more 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:30.430
 Basically, let's understand everything with the card. 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:33.569
 have a snack well how tasty yes really want 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.060
 ask you about what your husband think 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.430
 I have the exact coordinates. 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.030
 you just have to go there to pick up 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.880
 antidote 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.260
 some papers for the boss and everything will be 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.360
 okay, well, you eat only faster 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.560
 otherwise we will have little time 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.840
 faster to go boss we found 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.190
 Jack only he here d17 here some 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.680
 the mutant understood you to be made as soon as 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.910
 document seems to have a jack we will proceed to 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.910
 the field of our good 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:37.449
 no no no just not this damn bridge 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:37.449
 destroyed the same to us now do 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.820
 I have in general one plan, but I think 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.070
 those are unlikely to like in general i go there 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.560
 I will go there alone and you will stay here 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.360
 and you will guard our car go 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.910
 I go there alone because we can expect 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.669
 any evil and I still have 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.669
 myself a weapon so I will send myself
