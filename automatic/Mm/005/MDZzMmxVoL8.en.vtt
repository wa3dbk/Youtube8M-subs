our<00:02:16.280> hook<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.730> off<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.510> paper<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.280> fold

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
our hook is off of the paper and we fold

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.820 
our hook is off of the paper and we fold
it<00:02:19.880> over<00:02:20.030> make<00:02:20.959> sure<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.380> it's<00:02:21.500> gonna<00:02:21.680> be

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
it over make sure that it's gonna be

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.460 
it over make sure that it's gonna be
completely<00:02:22.400> covered<00:02:22.610> don't<00:02:23.180> work<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.870> like

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
completely covered don't work it I like

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.660 
completely covered don't work it I like
to<00:02:24.500> use<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.190> kind<00:02:25.489> of<00:02:25.519> glue<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.730> can<00:02:25.940> use

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
to use this kind of glue you can use

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.150 
to use this kind of glue you can use
glue<00:02:28.670> sticks<00:02:29.000> but<00:02:29.330> for<00:02:30.110> me<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:30.470> hard<00:02:30.650> for<00:02:30.920> you

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
glue sticks but for me it's hard for you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.770 
glue sticks but for me it's hard for you
to<00:02:31.310> see<00:02:31.519> where<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.790> glue<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.600> sometimes

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
to see where the glue is and sometimes

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.890 
to see where the glue is and sometimes
that<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.319> tissue<00:02:33.739> doesn't<00:02:34.010> stick<00:02:34.630> we<00:02:35.630> talked

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
that the tissue doesn't stick we talked

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.380 
that the tissue doesn't stick we talked
about<00:02:36.049> not<00:02:36.350> using<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.950> magically<00:02:37.580> if<00:02:38.030> we<00:02:38.180> make

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
about not using to magically if we make

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.809 
about not using to magically if we make
puddles<00:02:38.870> it's<00:02:39.140> just<00:02:39.350> not<00:02:39.560> going<00:02:39.769> to<00:02:39.830> work<00:02:40.100> we

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
puddles it's just not going to work we

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.930 
puddles it's just not going to work we
squiggle<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.840> glue<00:02:42.140> over<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:43.010> hanger<00:02:43.670> it's

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
squiggle the glue over the hanger it's

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.960 
squiggle the glue over the hanger it's
got<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.239> be<00:02:44.330> over<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.170> hanger<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.220> the

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
got to be over the hanger so that the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.960 
got to be over the hanger so that the
tissue<00:02:47.269> will<00:02:47.660> stick<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.440> hanger<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.400> we

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
tissue will stick to the hanger and we

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.850 
tissue will stick to the hanger and we
talked<00:02:50.209> about<00:02:50.239> not<00:02:50.660> coming<00:02:50.900> way<00:02:51.170> out<00:02:51.380> here

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
talked about not coming way out here

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.470 
talked about not coming way out here
because<00:02:52.190> that's<00:02:52.489> gonna<00:02:52.700> make<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.880> big<00:02:52.970> old<00:02:53.239> glue

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
because that's gonna make a big old glue

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.300 
because that's gonna make a big old glue
spot<00:02:54.019> in<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.200> middle<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.530> your<00:02:54.650> bumblebees

body so don't push too hard
skinny<00:02:59.510> little<00:02:59.959> line<00:03:00.940> squiggling<00:03:01.940> all<00:03:02.209> the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
skinny little line squiggling all the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.530 
skinny little line squiggling all the
way<00:03:02.930> around<00:03:04.060> after<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.090> do<00:03:05.269> that<00:03:05.510> very

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
way around after I do that very

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.550

so<00:03:22.900> we<00:03:23.080> know<00:03:23.290> it's<00:03:23.500> stuck<00:03:23.860> flip<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.550> over

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
stuck so you let put it away let it dry

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.520 
stuck so you let put it away let it dry
for<00:03:32.160> at<00:03:33.160> least<00:03:33.190> 30<00:03:33.790> minutes<00:03:34.170> often<00:03:35.170> we'll<00:03:35.380> do

for at least 30 minutes often we'll do

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.410 
for at least 30 minutes often we'll do
this<00:03:35.740> part<00:03:36.040> in<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.250> morning<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:36.850> then<00:03:37.060> do<00:03:37.270> the

out to two-phase activity okay you've
given<00:03:43.030> your<00:03:43.150> hanger<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.540> little<00:03:43.780> bit<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:43.960> time

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
given your hanger a little bit of time

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.260 
given your hanger a little bit of time
to<00:03:44.260> dry<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.610> now<00:03:45.790> we're<00:03:45.940> going<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.090> talk

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
to dry and so now we're going to talk

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.820 
to dry and so now we're going to talk
about<00:03:46.390> cutting<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:47.050> out<00:03:47.110> now<00:03:47.320> this<00:03:47.500> can<00:03:47.740> get

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
about cutting it out now this can get

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.950 
about cutting it out now this can get
tricky<00:03:47.890> too<00:03:48.490> if<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.060> get<00:03:49.180> too<00:03:49.390> close<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.690> the

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
tricky too if you get too close to the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.750 
tricky too if you get too close to the
hanger<00:03:50.290> then<00:03:50.500> it's<00:03:50.620> going<00:03:50.740> to<00:03:50.800> pull<00:03:51.070> away<00:03:51.220> and

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
hanger then it's going to pull away and

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.310 
hanger then it's going to pull away and
then<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.000> won't<00:03:52.120> stick<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:52.780> we<00:03:52.900> talked<00:03:53.170> about

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
then it won't stick so we talked about

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.080 
then it won't stick so we talked about
leaving<00:03:53.710> a<00:03:53.980> little<00:03:54.610> bit<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.910> an<00:03:55.030> edge<00:03:55.800> outside

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
leaving a little bit of an edge outside

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.430 
leaving a little bit of an edge outside
of<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.270> hanger<00:03:58.690> no<00:03:58.840> we<00:03:58.960> don't<00:03:59.140> want<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.320> big

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440
