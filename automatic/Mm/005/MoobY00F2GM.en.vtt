00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.800

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.900

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.990
 commander warrior and i have in mine 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.250
 suitcase tackled the us he naked justin 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.680
 ip at the round 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.629
 commander snipes ag strikes back with 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.750
 preparation dexterity quietly 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:45.309
 stronger hardliner and bing than box and 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.070
 the foreseeable on the 15.4 builds on them 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.470
 united the new the dig and on the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.559
 ten dinko heroes will be happy and happy 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.030
 Today, the comments turn around 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.220
 field trials or field 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.570
 command the first enemy of the parked 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.699
 will leave this blue suitcase there 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.799
 fall is there and this is such a 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.850
 said field command of the castle gaming 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.189
 I think right now 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.140
 Collected and needs a mission 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.659
 Of course he can do that 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.150
 but he can also do fieldwork 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.130
 Can not make it if he does not 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.990
 he should make the case 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.850
 fall and someone else can help him 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.700
 collect it again so easy is that 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.530
 quite so first to the suitcase so if 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.940
 you then less click basket and then 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.950
 a suitcase gets the bright here 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.470
 or I get that way anyway 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.880
 your environment command received and indeed 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.320
 reach a shot lying down 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.240
 the field command will also be below 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.130
 This was the scoreboard again 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.510
 faded in for the people 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.770
 maybe not read that fast 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.770
 this command now falls below command 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.450
 reach a shot lying down 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.060
 there are different ones like for example 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.720
 after a jump, three opponents without 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.210
 to die 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.010
 less secondary was clubbing off yes 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.229
 I 've made sun lie here and 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.150
 have my field command fulfilled now see 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.299
 her down right at killstreaks that 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.360
 down there, that means 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.460
 each ha commander warrior has supplies and 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.560
 how can I throw it off and 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.210
 get something nice for it 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.399
 open, free man can do everything 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.119
 possible to be in there to progress 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.220
 to the loki 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.489
 there can be anything in these 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.370
 inventories are like some apps 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.950
 example on branch son can be a camp 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.950
 be inside 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.950
 on 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:31.810
 there can be a moerser fire in it 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.000
 satellites shelled like hessens salvos 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.860
 fire on them so there is 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.780
 different stuff not every app so 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.860
 prison break has something not these are 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.300
 stop always higher is always 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.490
 Something funny in here I have 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.440
 First of all, the ball and the supplies 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.360
 clapped because I want to have 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.160
 to each colleague must also again 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.560
 short of a sniper rifle 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.780
 smell and now come the supplies and 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.500
 what is inside 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.860
 a maniac that means something like that 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.330
 in the stores and that is special 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.490
 here first the tactics disorders the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.380
 Apart from that, it was created on the ps4 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.580
 we see with also on the beautiful graphic 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.410
 the sun and all patience and how come 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.910
 then when I reach commands now 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.350
 how come then again a new one 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.130
 command falls into the game 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.860
 the first opponent is the one next 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.010
 Deffte not get the leaves then 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.540
 again comes command yes on the ground 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.790
 that is the one in bold 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.470
 has fulfilled command when the killed 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.240
 will there be a new field command 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.800
 it can I know more 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.000
 we've had that in times I believe 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.450
 the lobby that it is now let me 1678 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.110
 the way, is that there are six or seven 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.730
 field orders gave 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.200
 I 'll watch that we somehow with 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.460
 somehow it sounded like a gameplay 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.350
 where we really only notice 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.550
 orders go look how many we 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.170
 Maybe we can do that 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.680
 a little can you make out 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.510
 I find delicious in any case 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.120
 otherwise yes fall away but am now 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.680
 i here maniac and the little maniac 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.780
 you have to make sure important times 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.310
 people partly knives and these 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.200
 small facial expression in their eyes 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.580
 If I measure the people I see 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.110
 think that's pretty funny so 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.470
 Do you have to come up with something 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.620
 So let this love to detail you 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.760
 back there 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.790
 fun but then that we are a type 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.790
 ii 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.919
 Rapunzel some knife action can still see 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.050
 really cool because he then so that 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.110
 knife from below into the lower jaw purely 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.610
 Hunt will be found one more later 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.750
 I'm pretty cool like that and I have 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.100
 Let's just do it 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.870
 just here today as a comment with 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.360
 team deathmatch does not work anyway 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.240
 long at least from time here 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.800
 you see already our first player of 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.960
 here was his pink panther 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.690
 has gone off like hell and now 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.370
 he also needs no more than yes 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.860
 your pink you are not the pink 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.020
 panther or so was playing by that 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.550
 but it is unclear 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.300
 By the way, here 's how a clown gameplay 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.310
 producer of the cryptic shadows the faith 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.550
 I do not want to be that right 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.500
 See, now it's gonna be a cool one 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.620
 shot list behind it high and now 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.509
 pass on pofalla before down purely zack 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.580
 short sky but then I thought here 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.930
 again on the colleagues here too 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.060
 you do not get orders now 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.410
 I have to make five fights 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.169
 inventories finally get in 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.060
 maniac even something pretty horny so 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.250
 that means you can even in the maniac 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.289
 I get orders to get orders 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.590
 pretty tasty again by the 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.870
 flow granja and he moans around here like 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:46.570
 a small harbor clock you have to unfortunately 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:47.740
 so say the types here right 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.900
 baffled and I have one and build 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.090
 you the sun with the start of the snaps 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.419
 the now and I am struck 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.229
 until more and the maniac goes 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.300
 unfortunately does not regenerate why 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:03.280
 I'm here too, unfortunately 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.479
 away and I hope that I can give you one 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.130
 Do something with the field command 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.620
 I could explain how that works 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.699
 Find's cool achievement especially stocks 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.409
 There is nothing more than normal 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.900
 killstreak that's how it is now 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:16.330
 I am pretty well solved that way 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.250
 little bit gives the whole thing one 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.780
 small additional challenge write me 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.330
