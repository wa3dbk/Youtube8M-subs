00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.119
 hello moussa maïga the locker room from there 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.610
 and it's Tuesday night at the haven to retry 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.300
 a great clamor a bit like after the 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.540
 match against Châteauroux 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.590
 yeah that's for sure it's a pleasure to 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.739
 beat again league 2 and bah saw the 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.700
 match and the match scenario 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.170
 frankly l2 I thought it was going 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.239
 to be very hard to put the third goal 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.030
 as Konami third goal is 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.020
 was really so happy what 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.870
 after we fought we all know 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.730
 snatched and ben the end of the month of fasting 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.679
 was a buddy that's right from the start 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.980
 final whistle and we burst with joy 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:54.739
 but all you said is bonus 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.030
 gold are now at perry-life me 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.710
 it's sure it's the bonus 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.800
 it's still a bonus and the cup ccd 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.510
 match to please frankly we 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.409
 will take pleasure and the most 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.420
 important is the championship where we 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.159
 do not forget the number 1 goal which is 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.990
 the climb of course we started badly the 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.790
 championship so must quickly get 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.230
 refocus on the championship since 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.869
 that we had won seven laps we are 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.189
 passed through colmar face 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.630
 so there to swim 120 minutes maybe 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.149
 that it will be a little hard physically 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.259
 but I think it will not be necessary to say 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:30.350
 we are a little tired 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.270
 has played enough I think if we have 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.759
 really hungry good bah the perry-on-life 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.759
 Friday and will not go out discusses 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.840
 I think it is true that 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.799
 physically we were we were good we 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.380
 was rather better physically one 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.060
 said we jostled them anyway 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.140
 ended the match better than even if 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.640
 we say ok it's true they are 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.450
 led are eligible so it is 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.280
 obliged they are forced to push and 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.969
 month after month i will say frankly 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.009
 the whole team we do not have legs 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.430
 have nothing at all nuxe kids for 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.070
 Friday 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.229
 do not go out of excuses Friday we're going 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.180

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.860
 pocket the three points 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.789
 vital but for you these few 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.500
 particular with your case if we 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.410
 find another former club with whom 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.450
 she had a great time between 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.000
 our coach knows with whom we have very 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.830
 very well coached bah it will last 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.090

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.730
 Basque or indirectly 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.489

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.959

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.890
 it's true here to point I hope that 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.300
 I did not take a red with amiens 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.320

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.400
 match and I hope to play already so I 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.989
 I'm not going to say that I started at the goal 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.920
 of Termonde 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.590
 I hope to play and make a big match 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:11.650
 Friday in any case I am I am 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:13.519
 150% motivated oppose two for sure 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.470
 report there have been a lot of changes 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.690
 they have them they kept that six 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.190
 players from last year I believe it 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.390
 are a lot of recruits whose cap and so 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.840
 after to fit it's a little bit more 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.410
 difficult 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.190
 I listen to old teammates 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.410
 who told me they had a big 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.340
 team all I tell myself is that the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.430
 early season as yvan said 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.470
 survivors they will remove the head and 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.810
 also learn it's the same we're not 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.370
 still we do not know each other very well 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.489
 very very good but it's starting to come 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.660
 but we need time and frankly 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.650
 from now on the bike needs more 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.950
 waste time because we are too scared 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.950
 of the roof 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.250
 yet began to return 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.030
 finish his voice start to ring at 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.030
 from months I believe 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.840
 besides determination of courage to you 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:02.120
 to mount solidarity yeah that's for sure 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.710
 but frankly after the technique that 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.690
 these contributions for me is solidarity 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.940
 to be hungry be warriors until the 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.810
 90th minute and we even win 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.000
 techniques we will win 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:21.170
 just have to have these three themes of 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.670
 the tried the victory to taste on its end 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.900
 huge life but after I'm afraid that 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.390
 make it like a castle in the castle is 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.169
 did us a huge good 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.210
 after that it's true we were on a 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:34.010
 series of three games without a win 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.120
 yeah that's right and on the house are 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.220
 forced to catch up we lost face 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.500
 to orleans so we have to catch up 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.740
 well the fans and we try to 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.740
 to please
