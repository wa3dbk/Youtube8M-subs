my torque wrench is foot-pounds I did I
take<00:02:23.440> most<00:02:23.709> bolts<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:25.080> nine<00:02:26.459> foot<00:02:27.459> bones<00:02:28.920> which

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
is slightly more than the torque but

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.300 
is slightly more than the torque but
suppose<00:02:35.950> just<00:02:37.050> what<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.080> got<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.769> do<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:41.980> want

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
got that in position socket I never

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:48.320 
got that in position socket I never
really<00:03:12.700> use<00:03:25.770> that's<00:03:26.770> going<00:03:27.190> on<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.610> little<00:03:27.850> ice

well you got the idea I'll work on this

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.240 
well you got the idea I'll work on this
might<00:03:55.030> use<00:03:55.300> a<00:03:56.250> block<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.310> pound<00:03:57.880> on<00:03:59.250> I'll

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250

what I do all right there's the old
pensioner<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.780> new<00:04:07.959> hydraulic<00:04:08.560> tensioner

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:21.099 

and<00:04:13.430> we<00:04:14.180> got<00:04:14.420> 5<00:04:15.170> 16<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.400> put<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:18.729> inner<00:04:20.109> cover

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
and we got 5 16 to put the inner cover

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.890 
and we got 5 16 to put the inner cover
on<00:04:21.699> so<00:04:22.699> I'm<00:04:22.789> just<00:04:23.030> throw<00:04:23.330> that<00:04:23.509> back<00:04:23.750> on<00:04:25.900> okay

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
on so I'm just throw that back on okay

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.060 
on so I'm just throw that back on okay
here's<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.680> old<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.310> new<00:04:29.740> tensioner<00:04:30.740> for

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
here's the old and the new tensioner for

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.219 
here's the old and the new tensioner for
the<00:04:31.280> timing<00:04:31.759> belt<00:04:32.530> now<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:33.560> wasted<00:04:34.400> some<00:04:34.639> time

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
the timing belt now I wasted some time

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.390 
the timing belt now I wasted some time
pressing<00:04:36.229> this<00:04:36.410> out<00:04:36.650> of<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:36.889> old<00:04:37.039> one

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
pressing this out of the old one

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.909 
pressing this out of the old one
figuring<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.000> needs<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.360> go<00:04:38.479> in<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.750> new<00:04:38.919> but

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
figuring it needs to go in the new but

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.219 
figuring it needs to go in the new but
of<00:04:40.190> course<00:04:42.849> they<00:04:43.849> don't<00:04:44.000> use<00:04:44.270> anymore<00:04:44.599> after<00:04:44.990> I

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
of course they don't use anymore after I

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.460 
of course they don't use anymore after I
had<00:04:45.560> damaged<00:04:46.310> it<00:04:46.580> up<00:04:46.789> bad<00:04:47.570> enough<00:04:47.780> that<00:04:48.289> had

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
had damaged it up bad enough that had

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.120 
had damaged it up bad enough that had
decided<00:04:48.800> well<00:04:49.220> I<00:04:49.250> better<00:04:49.900> take<00:04:50.900> it<00:04:51.139> in<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:51.590> get

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
decided well I better take it in and get

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.290

that slack I saw originally where it

that slack I saw originally where it
wasn't<00:06:43.259> lined<00:06:43.469> up<00:06:43.649> but<00:06:43.770> was<00:06:43.949> over<00:06:44.219> a<00:06:44.249> little

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
wasn't lined up but was over a little

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.050 
wasn't lined up but was over a little
bit<00:06:44.580> was<00:06:44.879> due<00:06:45.180> to<00:06:45.479> the<00:06:45.860> water<00:06:46.860> pump<00:06:47.249> leaning

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
bit was due to the water pump leaning

bit was due to the water pump leaning
giving<00:06:48.719> slackware<00:06:49.649> it<00:06:49.770> shouldn't<00:06:52.009> so<00:06:53.009> I've

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
giving slackware it shouldn't so I've

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.700 
giving slackware it shouldn't so I've
got<00:06:54.089> a<00:06:54.120> quarter<00:06:54.689> inch<00:06:54.870> drive<00:06:55.259> wrench<00:06:56.219> on<00:06:56.610> the

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
got a quarter inch drive wrench on the

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:05.570 
got a quarter inch drive wrench on the
tensioner<00:06:58.710> to<00:06:59.099> turn<00:06:59.999> it<00:07:00.240> and<00:07:01.639> be<00:07:02.639> a<00:07:02.669> slack

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.429 

and<00:07:07.099> i'll<00:07:08.099> hook<00:07:08.250> the<00:07:08.460> build<00:07:08.699> onto<00:07:09.000> the

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:09.439 
and i'll hook the build onto the

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:13.309 
and i'll hook the build onto the
tensioner<00:07:11.030> then<00:07:12.030> I'll<00:07:12.210> rotate<00:07:12.449> the<00:07:13.139> whole

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 
tensioner then I'll rotate the whole

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:19.959 
tensioner then I'll rotate the whole
thing<00:07:16.849> twice<00:07:17.849> a<00:07:17.909> lot<00:07:18.300> around<00:07:18.750> and<00:07:19.289> make<00:07:19.469> sure

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:19.969 
thing twice a lot around and make sure

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:23.570 
thing twice a lot around and make sure
both<00:07:20.969> marks<00:07:21.569> line<00:07:21.960> up<00:07:21.990> to<00:07:22.710> their<00:07:22.949> appropriate

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 
both marks line up to their appropriate

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.100 
both marks line up to their appropriate
spots<00:07:24.060> again<00:07:24.509> and<00:07:25.319> if<00:07:26.219> that<00:07:26.430> works<00:07:26.759> out<00:07:27.180> which

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.110 
spots again and if that works out which

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.550 
spots again and if that works out which
it<00:07:28.289> should<00:07:28.969> then<00:07:29.969> I'll<00:07:30.150> put<00:07:30.389> the<00:07:30.569> cover<00:07:30.900> on<00:07:30.990> and

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 
it should then I'll put the cover on and

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.839 
it should then I'll put the cover on and
that's<00:07:32.370> the<00:07:32.580> next<00:07:32.789> thing<00:07:32.939> you'll<00:07:33.389> see<00:07:33.719> for<00:07:34.110> me

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:34.849 
that's the next thing you'll see for me

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:39.439 
that's the next thing you'll see for me
also<00:07:35.849> to<00:07:36.210> make<00:07:36.479> it<00:07:36.629> easier<00:07:37.169> to<00:07:38.210> turn<00:07:39.210> the

also to make it easier to turn the
engine<00:07:39.629> over<00:07:39.990> I<00:07:40.440> am<00:07:40.770> going<00:07:41.009> to<00:07:41.099> pull<00:07:41.280> the<00:07:41.430> spark

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:41.669 
engine over I am going to pull the spark

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.860 
engine over I am going to pull the spark
plugs<00:07:42.090> out<00:07:42.389> so<00:07:43.250> the<00:07:44.250> compression<00:07:44.879> won't<00:07:45.090> fight

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:45.870 
plugs out so the compression won't fight

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.730 
plugs out so the compression won't fight
me<00:07:46.110> and<00:07:46.289> turning<00:07:46.620> over<00:07:46.889> the<00:07:47.219> engine<00:07:47.400> with<00:07:48.740> to
