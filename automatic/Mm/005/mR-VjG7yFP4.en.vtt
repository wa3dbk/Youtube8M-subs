00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.879 
one thing we made larger was the battery
in<00:04:43.159> fact<00:04:43.729> iphone<00:04:44.300> 4<00:04:44.599> delivers<00:04:45.080> up<00:04:45.289> to<00:04:45.349> forty

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.519 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty
percent<00:04:46.220> more<00:04:46.520> talk<00:04:46.729> time

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:48.529 
percent more talk time

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:51.789 
percent more talk time
and<00:04:49.069> we<00:04:49.279> started<00:04:49.879> with<00:04:50.379> completely<00:04:51.379> opposing

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:51.799 
and we started with completely opposing

00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:54.339 
and we started with completely opposing
goals<00:04:52.159> and<00:04:52.489> we<00:04:53.149> wanted<00:04:53.419> to<00:04:53.479> make<00:04:53.659> this<00:04:53.839> iphone

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
goals and we wanted to make this iphone

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.589 
goals and we wanted to make this iphone
more<00:04:54.979> capable<00:04:55.519> we<00:04:55.789> wanted<00:04:56.059> to<00:04:56.119> add<00:04:56.299> more

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
more capable we wanted to add more

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.379 
more capable we wanted to add more
feature<00:04:56.929> and<00:04:57.439> yet<00:04:58.279> at<00:04:58.369> the<00:04:58.429> same<00:04:58.489> time<00:04:58.699> we

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
feature and yet at the same time we

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:00.909 
feature and yet at the same time we
wanted<00:04:59.659> to<00:04:59.689> make<00:04:59.809> it<00:04:59.959> smaller<00:05:00.199> and<00:05:00.529> even

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
wanted to make it smaller and even

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.309 
wanted to make it smaller and even
thinner<00:05:01.219> and<00:05:01.519> that<00:05:02.359> led<00:05:02.539> to<00:05:02.569> some<00:05:02.899> really

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
thinner and that led to some really

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.519 
thinner and that led to some really
surprising<00:05:03.469> innovation<00:05:05.259> and<00:05:06.259> we<00:05:06.349> developed

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:06.529 
surprising innovation and we developed

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.279 
surprising innovation and we developed
an<00:05:06.889> entirely<00:05:07.429> new<00:05:07.609> grade<00:05:08.149> stainless<00:05:08.779> steel

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
an entirely new grade stainless steel

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.129 
an entirely new grade stainless steel
that<00:05:09.829> after<00:05:10.159> machining<00:05:10.549> is<00:05:11.209> incredibly

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
that after machining is incredibly

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.179 
that after machining is incredibly
strong<00:05:12.529> but<00:05:13.369> also<00:05:13.579> remarkably<00:05:14.359> precise<00:05:15.189> the

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:16.189 
strong but also remarkably precise the

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:18.579 
strong but also remarkably precise the
steel<00:05:16.489> frame<00:05:16.849> functions<00:05:17.449> is<00:05:17.599> the<00:05:17.749> antenna<00:05:18.139> but

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:18.589 
steel frame functions is the antenna but

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.159 
steel frame functions is the antenna but
also<00:05:18.859> the<00:05:19.399> primary<00:05:19.639> structure<00:05:20.419> giving<00:05:20.989> us

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
also the primary structure giving us

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.449 
also the primary structure giving us
more<00:05:21.409> internal<00:05:21.949> volume<00:05:23.619> we<00:05:24.619> also<00:05:24.769> developed<00:05:25.369> a

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:25.459 
more internal volume we also developed a

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:27.369 
more internal volume we also developed a
custom<00:05:25.849> glass<00:05:26.029> that's<00:05:26.719> comparable<00:05:27.229> in

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:27.379 
custom glass that's comparable in

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:29.829 
custom glass that's comparable in
strength<00:05:27.709> to<00:05:27.919> sapphire<00:05:28.279> crystal<00:05:28.879> but<00:05:29.629> about

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:29.839 
strength to sapphire crystal but about

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:33.819 
strength to sapphire crystal but about
30<00:05:30.169> times<00:05:30.529> harder<00:05:31.189> than<00:05:31.459> plastic<00:05:32.469> this<00:05:33.469> glass
