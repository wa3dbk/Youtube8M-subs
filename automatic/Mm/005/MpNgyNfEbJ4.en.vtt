00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 at sport friends I'm simon yours 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.210
 muscle maker first and foremost 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.710
 thank you very much for this 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.269
 Fat youtube award here 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.460
 I am really happy about that 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.540
 that you have made that possible 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.130
 is of course a great one for me 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.440
 Of course, motivation gives me too 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.119
 the confirmation that the work 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.490
 that I do for you is a good one 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.330
 work is that you like it and that 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.800
 Of course that makes me special 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.539
 proud and I'll take it somewhere with me 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.699
 go hang where I often look in 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.710
 First of all, I have so many 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.119
 Thank you for this fat youtube 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.660
 I'm really happy about that 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.369
 very 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.559
 that's what I have with you today 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.870
 I would like to show you how you are more upper arm 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.180
 circumference gets because the upper arm circumference 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.300
 this is not defined first of all 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.980
 line about what you get here first 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.020
 looks over the biceps but 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.210
 the scope of it crucially depends on 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.920
 triceps of the armed stripper because of the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.620
 evening stretch here the power approximately 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.750
 two thirds of your upper arm circumference 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.090
 So in terms of volume of the volume 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.890
 The circumference is that of the triceps 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.379
 that makes the poor really fat and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.510
 one of the best exercises for this is french 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.330
 press in the not braker variant and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.189
 that's exactly what I'm going to show you now 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.380
 the starting position is sitting with the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.330
 sz snake in front of the body very important 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.310
 at the handle of the sz stangen depending on what 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.869
 for model you have tried as possible 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.670
 to grab tight to make a mistake 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.920
 I'll avoid you again soon 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.830
 would like to show more exactly so very important 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.229
 as close as possible grip upright position 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.210
 and now we go into one 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.340
 similar position as the military ipr 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.840
 However, it is the testat standing and 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.670
 Of course sitting here and exactly this 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.350
 I like to have a position when I am 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.880
 me then already on the bench on the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.680
 Of course, bank position if you 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.200
 training partner you can the the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 also in the hands of the hands so rich 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.680
 once a short push that is times 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.030
 just fine, just to come back 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.600
 concentrate again briefly 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.340
 collect 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.299
 I have a small weight now 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.399
 I will not take you then 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.369
 constantly in the in the microphone ryan 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.270
 Rossel and now also in this position 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.820
 just slow the sz rod direction 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.549
 nose drop so for the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.590
 eyebrows and such a few inches 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.320
 23 centimeters before to standstill 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.119
 come and push it out 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.770
 especially important to express that 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.490
 Do not stretch your arms completely 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.530
 so that too 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.780
 works with me the joints but only 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.550
 straighten to about 95 percent so 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.720
 still tension on the muscles and 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:25.980
 then the sz stalk slowly again 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.650
 sink and push up so I hope 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.850
 that iris can see in the angle 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.740
 own thing is very important that you 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.330
 she avoids i hope from the angle 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.950
 it was recognizable that my elbows 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.620
 stayed close to the body 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.200
 If you reach far, he tends 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.510
 a mistake namely that he with 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.800
 the elbow drift outward and here 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.570
 somehow leave like this or here 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.280
 somehow so the whole thing has then leaves 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.900
 nothing more to do with french press that 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.700
 whole is then only extremely on the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.350
 therefore never joints with the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.880
 endings here outward but 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.130
 always focus on that 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.640
 the sz rod is also important for the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.040
 grip position that you leave so that 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.320
 your elbow joint is tight on the body 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.380
 stay and then express like that again 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.060
 this exercise can also be his name all 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.610
 Honor make you when you at the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.560
 does not lower the corresponding motion 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.330
 muscle brake makes but I give 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.070
 just releasing gravity 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.260
 then the whole rushes on the 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.780
 nose and then the fashion will be 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.420
 Exercise besides, which is why they also spray 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.790
 known therefore as you break a 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.990
 Nose if you just put that on 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.970
 your face is clapping like 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.870
 especially important at the beginning of 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.450
 best with the training partner 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.890
 Exercise Muscular considered that is 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.340
 one of the best exercises you can do 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.020
 can 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.970
 Of course there are the joints here 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.800
 many say yes that is an exercise where 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.060
 In any case, I have to take care 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.070
 I just have a few tips 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.240
 given for the right execution there 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.160
 There is also a lot of me 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.140
 detailed tutorial with a shower 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.380
 dons and that's why I now have easy 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.370
 time to this very simple design 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.710
 regardless of the level on me 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.940
 just're focused I think 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.530
 It is always important in his exercises 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.250
 to train clean and not too much 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.630
 to gain weight 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.190
 this is natural for me now 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.080
 as training weight too little but as 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.820
 showing weight just right and 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.900
 Do not be tempted unnecessarily here either 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.430
 a lot of weight on it 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.170
 What I might not end up with 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.610
 everything is clear, I hope 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.410
 that you liked my little video 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.850
 thanks again for the youtube 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.870
 Of course I am very happy about that 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.910
 I'll talk about that somewhere 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.530
 set up and motivated me by it 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.330
 Let's see you in the next video 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.330
 many greetings your simon
