00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.929 

if<00:00:00.120> you<00:00:00.299> particularly<00:00:00.870> talk<00:00:01.110> about<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.589> game

00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:01.939 
if you particularly talk about this game

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.130 
if you particularly talk about this game
you<00:00:02.939> know<00:00:03.000> looking<00:00:03.270> at<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.570> Wicked<00:00:03.840> it<00:00:03.899> was<00:00:03.959> a

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
you know looking at the Wicked it was a

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.590 
you know looking at the Wicked it was a
wicked<00:00:04.350> we're<00:00:04.740> usually<00:00:05.640> you<00:00:05.940> like<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.390> bullet

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
wicked we're usually you like the bullet

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.629 
wicked we're usually you like the bullet
to<00:00:06.870> hit<00:00:07.080> that<00:00:07.230> back<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.799> length<00:00:08.010> mark<00:00:08.460> you

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
to hit that back of the length mark you

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.150 
to hit that back of the length mark you
know<00:00:08.760> close<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.360> off-stump<00:00:10.320> area<00:00:10.710> but<00:00:10.950> i

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
know close to the off-stump area but i

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.740 
know close to the off-stump area but i
think<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.610> know<00:00:11.700> right<00:00:11.940> from<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.330> start<00:00:12.389> we

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
think you know right from the start we

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.320 
think you know right from the start we
gave<00:00:12.929> away<00:00:12.960> too<00:00:13.349> many<00:00:13.469> boundaries<00:00:14.210> you<00:00:15.210> know

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
gave away too many boundaries you know

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.810 
gave away too many boundaries you know
we<00:00:15.450> gave<00:00:15.599> too<00:00:15.780> much<00:00:15.929> width<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.920> batsman

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
we gave too much width to the batsman

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.519 
we gave too much width to the batsman
and<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.029> balls<00:00:18.570> were<00:00:18.750> quite<00:00:18.960> short<00:00:19.320> which

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and the balls were quite short which

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.410 
and the balls were quite short which
meant<00:00:19.770> they<00:00:19.859> could<00:00:19.890> freely<00:00:20.250> score<00:00:21.180> off<00:00:21.390> them

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
meant they could freely score off them

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.900 
meant they could freely score off them
so<00:00:21.869> i<00:00:22.140> think<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.619> didn't<00:00:22.859> start<00:00:23.130> off<00:00:23.279> well<00:00:23.519> and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
so i think we didn't start off well and

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150 
so i think we didn't start off well and
not<00:00:24.539> only<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.810> i<00:00:25.230> think<00:00:25.500> after<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.920> tenth

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
not only that i think after the tenth

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.189 
not only that i think after the tenth
over<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.699> know<00:00:26.820> when<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.150> initiated<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
over you know when we initiated the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.830 
over you know when we initiated the
spinners<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.800> come<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.160> bowl<00:00:29.599> they<00:00:30.599> pulled

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
spinners to come in bowl they pulled

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.510 
spinners to come in bowl they pulled
quite<00:00:31.050> well<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.590> again<00:00:31.920> when<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.219> asked<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
quite well but again when we asked the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160 
quite well but again when we asked the
fast<00:00:32.730> bowlers<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.239> come<00:00:33.420> back<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.780> volume

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
fast bowlers to come back and volume

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.049 
fast bowlers to come back and volume
they<00:00:34.350> gave<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> runs<00:00:34.860> quite<00:00:35.100> freely<00:00:35.399> which

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
they gave the runs quite freely which

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.549 
they gave the runs quite freely which
meant<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.480> know<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.780> were<00:00:36.870> not<00:00:37.020> really<00:00:37.320> able

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
meant you know we were not really able

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.770 
meant you know we were not really able
to<00:00:37.920> hang<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> pressure<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.540> was

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
to hang on to the pressure that was

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.200 
to hang on to the pressure that was
created<00:00:40.050> by<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.410> spinner<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.070> i<00:00:41.640> think

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
created by the spinner so i think

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.869 
created by the spinner so i think
overall<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.290> know<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.800> need<00:00:43.950> quite<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> fair

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
overall you know we need quite a fair

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.700 
overall you know we need quite a fair
amount<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.329> improvement<00:00:45.629> especially<00:00:46.289> now

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
amount of improvement especially now

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.130 
amount of improvement especially now
bowling<00:00:47.070> department<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.780> know<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
bowling department and you know the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.110 
bowling department and you know the
batsman<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.590> playing<00:00:49.829> good<00:00:50.370> shots<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.000> know

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
batsman is playing good shots you know

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.299 
batsman is playing good shots you know
you<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.899> accept<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.800> important

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you you accept it but it's important

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.189 
you you accept it but it's important
that<00:00:53.460> people<00:00:53.940> according<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.660> what<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> plan

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
that people according to what the plan

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.470 
that people according to what the plan
is<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.770> deviate<00:00:56.219> too<00:00:56.250> much<00:00:56.399> offered<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.239> i

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
is and not deviate too much offered so i

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.229 
is and not deviate too much offered so i
think<00:00:58.079> overall<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> quite<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> to<00:01:00.090> some

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
think overall it was a quite a to some

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.790 
think overall it was a quite a to some
extent<00:01:00.570> or<00:01:00.690> disappointing<00:01:01.440> bowling

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
extent or disappointing bowling

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.619 
extent or disappointing bowling
performance<00:01:02.280> from<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> fast<00:01:02.699> bowlers<00:01:03.090> but

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
performance from the fast bowlers but

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.270 
performance from the fast bowlers but
the<00:01:03.719> positive<00:01:03.930> i<00:01:04.290> think<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.920> spinners

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
the positive i think the the spinners

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.520 
the positive i think the the spinners
ball<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:05.700> well<00:01:05.970> i<00:01:06.150> saw<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.750> first<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.290> was

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
ball really well i saw the first and was

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.620 
ball really well i saw the first and was
how<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.680> fast<00:01:07.979> bowlers<00:01:08.340> bowled<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.850> was<00:01:09.420> not

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
how the fast bowlers bowled I was not

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.570 
how the fast bowlers bowled I was not
sure<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.409> know<00:01:10.530> they<00:01:10.920> would<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.159> able<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
sure that you know they would be able to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.730 
sure that you know they would be able to
keep<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> pressure<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.140> was<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> reason

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
keep the pressure on that was the reason

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.190 
keep the pressure on that was the reason
we<00:01:14.070> thought<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.479> personally<00:01:16.049> thought

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
we thought you know I personally thought

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.609 
we thought you know I personally thought
that<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.650> important<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.729> keep<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
that it's important that we keep the

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.490 
that it's important that we keep the
spinners<00:01:19.619> especially<00:01:20.369> Jadeja<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:22.409> know

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
spinners especially Jadeja and you know

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.649 
spinners especially Jadeja and you know
use<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.890> later<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.430> they<00:01:23.610> are<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.509> some

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
use it later when they are to some

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.830 
use it later when they are to some
extent<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.259> know<00:01:25.409> when<00:01:25.979> they<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.689> go<00:01:27.689> for

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
extent you know when they have to go for

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.569 
extent you know when they have to go for
the<00:01:27.960> big<00:01:28.110> shots<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.070> know<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.400> way<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the big shots but you know the way the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
the big shots but you know the way the
gospel<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.360> hold<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> middle<00:01:31.110> overs<00:01:31.439> it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
gospel is hold in the middle overs it

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.880 
gospel is hold in the middle overs it
meant<00:01:32.159> delivery<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:33.509> big<00:01:33.930> shots<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
meant delivery little big shots so I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.130 
meant delivery little big shots so I
think<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.820> crucial<00:01:36.420> phase<00:01:36.840> where

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
think that was the crucial phase where

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.679 
think that was the crucial phase where
with<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> open<00:01:38.040> field<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.430> should<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.729> not

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
with the open field we should have not

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.660 
with the open field we should have not

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
boundary over was the minimum we were

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.460 
boundary over was the minimum we were

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
some point of time you know we had to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.270 
some point of time you know we had to
make<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.049> change<00:01:49.350> right<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.979> getting

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
make this change right I was getting

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.980 
make this change right I was getting
good<00:01:50.490> starts<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.540> was<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.840> able

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
good starts but you know it was not able

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.039 
good starts but you know it was not able
to<00:01:52.140> convert<00:01:52.619> those<00:01:53.490> starts<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.450> thought<00:01:54.990> you

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
to convert those starts so I thought you

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.190 
to convert those starts so I thought you
know<00:01:55.200> maybe<00:01:55.409> at<00:01:56.310> times<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.820> know<00:01:56.880> if<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.990> take

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
know maybe at times you know if you take

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.590 
know maybe at times you know if you take
the<00:01:58.350> individual<00:01:58.829> away<00:01:59.040> from<00:01:59.250> a4a<00:02:00.090> few<00:02:00.329> games

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the individual away from a4a few games

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.350 
the individual away from a4a few games
you<00:02:00.780> know<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.200> relax<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.460> drink<00:02:02.909> think

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
you know you can relax and drink think

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.999 
you know you can relax and drink think
freely<00:02:03.630> about<00:02:03.840> his<00:02:04.200> game<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.710> was<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
freely about his game and that was the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.649 
freely about his game and that was the
reason<00:02:05.159> why<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.460> rested<00:02:05.880> board<00:02:06.119> shaker<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
reason why I rested board shaker and

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.550 
reason why I rested board shaker and
serratia<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.979> game<00:02:09.200> but<00:02:10.200> i<00:02:10.259> think

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
serratia and I in this game but i think

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.559 
serratia and I in this game but i think
we<00:02:10.709> committed<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> same<00:02:11.819> mistake<00:02:12.180> again<00:02:12.270> you

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
we committed the same mistake again you

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.940 
we committed the same mistake again you
know

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
know

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.350 
know
to<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.310> backing<00:02:13.610> department<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:14.180> lost

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
to the backing department we lost

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.110 
to the backing department we lost
wickets<00:02:14.599> at<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.290> crucial<00:02:15.770> time<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.970> has

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
wickets at a crucial time and that has

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.940 
wickets at a crucial time and that has
been<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.330> case<00:02:17.480> in<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.930> series<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:18.470> far<00:02:18.500> but

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
been the case in the series so far but

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.460 
been the case in the series so far but
still<00:02:19.819> we<00:02:19.970> were<00:02:20.090> able<00:02:20.269> to<00:02:20.510> get<00:02:20.959> something

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
still we were able to get something

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.740 
still we were able to get something
close<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.769> 280<00:02:22.310> or<00:02:22.489> runs<00:02:22.910> which<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.300> feel<00:02:23.480> was

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
close to 280 or runs which I feel was

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.170 
close to 280 or runs which I feel was
you<00:02:24.290> know<00:02:24.379> good<00:02:24.560> enough<00:02:24.800> provided<00:02:25.310> we<00:02:25.489> bowled

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
you know good enough provided we bowled

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.210 
you know good enough provided we bowled
well<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.660> on<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:27.080> wicket<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.920> was<00:02:28.069> not

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
well on on this wicket but that was not

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.830 
well on on this wicket but that was not
the<00:02:28.280> case<00:02:28.519> well<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.150> think<00:02:29.239> when<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.510> comes<00:02:29.569> to

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
the case well I think when it comes to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.240 
the case well I think when it comes to
the<00:02:29.959> bowling<00:02:30.260> department<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:30.890> are<00:02:30.980> still<00:02:31.130> in

bounce we need bowlers who can hold

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.020 
bounce we need bowlers who can hold
quick<00:02:57.140> but<00:02:57.380> then<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.220> get<00:02:58.340> individuals<00:02:58.940> who

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
quick but then you get individuals who

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.789 
quick but then you get individuals who
both<00:02:59.239> quick<00:02:59.510> but<00:02:59.720> they<00:03:00.110> end<00:03:00.230> up<00:03:00.380> giving<00:03:00.470> more

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
both quick but they end up giving more

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.199 
both quick but they end up giving more
runs<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.190> know<00:03:01.280> without<00:03:01.430> even<00:03:01.819> bowling<00:03:02.090> at

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
runs you know without even bowling at

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.350 
runs you know without even bowling at
the<00:03:02.239> slog<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.530> think<00:03:03.680> we'll<00:03:03.890> have<00:03:04.069> to<00:03:04.250> find<00:03:05.180> a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
the slog so I think we'll have to find a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.539 
the slog so I think we'll have to find a
fair<00:03:05.750> balance<00:03:06.019> you<00:03:06.410> know<00:03:06.560> will<00:03:07.069> always<00:03:07.370> be<00:03:07.519> a

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
fair balance you know will always be a

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.009 
fair balance you know will always be a
site<00:03:07.849> that<00:03:07.880> will<00:03:08.180> be<00:03:08.329> known<00:03:08.510> more<00:03:08.750> for<00:03:08.810> our

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
site that will be known more for our

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.530
