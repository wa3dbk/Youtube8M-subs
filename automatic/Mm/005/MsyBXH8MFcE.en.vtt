 found by inpa researchers 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.710
 are concerned about the lack of 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.369
 incentive in planting to increase the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.810
 production of some species one stop

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.609
 I am from the corner of the area that receives the Congo 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.309
 when I have a purchase 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.700

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.160
 here comes changing among so many fruits 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.420
 the natives are no longer so 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.000
 hidden

 for the front of the tent 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.420
 It's okay that they are not yet so 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.000
 sold as peach palm and tucumã 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.260
 most consumed at that time I caught is 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.050
 how to sell cheap because mainly 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.690
 the staff as you come here with the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.520
 people they think we get the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.340
 More people buy from us 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.750
 second and third there we have to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.850
 sell a little more expensive, huh? 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.700
 the iranduba fair at the beginning of the highway 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.200
 manoel mano has a wide variety of 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.110
 native fruits 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.290
 but the price is still high the genipap does not 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.299
 leaves for less than 5 reais and the passion fruit 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.400
 mato can reach the 15 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.830
 most of these fruits derived election 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.640
 from planting to large 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.040
 commercial scale and this implied implies 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.640
 these fruits are very expensive in 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.220
 relation to the fruit is coming from another 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.680
 the price variation and the occurrence of 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.900
 of native fruits were studied 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.600
 for two years for these 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.450
 researchers from inpa they visited ten 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.840
 fairs of the capital the fruits of our 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.619
 land he was a bit like that is for 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.570
 which hid some in the like case of the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.969
 muricy yellow of patauá and other

 species plus research information 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.520
 are gathered in this book that 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.280
 concern may be the chop 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.239
 disappearing it is no longer so common in 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.230
 markets 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.599
 in addition it was observed 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.810
 the need to encourage the planting of 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.420
 some species already known as açaí 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.090
 for example is one of the native fruits that 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.819
 more gained national market and 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.760
 international demand has increased but 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.489
 This did not increase the price of 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.069
 product over the years the Amazon 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.860
 produces an average of about 80 thousand 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.440
 tons have come out every year what 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.450
 The state is still a little bit next year. 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.790
 should start exporting to the states 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.970
 together with the estimation that 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.989
 increase in the rural area of ​​Manaus and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.120
 interior
