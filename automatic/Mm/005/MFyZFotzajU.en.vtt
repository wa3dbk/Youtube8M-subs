this position so you're good to get one
kill<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:27.330> position<00:02:27.690> you're<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:27.900> you're

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
kill in this position you're like you're

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.230 
kill in this position you're like you're
guaranteed<00:02:28.560> almost<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.040> kill<00:02:29.250> but<00:02:29.910> beyond

guaranteed almost the kill but beyond
that<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:30.660> kill<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.680> very<00:02:31.980> difficult<00:02:32.370> for

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
that one kill it's very difficult for

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.230 
that one kill it's very difficult for
you<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.880> actually<00:02:32.910> make<00:02:34.820> additional<00:02:35.820> kills<00:02:36.090> on

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
you to actually make additional kills on

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.630 
you to actually make additional kills on
top<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.200> it's<00:02:37.440> you'll<00:02:38.160> get<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.460> one

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
top of that so it's you'll get the one

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.510 
top of that so it's you'll get the one
and<00:02:38.880> then<00:02:39.120> you're<00:02:39.990> done<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.370> two

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
and then you're done so the two

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.850 
and then you're done so the two
different<00:02:41.820> styles<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.630> off<00:02:43.170> ankle<00:02:43.650> or<00:02:43.800> a

different styles is off ankle or a

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.490 
different styles is off ankle or a
position<00:02:44.490> where<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.750> enemy<00:02:45.780> has<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.290> fully

more than one kill and on counter

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.699 
more than one kill and on counter
terrorists<00:04:03.600> side<00:04:03.750> because<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.290> defense<00:04:04.590> has

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
terrorists side because the defense has

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.620 
terrorists side because the defense has
spread<00:04:04.890> so<00:04:04.950> thin<00:04:05.430> because

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
spread so thin because

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.000 
spread so thin because
because<00:04:08.630> on<00:04:09.080> counter-terror<00:04:09.590> side<00:04:09.740> you<00:04:09.890> have

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
because on counter-terror side you have

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.390 
because on counter-terror side you have
to<00:04:10.130> cover<00:04:10.340> basically<00:04:11.260> B<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.830> and<00:04:12.860> middle

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
to cover basically B and a and middle

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.980 
to cover basically B and a and middle
and<00:04:13.580> just<00:04:13.790> everything<00:04:14.060> like<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.420> entire<00:04:14.660> map

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
and just everything like the entire map

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.740 
and just everything like the entire map
you<00:04:15.770> really<00:04:16.250> need<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.700> make<00:04:16.850> sure<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:19.750> the

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
you really need to make sure that the

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.140 
you really need to make sure that the
defense<00:04:21.350> isn't<00:04:21.530> spread<00:04:21.890> too<00:04:21.950> thin<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.910> Moors

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
defense isn't spread too thin the Moors

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.240 
defense isn't spread too thin the Moors
then<00:04:23.600> you<00:04:23.780> spread<00:04:23.960> your<00:04:24.050> defenses<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.980> harder

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
then you spread your defenses the harder

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.680 
then you spread your defenses the harder
it<00:04:25.340> is<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.460> win<00:04:25.700> their<00:04:25.850> round<00:04:26.030> so<00:04:26.450> if<00:04:26.510> it's<00:04:26.630> a

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
it is to win their round so if it's a

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.390 
it is to win their round so if it's a
four<00:04:26.900> on<00:04:26.930> four<00:04:27.200> for<00:04:27.320> example<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.070> terrorists

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
four on four for example the terrorists

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.160 
four on four for example the terrorists
have<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.520> really<00:04:28.820> easy<00:04:28.970> job<00:04:29.720> winning<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.080> round

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
have a really easy job winning the round

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.570 
have a really easy job winning the round
we're<00:04:30.350> three-on-three<00:04:30.590> for<00:04:31.040> example<00:04:31.340> because

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
we're three-on-three for example because

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.920 
we're three-on-three for example because
you<00:04:31.610> have<00:04:31.940> to<00:04:32.060> put<00:04:32.210> one<00:04:32.420> person<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.780> be

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
you have to put one person that be

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.260 
you have to put one person that be
watching<00:04:33.350> be<00:04:33.470> one<00:04:34.070> person<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.550> watching<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:35.060> and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
watching be one person a watching a and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.060 
watching be one person a watching a and
then<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.810> third<00:04:36.050> person<00:04:36.230> and<00:04:36.620> last<00:04:36.860> person

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
then the third person and last person

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.540 
then the third person and last person
can<00:04:37.640> be<00:04:37.760> anywhere<00:04:38.060> between<00:04:38.210> a<00:04:38.450> or<00:04:38.780> b<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.520> one<00:04:40.520> of

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
can be anywhere between a or b so one of

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.860 
can be anywhere between a or b so one of
the<00:04:40.670> bomb<00:04:40.820> sites<00:04:41.060> is<00:04:41.180> gonna<00:04:41.360> be<00:04:41.450> really<00:04:41.690> weak

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
the bomb sites is gonna be really weak

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.510 
the bomb sites is gonna be really weak
it's<00:04:42.110> only<00:04:42.290> gonna<00:04:42.470> have<00:04:42.620> one<00:04:42.890> person<00:04:42.920> on<00:04:43.280> it<00:04:43.400> at

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
it's only gonna have one person on it at

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.020 
it's only gonna have one person on it at
most<00:04:44.180> so<00:04:45.140> when<00:04:45.950> you<00:04:46.070> spread<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.370> defense<00:04:46.490> thin

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
most so when you spread the defense thin

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.790 
most so when you spread the defense thin
it<00:04:47.270> makes<00:04:47.780> it<00:04:47.870> easy<00:04:48.020> for<00:04:48.140> the<00:04:48.410> terrorists<00:04:48.740> to

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
it makes it easy for the terrorists to

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.440 
it makes it easy for the terrorists to
win<00:04:48.830> so<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.550> counter<00:04:49.820> terrorists<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:50.300> don't

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
win so the counter terrorists you don't

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.510 
win so the counter terrorists you don't
want<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.630> go<00:04:50.840> for<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.050> one-for-one<00:04:51.410> trade<00:04:51.770> you

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
want to go for a one-for-one trade you

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.760 
want to go for a one-for-one trade you
want<00:04:52.670> to<00:04:52.730> go<00:04:52.850> for<00:04:53.120> at<00:04:53.390> least<00:04:53.780> two<00:04:54.080> kills<00:04:54.350> before

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
want to go for at least two kills before

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.590 
want to go for at least two kills before
you<00:04:55.010> go<00:04:55.100> down<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:55.790> instead<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.210> it<00:04:56.360> being<00:04:56.390> a

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
you go down so instead of it being a

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.730 
you go down so instead of it being a
four<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:56.840> four<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:57.200> make<00:04:57.320> it<00:04:57.410> a<00:04:57.440> four<00:04:57.650> and

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
four and four you make it a four and

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.980 
four and four you make it a four and
three<00:04:58.010> in<00:04:58.250> your<00:04:58.580> team's<00:04:58.850> favor<00:04:59.180> because<00:04:59.870> now

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
three in your team's favor because now

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.240 
three in your team's favor because now
you<00:05:00.050> can<00:05:00.230> still<00:05:00.410> have<00:05:00.500> two<00:05:00.620> people<00:05:00.919> be<00:05:01.040> two

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
you can still have two people be two
