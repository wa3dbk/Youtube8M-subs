don't know if it's a one-time use or not

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.330 
don't know if it's a one-time use or not
there<00:04:19.049> might<00:04:19.200> be<00:04:19.230> like<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.799> couple<00:04:20.130> in<00:04:20.220> here

there might be like a couple in here

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.400 
there might be like a couple in here
because<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.639> feels<00:04:20.790> kind<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.090> thick<00:04:21.299> so<00:04:22.260> yeah

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
because it feels kind of thick so yeah

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.310

that<00:04:22.770> was<00:04:22.889> my<00:04:23.040> glim<00:04:23.340> box<00:04:23.730> for<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.450> month<00:04:24.660> I

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
that was my glim box for the month I

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.409 
that was my glim box for the month I
guess<00:04:25.530> July<00:04:25.860> because<00:04:26.160> that's<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:26.880> very<00:04:27.060> first

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
guess July because that's the very first

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.060 
guess July because that's the very first
one<00:04:27.540> that<00:04:27.840> they've<00:04:28.020> put<00:04:28.260> out<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:28.860> want<00:04:29.010> to
