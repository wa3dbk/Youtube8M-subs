00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
those kind of middle

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.610 
those kind of middle

extra point

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.330 
extra point
and<00:01:14.440> I<00:01:14.560> think<00:01:14.620> Tony<00:01:15.100> by<00:01:15.370> Kate<00:01:15.670> who

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340

let's<00:01:18.210> look<00:01:18.329> at<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.600> from<00:01:18.780> different<00:01:19.259> angles

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
let's look at this from different angles

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.370 
let's look at this from different angles
and<00:01:19.740> certainly<00:01:20.009> worth<00:01:20.280> checking<00:01:20.700> out<00:01:21.200> this<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and certainly worth checking out this is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.870 
and certainly worth checking out this is
exactly<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.070> talked<00:01:23.280> about<00:01:23.369> he<00:01:23.579> fakes

exactly what we talked about he fakes
the<00:01:24.119> same<00:01:24.359> thing<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.869> gets<00:01:25.289> it<00:01:25.439> up<00:01:25.560> their

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the same thing and gets it up their

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.529 
the same thing and gets it up their
leaves<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.969> can<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.270> caught

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
leaves it out there so it can be caught
