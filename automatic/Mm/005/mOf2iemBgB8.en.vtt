00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.780 

okay<00:00:00.989> so<00:00:01.050> what<00:00:01.530> we<00:00:01.650> have<00:00:01.770> here<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.100> cylinder

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
okay so what we have here is a cylinder

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.260 
okay so what we have here is a cylinder
head<00:00:02.939> off<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.200> 2004<00:00:04.279> f-150<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.700> this<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.089> the

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
head off a 2004 f-150 and this is the

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.030 
head off a 2004 f-150 and this is the
three<00:00:06.540> valve<00:00:06.779> by<00:00:07.259> four<00:00:07.620> cylinder<00:00:08.280> head<00:00:08.460> and

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
three valve by four cylinder head and

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.999 
three valve by four cylinder head and
not<00:00:11.040> too<00:00:11.160> often<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.429> get<00:00:11.610> one<00:00:11.730> off<00:00:11.910> but<00:00:13.009> wanted

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
not too often I get one off but wanted

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.730 
not too often I get one off but wanted
to<00:00:14.360> neither<00:00:15.360> had<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.719> off<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.990> wanted<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.289> take<00:00:16.710> a

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
to neither had it off I wanted to take a

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.279 
to neither had it off I wanted to take a
chance<00:00:17.039> here<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.490> show<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:18.020> exactly<00:00:19.020> what

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
chance here and show you exactly what

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.230 
chance here and show you exactly what
happens<00:00:19.320> when<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.070> spark<00:00:20.400> plugs<00:00:20.670> break<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
happens when the spark plugs break and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.720 
happens when the spark plugs break and
this<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:21.990> here<00:00:22.230> reads<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.369> did<00:00:23.550> break

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
this one here reads it and it did break

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.580 
this one here reads it and it did break
a<00:00:23.789> spark<00:00:24.150> plug<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.449> tried<00:00:24.720> removing<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.230> after

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
a spark plug I tried removing it after

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.349 
a spark plug I tried removing it after
head<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.830> head<00:00:25.949> off<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.400> uh<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.789> thought<00:00:27.240> it

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
head to head off so uh I thought it

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.550 
head to head off so uh I thought it
would<00:00:27.449> take<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.689> look<00:00:27.869> at<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.260> see<00:00:28.439> what

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
would take a look at it and see what

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.109 
would take a look at it and see what
happens

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
happens

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.700 
happens
see<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.390> looks<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> backside

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
see what it looks like in the backside

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.750 
see what it looks like in the backside
actually<00:00:33.680> these<00:00:34.680> spark<00:00:35.010> plugs<00:00:35.280> don't<00:00:35.579> look

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
actually these spark plugs don't look

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.280 
actually these spark plugs don't look
aren't<00:00:36.450> really<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> worst<00:00:36.960> shape<00:00:42.020> because<00:00:43.020> if

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
aren't really the worst shape because if

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.380 
aren't really the worst shape because if
you<00:00:43.440> look<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.829> spark<00:00:44.219> plug<00:00:44.460> closely<00:00:45.149> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
you look at that spark plug closely and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.490 
you look at that spark plug closely and
this<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:46.500> that's<00:00:46.620> broke<00:00:46.950> off<00:00:48.500> what's

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
this is the one that's broke off what's

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.020 
this is the one that's broke off what's
left<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.920> inside<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.670> still<00:00:50.879> be

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
left on the inside is we still be

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.150 
left on the inside is we still be
grounding<00:00:51.469> electrode<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.649> then<00:00:52.739> we<00:00:52.920> still

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
grounding electrode and then we still

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.420 
grounding electrode and then we still
have<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> voltage<00:00:54.270> or<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.920> load<00:00:55.920> electrode

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
have the voltage or the load electrode

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.599 
have the voltage or the load electrode
is<00:00:56.579> still<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:56.940> there<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:58.620> porcelain<00:00:59.160> I'll

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
is still on there and the porcelain I'll

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.729 
is still on there and the porcelain I'll
try<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.120> show<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.420> properly<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
try to show that properly here with the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.290 
try to show that properly here with the
light<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.000> still<00:01:03.180> on

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
light but you can see that it's still on

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
light but you can see that it's still on
and<00:01:03.870> what<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.229> want<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> make<00:01:04.619> sure<00:01:04.830> before

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
and what you want to make sure before

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.830 
and what you want to make sure before
you<00:01:05.850> start<00:01:06.710> removing<00:01:07.880> your<00:01:08.880> removal<00:01:09.299> process

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you start removing your removal process

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.649 
you start removing your removal process
with<00:01:10.020> your<00:01:10.260> removal<00:01:10.710> tool<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.420> there's<00:01:12.420> two

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
with your removal tool here there's two

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.750 
with your removal tool here there's two
different<00:01:12.810> styles<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.409> get<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:14.250> that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
different styles I get the one that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
different styles I get the one that
threads<00:01:15.119> into<00:01:15.330> actually<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.560> more<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.770> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
threads into actually it's more like a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.770 
threads into actually it's more like a
tap<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.490> die<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.420> which<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
tap and die in this one here which is a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.530 
tap and die in this one here which is a
little<00:01:18.990> coarser<00:01:19.970> thread<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.330> still

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
little coarser thread but it's still

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.240 
little coarser thread but it's still
basically<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.020> tap<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.590> then<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> pulse<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
basically a tap and then the pulse that

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.210 
basically a tap and then the pulse that
pulls<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.030> remaining<00:01:24.960> spark<00:01:25.320> plug<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.770> remain

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
pulls the remaining spark plug to remain

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.060 
pulls the remaining spark plug to remain
in<00:01:26.670> part<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.090> spark<00:01:27.390> plug<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.380> before

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
in part of the spark plug out but before

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.069 
in part of the spark plug out but before
you<00:01:29.369> go<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.610> push<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.090> porcelain<00:01:30.450> through

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
you go and push that porcelain through

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.859 
you go and push that porcelain through
you<00:01:31.860> want<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> make<00:01:32.250> sure<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.540> can

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you want to make sure that you can

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.410 
you want to make sure that you can
remove<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.520> what's<00:01:35.520> left<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> electrode

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
remove that what's left of the electrode

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.240 
remove that what's left of the electrode
in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.600> center<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.170> or<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.890> will<00:01:37.979> happen

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
in the center there or what will happen

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.980 
in the center there or what will happen
when<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.430> start<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.759> push<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.299> there's<00:01:39.900> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
when you start to push that there's a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.760 
when you start to push that there's a
good<00:01:40.110> possibility<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:42.630> either<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.350> center

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
good possibility that either that center

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.060 
good possibility that either that center
electrode<00:01:43.979> falls<00:01:44.520> into<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.030> cylinder<00:01:45.780> or

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
electrode falls into the cylinder or

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.740 
electrode falls into the cylinder or
part<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.250> grounding<00:01:47.759> strap<00:01:48.060> part<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.689> the

part of this grounding strap part of the
grounding<00:01:49.140> electrode<00:01:49.649> will<00:01:50.030> will<00:01:51.030> fall<00:01:51.270> into

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
grounding electrode will will fall into

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.780 
grounding electrode will will fall into
the<00:01:51.689> cylinder<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:53.399> one<00:01:53.579> right<00:01:53.729> here

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the cylinder and I have one right here

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.030 
the cylinder and I have one right here
where<00:01:54.149> that's<00:01:54.600> exactly<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:55.530> happened<00:01:55.890> is

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
where that's exactly what happened is

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.940 
where that's exactly what happened is
that<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:57.140> electoral<00:01:58.140> push<00:01:58.469> through<00:01:58.799> the

that the electoral push through the
grounding<00:01:59.399> strap<00:01:59.729> on<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.659> spark<00:02:01.140> plug<00:02:01.380> and

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
grounding strap on that spark plug and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.959 
grounding strap on that spark plug and
the<00:02:03.380> horseshoe<00:02:04.380> shaped<00:02:04.710> part<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.310> fell

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
the horseshoe shaped part of that fell

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.520 
the horseshoe shaped part of that fell
right<00:02:06.180> into<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.630> cylinder<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.200> not<00:02:07.380> why

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
right into the cylinder that's not why

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.109 
right into the cylinder that's not why
we<00:02:07.710> had<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.009> head<00:02:08.190> off<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.759> from

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
we had this head off but this is from

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.639 
we had this head off but this is from
another

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
another

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.860 
another
sample<00:02:10.009> where<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.429> where<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.150> happened<00:02:11.720> so

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
sample where that where that happened so

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.770 
sample where that where that happened so
before<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.760> start<00:02:13.760> your<00:02:13.909> removal<00:02:14.329> process

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
before you start your removal process

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.210 
before you start your removal process
you<00:02:14.930> want<00:02:15.019> to<00:02:15.110> make<00:02:15.200> sure<00:02:15.409> you<00:02:15.590> pull<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.040> out

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
you want to make sure you pull that out

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.640 
you want to make sure you pull that out
and<00:02:16.519> I'll<00:02:17.390> put<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.689> head<00:02:17.870> back<00:02:17.900> over<00:02:18.439> here

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
and I'll put the head back over here

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:37.599 
and I'll put the head back over here
again<00:02:35.230> yeah<00:02:36.230> was<00:02:36.560> this<00:02:36.680> plug<00:02:37.159> hole<00:02:37.400> right<00:02:37.549> here

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
again yeah was this plug hole right here

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.080 
again yeah was this plug hole right here
if<00:02:37.879> you<00:02:38.000> look<00:02:38.120> in<00:02:38.329> there<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.810> can<00:02:39.349> see<00:02:39.560> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
if you look in there you can see the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.000 
if you look in there you can see the
what's<00:02:41.090> left<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.810> spark<00:02:42.409> plug<00:02:42.650> from<00:02:42.889> the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
what's left of the spark plug from the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.349 
what's left of the spark plug from the
inside<00:02:45.790> here<00:02:47.739> try<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:48.950> reach<00:02:49.129> in<00:02:49.310> there<00:02:49.549> with

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
inside here try and reach in there with

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:57.970 
inside here try and reach in there with
my<00:02:50.480> needle<00:02:50.659> nose<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.930> grab<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.530> there

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
my needle nose and grab it and there

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.140 
my needle nose and grab it and there
with<00:02:58.129> it<00:02:58.310> there<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.760> is

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
with it there it is

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.789 
with it there it is
that's<00:03:01.689> what's<00:03:02.689> left<00:03:02.959> of<00:03:03.049> that<00:03:03.109> electrode<00:03:03.650> and

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
that's what's left of that electrode and

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.289 
that's what's left of that electrode and
it<00:03:03.859> does<00:03:04.099> have<00:03:04.280> sort<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.579> a<00:03:04.639> little<00:03:04.730> head<00:03:05.000> on<00:03:05.150> it

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
it does have sort of a little head on it

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.729 
it does have sort of a little head on it
so<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.510> doesn't<00:03:05.659> fall<00:03:05.930> through<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.290> porcelain

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
so it doesn't fall through the porcelain

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.830 
so it doesn't fall through the porcelain
but<00:03:06.920> again<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.370> danger<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:07.819> that<00:03:07.849> where<00:03:08.750> you

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
but again the danger is that where you

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.349 
but again the danger is that where you
if<00:03:09.049> you<00:03:09.200> push<00:03:09.439> that<00:03:09.680> through<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.879> breaks<00:03:11.150> you

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
if you push that through it breaks you

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.720 
if you push that through it breaks you
grounding<00:03:11.989> strap<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.620> spark<00:03:13.310> plug<00:03:13.549> in

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
grounding strap on that spark plug in

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.970 
grounding strap on that spark plug in
then<00:03:13.879> you'll<00:03:14.629> have<00:03:14.780> bits<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.650> pieces<00:03:15.799> of

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
then you'll have bits and pieces of

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.500 
then you'll have bits and pieces of
metal<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.609> you're<00:03:16.819> selling<00:03:17.120> there<00:03:17.239> which<00:03:17.329> are

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
metal and you're selling there which are

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.460 
metal and you're selling there which are
a<00:03:17.540> lot<00:03:17.690> harder<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:19.220> remove<00:03:19.519> then<00:03:20.150> than<00:03:21.109> just

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
a lot harder to remove then than just

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.839 
a lot harder to remove then than just
blowing<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.859> porcelain<00:03:22.280> out<00:03:22.430> with<00:03:22.579> an<00:03:22.699> air

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
blowing the porcelain out with an air

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.430 
blowing the porcelain out with an air
gun<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:25.040> that's<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.549> three<00:03:26.180> four<00:03:26.449> I<00:03:26.720> should

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
gun so and that's a three four I should

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.849 
gun so and that's a three four I should
say<00:03:27.620> five<00:03:28.129> four<00:03:28.430> three<00:03:28.780> valve<00:03:29.780> port<00:03:30.349> cylinder
