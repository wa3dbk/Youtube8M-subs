out<00:02:44.820> too<00:02:45.030> well<00:02:45.240> for<00:02:45.510> him<00:02:45.930> because<00:02:46.050> BC<00:02:46.380> was<00:02:46.620> able

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.490 
out too well for him because BC was able
to<00:02:46.890> fend<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.850> off<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.360> he<00:02:48.420> didn't<00:02:48.720> support<00:02:49.140> his

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500

own economy at home so once that attack

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.780 
own economy at home so once that attack
failed<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.320> didn't<00:02:55.500> work<00:02:55.650> out<00:02:55.800> too<00:02:55.860> well<00:02:56.070> for

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
him pieces inside the base here it's

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.710 
him pieces inside the base here it's
probably<00:03:00.750> gonna<00:03:00.840> see<00:03:01.080> this<00:03:01.370> Expo<00:03:02.370> behind<00:03:02.940> calm

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
probably gonna see this Expo behind calm

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.500 
probably gonna see this Expo behind calm
space<00:03:04.460> he's<00:03:05.460> gonna<00:03:05.640> be<00:03:05.760> suspecting<00:03:06.390> as

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
space he's gonna be suspecting as

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.060 
space he's gonna be suspecting as
something<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:06.990> up<00:03:07.140> here<00:03:09.500> once<00:03:10.500> he<00:03:10.650> sees<00:03:10.830> the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
something is up here once he sees the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.640 
something is up here once he sees the
lack<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.340> buildings<00:03:15.020> these<00:03:16.020> are<00:03:16.170> actually<00:03:16.470> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
lack of buildings these are actually the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.760 
lack of buildings these are actually the
exact<00:03:17.010> positions<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.630> July<00:03:19.080> versus<00:03:19.530> PC

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
exact positions of the July versus PC

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.620 
exact positions of the July versus PC
match<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.580> definitely<00:03:21.120> has<00:03:21.210> some<00:03:21.450> nice

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
match so this definitely has some nice

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.060 
match so this definitely has some nice

from<00:03:59.660> planting<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:01.350> hatchery<00:04:03.740> sacrifices<00:04:04.740> a

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
from planting the hatchery sacrifices a

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.420 
from planting the hatchery sacrifices a
few<00:04:05.840> pylons<00:04:06.840> there<00:04:06.990> and<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.130> know<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.250> few

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
few pylons there and you know a few

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.680 
few pylons there and you know a few
minerals<00:04:08.640> there<00:04:09.410> put<00:04:10.410> up<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.530> pylon<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:12.540> now

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
minerals there put up that pylon and now

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.820 
minerals there put up that pylon and now
I<00:04:12.720> think<00:04:14.510> calm<00:04:15.510> is<00:04:15.720> still<00:04:15.990> gonna<00:04:16.170> let<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.560> hat

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
I think calm is still gonna let that hat

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.010 
I think calm is still gonna let that hat
tree<00:04:17.100> come<00:04:18.000> up<00:04:18.180> there<00:04:18.390> it<00:04:18.479> looks<00:04:18.660> like<00:04:18.840> he's

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
tree come up there it looks like he's

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.510 
tree come up there it looks like he's
going<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:19.260> put<00:04:19.380> another<00:04:19.590> hatchery<00:04:19.799> down<00:04:20.160> right

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
going to put another hatchery down right

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.610 
going to put another hatchery down right
beside<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.270> right<00:04:22.080> to<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.320> left<00:04:22.530> of<00:04:22.740> it

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
beside to it right to the left of it

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.529 
beside to it right to the left of it
and<00:04:24.620> that's<00:04:24.800> gonna<00:04:24.979> let<00:04:25.220> them<00:04:25.340> get<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.060> normal

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
and that's gonna let them get a normal

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:32.140 
and that's gonna let them get a normal
mining<00:04:26.870> base<00:04:27.050> there<00:04:30.009> a<00:04:31.009> bit<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.639> commitment

mining base there a bit of a commitment
on<00:04:32.240> calms<00:04:32.630> part<00:04:32.900> I<00:04:32.990> think<00:04:33.229> putting<00:04:33.440> down<00:04:33.650> that

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
on calms part I think putting down that

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.150 
on calms part I think putting down that
hatchery<00:04:35.090> there<00:04:35.360> this<00:04:36.319> looks<00:04:36.530> like<00:04:36.740> some<00:04:37.130> kind

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
hatchery there this looks like some kind

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.150 
hatchery there this looks like some kind
of<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.759> four<00:04:38.180> hatch<00:04:39.280> hydro<00:04:40.280> bill<00:04:40.490> toomey<00:04:42.160> visa

too<00:07:40.680> I<00:07:40.710> think<00:07:40.860> it<00:07:41.099> was<00:07:41.219> the<00:07:41.779> evolution<00:07:42.779> Dan

down<00:07:49.770> I<00:07:49.949> think<00:07:50.009> calm<00:07:50.389> has<00:07:51.389> to<00:07:51.539> get<00:07:51.659> C<00:07:51.779> troops

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.110 
down I think calm has to get C troops

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.520 
down I think calm has to get C troops
out<00:07:52.349> here<00:07:52.590> to<00:07:52.710> deal<00:07:52.889> with<00:07:53.009> these<00:07:53.099> forces
