all your body that you can you see her

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.130 
all your body that you can you see her
he's<00:02:11.940> still<00:02:12.810> okay<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.350> maybe<00:02:14.690> at<00:02:15.690> nine<00:02:15.870> hundred

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
he's still okay so maybe at nine hundred

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.620 
he's still okay so maybe at nine hundred
and<00:02:16.200> plus<00:02:16.380> kilometers<00:02:17.070> today<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.360> zone

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
and plus kilometers today then a zone

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.420 
and plus kilometers today then a zone
was<00:02:18.780> not<00:02:18.900> very<00:02:18.990> easy<00:02:19.170> altitude<00:02:19.830> was<00:02:19.980> four<00:02:20.370> and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
was not very easy altitude was four and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.290 
was not very easy altitude was four and
a<00:02:20.520> half<00:02:20.550> four<00:02:20.910> thousand<00:02:21.180> eight<00:02:21.270> hundred

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
a half four thousand eight hundred

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.660 
a half four thousand eight hundred
meters<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.720> think<00:02:21.900> we<00:02:22.530> went<00:02:22.709> from<00:02:22.920> minus<00:02:23.490> five

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
meters I think we went from minus five

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.710 
meters I think we went from minus five
to<00:02:23.970> thirty<00:02:24.810> five<00:02:24.990> degrees<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.720> change

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
to thirty five degrees so that change

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.270 
to thirty five degrees so that change
was<00:02:27.930> not<00:02:28.080> very<00:02:28.230> easy<00:02:28.380> for<00:02:28.530> me<00:02:28.770> altitude<00:02:29.160> was

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
was not very easy for me altitude was

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.780 
was not very easy for me altitude was
not<00:02:29.910> easy<00:02:30.090> as<00:02:30.240> well<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.690> then<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.550> stage

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
not easy as well and then the stage

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.850 
not easy as well and then the stage
itself<00:02:32.910> was<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.360> liked<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.170> liked<00:02:34.380> rocks<00:02:34.650> and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
itself was I liked it I liked rocks and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.100 
itself was I liked it I liked rocks and
Alex<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.490> it<00:02:35.700> was<00:02:35.820> both<00:02:35.970> unfortunately<00:02:36.900> I

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
Alex and and it was both unfortunately I

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.500 
Alex and and it was both unfortunately I
was<00:02:37.860> almost<00:02:38.370> leading<00:02:38.790> at<00:02:38.880> some<00:02:39.060> point<00:02:39.270> and

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
was almost leading at some point and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.050 
was almost leading at some point and
then<00:02:39.600> two<00:02:40.560> punctures<00:02:40.800> one<00:02:41.760> after<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.030> other

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
then two punctures one after the other

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.090 
then two punctures one after the other
so<00:02:42.420> couldn't<00:02:43.200> really<00:02:43.320> push<00:02:43.530> but<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.739> finished

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
so couldn't really push but I finished

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.970 
so couldn't really push but I finished
and<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.940> think<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.180> finished<00:02:45.450> third<00:02:45.620> like<00:02:46.620> 12

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
and I think I finished third like 12

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.699 
and I think I finished third like 12
minutes<00:02:47.160> behind<00:02:47.340> first<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.760> think<00:02:48.410> not<00:02:49.410> very

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
minutes behind first I think not very

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.190 
minutes behind first I think not very
like<00:02:50.010> not<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.550> bad<00:02:50.700> for<00:02:50.880> me<00:02:50.970> but<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.510> expected

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
like not that bad for me but I expected

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.650 
like not that bad for me but I expected
to<00:02:52.260> win<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.440> stage<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.770> be<00:02:52.830> honest<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:53.340> course

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
to win the stage to be honest of course

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.110 
to win the stage to be honest of course
you<00:02:54.660> usually<00:02:54.959> have<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.610> flat<00:02:56.610> tire<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.970> lose

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
you usually have a flat tire you lose

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.199 
you usually have a flat tire you lose
about<00:02:57.300> five<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.690> ten<00:02:57.810> minutes<00:02:57.840> per<00:02:58.530> tire<00:02:58.739> I

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
about five to ten minutes per tire I

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.739 
about five to ten minutes per tire I
lost<00:03:00.209> 12<00:03:00.480> for<00:03:00.690> both<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.020> I'm<00:03:01.440> pretty<00:03:01.650> happy
