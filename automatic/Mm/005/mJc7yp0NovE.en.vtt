that<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:13.200> my<00:01:13.290> son's<00:01:13.530> idea<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.340> think<00:01:14.549> it

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that was my son's idea and I think it

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.480 
that was my son's idea and I think it
worked<00:01:14.790> well<00:01:15.380> but<00:01:16.380> otherwise<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:17.009> kind<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.340> put

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
worked well but otherwise we kind of put

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.890 
worked well but otherwise we kind of put
two<00:01:17.670> pallets<00:01:18.150> together<00:01:19.369> all<00:01:20.369> throughout

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
protection which is important for when

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.950 
protection which is important for when
doing<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.650> nerf<00:01:31.829> war<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.939> had<00:01:33.060> some<00:01:33.270> camouflage

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
doing a nerf war we had some camouflage

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
doing a nerf war we had some camouflage
face<00:01:34.439> paint<00:01:34.740> -<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:35.340> pretty<00:01:35.520> cool<00:01:35.640> got

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
face paint - that was pretty cool got

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.210 
face paint - that was pretty cool got
that<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.329> Amazon<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.020> few<00:01:37.170> bucks<00:01:37.350> but

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that on Amazon for a few bucks but

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.660 
that on Amazon for a few bucks but
basically<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:39.060> put<00:01:39.240> two<00:01:39.420> pallets<00:01:39.810> together

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
basically you put two pallets together

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.330 
basically you put two pallets together
position<00:01:41.670> them<00:01:41.820> together<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> V<00:01:43.250> so<00:01:44.250> you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
position them together like a V so you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.980 
position them together like a V so you
bring<00:01:44.610> them<00:01:44.729> together<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.780> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
bring them together just like that and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.260 
bring them together just like that and
then<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> couple<00:01:47.579> pieces<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.850> wood<00:01:48.060> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
then get a couple pieces of wood and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.219 
then get a couple pieces of wood and
then<00:01:49.280> screw<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.479> this<00:01:51.479> piece<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.840> wood<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
then screw in this piece of wood on the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.080 
then screw in this piece of wood on the
top<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.189> another<00:01:53.430> piece<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.729> wood<00:01:53.939> on

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
top and then another piece of wood on

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330 
top and then another piece of wood on
the<00:01:54.210> bottom<00:01:54.360> there<00:01:55.259> wasn't<00:01:55.530> space<00:01:55.770> there<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.310> I

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
the bottom there wasn't space there so I

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.969 
the bottom there wasn't space there so I
put<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:57.000> piece<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.600> wood<00:01:57.920> right<00:01:58.920> here<00:02:00.979> that's

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
put one piece of wood right here that's

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.679 
put one piece of wood right here that's
really<00:02:02.219> enough<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.909> keep<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.240> pallets

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
really enough to keep the pallets

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.620 
really enough to keep the pallets
together<00:02:04.729> in<00:02:05.729> order<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> good<00:02:06.390> time

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
together in order to have a good time

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.749 
together in order to have a good time
and<00:02:06.869> then<00:02:07.290> we<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.649> stuck<00:02:07.890> branches<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.550> there

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
and then we just stuck branches in there

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.929 
and then we just stuck branches in there
to<00:02:09.300> kind<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.539> give<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.869> jungle<00:02:10.140> look

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:11.939 
to kind of give it a jungle look

one<00:02:44.819> I<00:02:45.030> got<00:02:45.719> some<00:02:45.959> scrap<00:02:46.230> wood<00:02:46.260> that's<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.799> full

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
one I got some scrap wood that's a full

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.640 
one I got some scrap wood that's a full
2x4<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.060> it's<00:02:48.209> about<00:02:48.389> eight<00:02:48.629> feet<00:02:48.900> long<00:02:49.139> and

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
2x4 so it's about eight feet long and

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.860 
2x4 so it's about eight feet long and
then<00:02:50.370> just<00:02:50.609> made<00:02:50.849> it<00:02:50.969> work<00:02:51.180> okay

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
then just made it work okay

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.390 
then just made it work okay
and<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.290> these<00:02:52.409> aren't<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.889> most<00:02:53.040> sturdy

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
and so these aren't the most sturdy

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.280 
and so these aren't the most sturdy
things<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:53.879> the<00:02:53.969> world<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.510> they're<00:02:54.930> sturdy

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
things in the world but they're sturdy

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.759 
things in the world but they're sturdy
enough<00:02:55.439> for<00:02:56.000> having<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.060> kid's<00:02:57.269> birthday<00:02:57.419> party

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.559 
side and really what you can do
specially<00:03:05.159> since<00:03:05.219> it<00:03:05.489> was<00:03:05.579> wet<00:03:05.760> out<00:03:05.909> here<00:03:05.939> here

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
specially since it was wet out here here

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.439 
specially since it was wet out here here
was<00:03:06.689> some<00:03:06.840> PVC<00:03:07.169> pipe<00:03:07.319> from<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.739> garage<00:03:08.099> and<00:03:09.000> I

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:09.449 
was some PVC pipe from the garage and I

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.539 
was some PVC pipe from the garage and I
simply<00:03:09.750> hammered<00:03:10.199> it<00:03:10.319> in<00:03:10.439> the<00:03:10.560> ground<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.189> so

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
simply hammered it in the ground and so

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:20.830 
simply hammered it in the ground and so
that<00:03:12.540> worked<00:03:12.719> out<00:03:12.840> perfectly

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.900
