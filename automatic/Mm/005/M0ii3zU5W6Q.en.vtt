00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
OtterBox Commuter case on here because

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.029 
OtterBox Commuter case on here because
this<00:00:17.539> docking<00:00:18.539> system<00:00:18.960> actually<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.800> hold

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
this docking system actually can hold

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.250 
this docking system actually can hold
the<00:00:20.640> OtterBox<00:00:21.800> as<00:00:23.090> we<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.240> most<00:00:24.480> docks<00:00:24.869> do

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the OtterBox as we know most docks do

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.089 
the OtterBox as we know most docks do
not<00:00:26.180> have<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.359> ability<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.840> mount<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:29.869> an

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
not have the ability to mount with an

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.420 
not have the ability to mount with an
otterbox<00:00:32.099> Commuter<00:00:32.820> case<00:00:33.739> but<00:00:34.739> well<00:00:34.920> before<00:00:35.399> I

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
otterbox Commuter case but well before I

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.299 
otterbox Commuter case but well before I
put<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:36.030> let<00:00:36.420> me<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.510> show<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.309> this

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
put that on let me just show you this

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.090 
put that on let me just show you this
wire<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.940> comes<00:00:39.180> with<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.260> docking<00:00:40.500> system

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
wire that comes with the docking system

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.420 
wire that comes with the docking system
number<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.300> nine<00:00:42.480> feet<00:00:42.750> long<00:00:43.430> so

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
number one it's nine feet long so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.279 
number one it's nine feet long so
basically<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.180> could<00:00:45.510> put<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.899> my<00:00:46.050> back

the<00:01:19.020> car<00:01:19.290> charger

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
the car charger

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.050 
the car charger
and<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:22.710> there<00:01:23.710> is<00:01:23.859> actually<00:01:24.100> an<00:01:24.429> auxilary

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
and then there is actually an auxilary

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.889 
and then there is actually an auxilary
output<00:01:25.929> for<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:27.100> car<00:01:27.280> stereo<00:01:30.539> so<00:01:31.539> let's<00:01:31.780> see

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
output for the car stereo so let's see

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.080 
output for the car stereo so let's see
what<00:01:32.049> happens<00:01:32.380> when<00:01:32.590> I<00:01:32.860> connect<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.579> galaxy

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
what happens when I connect the galaxy

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:42.419 
what happens when I connect the galaxy
s3<00:01:39.630> okay<00:01:40.659> instantly<00:01:41.439> goes<00:01:41.649> into<00:01:41.920> dock<00:01:42.130> mode

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
s3 okay instantly goes into dock mode

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.149 
s3 okay instantly goes into dock mode
and<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:43.420> gets<00:01:43.659> it<00:01:43.869> goes<00:01:44.530> right<00:01:44.740> into<00:01:44.890> voice

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
and it gets it goes right into voice

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.889 
and it gets it goes right into voice
activation<00:01:45.670> mode<00:01:46.000> this<00:01:46.209> way<00:01:46.390> when<00:01:46.750> you're

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
activation mode this way when you're

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.550 
activation mode this way when you're
driving<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.530> use<00:01:47.740> voice<00:01:48.100> activation<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:50.079> like

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
driving and use voice activation so like

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.089 
driving and use voice activation so like
you<00:01:50.709> would<00:01:50.829> say<00:01:50.979> hi<00:01:51.509> hi<00:01:52.509> galaxy<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.349> it<00:01:53.979> would

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
you would say hi hi galaxy and it would

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
you would say hi hi galaxy and it would
wake<00:01:54.280> up<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:56.610> did<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:57.729> hear<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.000> music
