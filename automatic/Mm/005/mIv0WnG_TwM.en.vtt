there's<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> relay<00:00:54.030> you're<00:00:54.270> seeing<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
there's a relay you're seeing in the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
there's a relay you're seeing in the
picture<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.590> takes<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> batteries

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
picture that really takes the batteries

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.760 
picture that really takes the batteries
from<00:00:56.670> parallel<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.629> series<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.350> starts<00:00:58.680> at

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
from parallel to series so it starts at

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.150 
from parallel to series so it starts at
24<00:00:59.309> volts<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.940> had<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.079> take<00:01:01.260> apart<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.800> relay

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
24 volts I had to take apart that relay

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.579 
24 volts I had to take apart that relay
and<00:01:02.430> sybbie<00:01:03.210> blast<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.750> parts<00:01:04.019> inside<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.530> in

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and sybbie blast the parts inside it in

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.190 
and sybbie blast the parts inside it in
the<00:01:04.650> contacts<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.309> order<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.760> work

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
the contacts in order to get to work

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.770 
the contacts in order to get to work
then<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.320> barrel<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.710> couple<00:01:08.070> big<00:01:08.310> d9<00:01:09.150> batteries

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
then we barrel a couple big d9 batteries

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.230 
then we barrel a couple big d9 batteries
out<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.110> my<00:01:10.229> RV<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:11.369> attempted<00:01:11.909> starting

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
out of my RV we attempted starting

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.179 
out of my RV we attempted starting
earlier<00:01:12.659> with<00:01:12.810> two<00:01:12.960> car<00:01:13.229> batteries<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> was

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
earlier with two car batteries it was

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:26.280 
earlier with two car batteries it was
not<00:01:14.369> enough<00:01:14.729> amperage<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.420> start<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> engine

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.780 

well<00:01:27.290> let's<00:01:27.500> turn<00:01:27.710> on<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.950> ignition<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.549> see

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
well let's turn on the ignition and see

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.649 
well let's turn on the ignition and see
what<00:01:28.970> happens

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
what happens

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.320 
what happens
wish<00:01:30.080> me<00:01:30.290> luck
