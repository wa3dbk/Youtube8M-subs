redwood<00:02:30.010> inside<00:02:30.370> this<00:02:30.580> house<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.120> is

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
redwood inside this house is is

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.160 
redwood inside this house is is
fantastic<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.540> what<00:02:34.690> we're<00:02:34.840> doing<00:02:34.870> is

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
fantastic and so what we're doing is

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.600 
fantastic and so what we're doing is
just<00:02:35.230> really<00:02:35.560> tightening<00:02:35.920> up<00:02:36.070> all<00:02:36.220> this<00:02:36.370> loose

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
just really tightening up all this loose

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.550 
just really tightening up all this loose
sidings<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.180> think<00:02:37.390> water<00:02:37.570> got<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:38.080> it<00:02:38.230> just<00:02:38.440> got

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
sidings I think water got in it just got

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.580 
sidings I think water got in it just got
loose<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.160> just<00:02:39.400> moving<00:02:40.330> around<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:41.470> know

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
loose and just moving around you know

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.380 
loose and just moving around you know
the<00:02:41.860> Sun<00:02:42.100> bakes<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:43.080> stucco<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.110> then<00:02:44.410> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
the Sun bakes the stucco and then the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.850 
the Sun bakes the stucco and then the
stucco<00:02:46.390> bakes<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.959> paper<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.650> then<00:02:47.709> with<00:02:47.830> a

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
stucco bakes the paper and then with a

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.300 
stucco bakes the paper and then with a
leak<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.430> just<00:02:49.140> came<00:02:50.140> apart<00:02:50.350> here<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.130> just

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
leak it just came apart here and just

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.080 
leak it just came apart here and just
for<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.459> record<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:53.430> for<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.490> record<00:02:54.820> I<00:02:54.910> did

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
for the record I for the record I did

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.540 
for the record I for the record I did
not<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.510> did<00:02:55.810> not<00:02:56.110> cut<00:02:56.410> any<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.709> this<00:02:56.890> wire<00:02:57.220> I

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
not I did not cut any of this wire I

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.940 
not I did not cut any of this wire I
just<00:02:58.000> chipped<00:02:58.300> it<00:02:58.420> off<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.320> was<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.800> was

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
just chipped it off and it was it was

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.750 
just chipped it off and it was it was
broken<00:03:00.330> all<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.630> way<00:03:01.750> through<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:04.260> maybe

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
broken all the way through so maybe

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.960 
broken all the way through so maybe
maybe<00:03:07.950> there<00:03:08.950> could<00:03:09.160> be<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.340> combination<00:03:09.640> of

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
maybe there could be a combination of

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.640 
maybe there could be a combination of
things<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.330> maybe<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.720> house<00:03:10.870> did<00:03:11.170> shift<00:03:11.440> a

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
things to maybe the house did shift a

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.320 
things to maybe the house did shift a
bit<00:03:11.680> or<00:03:11.950> just<00:03:11.980> expanded<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:12.910> much<00:03:13.090> with<00:03:13.239> the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
bit or just expanded so much with the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.690 
bit or just expanded so much with the
wire<00:03:13.510> broke<00:03:13.810> but<00:03:14.220> we're<00:03:15.220> going<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.459> tie<00:03:15.640> this

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
wire broke but we're going to tie this

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.720 
wire broke but we're going to tie this
together<00:03:16.770> this<00:03:17.770> whole<00:03:17.950> thing<00:03:18.190> together<00:03:18.370> this

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
together this whole thing together this

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.120 
together this whole thing together this
is<00:03:18.880> just<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.180> beginning<00:03:19.270> of<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.720> piece<00:03:20.050> that<00:03:21.040> I

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
is just the beginning of a piece that I

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.729 
is just the beginning of a piece that I
I<00:03:21.670> cut<00:03:22.150> out<00:03:22.180> here<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:23.080> I'm<00:03:23.560> going<00:03:23.680> to

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
I cut out here this is I'm going to

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.290 
I cut out here this is I'm going to
prime<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.190> before<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.670> goes<00:03:24.790> in<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:25.180> you

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
prime this before it goes in but you

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.030 
prime this before it goes in but you
could<00:03:25.450> see<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:27.700> fits<00:03:28.000> in<00:03:28.209> here<00:03:28.239> like<00:03:29.040> like

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
could see it it fits in here like like

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.690 
could see it it fits in here like like
so<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.989> that's<00:03:32.290> going<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.070> get<00:03:33.160> moved<00:03:33.370> over<00:03:33.489> a

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
so and that's going to get moved over a

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.010 
so and that's going to get moved over a
bitch<00:03:33.910> but<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.540> idea<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:34.900> to

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
bitch but the idea is to

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.020 
bitch but the idea is to
we're<00:03:36.650> going<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:36.860> we're<00:03:37.310> going<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.460> pre-drill

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
we're going to we're going to pre-drill

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.560 
we're going to we're going to pre-drill
it<00:03:38.150> right<00:03:38.360> here<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.400> stir<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.430> maybe<00:03:40.760> maybe

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
it right here and stir it maybe maybe

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.450 
it right here and stir it maybe maybe
we'll<00:03:41.840> use<00:03:42.020> this<00:03:42.140> existing<00:03:42.650> hole<00:03:42.860> but<00:03:43.190> we'll

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
we'll use this existing hole but we'll

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.870 
we'll use this existing hole but we'll
pre-drill<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.210> piece<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.780> then<00:03:45.760> screw<00:03:46.760> it

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
pre-drill this piece and then screw it

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.240 
pre-drill this piece and then screw it
into<00:03:47.060> place<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.750> then<00:03:48.560> we're<00:03:48.740> going<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.890> seal

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
into place and then we're going to seal

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.290 
into place and then we're going to seal
all<00:03:49.670> of<00:03:49.940> this<00:03:50.120> up<00:03:50.420> so<00:03:51.820> so<00:03:52.820> there's<00:03:53.000> just<00:03:53.150> no

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
all of this up so so there's just no

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.840 
all of this up so so there's just no
chance<00:03:53.330> it<00:03:53.840> will<00:03:53.930> ever<00:03:54.110> move<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:55.520> we'll<00:03:55.730> take

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
chance it will ever move so we'll take

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.600 
chance it will ever move so we'll take
this<00:03:56.000> out<00:03:56.210> and<00:03:58.000> trying<00:03:59.000> it<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:01.070> now<00:04:01.370> it's

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
this out and trying it and now it's

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.910 
this out and trying it and now it's
fused<00:04:02.330> together<00:04:02.780> just<00:04:03.170> all<00:04:03.320> bonded<00:04:03.740> together

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
fused together just all bonded together

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.060 
fused together just all bonded together
