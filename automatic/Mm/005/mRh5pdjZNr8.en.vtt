that<00:03:39.330> river<00:03:39.690> was<00:03:39.990> but<00:03:40.760> then<00:03:41.760> we<00:03:41.880> saw<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.390> hill

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
that river was but then we saw a hill

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.480 
that river was but then we saw a hill
off<00:03:43.020> in<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.350> distance<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.010> think<00:03:44.220> we're

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
off in the distance so I think we're

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.330 
off in the distance so I think we're
almost<00:03:44.640> as<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.150> can

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340
