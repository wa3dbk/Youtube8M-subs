00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.370
 Today there is ballad of william pitt 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.650
 from running wild the reef of this 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.230
 song I would markdowns everything 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.180
 play is still relatively classic 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.960
 standard everything is in eight others 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.270
 everything in eighths and d minor relative 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.220
 So basically we start in the 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.440
 fifth bunch at work with the note 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:11.620
 which we play twice so then 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.500
 let's go to the quinte of the de 7 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.830
 and the note aaa on the b-side game 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.920
 Once we come the little finger 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.780
 then he plays the note f8 and again 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.790
 on the a-side, too, this one is once 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.869
 part 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.140
 now we will go with that 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:36.180
 index finger on the g string and that the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.290
 Fifth, there they still play there 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.030
 and then we go straight back to it 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:45.190
 dress finger of which we are just coming 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.050
 back so and dana play again the 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.539
 forefinger this time again in 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.899
 five colorful but on the side with the 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.899
 note g 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.880
 the next sound is the ring finger too 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.409
 on the b page with the note aa again 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.450
 that also the last eighth in the 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.950
 first day so now comes the clou of 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.810
 second day is completely identical 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.679
 that only the last round away and for that 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.020
 play when the g 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:20.600
 in the fifth and on the de page as 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:24.730
 quarter note then as third day 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.730
 play the first stroke with the end 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.709
 then we go in with the index finger 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.270
 the third 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.650
 the side play that again twice 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.870
 then play from the ft quinte 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.870
 actually so the c5 and on the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:51.660
 on the other side back to the f 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:56.580
 then the whole sound comes over the f that 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.080
 the g in the fifth and fdp side and also 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.800
 back to that again 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.739
 again in the third and back then 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.720
 We must want the forefinger down 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.930
 on the one hand because we are playing 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:16.290
 as the very last sound in wittmund on the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:18.299
 On the side of the tremble in the forest 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.400
 bit tricky maybe but it is 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.959
 actually feasible so actually 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.069
 they all eighth through the doors the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.370
 At the end we'll sound on the four 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.140
 let as fourth and that is always so 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.380
 he repeated again I have to I 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.380
 clasp 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.780
 It will be just a whole time 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.780
 unchanged repeated a lot of fun lecture
