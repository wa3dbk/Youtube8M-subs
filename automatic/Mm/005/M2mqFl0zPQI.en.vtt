00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.179
 novelty 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.750

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:06.149
 according to the one with that party I 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.789

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.810
 an earthquake but I also had 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.450
 promised that companies that have 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.879

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.680
 opportunity and pass manually bring 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.230

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.599
 in the latest videos although I'm going to teach there 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.340
 first here you type 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.470
 A break for the first time will be 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.650
 here with this head-up jerk and 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.209

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.319

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.290
 Christians so you choose has passed 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.049
 make space first and have space 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.329
 then having to come into force is 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.079

 yesterday may be have to these items 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.030
 when you start in so 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.950
 some reason about a bug the items 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.470
 disappear you make by 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.690
 example, this portal is growing and 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.730
 a few moments later when first 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.470
 place you can then buy the living 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.840

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.840
 that not only have to carry it 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:29.909
 problem is who in the class has 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.900
 practically everything that has to 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.609
 to do is try to take anyone to ambev 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.299
 will the project serve this crisis 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.419
 financial 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.829
 She's also here, and it's really the face of me. 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.599
 I have is that many times it would not be the 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.030
 even if trying is to see that my 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.720
 character is aging and that at last the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.060
 People have to do with nikita's phone is 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.599
 anthony reads tallec then the event goes 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:59.519
 also is kid I know want the 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:01.440
 girls have orders to spirit trf and you 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.870
 wants to get married and she wants to know who 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.359
 who is why I have is that it has 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.680
 Everyone has an adventure name that 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.959
 I do not know what the fuck also for who 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.310
 There is nothing here and you already yours. 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.379
 mate managed to press clapton 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.659
 come here you're not sure I'll talk 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.699
 by cargill the money will be very 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.099
 technique that happens when 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.109
 practical cacaracá because it changed nothing for 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:25.560
 here but this video only give rise to a 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.180
 television and I hope the Pope only 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.550
 found this video that they were not 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.349
 subscribed and you see on the channel you see 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.240
 long the server come here 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.340
 i understand vitor also help server 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.260
 and e 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.120
 Let's go through here and treat our 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.280
 mainly young friends with less 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.220
 20 years and that the server is pirated 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.740
 here is already has several boys and will bring 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.870
 It's still very cold, it's still very cold 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.180
 very original has to also involve 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.760
 More cool then I hope you 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.770
 have liked this video here 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.110
 I hope you like the server goes to 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.350
 that the consumer once again the ipea 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.080
 andré, it should always be possible to 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.570
 screen you call it plays in the universe 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.270
 and it's basically I think that 's it 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.040
 so people lose status let 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.870
 causes an over aquino this video and 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.600
 sign up for the channel will be your critics 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.280
 low because I had a channel will be essential 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.700
 it's just in the arm 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.700
 went
