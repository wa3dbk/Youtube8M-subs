I<00:00:22.420> think<00:00:23.259> it's<00:00:23.380> re<00:00:23.699> four<00:00:24.699> six<00:00:25.089> zero<00:00:25.679> newer

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 
I think it's re four six zero newer

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.509 
I think it's re four six zero newer
model<00:00:27.160> unfortunately<00:00:27.400> not<00:00:28.089> DCC<00:00:29.070> ready<00:00:30.070> I

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
model unfortunately not DCC ready I

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.300 
model unfortunately not DCC ready I
didn't<00:00:31.330> see<00:00:31.480> much<00:00:31.660> of<00:00:31.720> them<00:00:32.080> actually<00:00:32.680> this<00:00:33.100> is

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
didn't see much of them actually this is

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.070 
didn't see much of them actually this is
already<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:35.490> long<00:00:36.490> time<00:00:36.730> ago<00:00:37.000> I<00:00:37.030> described<00:00:37.900> the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
already a long time ago I described the

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.320 
already a long time ago I described the
best<00:00:38.350> way<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:38.710> convert<00:00:39.670> them<00:00:39.880> the<00:00:40.090> motor

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
best way to convert them the motor

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.930 
best way to convert them the motor
because<00:00:40.600> one<00:00:41.230> brush<00:00:41.530> on<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.370> motor<00:00:42.580> body

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
because one brush on the motor body

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.650 
because one brush on the motor body
motor<00:00:43.690> body<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:45.340> the<00:00:45.760> chassis<00:00:46.030> chassis

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
motor body on the chassis chassis

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.530 
motor body on the chassis chassis
directs<00:00:47.410> connects<00:00:48.100> to<00:00:48.310> the<00:00:48.520> one<00:00:49.000> of<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.270> track

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
directs connects to the one of the track

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.770 
directs connects to the one of the track
so<00:00:49.890> need<00:00:50.890> to<00:00:51.010> insulate<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.460> brush<00:00:52.030> but

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
so need to insulate the brush but

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.210 
so need to insulate the brush but
actually<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.440> motor<00:00:55.470> this<00:00:56.470> is<00:00:56.620> beautiful

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
actually the motor this is beautiful

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.510 
actually the motor this is beautiful
beautiful<00:00:57.400> model<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:59.530> got<00:01:00.100> special

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
beautiful model and I got special

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.400 
beautiful model and I got special
request<00:01:01.000> and<00:01:01.300> actually<00:01:01.660> I<00:01:01.720> did<00:01:01.990> it<00:01:02.080> very<00:01:02.260> well

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
request and actually I did it very well

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.619 
request and actually I did it very well
and<00:01:02.860> I'm<00:01:03.040> very<00:01:03.070> happy<00:01:03.430> about<00:01:03.640> it<00:01:03.970> about<00:01:04.299> lights

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
and I'm very happy about it about lights

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:13.530 
and I'm very happy about it about lights
okay<00:01:05.610> let's<00:01:06.610> just<00:01:06.759> start<00:01:07.000> running<00:01:07.299> it<00:01:12.540> sound

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
okay let's just start running it sound

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.070 
okay let's just start running it sound
tones<00:01:13.990> with<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.890> function<00:01:15.370> one<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:16.410> I<00:01:17.410> use

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
tones with the function one and I use

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.320 
tones with the function one and I use
eCos<00:01:20.080> command<00:01:20.650> station<00:01:21.190> for<00:01:21.520> name

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
eCos command station for name

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.130 
eCos command station for name
recognition

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
recognition

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:34.530 
recognition
so<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:26.940> 460<00:01:28.590> 0<00:01:29.590> 13<00:01:30.930> b<00:01:32.040> LS<00:01:33.040> and<00:01:33.310> that<00:01:34.030> number

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
so it's 460 0 13 b LS and that number

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.990 
so it's 460 0 13 b LS and that number
will<00:01:34.750> be<00:01:34.960> in<00:01:35.680> command<00:01:36.070> station<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.490> if<00:01:39.820> it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
will be in command station and if it

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.330 
will be in command station and if it
will<00:01:40.180> be<00:01:40.330> another<00:01:40.570> engine<00:01:41.050> on<00:01:41.260> the<00:01:41.800> same

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
will be another engine on the same

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.510 
will be another engine on the same
address<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:43.060> CC<00:01:43.390> address<00:01:43.690> is<00:01:43.870> actually<00:01:44.260> 0<00:01:44.890> 13

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
address the CC address is actually 0 13

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.030 
address the CC address is actually 0 13
I<00:01:45.850> can<00:01:46.840> put<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.170> same<00:01:47.409> address<00:01:47.799> with

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
I can put the same address with

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.850 
I can put the same address with
different<00:01:48.490> parameters<00:01:49.210> and<00:01:49.620> command<00:01:50.620> station

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
different parameters and command station

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.800 
different parameters and command station
will<00:01:51.220> recognize<00:01:51.909> it<00:01:52.150> that's<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.600> advantage

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
will recognize it that's the advantage

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.530 
will recognize it that's the advantage
of<00:01:53.110> ego<00:01:53.620> space<00:01:53.950> very<00:01:54.670> nice<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:56.200> likes<00:01:57.540> Swiss

like<00:02:25.159> I<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:26.480> just<00:02:26.510> calling<00:02:27.079> the<00:02:27.200> memories<00:02:27.590> light

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
like I I just calling the memories light

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.649 
like I I just calling the memories light
because<00:02:28.370> they<00:02:28.519> read<00:02:28.959> with<00:02:29.959> command<00:02:30.409> station

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
because they read with command station

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.030 
because they read with command station
actually<00:02:32.659> with<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.019> decoder<00:02:33.349> program<00:02:33.769> and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
actually with the decoder program and

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.640 
actually with the decoder program and
using<00:02:34.609> lamps<00:02:35.000> if<00:02:35.510> its<00:02:36.079> function<00:02:36.650> them<00:02:36.920> bingo

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
using lamps if its function them bingo

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.190 
using lamps if its function them bingo
so<00:02:39.650> both<00:02:40.099> they<00:02:40.970> not<00:02:41.180> directional<00:02:41.840> because

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
so both they not directional because

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.890 
so both they not directional because
first<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.250> all<00:02:43.340> it's<00:02:43.579> only<00:02:43.760> for<00:02:44.150> functions<00:02:44.689> and

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
first of all it's only for functions and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.110 
first of all it's only for functions and
I'm<00:02:44.989> using<00:02:45.230> old<00:02:45.500> functions<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.609> accomplish

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
I'm using old functions to accomplish

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.800 
I'm using old functions to accomplish
this<00:02:47.299> task<00:02:47.359> and<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:49.700> real<00:02:50.030> life

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
this task and in real life

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.800 
this task and in real life
that<00:02:51.139> type<00:02:51.379> of<00:02:51.409> lights<00:02:51.879> should<00:02:52.879> be<00:02:53.060> like<00:02:53.329> an<00:02:53.540> in

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
that type of lights should be like an in

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.160 
that type of lights should be like an in
both<00:02:54.079> should<00:02:54.889> be<00:02:54.920> directional<00:02:56.019> okay<00:02:57.019> but

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
both should be directional okay but
