00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:12.770
 offers a cupcake recipe to 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:19.070
 the coconut to realize it there you 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:22.960
 will require 620 g of flour 250 g of sugar 2 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.419
 140 thousand liters of sunflower oil 4th 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.589
 a tablespoon of baking powder 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:31.369
 of a tablespoon of aromas of 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:35.030
 pistachios a pinch of salt 250 g of 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.680
 coconut 200 g jam 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.990
 tablespoons of flower rum 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.790
 orange 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.810
 I start with breaking but they in a 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:48.250
 large salad bowl and I add light 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.250
 I then add the sugar 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.750
 I do not forget my thought of alone 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.820
 and I have to be everything 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.119
 once my first ingredients 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.119
 are mixing well I add the flour 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.140
 I also add the baking powder 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.350
 then I add my aromas of pistachios 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.970
 I can now mix all the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.970
 ingredients by hand this time 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.530
 and 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.239
 in the end my crow's feet look like 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.690
 slightly to the texture of a dough 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.690
 almond 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.980
 I then start making my 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.050
 cupcakes by making balls that 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.360
 I will come to model in the manner of a 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.260
 dome 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.670
 I think it's more 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.870
 simple to look at the pictures for 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.870
 understand what I mean 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.990
 Then I come to drop my little ones 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.690
 cakes on a plate then underway and 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.160
 to prevent them from knowing 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.160
 if I use baking paper 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.000
 I repeat again and again this 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.150
 operation until I have no more 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.150
 paws 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.379
 it is now time to turn our 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.019
 cupcakes in an oven 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.769
 previously heated to 180 degrees for 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.720
 a duration of about 20 minutes 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.319
 here we are after cooking here is the 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.480
 result 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.620
 I will immediately take them out of the oven 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.620
 so that he can cool 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.620
 as you can see zune 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.090
 slightly inflated so leave a 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.090
 space between each cake 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.160
 manage to leave them like that in the open 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.470
 or so that he can totally 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.389
 cool as I already told you and 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.720
 I will move on to preparing my 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.790
 appart to realize it is very 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.110
 simple I mix the jam and my 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.300
 aromas of orange blossom 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.980
 today I used jam 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.389
 apricots but know that no matter 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.389
 jam will suit 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.120
 and 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.210
 I prepare in a large plate 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.710
 hollow manhwa grated coconut and I can 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.070

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.860

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.910
 me is the one you see on the screen 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.010
 so I use a big spoon and I 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.500
 slightly turn my cookies to 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.840
 inside avoiding to export 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.060
