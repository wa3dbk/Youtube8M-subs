00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
put a little cut down the middle so just

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.710 
put a little cut down the middle so just
about<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.829> quarter<00:03:53.639> of<00:03:53.760> an<00:03:54.030> inch<00:03:54.209> from<00:03:54.630> the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
edges so you're going to take the side

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.629 
edges so you're going to take the side
that<00:03:57.480> is<00:03:57.510> sticky<00:03:57.930> put<00:03:58.859> the<00:03:59.010> sticky<00:03:59.400> side<00:03:59.579> down

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
that is sticky put the sticky side down

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.809 
that is sticky put the sticky side down
onto<00:04:00.239> your<00:04:00.599> pink<00:04:00.900> decorating<00:04:01.530> sugar<00:04:01.769> as<00:04:02.160> this
