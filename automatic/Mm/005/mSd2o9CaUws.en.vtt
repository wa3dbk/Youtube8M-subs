00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.050
 oh, how late would the internet be reality today 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.040
 I bring you a very special video because 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.720
 it is 100% improvised because today it arrives 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.430
 late before arriving at my house the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.140
 work I said I'm very talkative and 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.810
 It would be a good time to take advantage of this 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.070
 is this energy outbreak for 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.840
 record a video that they had generated 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.180
 hours is a couple of days but not what 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.320
 I'm going to be able to do so this one exists 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.810
 video 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.930
 good morning I believe you about this 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.900
 Netflix series in conjunction with Marvel and 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.850
 it's obviously giving it some good 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.800
 reasons to really see but not 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.600
 I understand why someone does not variable 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.699
 speed that is constant enough 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.800
 reason the fact that you are with mother and 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.330
 I'm in chingona as to not the 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.040
 see why we need reasons but 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.850
 well I will do this video to do 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.070
 my work of convincing because they are 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.440
 with mother for me first because it has 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.940
 a slightly darker shade than others 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.280
 other things that has made more noise that is 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.350
 I usually compare to design 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.210
 marvel and we see what to say has things a 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.180
 little darker than marvel but in 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.800
 this case is not like that in this case 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.020
 story of giving a little more 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.520
 dark is definitely the most 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.800
 bloody manuel has done until the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.170
 date because if they see it this way it's 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.229
 how good is right because everything 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.490
 they try to do it like in a 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.220
 viteri classification are not a 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.960
 b15 classification maybe something a lot 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.420
 but now having been a little more 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.060
 there and this is very good for me because 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.350
 in the comic it is really use a lot 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.390
 violence to attack 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.580
 the criminals or their enemies with the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.830
 who are facing then I think this 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.590
 it's a very good point very well marvel 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.450
 very good xlix now the actors for me 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.090
 they are the majority unknown 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.340
 charly cos makes an excellent role as 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.890
 as much as more edges as they surrounded it 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.020
 As more burgos of truth I do believe him 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.270
 that is blind acts super well blind 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.549
 you do not feel a moment 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.500
 some strange movement with your eyes or 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.450
 some strange physical movement that 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.759
 say something and the cause already does 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.610
 doubly you have not blindly for me now 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.420
 which best fits in your role 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.630
 It is definitely vincent d'onofrio 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.100
 as wilson fish as kingpin in this 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.319
 man obviously we will all remember 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.569
 like man never run of men's 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.700
 black one and those dreams of a paper 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.620
 immortal that we have all seen and all 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.680
 also we recognize anywhere 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.360
 It has come out a lot in the order but I did not 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.190
 agreement what was this division in which 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.140
 out was not victims not the unit of 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.760
 special victims' of nothing if not me 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.980
 wrong first he tried then what 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.680
 you can meet agitators he makes a 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.049
 excellent paper like wilson fish or 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.800
 you really see the madness in your 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.840
 performance 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.510
 and this is very small because I remember of 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.340
 when michael clarke duncan did 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.680
 here prevents the film version that does not 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.820
 he was very successful and he had 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.420
 precisely something batman to ben affleck 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.280
 how to give halo and well no no it felt 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.720
 really like I went into effort in 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.940
 that movie you feel that you were made 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.920
 just like to take it out to get 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.960
 real money this series itself is 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.520
 much better achieved if maybe it has 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.070
 a bad image of giving of albert by 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.260
 have seen that movie with venable 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.590
 totally mocks their minds because they do not 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.240
 it is like this to give them a very very cool and in 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.650
 this series really shaped how 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.420
 is that I'm going to tell you a little bit more 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.040
 now yes about the series something that I 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.100
 they really like that they do not concentrate much 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.900
 in at the beginning of the band of 12 by 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.700
 example tell you many things about the 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.170
 relationship you have with your father and the 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.090
 relationship that I say of the lives that 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.340
 wore when he was a child and the 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.050
 accident that happened to them when it was 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.270
 blind but they tell you like in 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.580
 flashback your actions of the short ones that 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.920
 they do not occupy too much space and no and no 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.380
 they contaminate the main plot not that it is 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.480
 really everything that wilson moves 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.480
 phillips that in crime and in magic 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.310
 and all this does not stop being me too 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.680
 like the sharia begins when he already 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.230
 is a vigilante maybe not one so 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.680
 prepared a home hero let's say it like that 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.959
 which in fact mentions that he buys his 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.540
 things to fight him his or her clothes 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.340
 buy them on the internet then you know 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.680
 something that makes me very young does not 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.110
 goes live that is an incomplete 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.549
 a verne scarf or something and I like it 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.859
 Also a lot is that the series is very 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.310
 real osasuna spanks a very hero 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.130
 real who fights not so much with super 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.840
 villain but fight with criminals 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.650
 for crooks like piglets with gangsters 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.840
 with criminals go let's say it like that and 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.650
 apart from all this mad murdock is 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.850
 lawyer and the treble are a shit 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.760
 then apart from that because outside of 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.500
 the law to do justice not apart with 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.560
 his real person from the fattest the 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.060
 that really seeks the superior good of 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.669
 the people or the batt really 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.840
 defend the people who deserve it 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.360
 something that I also like many that 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.150
 explain why it has so developed 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.790
 your senses or for example in the 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.890
 Ben Ali's film will not explain 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.310
 not at all how he can have the ear 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.980
 touch and taste as developed 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.420
 because you say how can it be that 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.520
 person follows that is obviously normal 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.180
 that children have more acute or their 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.700
 other senses but not to the degree of something 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.350
 already almost supernatural new superhuman and 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.180
 Here they explain the reason for their 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.560
 senses so chingÃ³n is something that also 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.900
 I really like the character of the 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.330
 It really is Catholic and despite 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.490
 that I'm not religious I think 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.070
 excellent people who have too much 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.930
 faith because it gives them extra motivation not 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.270
 they are given a motivation beyond 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.860
 themselves and imagine a person who 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.170
 apart from that he has confidence in himself 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.900
 she has the confidence that someone 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.700
 more divine looks it is protecting it 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.890
 then it makes me very crazy 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.020
 rhythm of the series is terrific 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.060
 I really think it's the best series of 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.210
 marvel so far have not had the 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.370
 opportunity to see to see but I'm 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.510
 watching I'm still up to date with that 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.490
 I want 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.110
 and even though they partners I like 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.970
 much all this roll of the inhuman 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.100
 that they are putting him back from vÃ©lez 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.960
 something very different the announcement that there 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.310
 been all season and not like seeing 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.290
 with soul that stands that what 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.730
 they were going up every Tuesday because 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.280
 still here you can not see at your pace and 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.500
 you really do not stay with the desire to 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.870
 know what's happening are you really can 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.150
 do something that I would recommend either 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.590
 we see too fast because if you do not 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.390
 you can finish it maybe in a day 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.820
 only and then it will not have 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.730
 nothing to see and the second season is 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.710
 announced until 2016 so have 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.140
 in mind that if you pour it full 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.570
 they will not be able to see the season zone until 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.310
 2016 and then impossible direct 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.930
 endings that really need to see her 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.910
 I liked me know where 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.330
 a long time ago but with this series 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.370
 really already climbed many steps to 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.140
 become I believe that in about 2000 I 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.670
 I think it's already in my top 10 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.470
 favorite superheroes of all 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.000
 comics thanks to this good series 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.500
 personally those are my reasons for 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.990
 what you should really should 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.850
 so I would like it if you already saw the 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.710
 series that let me remove the 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.630
 comments that seemed to them 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.480
 liked that they did not like it 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.710
 they have seen it and they also 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.090
 I would appreciate it if you left me in 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.140
 comments on any topic that 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.330
 like to see me speak in the next 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.500
 videos in the end is to stop all my 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.480
 social networks to follow me and 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.920
 we can be in contact and I do not have 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.170
 nothing more than to thank those who have seen 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:21.600
 the video and tell them to see you in the 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.600
 next tv edition video I love them 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.950
 the body published in 2011 already has its 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.900
 gratuitous 

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.900
 smssm against something 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.170
 475 parts
