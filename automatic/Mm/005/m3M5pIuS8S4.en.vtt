00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.050
If I can add a color in these born feelings,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.830
Would it become a beautiful dream?

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.520
Tomorrow again, on a new canvass,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.790
My future will be colored,

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.870
The thing I really want, is the one you always
give,

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.420
Just the song for me to sing,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.380
Yesterday was being repainted again,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.610
The sound was colorfully bursting,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.480
If I can tell much of what I want, will it be nice?

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.000
The feelings that I have now,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.530
Red?

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.140
Blue?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.530
White?

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710
How vague it is,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.730
If I'm going to love you, 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.320
Greater than anyone in this world, will it be
nice?

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.930
Now,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.490
Even it's an unrequited love, 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.970
That can't reach you,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.300
If I can sing it with joy, it would be great!

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.550
If I would wake up from this dream someday,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.810
I will understand, but if it's now,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.720
There's something that goes on before,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.460
I can feel it,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.920
A colorful stage filled with sounds,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.110
If I can tell much of what I want, will it be nice?

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.700
The feelings that I have now,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.270
Red?	

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.720
Blue?

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:28.230
White?

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.320
How vague it is,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.440
If I'm going to love you,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.010
Greater than anyone in this world, will it be
nice?

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.630
Now,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.290
Even it's an unrequited love,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.790
That won't come true,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.430
I want my song to reach you,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.930
Someday,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.610
Even if the end will come,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.110
We will have fun!

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.380
I'll say it! Colorful x Melody!
