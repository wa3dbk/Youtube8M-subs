00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
texture thing then just like smooth and

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.420 
texture thing then just like smooth and
it<00:02:09.800> feels<00:02:09.980> like<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:15.070> don't<00:02:16.070> know<00:02:16.160> what<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.310> was

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
it feels like I don't know what that was

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.270

though<00:02:19.370> it's<00:02:19.520> dry<00:02:19.700> like<00:02:19.910> it's<00:02:20.090> not<00:02:20.270> coming<00:02:20.690> off

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
though it's dry like it's not coming off

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.650 
though it's dry like it's not coming off
so<00:02:21.770> that's<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:23.710> mean<00:02:24.710> that's<00:02:24.770> pretty<00:02:25.010> good<00:02:25.190> um

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
so that's I mean that's pretty good um

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
about four to five hours ok so it's 240

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
right now I'm going to use this for a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.300 
right now I'm going to use this for a
couple<00:02:33.290> hours<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.890> I'm<00:02:33.980> going<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.160> come<00:02:34.280> back

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
couple hours and I'm going to come back

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.670 
couple hours and I'm going to come back
around<00:02:34.580> six<00:02:34.850> o'clock<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:35.690> not<00:02:35.840> six

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
around six o'clock so that it's not six
