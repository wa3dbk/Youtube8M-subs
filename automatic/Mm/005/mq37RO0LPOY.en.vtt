I'm using x XO hex wrench and I get well
I<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:59.009> another<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.340> there<00:01:59.780> but<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:01.140> I'm

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
I get another one there but I what I'm

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.320 
I get another one there but I what I'm
doing<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.799> input

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
doing is input

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.260 
doing is input
on<00:02:02.510> putting<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.530> hex<00:02:03.740> wrenches<00:02:04.160> by<00:02:04.880> inserting

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
on putting the hex wrenches by inserting

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.139 
on putting the hex wrenches by inserting
them<00:02:05.720> into<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:06.350> holes<00:02:06.950> on<00:02:07.220> either<00:02:07.490> side<00:02:07.850> and

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
them into the holes on either side and

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.240 
them into the holes on either side and
then<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.390> remove<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:11.260> shaft<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.650> the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
then I remove the the shaft and the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.180 
then I remove the the shaft and the
screw<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:16.370> anyway<00:02:16.820> I'm<00:02:16.970> using<00:02:17.270> hex<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.590> hex

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
screw so anyway I'm using hex a hex

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.760 
screw so anyway I'm using hex a hex
wrench<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.680> just<00:02:22.040> kind<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.280> folding<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
wrench that is just kind of folding the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.030 
wrench that is just kind of folding the
casters<00:02:24.770> for<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.700> minute<00:02:26.090> there<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.840> then<00:02:27.830> when

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
casters for a minute there and then when

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.120 
casters for a minute there and then when
I<00:02:28.130> pull<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.670> hex<00:02:29.390> wrench<00:02:29.720> out<00:02:29.960> there<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.500> you

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
I pull the hex wrench out there and you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.200 
I pull the hex wrench out there and you
see<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.320> washers<00:02:33.430> from<00:02:34.430> either<00:02:34.790> side<00:02:34.970> of

that's<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.890> bunch<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.850> hair<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:48.050> there<00:02:48.170> we<00:02:48.290> got<00:02:48.500> a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
that's a bunch of hair so there we got a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.280 
that's a bunch of hair so there we got a
bunch<00:02:48.770> of<00:02:48.890> dogs<00:02:49.160> in<00:02:49.640> our<00:02:49.760> house<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.450> we<00:02:51.170> have

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
hair this probably got about three

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.390 
hair this probably got about three
months<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:01.270> hair<00:03:02.270> buildup<00:03:02.810> so<00:03:03.770> it's<00:03:03.980> not<00:03:04.160> like

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
months of hair buildup so it's not like

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.240 
months of hair buildup so it's not like
that<00:03:04.670> much<00:03:05.030> hair<00:03:05.300> buildup<00:03:05.959> can<00:03:06.200> be<00:03:06.350> from<00:03:07.040> one

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
that much hair buildup can be from one

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.120 
that much hair buildup can be from one
day<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.209> do<00:03:09.019> a<00:03:09.200> lot<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:09.530> things<00:03:09.860> other

I put then I put the caster wheel and if
you<00:04:19.530> look<00:04:19.829> there<00:04:20.220> if<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.609> can<00:04:20.790> see<00:04:21.150> there<00:04:21.959> is

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
you look there if you can see there is

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.550 
you look there if you can see there is
another<00:04:22.850> washer<00:04:23.850> in<00:04:24.000> between<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:25.020> caster

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
another washer in between the caster

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.689 
another washer in between the caster
wheel<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.340> caster<00:04:26.760> fork<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.860> this

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
wheel and the caster fork so and this

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.490 
wheel and the caster fork so and this
part<00:04:29.970> is<00:04:30.180> kind<00:04:30.419> of<00:04:30.479> difficult<00:04:30.690> it's<00:04:31.199> kind<00:04:31.440> of

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
part is kind of difficult it's kind of

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.439 
part is kind of difficult it's kind of
difficult<00:04:31.979> to<00:04:32.250> put<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.520> shaft<00:04:32.850> through<00:04:33.180> there

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
difficult to put the shaft through there

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:38.840 
difficult to put the shaft through there
and<00:04:33.630> then<00:04:34.320> also<00:04:34.800> put<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:36.530> put<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.680> washer<00:04:38.160> in

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
and then also put the put the washer in

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.120 
and then also put the put the washer in
between<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.389> caster<00:04:39.900> wheel<00:04:40.260> on<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.680> caster

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
between the caster wheel on the caster

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.439 
between the caster wheel on the caster
fork<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.729> then<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:44.070> know<00:04:44.190> then<00:04:44.639> put<00:04:45.270> the

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
fork and then you know then put the

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:52.150 
fork and then you know then put the
screw<00:04:45.750> then<00:04:46.650> run<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.160> screw<00:04:47.400> into<00:04:47.789> the<00:04:49.880> the

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
screw then run the screw into the the

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
screw then run the screw into the the
shaft<00:04:53.419> so<00:04:54.680> it's<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.800> lot<00:04:55.979> of<00:04:56.130> it's<00:04:56.850> kind<00:04:57.150> of

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
shaft so it's a lot of it's kind of

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.480 
shaft so it's a lot of it's kind of
difficult<00:04:57.389> to<00:04:57.690> do<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:57.990> but<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.979> it<00:04:59.100> takes<00:04:59.340> a

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
difficult to do that but and it takes a

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.159 
difficult to do that but and it takes a
little<00:04:59.639> bit<00:04:59.820> of<00:04:59.880> time<00:05:00.120> that's<00:05:00.389> why<00:05:00.630> I'm<00:05:00.870> laying

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
little bit of time that's why I'm laying

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.070 
little bit of time that's why I'm laying
on<00:05:01.350> my<00:05:01.410> belly<00:05:02.240> while<00:05:03.240> I'm<00:05:03.449> doing<00:05:03.690> this<00:05:03.870> because

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
on my belly while I'm doing this because

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.740 
on my belly while I'm doing this because
you<00:05:05.039> know<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.310> whole<00:05:05.460> process<00:05:05.699> I<00:05:06.300> would<00:05:06.479> say

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
you know the whole process I would say

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.400 
you know the whole process I would say
probably<00:05:07.530> took<00:05:07.889> me<00:05:07.949> about<00:05:08.100> thirty<00:05:08.699> minutes

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
probably took me about thirty minutes

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.830 
probably took me about thirty minutes
and<00:05:10.410> each<00:05:11.250> time<00:05:11.580> that<00:05:11.760> I<00:05:11.910> do<00:05:11.970> this<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.570> get<00:05:12.810> a

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
and each time that I do this I get a

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.909 
and each time that I do this I get a
little<00:05:13.080> bit<00:05:13.260> quicker<00:05:13.550> but<00:05:14.840> it<00:05:15.840> still<00:05:16.470> it<00:05:16.680> takes

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
little bit quicker but it still it takes

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.500 
little bit quicker but it still it takes
a<00:05:17.039> while<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.490> you<00:05:17.580> got<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:17.849> have<00:05:17.940> a<00:05:18.000> little<00:05:18.210> bit

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
a while and you got to have a little bit

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.920 
a while and you got to have a little bit
of<00:05:18.599> patience<00:05:19.050> whenever<00:05:19.979> you're<00:05:20.190> doing<00:05:20.370> this

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
of patience whenever you're doing this

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.190 
of patience whenever you're doing this
what<00:05:21.930> I'm<00:05:22.080> doing<00:05:22.560> is<00:05:22.830> a<00:05:23.310> righty<00:05:24.300> tighty<00:05:24.660> so<00:05:25.169> I

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
what I'm doing is a righty tighty so I

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.790 
what I'm doing is a righty tighty so I
need<00:05:25.470> to<00:05:25.680> so<00:05:25.979> I'm<00:05:26.099> tightening<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:27.800> I'm

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
need to so I'm tightening the I'm

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.060 
need to so I'm tightening the I'm
tightening<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.520> wheel<00:05:30.450> and<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.800> in<00:05:32.039> between

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
tightening the wheel and the in between

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
the castro caster forks and what I'm

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.950 
the castro caster forks and what I'm
going<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.080> do<00:05:37.260> I'm<00:05:37.440> I'm<00:05:37.830> tightening<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.520> wheel

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
going to do I'm I'm tightening the wheel

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.129 
going to do I'm I'm tightening the wheel
pretty<00:05:39.960> good<00:05:40.200> here<00:05:40.970> with<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.270> with<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:42.930> hex

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
pretty good here with the with the hex

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.529 
pretty good here with the with the hex
wrenches<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:44.370> I'm<00:05:45.300> going<00:05:45.479> to<00:05:45.539> try<00:05:45.780> it<00:05:45.840> out<00:05:46.080> you

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
wrenches and I'm going to try it out you

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.480 
wrenches and I'm going to try it out you
see<00:05:48.539> it<00:05:48.660> doesn't<00:05:49.020> only<00:05:49.110> turn<00:05:49.470> that<00:05:49.680> much<00:05:49.950> it

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
see it doesn't only turn that much it

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.779 
see it doesn't only turn that much it
doesn't<00:05:50.669> only<00:05:50.910> turn<00:05:51.270> that<00:05:51.450> good<00:05:51.770> so<00:05:52.770> what<00:05:53.669> I'm

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
doesn't only turn that good so what I'm

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.070 
doesn't only turn that good so what I'm
going<00:05:53.880> to<00:05:53.940> do<00:05:54.060> what<00:05:54.360> I'm<00:05:54.510> doing<00:05:54.900> is<00:05:55.080> I<00:05:55.260> have<00:05:56.070> my

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
going to do what I'm doing is I have my

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.969 
going to do what I'm doing is I have my
I've<00:05:58.080> tightened<00:05:58.560> it<00:05:58.710> too<00:05:59.250> much<00:05:59.460> so<00:06:00.770> what<00:06:01.770> I'm

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
I've tightened it too much so what I'm

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.450 
I've tightened it too much so what I'm
doing<00:06:02.010> is<00:06:02.550> I'm<00:06:02.789> I'm<00:06:03.300> gonna<00:06:03.539> loosen<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.460> loosen

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
doing is I'm I'm gonna loosen the loosen

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.089 
doing is I'm I'm gonna loosen the loosen
the<00:06:05.639> screws<00:06:06.260> loosen<00:06:07.260> the<00:06:07.380> screw<00:06:07.650> and<00:06:07.979> the

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
the screws loosen the screw and the

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.540 
the screws loosen the screw and the
shaft<00:06:09.560> loosen<00:06:10.560> the<00:06:10.650> screws<00:06:10.919> from<00:06:11.190> the<00:06:11.310> shaft

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
shaft loosen the screws from the shaft

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.839 
shaft loosen the screws from the shaft
on<00:06:12.419> either<00:06:12.599> side<00:06:13.020> so<00:06:13.320> that<00:06:14.130> I<00:06:14.160> can<00:06:14.460> get<00:06:14.639> some

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
on either side so that I can get some

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.210 
on either side so that I can get some
spin<00:06:15.180> you<00:06:15.840> see<00:06:16.080> now<00:06:16.289> it's<00:06:16.530> spinning<00:06:16.949> pretty

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
spin you see now it's spinning pretty

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.820 
spin you see now it's spinning pretty
darn<00:06:17.460> good

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
darn good

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.120 
darn good
I'm<00:06:19.160> pretty<00:06:19.430> happy<00:06:19.850> about<00:06:19.880> that<00:06:20.950> this<00:06:21.950> is<00:06:22.100> a

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
I'm pretty happy about that this is a

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.180 
I'm pretty happy about that this is a
little<00:06:22.340> bit<00:06:22.550> of<00:06:22.640> closer<00:06:22.910> of<00:06:23.210> an<00:06:23.330> angle<00:06:23.690> of<00:06:24.190> the

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
little bit of closer of an angle of the

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.200 
little bit of closer of an angle of the
of<00:06:25.610> the<00:06:25.820> caster<00:06:26.300> spinning<00:06:26.750> so<00:06:27.710> it's<00:06:28.550> okay

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
of the caster spinning so it's okay

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.690 
of the caster spinning so it's okay
you<00:06:29.540> know<00:06:29.690> I<00:06:29.720> it's<00:06:30.410> not<00:06:30.620> really<00:06:31.130> really<00:06:31.400> fast

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
you know I it's not really really fast

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.540 
you know I it's not really really fast
spinning<00:06:32.390> but<00:06:32.600> it's<00:06:33.140> pretty<00:06:33.440> good<00:06:33.680> compared

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
spinning but it's pretty good compared

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.670 
spinning but it's pretty good compared
it's<00:06:34.820> better<00:06:35.060> than<00:06:35.350> anything's<00:06:36.350> better<00:06:36.590> than

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
it's better than anything's better than

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.840 
it's better than anything's better than
having<00:06:37.040> all<00:06:37.310> that<00:06:37.490> hair<00:06:37.790> in<00:06:37.970> there<00:06:38.180> so<00:06:39.850> anyway

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
having all that hair in there so anyway

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.690 
having all that hair in there so anyway
here<00:06:41.210> after<00:06:41.510> this<00:06:41.690> then<00:06:42.050> I<00:06:42.170> am<00:06:42.500> all<00:06:43.190> done<00:06:43.430> you

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
here after this then I am all done you

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.450 
here after this then I am all done you
know<00:06:43.820> I<00:06:43.850> actually<00:06:44.540> cleaned<00:06:45.140> out<00:06:45.320> the<00:06:45.530> hair

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
know I actually cleaned out the hair

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.800 
know I actually cleaned out the hair
from<00:06:47.420> my<00:06:47.960> other<00:06:48.590> castor<00:06:49.370> so<00:06:50.030> I<00:06:50.090> cleaned<00:06:50.630> out

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
from my other castor so I cleaned out

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.080 
from my other castor so I cleaned out
the<00:06:50.960> hair<00:06:51.170> from<00:06:51.830> my<00:06:51.980> left<00:06:52.190> castor<00:06:52.760> that<00:06:52.940> was

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
the hair from my left castor that was

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.270 
the hair from my left castor that was
all<00:06:53.300> majorly<00:06:54.020> gummed<00:06:54.380> up<00:06:54.590> and<00:06:54.770> then<00:06:54.920> I<00:06:54.950> cleaned

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
all majorly gummed up and then I cleaned

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.120 
all majorly gummed up and then I cleaned
out<00:06:55.370> the<00:06:55.430> hair<00:06:55.700> from<00:06:56.450> outright<00:06:56.750> castor<00:06:57.470> that

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
out the hair from outright castor that

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.950 
out the hair from outright castor that
was<00:06:58.340> gummed<00:06:59.030> up<00:06:59.120> a<00:06:59.300> little<00:06:59.540> bit

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
was gummed up a little bit

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.300 
was gummed up a little bit
so<00:07:01.660> anyway<00:07:02.660> I'm<00:07:03.140> after<00:07:03.890> I<00:07:04.100> do<00:07:04.220> this<00:07:04.550> transfer

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
so anyway I'm after I do this transfer

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.710 
so anyway I'm after I do this transfer
to<00:07:07.310> my<00:07:07.490> wheelchair<00:07:08.470> then<00:07:10.450> actually<00:07:11.450> what<00:07:11.600> I'm

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 
to my wheelchair then actually what I'm

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.600 
to my wheelchair then actually what I'm
going<00:07:11.840> to<00:07:11.870> do<00:07:12.050> actually<00:07:12.470> I<00:07:12.590> get<00:07:13.010> my<00:07:13.160> cushion

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
going to do actually I get my cushion

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.580 
going to do actually I get my cushion
and<00:07:13.730> put<00:07:13.940> my<00:07:14.060> cushion<00:07:14.420> underneath<00:07:14.630> me<00:07:14.900> but<00:07:15.560> I

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
and put my cushion underneath me but I

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.010 
and put my cushion underneath me but I
can<00:07:15.890> you<00:07:16.490> see<00:07:16.700> how<00:07:16.850> I'm<00:07:17.210> wheeling<00:07:17.750> a<00:07:17.840> lot

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
can you see how I'm wheeling a lot

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.130 
can you see how I'm wheeling a lot
faster<00:07:18.560> I<00:07:18.650> believe<00:07:19.010> I<00:07:19.280> can<00:07:19.820> let<00:07:20.420> go<00:07:20.690> of<00:07:20.720> the

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
faster I believe I can let go of the

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.300 
faster I believe I can let go of the
wheels<00:07:21.500> and<00:07:22.540> wheel<00:07:23.540> and<00:07:23.990> move<00:07:24.590> forward<00:07:25.070> pretty

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310 
wheels and wheel and move forward pretty

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.780 
wheels and wheel and move forward pretty
decently<00:07:26.020> so<00:07:27.020> there<00:07:27.590> still<00:07:27.740> is<00:07:28.160> a<00:07:28.190> little<00:07:28.640> bit

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:28.790 
decently so there still is a little bit

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.330 
decently so there still is a little bit
of<00:07:28.880> pull<00:07:29.120> to<00:07:29.360> the<00:07:29.480> right<00:07:29.720> side<00:07:30.050> but<00:07:30.860> it's<00:07:31.130> not

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:31.340 
of pull to the right side but it's not

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.730 
of pull to the right side but it's not
that<00:07:31.550> bad<00:07:31.820> so<00:07:32.450> those<00:07:32.690> are<00:07:32.870> the<00:07:32.960> hex<00:07:33.230> wrenches

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:33.740 
that bad so those are the hex wrenches

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.210
