00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.460
 on ordinary cars drive things for us 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.620
 familiar but on a tractor for example 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.780
 what you probably immediately imagine 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.670
 represent thoroughly impregnated 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.820
 oil and solarium machine 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.840
 the quilted jacket and dusty 8 blades 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.740
 unshaven 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.789
 yes with harmony but no now speech is not 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.070
 agricultural and construction 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.529
 technology and me actually she 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.510
 interesting because it's expensive 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.020
 on which we all ride on cars 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.420
 cars 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.160
 After all, there is a technique with which 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.020
 you can do them normally and 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.690
 repair properly 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.239
 to demonstrate the accuracy of the work 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.920
 modern smart tractor on the recent 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.730
 exhibition construction equipment and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.010
 technology 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.649
 neatly split the huge 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.530
 bulldozer egg placed in 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.280
 a glass of shell cracked crystal remained 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.440
 unscathed 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.719
 turns current bulldozers 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.420
 allow you to equalize the road by eye 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.489
 and using a leveling system there 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.680
 all mature full automatics 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.750
 optics watering can use 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.390
 ultrasonic sensors and laser 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.030
 plane-built tractors satellites 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.040
 it's impressive the funniest thing is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.020
 the cabin of this bulldozer is almost like 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.020
 average budget passenger cars 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.020
 comfortable chair plastic trim even 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.330
 radio and air conditioner there is a pity that 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.119
 ride on this hulk I do not 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.520
 gave but let the loader levers 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.299
 he is at least wheeled we are not so big 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.340
 of course 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.619
 albeit a trifle paunchy car 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.170
 multipurpose attached to it already nine 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.020
 hinged door sets 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.630
 1 front as vintage BMW from this 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.520
 post-war years or at the fridge 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.340
 for example only in the cabin here 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.140
 more spacious management 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.060
 a huge multi-tonne me 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.609
 they were afraid to trust but on this 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.119
 compact small loaders i am now 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.119
 I will ride 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.479
 instead of the seat belt arc start 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.250
 turning the key right lever is responsible for 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.620
 work with a ladle any student 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.510
 trained on game consoles with 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.000
 this will do the left lever 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.000
 for the movement of the tractor itself handle from 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.840
 ourselves we go forward ourselves back to the right 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.130
 going right left respectively left 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.920
 it unfolds almost like 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.040
 tank even his 50 strong korean 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.350
 diesel accelerates 3 tons of baby to 12 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.750
 kilometers per hour and in traffic jams is not faster 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.090
 but you will park on this 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.280
 metropolitan conditions well, just lovely 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.290
 if anything can be cautious 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.350
 move the shovel but for that already 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.780
 take some skill I certainly 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.360
 behind the levers of this loader that a cow 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.700
 on the ice but the train somehow out of habit 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.770
 fearing for pedestrians and catching 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.400
 dumb motorcyclists in the rear mirrors 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.250
 kind of 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.800
 but girls yes yes girls from concern 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.200
 Tractor plants managed to show on 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.200
 such pepelats ah dance of little swans 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.060
 so elegantly circling i personally never 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.800
 I can not on the floor not on the pavement but 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.430
 take part in the action very much 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.740
 wanted to 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.710
 so heroically volunteered to go under 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.390
 jumping bikes during 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.820
 the presentation show is great not the tractor 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.220
 but also scary when the protector looms 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.010
 right above your nose so what am i 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.380
 it all turns out now you can equal 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.690
 mounds for roads not chasing day after day 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.850
 back and forth graders and carry loads 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.280
 small tractors when working 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.540
 no need to block the road for repair 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.000
 across its width 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.250
 appliances have money from ours with you 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.620
 transport tax seems to be too 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.620
 something else is probably missing
