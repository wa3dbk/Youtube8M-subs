00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.479
 hello today I'll teach you to 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:06.360
 how to do it 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:09.120
 two other very simple ideas like 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.890
 souvenirs for different parties if 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.680
 you want to know how these tastings are made 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.900
 see the rest of the video the materials 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.980
 what we are going to need for these will be 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.579
 the molds the cardboard the adhesive 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.949
 your preference some draft pencil 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.749
 scissors rule an object to mark 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.849
 Folds and what we want for 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.560
 decorate it now if we see the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.079
 procedure the first thing we will do 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.149
 will download the image of the mold 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.120
 adjust to the size that we want 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.960
 and cut it in my case I adjust them to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.960
 letter size 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.000
 and I have both worlds cut out and now 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.590
 we're going to move it to the cardboard of the 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.590
 color that we choose 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.710
 once they are marked we will cut 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.720
 and with the help of our rule and our 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.000
 object to mark twice we are going to 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.540
 make these folds that we already have 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.540
 marked 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.120
 now we can erase the lines 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.120
 made in pencil with the eraser 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.990
 now we simply double this to 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.990
 to be able to assemble our box 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.830
 To put it together we will put adhesive on 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.290
 our lashes and we're going to stick them 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.820
 way a little inclined so you do not 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.820
 see as you see in the picture 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.850
 so we will be closed this the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.130
 I really do not consider that I need 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.440
 much decoration since simply with 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.409
 some nice ribbon we can close it from 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.850
 this way and we already have left besides I have 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.880
 I went to several parties and found 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.830
 in this way in my case used with 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.830
 the war is because it is the only thing 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.229
 I have to combine but if you the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.450
 used to not be some christening or 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.789
 they integrate white cardboard and some ribbon 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.250
 of pink organza or for about 15 years 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.459
 making it the color of the party for 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.480
 the other one we will do the same procedure 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.550
 only that it is left with a hole 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.680
 up and in this case I wanted to add 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.630
 a little more decoration by placing a 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.489
 little lace and a little bit of you 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.470
 Well I hope you liked these 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.090
 ideas reminding them that they are very ideas 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.370
 simple things that can be done in large 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.680
 amounts and well that was all for me 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.680
 part and in the next video bye bye
