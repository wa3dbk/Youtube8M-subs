00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
more or two degrees that is very bad for

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.229 
more or two degrees that is very bad for

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
the embryo that is developing into the

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.000 
the embryo that is developing into the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
shell of the egg and the often it can

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.310 
shell of the egg and the often it can
die<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.760> very<00:02:52.760> important<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.780> try<00:02:54.290> to

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
die so it is a very important to try to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.449 
die so it is a very important to try to
get<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:55.959> brand<00:02:56.959> that<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.350> more<00:02:57.800> reliable<00:02:58.070> than

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
get a brand that is more reliable than

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.570 
get a brand that is more reliable than
others<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:59.120> personally<00:03:00.110> use<00:03:00.290> from<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.280> bottom
