00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.610
 milliliters of cream to assemble this is 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.200
 of animal radio origin I will use 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.970

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.590

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.390
 start with the preparation of the recipe 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.990
 or 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.840
 The first thing I'm going to do is take the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.710
 I'm going to remove what is the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.450
 and then I'm going to wash them 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.280
 next what we are going to do is 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.229
 Caesar the strawberries already washed we're going to 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.360
 toss in a bowl and now with help 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.330
 We will crush them from a fork and 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.280
 let's make puree 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.560
 once we have titled the strawberry 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.060
 as you fix I have left pieces of strawberry 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.890
 quite big because I like it 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.290
 find me stumbling in the ice cream 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.150
 Now what I'm going to do is add the 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.899
 100 milliliters of cream to assemble 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.080
 in this perfect way I will add 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.660
 also the 100 grams of icing sugar 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.840
 there's everything inside and now I 'm going to mix it 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.390
 everything very well once we have mixed 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.510
 all right I'm going to cut what is the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.790

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.540
 and I'm going to throw what is only 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.000
 half a teaspoon nothing more and we're going to 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.250
 Mix everything again very well 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.390
 once we have mixed everything well 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.520

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.890

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.870
 We've taken all content within 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.300
 We will leave the refrigerator 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.550
 running for about 20 a 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.630
 40 minutes until we get the 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.630
