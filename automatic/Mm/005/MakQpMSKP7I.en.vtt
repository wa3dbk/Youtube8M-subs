00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
it's up everyone this is wipeout and

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.740 
it's up everyone this is wipeout and
today<00:00:02.610> I<00:00:02.639> bring<00:00:02.760> you<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.149> direct<00:00:03.449> comparison

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
today I bring you a direct comparison

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.749 
today I bring you a direct comparison
between<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.380> Xbox<00:00:04.799> 360<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.609> PlayStation

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759

between the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation
3<00:00:06.509> now<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.500> was<00:00:08.010> always<00:00:08.189> suspicious<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:09.059> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
3 now I was always suspicious that the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.789 
3 now I was always suspicious that the
Xbox<00:00:10.320> 360<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.070> 1080p<00:00:11.550> graphics<00:00:12.240> could<00:00:13.049> not<00:00:13.530> be

Xbox 360 is 1080p graphics could not be
as<00:00:14.099> sharp<00:00:14.790> as<00:00:15.139> the<00:00:16.139> PlayStation<00:00:16.680> 3s<00:00:17.310> 1080p

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.849 
as sharp as the PlayStation 3s 1080p
graphics<00:00:18.390> being<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.869> PlayStation<00:00:19.109> 3<00:00:19.710> is

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
graphics being that the PlayStation 3 is

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.370 
graphics being that the PlayStation 3 is
designed<00:00:20.340> from<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.029> ground<00:00:21.060> up<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.689> produce<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.550 
full 1920 by 1080 image and the Xbox 360
isn't<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:28.070> what<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.099> did<00:00:29.220> was<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.609> created<00:00:29.880> an

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
isn't so what I did was I created an

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.010 
isn't so what I did was I created an
image<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.460> full<00:00:32.730> 1920<00:00:33.480> by<00:00:33.600> 1080

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
resolution actually 2 images that would

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.389 
resolution actually 2 images that would
be<00:00:36.239> my<00:00:37.050> test<00:00:37.410> images<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.640> them<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:40.399> very

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
be my test images one of them is a very

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.150 
be my test images one of them is a very
very<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.969> know<00:00:42.030> full<00:00:42.329> high-definition

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
very you know full high-definition

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.130 
very you know full high-definition
checkerboard<00:00:44.160> where<00:00:44.879> each<00:00:45.239> pixel<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
checkerboard where each pixel on the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.500 
checkerboard where each pixel on the
screen<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.550> picture<00:00:48.270> is

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
screen in the in the picture is

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.690 
screen in the in the picture is
alternating<00:00:49.469> black<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.160> white<00:00:50.370> color

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
alternating black and then white color

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.150 
alternating black and then white color
so<00:00:51.539> every<00:00:51.809> pixel<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.289> black<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.829> then<00:00:52.949> white

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
so every pixel is black and then white

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.220 
so every pixel is black and then white
and<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:53.460> black<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:53.969> white<00:00:54.230> basically

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and then black and then white basically

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.430 
and then black and then white basically
in<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> checkerboard<00:00:55.770> pattern<00:00:56.000> in<00:00:57.000> full<00:00:57.809> 1920

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
in a checkerboard pattern in full 1920

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.049 
in a checkerboard pattern in full 1920
by<00:00:58.559> 1080<00:00:58.920> resolution<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:02.250> other<00:01:02.609> shot

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
by 1080 resolution and the other shot

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.940 
by 1080 resolution and the other shot
was<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.930> single<00:01:04.860> white<00:01:04.979> pixel<00:01:05.400> surrounded<00:01:05.939> by<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
was a single white pixel surrounded by a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.000 
was a single white pixel surrounded by a
rows<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.159> columns<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.700> single<00:01:09.119> black<00:01:09.479> pixels

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
rows and columns of single black pixels

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.649 
rows and columns of single black pixels
so<00:01:11.810> on<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.049> true<00:01:13.590> 1080p<00:01:13.920> output<00:01:14.509> what<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
so on a true 1080p output what that

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.539 
so on a true 1080p output what that
would<00:01:15.840> look<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.159> once<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.369> being

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
would look like once it's being

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.060 
would look like once it's being
displayed<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> screen<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.630> would<00:01:18.750> see

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
displayed on the screen you would see

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.450 
displayed on the screen you would see
each<00:01:20.070> pixel<00:01:20.820> being<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.930> color<00:01:22.220> black<00:01:23.220> and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
each pixel being one color black and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.710 
each pixel being one color black and
then<00:01:23.640> white<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.119> black<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.330> then<00:01:24.570> white

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
then white and then black and then white

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.410 
then white and then black and then white
with<00:01:25.380> no<00:01:25.619> gray<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:25.920> between<00:01:26.159> that's<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.150> true

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
with no gray in between that's a true

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.890 
with no gray in between that's a true
one-to-one<00:01:28.170> per<00:01:28.500> pixel<00:01:29.090> 1080p<00:01:30.090> display<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:32.340> I

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
one-to-one per pixel 1080p display so I

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.929 
one-to-one per pixel 1080p display so I
suspected<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.200> Xbox<00:01:34.710> 360<00:01:35.430> wouldn't<00:01:35.820> be

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
suspected that the Xbox 360 wouldn't be

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.120 
suspected that the Xbox 360 wouldn't be
able<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.350> wanted<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> test<00:01:37.950> it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
able to do this and I wanted to test it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.929 
able to do this and I wanted to test it
out<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:39.450> results<00:01:39.930> were<00:01:40.470> surprising<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.909> I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
out and the results were surprising so I

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.490 
out and the results were surprising so I
pulled<00:01:42.210> over<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> buddy<00:01:42.780> who's<00:01:42.990> got<00:01:43.020> an<00:01:43.259> Xbox

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
pulled over a buddy who's got an Xbox

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.700 
pulled over a buddy who's got an Xbox

unscaled picture format and it both set
to<00:02:00.030> 1080p<00:02:01.520> now<00:02:04.880> there<00:02:05.880> was<00:02:06.000> more<00:02:06.210> testing<00:02:06.659> that

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
to 1080p now there was more testing that

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.070 
to 1080p now there was more testing that
I<00:02:06.810> wanted<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.259> do<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.099> couldn't<00:02:08.810> get<00:02:09.810> all

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
I wanted to do but I I couldn't get all

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.660 
I wanted to do but I I couldn't get all
the<00:02:10.110> tests<00:02:10.470> done<00:02:10.649> because<00:02:10.920> my<00:02:11.190> friend<00:02:11.610> was

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the tests done because my friend was

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.809 
the tests done because my friend was
actually

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
actually

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.229 
actually
getting<00:02:13.209> kind<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:14.489> high<00:02:15.489> should<00:02:15.730> we<00:02:15.849> put<00:02:16.060> this

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
getting kind of high should we put this

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
he was feeling a little defeated he was

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.770 
he was feeling a little defeated he was
disappointed<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:23.799> know<00:02:24.450> he<00:02:25.450> was<00:02:25.599> getting

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.670 
disappointed and you know he was getting
butthurt<00:02:26.139> so<00:02:26.819> we<00:02:27.819> had<00:02:27.969> to<00:02:28.120> cut<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.680> sessions

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
butthurt so we had to cut the sessions

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.830 
butthurt so we had to cut the sessions
short<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:30.609> if<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.819> ever<00:02:30.969> come<00:02:31.239> across<00:02:31.359> another

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
short but if I ever come across another

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.459 
short but if I ever come across another
360<00:02:32.969> again<00:02:33.969> that<00:02:34.389> I<00:02:34.510> can<00:02:34.719> spend<00:02:35.049> some<00:02:35.200> time

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:35.469 
360 again that I can spend some time

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:36.839 
360 again that I can spend some time
with<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.859> do<00:02:35.950> some<00:02:36.129> more<00:02:36.250> testing<00:02:36.700> or

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
with and do some more testing or

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.330 
with and do some more testing or
research<00:02:37.120> on<00:02:37.420> then<00:02:37.750> I'll<00:02:38.230> definitely<00:02:38.950> do<00:02:39.099> some

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
research on then I'll definitely do some

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.420 
research on then I'll definitely do some
more<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.519> these<00:02:39.609> videos<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.680> first<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.980> copied

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
more of these videos so first I copied

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.729 
more of these videos so first I copied
the<00:02:42.519> picture<00:02:42.879> file<00:02:43.120> over<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.599> my<00:02:43.719> PSP<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.530> then

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
the picture file over to my PSP and then

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.990 
the picture file over to my PSP and then
moved<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.189> to<00:02:45.909> the<00:02:46.590> 360<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.829> ps3<00:02:48.010> with<00:02:48.909> the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
moved it to the 360 and the ps3 with the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.949 
moved it to the 360 and the ps3 with the
USB<00:02:49.239> cable<00:02:49.450> in<00:02:49.870> my<00:02:49.900> PSP<00:02:50.669> although<00:02:51.669> I<00:02:52.090> did<00:02:52.750> come

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
USB cable in my PSP although I did come

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.789 
USB cable in my PSP although I did come
across<00:02:52.989> some<00:02:53.859> hurdles<00:02:54.280> because<00:02:54.969> I<00:02:55.709> don't<00:02:56.709> know

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
across some hurdles because I don't know

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.619 
across some hurdles because I don't know
if<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.099> just<00:02:57.129> couldn't<00:02:57.790> figure<00:02:57.969> it<00:02:58.209> out<00:02:58.359> in<00:02:58.510> the

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
if I just couldn't figure it out in the

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.899 
if I just couldn't figure it out in the
ten<00:02:58.900> minutes<00:02:59.169> that<00:02:59.260> I've<00:02:59.409> tried<00:02:59.650> five<00:03:00.549> minutes

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
ten minutes that I've tried five minutes

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.509 
ten minutes that I've tried five minutes
or<00:03:01.030> whatever<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.049> could<00:03:02.349> not<00:03:02.590> get<00:03:02.919> the

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
or whatever but I could not get the

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.089 
or whatever but I could not get the

function<00:03:12.819> to<00:03:13.239> allow<00:03:13.329> you<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.629> copy<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.109> from

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.689 

second<00:03:21.159> hurdle<00:03:21.310> I<00:03:21.519> ran<00:03:21.759> into<00:03:21.939> was<00:03:22.859> that<00:03:23.859> the

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
second hurdle I ran into was that the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:27.420 
second hurdle I ran into was that the
Xbox<00:03:25.209> 360<00:03:26.049> would<00:03:26.229> not<00:03:26.379> read<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.709> bitmap<00:03:27.069> file

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
Xbox 360 would not read the bitmap file

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.119 
Xbox 360 would not read the bitmap file
wouldn't<00:03:28.060> read<00:03:28.180> dot<00:03:28.419> BMP<00:03:28.629> so<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.620> went<00:03:29.859> back<00:03:30.009> to

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
wouldn't read dot BMP so I went back to

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.999 
wouldn't read dot BMP so I went back to
my<00:03:30.220> computer<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.699> I<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.959> know<00:03:32.079> I<00:03:32.109> recreated

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:33.009 
my computer and I you know I recreated

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:39.390 
my computer and I you know I recreated
the<00:03:33.159> files<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:35.519> bitmap<00:03:36.569> JPEG<00:03:37.569> ping<00:03:38.500> TIFF<00:03:39.189> and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
the files in bitmap JPEG ping TIFF and

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.159 
the files in bitmap JPEG ping TIFF and
Targa<00:03:40.530> image<00:03:41.530> files<00:03:41.859> and<00:03:42.159> I<00:03:42.879> took<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:43.959> back<00:03:44.109> to

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
Targa image files and I took it back to

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.059 
Targa image files and I took it back to
the<00:03:44.409> 360<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:45.009> the<00:03:45.129> ps3<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:46.329> ps3<00:03:47.019> read<00:03:47.739> all<00:03:48.040> of

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
the 360 and the ps3 the ps3 read all of

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.050 
the 360 and the ps3 the ps3 read all of
the<00:03:48.340> files<00:03:48.609> except<00:03:49.180> for<00:03:49.659> the<00:03:50.109> targa<00:03:50.739> file<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:52.030> I

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
the files except for the targa file so I

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.999 
the files except for the targa file so I
was<00:03:52.180> able<00:03:52.299> to<00:03:52.449> read<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:52.810> bitmap<00:03:53.169> it<00:03:53.650> was<00:03:53.769> able

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:54.009 
was able to read the bitmap it was able

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.319 
was able to read the bitmap it was able
to<00:03:54.099> read<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.400> JPEG<00:03:54.879> the<00:03:55.540> ping<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.229> the<00:03:56.319> tiff

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
to read the JPEG the ping and the tiff

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.110 
to read the JPEG the ping and the tiff
but<00:03:58.329> now<00:03:58.569> the<00:03:58.629> Targa<00:03:59.109> now<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.680> Xbox<00:04:00.189> 360<00:04:00.849> was

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
but now the Targa now the Xbox 360 was

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.689 
but now the Targa now the Xbox 360 was
only<00:04:01.629> able<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:02.109> read<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:03.430> JPEG<00:04:03.909> file<00:04:04.590> now<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:06.400> I

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
only able to read the JPEG file now so I

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.830 
only able to read the JPEG file now so I
did<00:04:07.509> the<00:04:07.629> comparison<00:04:08.229> with<00:04:08.409> JPEGs<00:04:09.539> on<00:04:10.539> both

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
did the comparison with JPEGs on both

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.959 
did the comparison with JPEGs on both
systems<00:04:11.049> to<00:04:11.409> make<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.709> fair<00:04:11.919> and<00:04:11.949> I<00:04:12.189> used<00:04:12.729> a

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:12.969 
systems to make it fair and I used a

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.479 
systems to make it fair and I used a
JPEG<00:04:13.539> compression<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.500> was<00:04:14.650> very<00:04:14.859> very<00:04:15.159> low

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
JPEG compression that was very very low

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.240 
JPEG compression that was very very low
so<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:17.169> picture<00:04:17.769> is<00:04:17.859> very<00:04:18.009> little

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
so the picture is very little

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.590 
so the picture is very little
compression<00:04:18.820> in<00:04:18.909> it

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.900 

okay<00:04:23.380> so<00:04:23.440> first<00:04:23.770> up<00:04:23.980> is<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.160> Xbox<00:04:24.490> 360<00:04:25.650> first

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
okay so first up is the Xbox 360 first

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.610 
okay so first up is the Xbox 360 first
we're<00:04:27.910> gonna<00:04:27.970> zoom<00:04:28.300> in<00:04:28.360> all<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:28.990> way<00:04:29.170> and<00:04:29.470> take

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
we're gonna zoom in all the way and take

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.180 
we're gonna zoom in all the way and take
a<00:04:29.680> look<00:04:29.980> at<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.430> pixels<00:04:31.710> okay<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:32.770> can<00:04:33.010> see

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
a look at the pixels okay you can see

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.390 
a look at the pixels okay you can see
here<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:33.780> each<00:04:34.780> white<00:04:35.200> dot<00:04:35.470> is<00:04:35.680> about<00:04:35.950> four

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
here that each white dot is about four

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.460 
here that each white dot is about four
pixels<00:04:36.910> wide<00:04:38.070> should<00:04:39.070> be<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.840> single<00:04:40.840> color<00:04:41.050> per

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.860 
pixels wide should be a single color per
pixel<00:04:41.740> so<00:04:42.100> it<00:04:42.160> should<00:04:42.280> be<00:04:42.430> black<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:43.720> then

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
pixel so it should be black and then

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.180 
pixel so it should be black and then
white<00:04:44.160> should<00:04:45.160> be<00:04:45.280> one<00:04:45.520> white<00:04:45.820> pixel<00:04:46.660> with<00:04:47.590> a
