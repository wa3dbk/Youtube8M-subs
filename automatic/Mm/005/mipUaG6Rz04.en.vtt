boiler<00:02:17.530> on<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:18.820> wall<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:20.110> gas<00:02:21.420> connection

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
boiler on that wall the gas connection

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.160 
boiler on that wall the gas connection
will<00:02:23.410> come<00:02:23.890> through<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:26.160> down<00:02:27.160> there<00:02:27.960> as<00:02:28.960> you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
will come through just down there as you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.310 
will come through just down there as you
can<00:02:29.320> see<00:02:29.530> there<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:30.010> absolutely<00:02:30.640> no<00:02:31.320> flagging

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
can see there is absolutely no flagging

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.080 
can see there is absolutely no flagging
or<00:02:32.560> anything<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:35.340> roof<00:02:36.340> we've<00:02:36.670> just<00:02:36.940> got

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
or anything on the roof we've just got

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.690 
or anything on the roof we've just got
this<00:02:40.170> sort<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.200> ash<00:02:41.380> felt<00:02:41.770> what<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.400> sort<00:02:42.640> of

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
this sort of ash felt what is it sort of

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.380 
this sort of ash felt what is it sort of
felt<00:02:42.970> roofing<00:02:43.390> felt<00:02:43.770> material<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:46.090> pipe

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
felt roofing felt material that pipe

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.670 
felt roofing felt material that pipe
there<00:02:46.690> is<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:47.290> overflow<00:02:49.110> from<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.350> tank

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
there is the overflow from the tank

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.640 
there is the overflow from the tank
which<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.780> other<00:02:52.930> side<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.470> this

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
which is just the other side of this

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.360 
which is just the other side of this
this<00:02:54.340> stud<00:02:54.700> work<00:02:54.880> has<00:02:55.600> all<00:02:55.900> been<00:02:56.140> made<00:02:56.980> by<00:02:57.310> the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
this stud work has all been made by the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.840 
this stud work has all been made by the
last<00:02:57.700> owner<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:59.620> future<00:03:00.250> videos<00:03:00.610> we'll

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
last owner and in future videos we'll

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.970 
last owner and in future videos we'll
just<00:03:01.240> be<00:03:01.450> referring<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.620> him<00:03:02.770> as<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:02.980> idiot

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
just be referring to him as the idiot

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.070 
just be referring to him as the idiot
because<00:03:05.980> everything<00:03:06.459> he's<00:03:06.580> done<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:07.080> really

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
because everything he's done is really

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.300 
because everything he's done is really
poor<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:08.740> can<00:03:09.610> see<00:03:09.850> here<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:12.220> know

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
poor you can see here the you know

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.310 
poor you can see here the you know
there's<00:03:12.490> virtually<00:03:12.910> no<00:03:13.090> insulation<00:03:13.600> what

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
there's virtually no insulation what

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.580 
there's virtually no insulation what
have<00:03:14.410> we<00:03:14.530> got<00:03:14.709> maybe<00:03:15.780> half<00:03:16.780> an<00:03:17.050> inch<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.410> an

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
have we got maybe half an inch to an

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.070 
have we got maybe half an inch to an
inch<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:18.580> all<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.910> this<00:03:19.030> needs<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.510> be<00:03:20.519> re

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
inch so all of this needs to be re

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.190 
inch so all of this needs to be re
insulated<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.790> my<00:03:25.150> idea<00:03:25.540> was<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.930> put<00:03:26.080> the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
insulated but my idea was to put the

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.650 
insulated but my idea was to put the
boiler<00:03:26.560> here<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:28.620> those<00:03:29.760> 22<00:03:30.760> mil<00:03:31.000> pipes<00:03:31.300> I

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
boiler here and those 22 mil pipes I

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.479 
boiler here and those 22 mil pipes I
think<00:03:32.470> are<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:33.010> feed<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.970> return<00:03:35.220> from<00:03:36.220> the

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
think are the feed and return from the

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.570 
think are the feed and return from the
hot-water<00:03:37.450> tank<00:03:38.320> that's<00:03:38.800> already<00:03:39.040> in<00:03:39.310> there

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
hot-water tank that's already in there

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.970 
hot-water tank that's already in there
so<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.510> know<00:03:40.989> normally<00:03:41.350> they<00:03:41.470> would<00:03:41.650> go<00:03:41.800> off

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
so you know normally they would go off

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.350 
so you know normally they would go off
to<00:03:42.340> your<00:03:43.269> boiler<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.760> we<00:03:45.880> might<00:03:46.030> be<00:03:46.060> able<00:03:46.239> to

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
to your boiler so we might be able to

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.110 
to your boiler so we might be able to
use<00:03:46.480> some<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.110> these<00:03:47.230> old<00:03:47.590> pipes<00:03:48.550> but<00:03:48.970> we'll

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
use some of these old pipes but we'll

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.759 
use some of these old pipes but we'll
have<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.300> rip<00:03:49.870> out<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.890> old<00:03:50.920> tank<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:52.870> get<00:03:53.650> the

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
have to rip out the old tank to get the

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.940 
have to rip out the old tank to get the
new<00:03:53.890> boiler<00:03:54.160> installed<00:03:54.880> there

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
new boiler installed there

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.820 
new boiler installed there
hopefully<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.220> flue<00:03:58.000> can<00:03:58.390> go<00:03:58.570> straight<00:03:59.530> up

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
hopefully the flue can go straight up

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.290 
hopefully the flue can go straight up
and<00:04:00.010> out<00:04:00.130> of<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.390> roof<00:04:01.600> just<00:04:01.989> up<00:04:02.260> there<00:04:03.300> we've

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
and out of the roof just up there we've

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.539 
and out of the roof just up there we've
obviously<00:04:04.450> got<00:04:04.750> electrics<00:04:05.230> up<00:04:05.440> here<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:06.459> I'm

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
obviously got electrics up here so I'm

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.300 
obviously got electrics up here so I'm
hoping<00:04:06.790> there'll<00:04:07.150> be<00:04:07.209> no<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:08.739> know<00:04:08.860> no<00:04:09.040> major

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
hoping there'll be no you know no major

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.289 
hoping there'll be no you know no major
issues<00:04:09.959> unfortunately<00:04:11.130> for<00:04:12.130> us<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:13.180> I'll

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
issues unfortunately for us and I'll

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.150 
issues unfortunately for us and I'll
just<00:04:13.480> go<00:04:13.630> back<00:04:13.840> out<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:14.760> show<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:15.840> yeah<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
just go back out and show you yeah the

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:28.010 
just go back out and show you yeah the
idiot<00:04:18.549> has<00:04:19.169> put<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.440> tank<00:04:21.370> in<00:04:21.900> place<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:24.850> then

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.230 

bill<00:04:29.910> help<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.090> water<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.690> cover<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.140> or<00:04:32.669> if<00:04:33.669> it

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
bill help the water to cover it or if it

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.490 
bill help the water to cover it or if it
will<00:04:34.330> focus<00:04:34.620> come<00:04:35.620> on<00:04:36.300> that<00:04:37.300> is<00:04:37.660> just<00:04:38.200> plywood

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
will focus come on that is just plywood

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.969 
will focus come on that is just plywood
that's<00:04:39.460> been<00:04:39.669> painted<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:41.590> he's<00:04:41.770> just

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
that's been painted and he's just

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.279 
that's been painted and he's just
hammered<00:04:42.729> it<00:04:42.820> in<00:04:43.000> there<00:04:43.270> after<00:04:43.599> installing

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
hammered it in there after installing

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.860 
hammered it in there after installing
the<00:04:45.330> boiler<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:47.229> I<00:04:47.740> suspect<00:04:48.729> what<00:04:48.940> we'll<00:04:49.120> do<00:04:49.360> is

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
the boiler so I suspect what we'll do is

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.300 
the boiler so I suspect what we'll do is
just<00:04:50.800> knock<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.370> out<00:04:51.599> and<00:04:53.039> so<00:04:54.039> we've<00:04:54.160> got

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
just knock that out and so we've got

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.980 
just knock that out and so we've got
full<00:04:54.550> access<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.240> boy<00:04:55.390> there<00:04:55.660> on<00:04:55.750> all<00:04:55.870> the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
full access to the boy there on all the

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.719 
full access to the boy there on all the
pipes

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
pipes

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.839 
pipes
I<00:04:57.729> may<00:04:58.510> even<00:04:58.690> cut<00:04:59.680> out<00:04:59.710> the<00:05:00.099> wall<00:05:00.370> there<00:05:00.700> that

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
I may even cut out the wall there that

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.960 
I may even cut out the wall there that
goes<00:05:01.030> through<00:05:01.360> into<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.690> loft<00:05:01.870> space<00:05:02.169> and<00:05:02.970> you

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
goes through into the loft space and you

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.610 
goes through into the loft space and you
know<00:05:04.060> they<00:05:04.180> would<00:05:04.300> just<00:05:04.660> install<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.229> boiler

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
know they would just install the boiler

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.210 
know they would just install the boiler
and<00:05:05.740> everything<00:05:06.130> that's<00:05:06.310> required<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:08.220> put

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
and everything that's required and put

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.610 
and everything that's required and put
all<00:05:09.370> these<00:05:09.520> walls<00:05:09.820> back<00:05:10.180> into<00:05:10.450> place<00:05:10.690> it<00:05:11.500> will

all these walls back into place it will
allow<00:05:11.770> us<00:05:11.800> in<00:05:12.580> a<00:05:12.669> much<00:05:12.820> easier<00:05:12.849> access<00:05:14.039> come<00:05:15.039> on

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
allow us in a much easier access come on

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.839 
allow us in a much easier access come on

stupid<00:05:16.450> camera<00:05:18.630> it<00:05:19.630> will<00:05:19.750> allow<00:05:19.990> us<00:05:20.020> much

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
stupid camera it will allow us much

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.640 
stupid camera it will allow us much
easier<00:05:20.770> access<00:05:20.950> if<00:05:21.400> we<00:05:21.669> if<00:05:22.270> we<00:05:22.450> do<00:05:22.630> that<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.110> we

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
easier access if we if we do that and we

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.140 
easier access if we if we do that and we
can<00:05:23.830> get<00:05:24.010> right<00:05:24.220> in<00:05:24.430> there<00:05:24.669> and<00:05:24.849> check<00:05:25.120> the

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
can get right in there and check the

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.330 
can get right in there and check the
condition<00:05:25.810> of<00:05:25.870> all<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:26.080> pipes<00:05:26.470> and<00:05:26.800> bits<00:05:27.250> and

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
condition of all the pipes and bits and

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.140 
condition of all the pipes and bits and
pieces<00:05:28.050> so<00:05:29.050> yeah<00:05:29.770> that's<00:05:30.070> just<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.940> quick

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
pieces so yeah that's just the quick

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.810 
pieces so yeah that's just the quick
look<00:05:31.330> at<00:05:31.539> the<00:05:32.229> issues<00:05:32.560> in<00:05:32.830> this<00:05:33.010> house<00:05:33.250> so<00:05:33.669> we

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
look at the issues in this house so we

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.930 
look at the issues in this house so we
have<00:05:34.410> poor<00:05:35.410> or<00:05:35.710> non-existent<00:05:36.990> insulation

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
have poor or non-existent insulation

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.790 
have poor or non-existent insulation
same<00:05:39.940> with<00:05:40.120> this<00:05:40.270> window<00:05:41.229> here<00:05:41.470> we've<00:05:41.650> got

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
same with this window here we've got

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.219 
same with this window here we've got
very<00:05:42.070> old<00:05:42.340> aluminium<00:05:43.330> windows<00:05:43.750> that<00:05:43.930> need<00:05:44.110> to

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
very old aluminium windows that need to

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.700 
very old aluminium windows that need to
be<00:05:44.349> ripped<00:05:44.560> out<00:05:44.710> and<00:05:44.919> changed<00:05:45.430> the<00:05:46.090> problem<00:05:46.479> is

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
be ripped out and changed the problem is

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.409 
be ripped out and changed the problem is
the<00:05:48.120> framework<00:05:49.120> here<00:05:49.680> is<00:05:50.680> not<00:05:51.669> big<00:05:52.120> enough<00:05:52.150> to

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
the framework here is not big enough to

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.500 
the framework here is not big enough to
fit<00:05:52.990> modern<00:05:53.650> windows<00:05:54.340> so<00:05:55.120> we're<00:05:55.210> gonna<00:05:55.300> have

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
fit modern windows so we're gonna have

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.490 
fit modern windows so we're gonna have
to<00:05:55.539> have<00:05:55.720> this<00:05:55.960> dormer<00:05:56.830> all<00:05:57.070> knocked<00:05:57.700> out<00:05:57.940> and

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
to have this dormer all knocked out and

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.130 
to have this dormer all knocked out and
a<00:05:59.500> new<00:05:59.890> framework<00:06:00.750> built<00:06:03.510> the<00:06:04.510> other<00:06:04.660> side<00:06:04.930> of

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
a new framework built the other side of

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.610 
a new framework built the other side of
this<00:06:05.320> is<00:06:05.729> nothing<00:06:06.729> but<00:06:06.760> the<00:06:07.599> outside<00:06:07.840> wooden

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
this is nothing but the outside wooden

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.400 
this is nothing but the outside wooden
cladding<00:06:08.830> so<00:06:09.430> there's<00:06:09.610> no<00:06:10.210> insulation<00:06:10.690> here

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
cladding so there's no insulation here

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.350 
cladding so there's no insulation here
at<00:06:11.560> all

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
at all

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.460 
at all
you<00:06:13.360> know<00:06:13.479> coupled<00:06:13.870> with<00:06:13.900> these<00:06:14.140> old

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
you know coupled with these old

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.270 
you know coupled with these old
inefficient

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
inefficient

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.210

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
heaters it's you know it's all a bit of

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.279 
heaters it's you know it's all a bit of
a<00:06:18.280> mess<00:06:18.490> so<00:06:19.390> yeah<00:06:19.630> that<00:06:19.840> was<00:06:19.900> just<00:06:19.960> a<00:06:20.169> quick
