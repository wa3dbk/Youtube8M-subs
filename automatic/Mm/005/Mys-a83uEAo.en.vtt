00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:04.340
 politicians the hacienda spokesman 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.300
 listen to it here 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.529
 listening to workers 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.829
 like back and legs 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:15.279
 It is not normal for politicians to listen to the stories of the people 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.179
 by the way this element guadiato 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.630
 again at five in the afternoon in the stubborn contest 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.630
 rosa that's a bitch for everyone 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.560
 very few do not 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.620
 and well, yes 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.070
 rubén castro 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.420
 now the correct one is not because they are betis do not want to take private blame 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.190
 public hear these stories and why does not commit also ventilated 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.140
 which are where it is expressed 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.670
 Catholic aims 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.940
 Catholic Church 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.450
 in fact logos like a night heart we started a bit what has been 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.160
 the difficult relationship harper with a Yankee double standard 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.239
 I really do not have the answer 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.000
 I do not think I do not know because without them they do not want to listen to 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.720
 Zapala those workers 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.900
 I heard stories 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.240
 these workers they are making the cup 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.470
 pedro pita 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.870
 they are ensuring that people who go a little bit 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.500
 they receive 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.940
 and arequipa who and Jewish lempiras 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.420
 although they can not turn around 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.480
 I think they do not have health insurance 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.460
 baltimore I have not seen anyone in the plant that has enough money 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.630
 to pay for the company's health insurance 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.710
 I know colleagues who have to help you billions of dollars 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.880
 cutting from his check he smelled little 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.900
 when you are going to be washing clothes to say 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.070
 this is not 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.520
 they can not do 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.950
 we can not allow those things 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.240
 I know people from the plant 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.420
 working 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.910
 working hard 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.340
 and whoever wants moscow 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.120
 to take food out of 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.830
 the assistance 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.149
 this of that situation of the workers and supply 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.149
 and I say what I measure square of the deputation 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:15.679
 except that for example sites like it will do more 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.439
 the union alone the differences between 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.199
 superiority to marc gené 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:22.689
 He indicated that this year's goal 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.889
 could change this situation of workers 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.229
 the famp to the hospital in a way not 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:29.999
 pensions has not occurred 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.469
 of hospital with him 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:33.840
 it provoked the birds 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.890
 of this group 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.350
 booty we have done but union and putin accused unions according to you by 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.290
 cent and it's better for the worker 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.399
 the third is the most basic 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:45.299
 these technical workers 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.399
 that will return to the sea 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.060
 there is no worker around the plant 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.609
 we earn less 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.769
 side laws 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:55.839
 the superior 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.449
 people are winning 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.489
 between seven and another side 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.310
 the average salaries 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.549
 Live the beard 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.519
 mate as presenter 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.589
 the same job allan would suffer 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:10.589
 like good ice cream 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.359
 almost all the people that I know of arms 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:16.509
 and in that moment 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:19.309
 that who covers the whole afternoon has 30 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.199
 he was released 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.199
 again I have never met a companion 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:25.899
 those live 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:30.129
 the paparazzo that can for the health insurance offered by the company 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.219
 forever 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.609
 These are difference from the bouquet 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.379
 It is foolish to speak of respect and dignity to lose the fact of having 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.980
 someone in his defense if the company that was good and bad 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.209
 people leave typical caused machines 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.359
 in Mexico 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.059
 is part of the working letter caravaca has to have and they are not to win every 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:53.549
 practice 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.819
 these directions different parties whole rats 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.629
 that's why his first block 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.290
 your baby does not want to pay the pp does not want to get to power the worker 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:06.829
 between them the map 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:07.669
 this third 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.399
 he basically 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:12.839
 unions to ensure that the 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.059
 so that they are not of the mind 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:18.059
 the negotiation that your negotiation there are some rules 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.609
 channel plus different 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.849
 xiomara remove by the bug 7 14 if union 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:29.909
 you can be fired by jorge rotondo and you clues the case that the environment 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.610
 you were fired 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.080
 let's say that the one who tied for three years attacked her 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.129
 I do not like it is possible to think that these dangers of the river 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.830
 that is perfectly legal however counts as union with contract 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.289
 a contract 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.020
 erick and that is regulated detroit 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.199
 so exhausted reason has given 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.219
 I do not see 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.779
 ibope chases even in the written book 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:03.319
 you can not trust but on the other because I think that this is true then 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.039
 cent and that's more money no more salary 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.620
 more rights 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.960
 the work rhythms 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.710
 between so much expectation 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.259
 percent 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:13.999
 which labor of the workers 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.239
 of the sota dpto emiratí we also had the current gold cup 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.529
 of the estimated arrival time of two months 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:26.029
 when it comes to getting away because it will not happen has falsified 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:28.449
 the street or 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.409
 while the unions is little going to suppose that reinvent 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.879
 Silver mates have 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:37.919
 this is so be it 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.919
 because businesses have this system 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.139
 because the classmates have 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.800
 but still think 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.339
 and they feel 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.589
 I stayed there yes he spoke in public 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:51.379
 If I go to the marches 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.129
 for getting in trouble at work 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:56.800
 may have problems with supervisors 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.059
 or until dying lose my job 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:02.520
 quest and delivered under the federal labor law here 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.839
 no worker can lose his job for organizing year 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.589
 the abyss of the plant 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:14.589
 the two complaints we had with the poem next to the lawyer 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:16.930
 parts of the device 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.830
 is that if these things happened and 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.889
 so timid region the threats 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.999
 and still people feel down this price 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.980
 still 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.210
 groups of workers who are outside are talking a lot 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.020
 by his classmates 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.599
 do not feel moved 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:37.240
 we need more force to effect the plant but also 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.550
 when we arrived well 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.639
 and they feel the support of the never Latino community 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:47.479
 in churches but politicians is for all that 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.300
 he also encouraged more to die 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.499
 motivation 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:53.499
 to be up to March this is something that is difficult 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:55.969
 people want 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:58.629
 that this midnight 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:00.889
 nicki bille by someone 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:02.620
 harris that clay that 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.860
 momo mick jagger 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.509
 money to pay for food 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.639
 this is 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:09.889
 this is that they are doing 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:10.740
 but no 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.099
 does not have genes to want for the little again for the decade of work 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:17.340
 this legacy of losing your job 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.129
 by getting organized there is a child silvia would be almost like a title 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:23.839
 although worker 

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:25.249
 they are afraid 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:28.319
 the employer to use the money to pay them less have fewer rights 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.979
 and having less I'm actress maricielo to a point where one 

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:36.389
 really not being able to own their rights and improving as all 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:40.469

 next to which we can the Lord our support and respect his fight 

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:52.039
 the one of this x 7 in the global computation is enough to promote and listen to 

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:53.270
 stories say 

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.720
 finally it sucks fight and it is worth it that all our workers 

00:07:57.419 --> 00:07:59.889
