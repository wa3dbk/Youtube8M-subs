for very long as it can make them cold
which<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.600> problem<00:02:01.110> or<00:02:01.759> stress<00:02:02.759> them<00:02:02.939> out

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
which is a problem or stress them out

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.439 
which is a problem or stress them out
which<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> very<00:02:03.659> big<00:02:03.810> problem<00:02:03.990> as<00:02:04.320> well
