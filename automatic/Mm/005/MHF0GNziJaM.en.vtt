the amount of mob spawning in your mob
spawner<00:00:09.740> or<00:00:10.740> mob<00:00:10.980> farm<00:00:11.809> basically<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.929> one

spawner or mob farm basically the one

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.749 
spawner or mob farm basically the one
mistake<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.710> did<00:00:13.920> when<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.130> first<00:00:14.219> started

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
mistake that I did when I first started

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.580 
mistake that I did when I first started
off<00:00:14.849> doing<00:00:15.269> these<00:00:15.450> mob<00:00:15.690> farms<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.560> I

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
off doing these mob farms is that I

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.920 
off doing these mob farms is that I
didn't<00:00:17.010> go<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.310> ground<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:18.539> light<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
didn't go on the ground to light of the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.609 
didn't go on the ground to light of the
caves<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.710> was<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> major<00:00:20.400> flaw<00:00:20.939> because

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
caves and this was a major flaw because

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.460 
caves and this was a major flaw because
when<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.769> first<00:00:22.980> go<00:00:23.670> into<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.000> chunk<00:00:24.470> they

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
when you first go into the chunk they

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.259 
when you first go into the chunk they
all<00:00:25.590> spoil<00:00:25.920> them<00:00:26.189> off<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.550> everything's<00:00:26.970> fine

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
all spoil them off on everything's fine

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.689 
all spoil them off on everything's fine
and<00:00:27.539> then<00:00:28.170> what<00:00:28.380> happens<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.980> they<00:00:29.070> all<00:00:29.250> spawn

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
and then what happens is they all spawn

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.299 
and then what happens is they all spawn
below<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.929> where<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.980> amount<00:00:32.219> of

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
below and this is where the amount of

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.520 
below and this is where the amount of
mobs<00:00:32.550> spawn<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.059> drop<00:00:33.450> rapidly<00:00:34.020> because

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
mobs spawn is drop rapidly because

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.900 
mobs spawn is drop rapidly because
they're<00:00:34.710> all<00:00:34.829> getting<00:00:35.100> spawned<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
they're all getting spawned in and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.000 
they're all getting spawned in and
they're<00:00:36.000> not<00:00:36.030> dying<00:00:36.420> they're<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.200> they're

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
they're not dying they're just they're

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.260 
they're not dying they're just they're
just<00:00:38.129> wandering<00:00:38.399> around<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> dark

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
just wandering around here in the dark

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.220 
just wandering around here in the dark
so<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.070> gonna<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.690> decrease<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
so this is gonna just decrease the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.720 
so this is gonna just decrease the
amount<00:00:43.290> hearts<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.010> dramatically

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
amount hearts and you get dramatically

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
amount hearts and you get dramatically
it's<00:00:45.629> one<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.989> first<00:00:46.230> things<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.649> I

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it's one of the first things that I

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.380 
it's one of the first things that I
didn't<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.340> when<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.610> started<00:00:47.850> making<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.270> I

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
didn't do when I started making it I

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.290 
didn't do when I started making it I
mean<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.809> used<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> think<00:00:49.350> ah<00:00:49.640> now<00:00:50.640> there's<00:00:51.180> not

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
mean I used to think ah now there's not

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
mean I used to think ah now there's not
much<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> problem<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:53.039> shouldn't<00:00:53.280> affect

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
much of a problem it shouldn't affect

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.970 
much of a problem it shouldn't affect
her<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.699> much<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.680> did

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
her that much but really it really did

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.889 
her that much but really it really did
affect<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.610> mean<00:00:56.760> now<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.570> getting<00:00:57.840> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
affect it I mean now I'm getting a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.360 
affect it I mean now I'm getting a
couple<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.230> stacks<00:00:58.530> from<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.890> lighting<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
couple of stacks from just lighting a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.709 
couple of stacks from just lighting a
few<00:01:00.320> huge<00:01:01.320> stacks<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.710> them<00:01:02.180> good<00:01:03.180> power<00:01:03.420> by

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
few huge stacks of them good power by

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
few huge stacks of them good power by
just<00:01:03.930> lighting<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.379> few<00:01:04.589> areas<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.189> that's

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
just lighting a few areas and that's

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.010 
just lighting a few areas and that's
that's<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.360> saying<00:01:06.600> something

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that's really saying something

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.770 
that's really saying something
I<00:01:07.170> mean<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.159> I'm<00:01:08.369> right<00:01:08.909> underneath<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.570> sea

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
I mean this I'm right underneath the sea

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
I mean this I'm right underneath the sea
another<00:01:10.650> reason<00:01:10.920> why<00:01:11.010> does<00:01:11.220> under<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> sea<00:01:11.640> is

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
another reason why does under the sea is

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.090 
another reason why does under the sea is
that<00:01:11.939> once<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.140> these<00:01:13.260> caves<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.830> don't

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that once I like these caves I don't

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.850 
that once I like these caves I don't
need<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.700> they'll<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.780> mob<00:01:16.110> bulwark<00:01:16.350> day

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
need to and they'll the mob bulwark day

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.620 
need to and they'll the mob bulwark day
or<00:01:16.920> night<00:01:17.119> there's<00:01:18.119> no<00:01:18.180> other<00:01:18.509> thing

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
or night there's no other thing

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.140 
or night there's no other thing
affecting<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.890> mean<00:01:20.390> if<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.659> was<00:01:22.369> on<00:01:23.369> solid

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
affecting it I mean if it was on solid

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.670 
affecting it I mean if it was on solid
ground<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.960> nighttime

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
ground at nighttime

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.980 
ground at nighttime
they'll<00:01:26.280> spawn<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> ground<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.780> didn't

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
they'll spawn on the ground if I didn't

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.609 
they'll spawn on the ground if I didn't
write<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.140> up

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
write it up

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.660 
write it up
but<00:01:30.140> dislike<00:01:31.140> reduces<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.159> amount<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.369> work<00:01:32.520> I

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
but dislike reduces the amount of work I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
but dislike reduces the amount of work I
need<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.909> do<00:01:33.030> by<00:01:34.790> making<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.909> above<00:01:36.240> water<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
need to do by making it above water it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.830 
need to do by making it above water it
helps<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.040> ice<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.369> well<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.549> guess<00:01:38.850> ice<00:01:39.240> is

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
helps for ice as well I guess ice is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.440 
helps for ice as well I guess ice is
easier

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.630 

yeah<00:01:43.110> that's<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> main<00:01:43.680> tip<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.280> lots<00:01:44.549> of

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
yeah that's the main tip just lots of

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.480 
yeah that's the main tip just lots of
your<00:01:44.759> caves<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.409> go<00:01:46.409> around<00:01:46.560> lights<00:01:47.100> no<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
your caves just go around lights no I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.340 
your caves just go around lights no I
mean<00:01:47.670> there's<00:01:48.420> an<00:01:48.509> advantage<00:01:48.780> look<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.229> all

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
mean there's an advantage look at all

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.789 
mean there's an advantage look at all
the<00:01:49.530> these<00:01:50.189> always<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.850> coal<00:01:51.439> I've<00:01:52.439> had<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the these always like coal I've had a
