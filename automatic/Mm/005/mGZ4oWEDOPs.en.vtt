Lexmark and Lockheed Martin when I was
in<00:00:38.399> ninth<00:00:38.579> grade<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.149> took<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.510> robotics<00:00:40.230> class

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
in ninth grade I took a robotics class

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.549 
in ninth grade I took a robotics class
using<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.010> Lego<00:00:41.520> Mindstorm<00:00:42.059> program<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.540> XTS

using the Lego Mindstorm program in XTS

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.900 
using the Lego Mindstorm program in XTS
and<00:00:43.649> that's<00:00:44.160> actually<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.640> got<00:00:44.760> me

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and that's actually what got me

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.490 
and that's actually what got me
interested<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.480> engineering<00:00:45.989> there's<00:00:46.320> only

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
interested in engineering there's only

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.560 
interested in engineering there's only
like<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.039> two<00:00:47.070> girls<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.610> my<00:00:47.640> classes<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.450> am

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
like one or two girls in my classes I am

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.209 
like one or two girls in my classes I am
in<00:00:48.809> computer<00:00:49.140> science<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:49.950> good<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
in computer science and so it's good to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.040 
in computer science and so it's good to
go<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.789> there<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.210> teach<00:00:51.420> these<00:00:51.629> girls<00:00:51.930> that

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
go out there and teach these girls that

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.229 
go out there and teach these girls that
it's<00:00:52.199> okay<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> become<00:00:52.860> an<00:00:52.980> engineer<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.699> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
it's okay to become an engineer and to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.240 
it's okay to become an engineer and to
show<00:00:54.449> them<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.230> an<00:00:55.410> engineer<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
show them like I'm an engineer and you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.229 
show them like I'm an engineer and you
guys<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.579> do<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.820> too

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
guys can do it too

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.180 
guys can do it too
people<00:00:57.750> aren't<00:00:57.870> pushing<00:00:58.140> girls<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.980> be

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
people aren't pushing girls to be

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.150 
people aren't pushing girls to be
engineers<00:01:00.120> or<00:01:00.449> doing<00:01:01.350> anything<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> STEM

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
engineers or doing anything in the STEM

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.039 
engineers or doing anything in the STEM
fields<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> few<00:01:03.329> girls<00:01:03.600> interested<00:01:03.809> at

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
fields and so a few girls interested at

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.780 
fields and so a few girls interested at
a<00:01:04.140> young<00:01:04.320> age<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.400> develop<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
a young age and if they develop a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.010 
a young age and if they develop a
passion<00:01:05.970> for<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.540> that's<00:01:06.720> something<00:01:06.900> that

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
passion for it and that's something that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.480 
passion for it and that's something that
they're<00:01:07.229> gonna<00:01:07.350> want<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> keep<00:01:07.920> doing<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
they're gonna want to keep doing and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.550 
they're gonna want to keep doing and
they'll<00:01:09.450> take<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.229> rest<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.470> their

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
they'll take it for the rest of their

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.330 
they'll take it for the rest of their
life<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.909> because<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:12.930> puts<00:01:13.920> me

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
life I like it because it really puts me

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.390 
life I like it because it really puts me
in<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> position<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.110> lot<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:16.979> our<00:01:17.220> young

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
in a position that a lot of our young

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.460 
in a position that a lot of our young
ladies<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.820> engineering<00:01:18.479> are<00:01:18.630> young<00:01:18.810> now<00:01:19.290> I'm

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
ladies in engineering are young now I'm

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.310 
ladies in engineering are young now I'm
the<00:01:19.619> only<00:01:19.650> male<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.780> feel

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the only male and I think I get to feel

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.980 
the only male and I think I get to feel
a<00:01:22.350> little<00:01:22.710> bit<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.400> intimidation<00:01:23.990> that

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
a little bit of the intimidation that

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.350 
a little bit of the intimidation that
our<00:01:25.380> young<00:01:25.680> ladies<00:01:26.100> feel<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.150> through

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
our young ladies feel that go through

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.420 
our young ladies feel that go through
engineering<00:01:27.720> who<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:28.740> historically

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
engineering who are historically

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.569 
engineering who are historically
underrepresented<00:01:30.439> so<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.799> concepts<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.369> we

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
underrepresented so the concepts that we

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.969 
underrepresented so the concepts that we
teach<00:01:33.000> are<00:01:33.240> mathematics<00:01:34.079> through<00:01:34.560> robotics

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
teach are mathematics through robotics

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.249 
teach are mathematics through robotics
we<00:01:35.850> also<00:01:36.000> talk<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.810> bit<00:01:36.990> about

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
we also talk a little bit about

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.380 
we also talk a little bit about
programming<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.490> an<00:01:38.670> area<00:01:38.820> where

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
programming and that's an area where

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.649 
programming and that's an area where
young<00:01:40.350> ladies<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:40.920> definitely<00:01:41.700> needed<00:01:41.909> and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
young ladies are definitely needed and

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.149 
young ladies are definitely needed and
it's<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.409> programming<00:01:43.829> for

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
it's not just programming for

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.179 
it's not just programming for
programming<00:01:44.670> sake<00:01:44.909> there's<00:01:45.720> an<00:01:45.930> application

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
programming sake there's an application

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.800 
programming sake there's an application
involved<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.180> immediate

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
involved and you you get immediate

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.819 
involved and you you get immediate
feedback<00:01:48.840> does<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.649> work<00:01:49.939> does<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.329> work

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.249 

they<00:01:55.759> get<00:01:55.969> really<00:01:56.390> frustrated<00:01:57.049> whenever

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
they get really frustrated whenever

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.080 
they get really frustrated whenever
something<00:01:57.619> goes<00:01:57.770> wrong<00:01:58.009> you<00:01:58.460> have<00:01:58.609> to<00:01:58.759> kind<00:01:58.999> of

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
something goes wrong you have to kind of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.090 
something goes wrong you have to kind of
make<00:01:59.390> them<00:01:59.569> sit<00:01:59.810> down<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.079> go<00:02:00.679> through<00:02:00.710> the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
make them sit down and go through the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.789 
make them sit down and go through the
process<00:02:01.549> of<00:02:01.729> brainstorming<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.990> coming<00:02:03.710> up

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
process of brainstorming and coming up

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.800 
process of brainstorming and coming up
with<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:03.979> new<00:02:04.130> design<00:02:04.310> in<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.850> program<00:02:05.329> but

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
with a new design in the program but

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.539 
with a new design in the program but
it's<00:02:05.959> really<00:02:06.140> cool<00:02:06.409> to<00:02:06.590> watch<00:02:06.770> their<00:02:07.310> faces

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
it's really cool to watch their faces

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:08.949 
it's really cool to watch their faces
light<00:02:07.880> up<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.179> ever<00:02:08.269> they<00:02:08.390> finally<00:02:08.720> get<00:02:08.869> it

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
light up and ever they finally get it

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.719 
light up and ever they finally get it
right<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.410> they<00:02:09.979> succeed<00:02:10.399> in<00:02:10.549> their<00:02:10.670> mission

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
right and they succeed in their mission

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.350 
right and they succeed in their mission
I<00:02:14.110> was<00:02:15.110> like<00:02:15.920> what<00:02:16.160> type<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.430> control<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.180> to

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
I was like what type of control is to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.380 
I was like what type of control is to
use<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.930> lot<00:02:18.349> kind<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.739> pieces<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.370> put<00:02:19.760> on<00:02:20.090> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
use a lot kind of pieces to put on the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.199 
use a lot kind of pieces to put on the
robot<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.989> make<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.349> like<00:02:21.830> on<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.220> water<00:02:22.400> float

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
robot to make it like on the water float

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.089 
robot to make it like on the water float
not<00:02:23.390> Foley<00:02:23.690> tip<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.379> stuff<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.860> most

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
not Foley tip and stuff the most

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.490 
not Foley tip and stuff the most
challenging<00:02:25.819> part<00:02:26.120> was<00:02:26.239> getting<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.750> boat<00:02:27.260> to

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
challenging part was getting the boat to

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.400 
challenging part was getting the boat to
float<00:02:27.890> properly<00:02:28.640> which<00:02:29.629> didn't<00:02:30.019> require<00:02:30.110> a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
float properly which didn't require a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.680 
float properly which didn't require a
lot<00:02:30.860> of<00:02:30.890> trial<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.489> error<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.060> far<00:02:32.540> I've

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
lot of trial and error so far I've

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.280 
lot of trial and error so far I've
learned<00:02:32.930> about<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.920> buoyancy<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:35.049> about<00:02:36.049> how

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
learned about the buoyancy and about how

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.170 
learned about the buoyancy and about how
even<00:02:36.680> about<00:02:36.920> must<00:02:37.129> be<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.519> how<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.790> get<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.150> to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
even about must be and how to get it to

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.569 
even about must be and how to get it to
be<00:02:38.329> even<00:02:38.690> along<00:02:39.410> with<00:02:39.590> programming<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.340> so

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
be even along with programming it so

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.300 
be even along with programming it so
that<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.879> can<00:02:41.030> drive<00:02:41.329> around<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.810> water

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
that it can drive around in the water

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.160 
that it can drive around in the water
get<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.370> gear<00:02:44.150> trains<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.629> work<00:02:44.810> with<00:02:45.049> it

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
get the gear trains to work with it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.140 
get the gear trains to work with it
right<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.680> get<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:45.799> all<00:02:46.160> stabilized<00:02:46.730> where<00:02:47.060> it

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
right and get it all stabilized where it

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.699 
right and get it all stabilized where it
stays<00:02:47.329> and<00:02:47.569> works<00:02:47.720> I've<00:02:48.230> done<00:02:48.410> computer

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
stays and works I've done computer

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.160 
stays and works I've done computer
programming<00:02:49.310> before<00:02:49.640> but<00:02:50.090> I've<00:02:50.660> not<00:02:50.900> done<00:02:51.109> it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
programming before but I've not done it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.039 
programming before but I've not done it
to<00:02:51.560> make<00:02:52.160> something<00:02:52.640> move<00:02:52.910> it's<00:02:53.660> all<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
to make something move it's all the

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.670 
to make something move it's all the
testing<00:02:54.879> designing<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:56.840> things<00:02:57.139> and<00:02:57.500> then

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
testing designing the things and then

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.830 
testing designing the things and then
realizing<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:58.639> it<00:02:58.819> doesn't<00:02:59.209> work<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.780> then

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
realizing that it doesn't work and then

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.559 
realizing that it doesn't work and then
redesigning<00:03:00.829> it<00:03:01.130> until<00:03:01.609> you<00:03:01.819> get<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.269> product

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
redesigning it until you get a product

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.440 
redesigning it until you get a product
that<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.139> like<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.950> have<00:03:04.160> put<00:03:04.639> forth<00:03:04.970> many

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
that you like you have put forth many

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.000 
that you like you have put forth many
different<00:03:05.780> ideas<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.349> you<00:03:06.410> want<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.620> see<00:03:06.799> if

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
different ideas and you want to see if

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.890 
different ideas and you want to see if
it<00:03:07.160> has<00:03:07.280> worked<00:03:07.519> science<00:03:08.239> is<00:03:08.329> definitely<00:03:08.450> one

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
it has worked science is definitely one

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.900 
it has worked science is definitely one
of<00:03:08.989> my<00:03:09.109> most<00:03:09.440> interesting<00:03:10.040> subjects<00:03:10.549> to<00:03:10.760> me

there's so much you can never learn too
much<00:03:13.130> science<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.880> fun<00:03:14.180> part<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.780> getting<00:03:15.680> the

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
much science the fun part is getting the

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.220 
much science the fun part is getting the
challenge<00:03:16.609> you<00:03:17.120> just<00:03:17.269> want<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.540> be<00:03:17.660> challenged

challenge you just want to be challenged

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.870 
challenge you just want to be challenged
you<00:03:18.319> don't<00:03:18.500> want<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.950> give<00:03:19.130> up<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.579> just<00:03:19.760> want

just so much to learn and no matter how

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.690 
just so much to learn and no matter how
much<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:27.230> learn<00:03:27.530> we're<00:03:28.280> always<00:03:28.400> learning

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
much you learn we're always learning

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.599 
much you learn we're always learning
more<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.540> more<00:03:29.599> about<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:31.220> world<00:03:31.400> and

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
more and more about the world and

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.580 
more and more about the world and
everything<00:03:31.880> so<00:03:32.569> you<00:03:32.630> can<00:03:32.810> never<00:03:33.049> stop

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
everything so you can never stop

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.949 
everything so you can never stop
learning<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:35.060> that's<00:03:35.359> the<00:03:35.510> most<00:03:35.690> interesting

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
learning and that's the most interesting

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.690 
learning and that's the most interesting
part<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.680> want<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.069> be<00:03:37.160> an<00:03:37.250> engineer<00:03:37.340> when<00:03:37.609> I

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
part I want to be an engineer when I

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.909 
part I want to be an engineer when I
grow<00:03:37.730> up<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:38.299> I'm<00:03:39.169> not<00:03:39.230> really<00:03:39.530> sure<00:03:39.769> what

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
grow up and I'm not really sure what

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.309 
grow up and I'm not really sure what
kinda<00:03:40.370> idiot<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:41.690> I'm<00:03:41.810> trying<00:03:42.079> to<00:03:42.139> go<00:03:42.290> to

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
kinda idiot and so I'm trying to go to

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.990 
kinda idiot and so I'm trying to go to
as<00:03:42.590> many<00:03:42.620> like<00:03:42.919> cancer<00:03:43.489> things<00:03:43.669> as<00:03:43.819> possible

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
as many like cancer things as possible

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.789 
as many like cancer things as possible
so<00:03:44.690> that<00:03:44.720> way<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:44.930> can<00:03:45.139> like<00:03:45.260> figure<00:03:45.470> out<00:03:45.590> how<00:03:45.680> to

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
so that way I can like figure out how to

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.430 
so that way I can like figure out how to
be<00:03:45.889> mechanical<00:03:46.010> or<00:03:46.880> electrical<00:03:47.150> or<00:03:47.630> even

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
be mechanical or electrical or even

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.470 
be mechanical or electrical or even
biomedical<00:03:49.069> I<00:03:49.340> love<00:03:49.639> math<00:03:49.819> and<00:03:50.030> science<00:03:50.329> and<00:03:50.450> I

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
biomedical I love math and science and I

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.030 
biomedical I love math and science and I
think<00:03:50.510> engineering<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.500> like<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:51.919> use

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
think engineering and I like to use

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.330 
think engineering and I like to use
robots<00:03:52.489> I<00:03:52.849> like<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.540> be<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.690> teacher<00:03:53.930> but<00:03:54.470> after

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
robots I like to be a teacher but after

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.349 
robots I like to be a teacher but after
coming<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.639> this<00:03:55.730> camp<00:03:55.910> I<00:03:56.000> feel<00:03:56.180> more<00:03:56.299> like

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
coming to this camp I feel more like

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:57.050 
coming to this camp I feel more like
being<00:03:56.750> and

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
being and

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.540 
being and
near<00:03:57.420> is<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.440> kind<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.010> like<00:03:59.220> saying

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
near is a kind of like saying

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.610 
near is a kind of like saying
engineering<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.330> awesome<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.170> now<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.319> feel

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
engineering is awesome and now I feel

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.849 
engineering is awesome and now I feel
like<00:04:01.650> engineering<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.400> awesome
