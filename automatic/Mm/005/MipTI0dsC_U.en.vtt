00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
paint which is gonna be a semi-gloss

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.640 
paint which is gonna be a semi-gloss
which<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.509> essentially<00:00:16.049> exactly<00:00:16.139> what<00:00:16.560> it

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
which is essentially exactly what it

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.580 
which is essentially exactly what it
sounds<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.210> has<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> real<00:00:18.449> nice<00:00:18.600> Sheen<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.439> it

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
sounds like has a real nice Sheen to it

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.800 
sounds like has a real nice Sheen to it
unlike<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> flat<00:00:24.230> so<00:00:25.230> I'm<00:00:25.380> gonna<00:00:25.500> dump

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
unlike the flat so I'm gonna dump

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.419 
unlike the flat so I'm gonna dump
everything<00:00:27.810> but<00:00:27.990> about<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.470> quarter<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.189> this

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
everything but about a quarter of this

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.030 
everything but about a quarter of this
can<00:00:29.760> into<00:00:30.210> another<00:00:30.480> bucket<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.679> reason<00:00:31.920> I'm

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
can into another bucket the reason I'm

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.430 
can into another bucket the reason I'm
doing<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.840> because<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:34.050> want<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.320> avoid

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
doing that is because we want to avoid

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.549 
doing that is because we want to avoid
drips<00:00:35.130> at<00:00:35.340> all<00:00:35.460> costs<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.149> are<00:00:37.050> working<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
drips at all costs we are working with a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.869 
drips at all costs we are working with a
bulk<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:39.170> get<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.500> lot<00:00:41.100> better<00:00:41.280> probability

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
bulk can get a lot better probability

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.880 
bulk can get a lot better probability
that<00:00:42.270> you'd<00:00:42.420> be<00:00:42.540> getting<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.200> drips<00:00:43.530> when<00:00:43.770> you

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that you'd be getting the drips when you

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.760 
that you'd be getting the drips when you
pull<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.219> brush<00:00:44.340> out<00:00:44.610> itself<00:00:48.379> so<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.530> want<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
pull the brush out itself so we want to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.090 
pull the brush out itself so we want to
help<00:00:49.890> stand<00:00:50.370> another<00:00:50.640> trim<00:00:51.620> which<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.829> really

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
help stand another trim which is really

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.610 
help stand another trim which is really
essential<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:55.219> way<00:00:56.219> our<00:00:56.969> trim<00:00:57.899> paint<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
essential that way our trim paint and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
essential that way our trim paint and
these<00:00:58.800> stuff<00:00:59.100> has<00:00:59.430> a<00:01:00.410> surface<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.739> grip<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.969> if

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
these stuff has a surface to grip to if

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.550 
these stuff has a surface to grip to if
you<00:01:03.300> will

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.789 

just<00:01:12.560> take<00:01:12.740> your<00:01:12.890> time<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:14.530> get<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.560> lot<00:01:15.770> of

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
just take your time you get a lot of

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.690 
just take your time you get a lot of
detail<00:01:16.429> in<00:01:16.460> these<00:01:16.789> old<00:01:17.000> places<00:01:18.399> which<00:01:19.399> can<00:01:19.579> be

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
detail in these old places which can be

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.249 
detail in these old places which can be
a<00:01:19.729> little<00:01:19.850> tricky<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.299> paint<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:26.750> if<00:01:26.899> you<00:01:27.020> have

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
a little tricky to paint and if you have

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:45.150 
a little tricky to paint and if you have
to<00:01:27.469> get<00:01:27.679> out<00:01:27.770> your<00:01:27.920> painters<00:01:28.280> tape

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.170 

and<00:01:46.780> once<00:01:47.780> again<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.860> is<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.400> first<00:01:49.940> of<00:01:50.120> two

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
and once again this is the first of two

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.970 
and once again this is the first of two
coats<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:53.600> if<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:54.350> don't<00:01:54.530> get<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:54.950> first

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
coats so if you don't get it the first

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:11.920 
coats so if you don't get it the first
time<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:56.000> get<00:01:56.120> it<00:01:56.270> second<00:02:10.360> let<00:02:11.360> your<00:02:11.480> brush<00:02:11.690> do

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
time you get it second let your brush do

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:52.180 
time you get it second let your brush do
the<00:02:12.050> work<00:02:12.200> for<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.620> just<00:02:13.870> guide<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:15.020> along

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.390 

if<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.360> get<00:02:53.480> drips<00:02:53.870> on<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.830> floor<00:02:55.130> which<00:02:55.370> is

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
if you get drips on the floor which is

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.200 
if you get drips on the floor which is
inevitable<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:58.160> nice<00:02:58.340> thing<00:02:58.520> about<00:02:58.550> latex<00:02:59.060> is

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
inevitable the nice thing about latex is

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.010 
inevitable the nice thing about latex is
it<00:02:59.360> cleans<00:02:59.630> up<00:02:59.810> with<00:03:00.280> water<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:02.210> you<00:03:02.870> don't

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
it cleans up with water so you don't

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.890 
it cleans up with water so you don't
have<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.260> use<00:03:03.380> any<00:03:03.670> nasty<00:03:04.670> solvent<00:03:05.150> now<00:03:05.750> when

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
have to use any nasty solvent now when

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.550 
have to use any nasty solvent now when
we're<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.470> trim<00:03:06.920> hits<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.400> floor<00:03:08.560> there's

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
we're the trim hits the floor there's

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.200 
we're the trim hits the floor there's
one<00:03:09.740> place<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.010> particular<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.820> might<00:03:10.970> want

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
one place in particular you might want

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.230 
one place in particular you might want
to<00:03:11.270> use<00:03:11.450> tape

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
to use tape

00:03:13.240 --> 00:04:20.390 
to use tape
it's<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.390> tricky<00:03:15.020> line

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.760 

okay<00:04:21.180> so<00:04:21.239> we've<00:04:21.600> got<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.810> first<00:04:22.109> coat<00:04:22.320> of<00:04:22.500> trim
