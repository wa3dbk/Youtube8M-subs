how<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:20.239> thought<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.330> just<00:04:21.450> press<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:21.750> I

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
how I thought you just press that I

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.860 
how I thought you just press that I
guess<00:04:22.500> not<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:23.010> don't<00:04:23.250> know<00:04:23.390> I'm<00:04:24.390> not<00:04:24.540> sure<00:04:24.600> how
