00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
both step it on the slide down to that

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.760 
both step it on the slide down to that
right<00:01:48.509> hand<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:48.990> did<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.439> reverse

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
right hand so we did that on the reverse

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.190 
right hand so we did that on the reverse
side<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.850> did<00:01:51.000> sugar<00:01:51.479> push<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.869> change<00:01:51.899> your

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
side we did sugar push to change your

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.330 
side we did sugar push to change your
hands<00:01:52.380> two<00:01:52.950> three<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.850> four<00:01:54.210> five<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:54.990> six

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
hands two three and four five and six

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.420 
hands two three and four five and six
then<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.369> had<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:57.119> two<00:01:57.780> three<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.770> four<00:01:59.369> so

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
then we had a one two three and four so

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.920 
then we had a one two three and four so
she's<00:01:59.820> on<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.030> right<00:02:00.149> foot<00:02:00.360> perform<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
she's on the right foot perform in a

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.709 
she's on the right foot perform in a
redirect<00:02:01.350> her<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.979> triple<00:02:02.670> step<00:02:02.939> around<00:02:03.390> that

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
redirect her to triple step around that

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.170 
redirect her to triple step around that
foot<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.950> she's<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.280> right<00:02:05.460> foot<00:02:05.729> for<00:02:05.969> four

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
foot so she's on the right foot for four

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.100 
foot so she's on the right foot for four
if<00:02:06.329> we<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.659> from<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> reverse<00:02:07.049> side

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
if we do this from the reverse side

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.090 
if we do this from the reverse side
we<00:02:09.110> have<00:02:09.229> sugar<00:02:09.350> push<00:02:09.649> 2<00:02:10.399> 3<00:02:11.090> &amp;<00:02:11.300> 4<00:02:11.330> 5<00:02:11.990> &amp;<00:02:12.350> 6

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
we have sugar push 2 3 &amp; 4 5 &amp; 6

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.480 
we have sugar push 2 3 &amp; 4 5 &amp; 6
Oh<00:02:13.190> 1<00:02:13.520> 2<00:02:13.660> 3<00:02:14.660> &amp;<00:02:15.020> 4<00:02:15.050> this<00:02:15.770> is<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.010> left<00:02:16.250> hand<00:02:16.340> is

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
going to slide this down to the right

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.660 
going to slide this down to the right
hand<00:02:20.569> then<00:02:20.959> we're<00:02:21.110> gonna<00:02:21.200> do<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.380> reverse<00:02:22.370> whip

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
hand then we're gonna do a reverse whip

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.880 
hand then we're gonna do a reverse whip
so<00:02:22.940> it's<00:02:23.090> still<00:02:23.300> 1<00:02:23.540> 2<00:02:23.720> 3<00:02:23.900> &amp;<00:02:24.050> 4<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.620> reverse

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
so it's still 1 2 3 &amp; 4 of a reverse

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.990 
so it's still 1 2 3 &amp; 4 of a reverse
whip<00:02:25.130> 1<00:02:25.970> 2<00:02:26.600> 3<00:02:27.200> &amp;<00:02:27.530> 4<00:02:27.560> same<00:02:28.489> redirect<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.390> 5<00:02:30.290> &amp;<00:02:30.770> 6<00:02:31.489> so

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
whip 1 2 3 &amp; 4 same redirect on 5 &amp; 6 so

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.490 
whip 1 2 3 &amp; 4 same redirect on 5 &amp; 6 so
we<00:02:32.120> do<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.390> from<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.720> reverse<00:02:32.900> side<00:02:32.959> or<00:02:33.350> is

that<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.280> reverse<00:02:34.459> side<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.970> is

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
that is that the reverse side this is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.979 
that is that the reverse side this is
the<00:02:35.180> reverse<00:02:35.480> side<00:02:35.660> 1<00:02:36.350> 2<00:02:36.620> 3<00:02:37.550> &amp;<00:02:37.850> 4<00:02:37.880> now<00:02:38.810> I'm<00:02:38.870> gonna
