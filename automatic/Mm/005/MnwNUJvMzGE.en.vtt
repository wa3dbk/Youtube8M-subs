00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.820
 hello welcome to the kitchen quarry caillebotte 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.630
 I propose today to proceed for the quilting 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.789
 leeks that we had yet nurserymen him 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:15.959
 and percent 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.259
 who are not my feet with all the instruments 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.970
 necessary it will be the case 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.460
 so a pair of scissors be careful of the bleach we will see why 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.859
 water naturally 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.859
 lucian freud and this is the country 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.160
 so from there 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.080
 of play for finally being able to the hands 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.059
 the game 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.860
 the counselor cÃ©line that it is still the race the fn 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.780
 here is the leek and I'm soaked 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.690
 in this mix of edwige pitel 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.040
 as for his eternal about 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.040
 the why because 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.360
 it is to prevent the pear at the counter-top worst enemy 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.230
 who is the ringworm 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.810
 that some call the point green 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.210
 then no 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.430
 frequented leeks 15 minutes in this mixture p 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.970
 that way he'll be protecting against the wind 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.810
 by 100% step so if the verb comes back 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.070
 well we have a method 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.740
 sweet to fight this 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.210
 this penalty leek players 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.840
 it's doing it 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.800
 macerate 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.820
 d fail 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.570
 and and tomato stalks 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.570
 to make a pure an automaton 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.860
 the leeks are then watered with the biggest 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.290
 eric samyn she is eliminated 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.290
 also leek green there is another method 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.610
 can prevent attacks from the leader of the leek 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.600
 it's to leave 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.840
 but young leeks 48 hours in the sun 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.390
 on earth as sarah meier not afraid 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.400
 they were a little bit of files 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.990
 48 'of a ball or deported or water them is a technique that the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.090
 protect me I use this one bleach 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.480
 megamind so be the diesel 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.189
 but these 48 hours on the fate of her husband 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:13.259
 so now we're going to let it soak and 15 minutes so I'm looking at my 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:14.560
 shows very well 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.040
 while leeks 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.239
 30 in the mixture of water and bleach 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.709
 so we will prepare the furrow 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.260
 a bare back I installed a cord here why 20% to the groove the most 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.260
 possible right a course since the state the two world gardeners and 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.999
 the vegetables aligned and so I do with the whip I made my way 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.539
 I'm not happy either 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.949
 so why redo a groove well to 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.459
 because we are going to plant 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.540
 young leeks in this furrow we will leave the furrow and for watering 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.730
 early leek 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.200
 it will be more convenient an employer to December really has in the roots 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.920
 leek 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.899
 call them and 15 minutes have passed 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:07.450
 leeks of which to satisfy this meaning percent one of the babies 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.099
 Double taxation 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.509
 it's trainer in a company 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:14.600
 widely 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.739
 against this famous pence to leek 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.159
 who she is a 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.909
 who is his worst enemy 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.040
 while I can start now then at picards 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.499
 so in the 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.119
 in the furrow 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:31.489
 I put 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.329
 red leek 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.209
 like this 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.009
 we still liked a distance of about 12 15 centimeters 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.299
 placing with leek six inches from the previous 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.579
 I think that in the end all 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.789
 so fast 

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:59.699
 if we have a good year 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.659
 so here and so so after the maternity planting ended on 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.849
 transplanting so the urgency is there is the dew 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.699
 so I water with a watering can 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.449
 because it's going to avoid 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:14.999
 maintenance 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:18.180
 that is to say, to form a crust on the ground 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.180
 which does not promote breathing 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.400
 of the earth 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.139
 so here we are watering 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.139
 copiously one must not be afraid of the dew 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:30.610
 here 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.879
 and therefore promote the furrow that is 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.870
 the one that stayed for you 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.569
 so 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.710
 that watering will always penetrate well 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.800
 p 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.930
 and they were gaining roots 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.590
 the leek does not have a very important root system that goes very far 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.430
 the leek 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.759
 roots 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.759
 around the leek what 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.849
 louvois must have really penetrated 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.249
 Grand parents 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.369
 as much as I can remember water with manure so the leek the court 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.080
 food 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.139
 in euros did not succeed so 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.300
 in our regulations the beer we are dealing with the ground before 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.569
 so it's over for leeks 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.569
 mercy 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.359
 for new advice from geneva
