00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
 full slid to yearsplays 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.369
 zdarova people and today I would like to 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.070
 play the third episode of the game under 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.100
 name scp-354 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.320
 I played and went through the previous two 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.489
 episodes so I have something to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.589
 compare and in this passage I 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.839
 talk about what has changed by 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.129
 compared to previous episodes she 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.470
 what worked Kirill 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.879
 Well, in general, I will express my impressions on 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.379
 third episode 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.420
 and I want to say what Cyril passed 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.699
 the new version of the graphics engine unity 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.429
 underwent some changes for example 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.360
 there were various highlights here and as you can see 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:09.360
 now can be and also play whose not 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.660
 have become much better and besides kirill 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.570
 replaced the grass it became such 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.390
 beautiful bright juicy and replaced 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.140
 some textures besides this kirill 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:27.090
 worked on optimizing now the game 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.180
 gives 40 to 60 fps without recording to 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.570
 my not very powerful computer yes even 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.899
 and now when I write I have a plan for FPS 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.040
 holding on 50 now shows me 60 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:44.939
 55 that you are very well apart from this 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.670
 Cyril worked on the game design and the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.280
 have on level design over here 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.790
 just great and for that he needs 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.310
 say thank you our enemies and in the third 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.110
 episode it's all the same flying sphere from 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.399
 second episode and of course the new one 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.600
 kind of enemies is the boss to kill which 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.239
 need to attach a little ingenuity so 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.459
 now we are delirious 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.090
 the main character we have from him 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.760
 get out and not stumble on 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.609
 any of the spheres that will kill us 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.000
 this yellow glow she is not always 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:29.430
 yellow here and there is a choice of color 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.739
 randomly that is one time you log in 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.620
 yellow another will send another color 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.109
 what I won't tell you 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.980
 I want to say as I tester this 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:42.400
 episode and tester in general see 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.849
 and therefore I know where to go will not 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:51.849
 such zapar that you damn where to go and so 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:54.450
 Now we get to such an office from 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.530
 which of course we must get out a 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.660
 to open this door 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.830
 it is necessary to take this one 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.360
 naturally logical if the door is closed 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:11.650
 then look for a key that I did not like in 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.780
 the third episode of scp-354 is not me 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.299
 I liked that the third episode 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.290
 turned out practically and not at all 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.989
 scary that is for the whole game I never 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.120
 scared no of course I once 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.370
 flinched when Cyrill added from this 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.620
 white shimmering soldiers pancake cho for 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:35.019
 garbage well, like so on the earliest versions 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.599
 there were many bugs for example to pass 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.549
 This ladder was necessary only 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:44.290
 jumped through these here 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:46.269
 green transformers unfortunately here 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.389
 there is such a bug that if so 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.940
 here's the camera turning this gun will 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:56.319
 pass through walls but i think that in 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.660
 future kirill will fix it well what else 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.419
 can you say about the third episode 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.299
 and for the duration it is almost 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:07.840
 same as all previous episodes that is 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.450
 about average transit time about 15 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.669
 minutes and as you can see the level design 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.639
 pretty decent added such here 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.560
 model with pisyunami each of 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:21.340
 there is a letter such Taras 5 a 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.080
 a man like Jesus though if 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.050
 there was a cross he probably would 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.020
 chained to him and so to pass 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.200
 then you must go down here 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.660
 so no entries in the diaries water 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.550
 here of course is also much more beautiful 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.910
 what was in the second in the second and first 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.820
 episode but this is mainly due to 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:46.610
 one version of the engine 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:49.370
 so now we appear on this one 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.410
 the helicopter from which we should just 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:57.960
 jump and move 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:00.900
 I think the cabus yes we moved to 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.330
 to the boss and now our goal will be first 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.150
 kill these cats from the second one 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.000
 episodes that can shoot us big 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.100
 number of lives but I will try him 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.600
 don't let that happen but unfortunately he doesn't 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.900
 corrected cats still have such 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.510
 ice crystals as they hang in the air 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.090
 stupid cat so they did not put very 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.490
 few lives and in order to kill here 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.700
 this boss needs to incite these 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:30.270
 here are the spheres on it if you will 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.790
 shoot a gun to the boss then you don't 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.100
 couldn’t pass it you won’t kill him just 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.500
 him a huge amount of hp and even three 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.410
 Here these areas will kill his order 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.130
 seconds 10 15 so you have to be 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.320
 careful that the spheres of the periods flowed on 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.200
 you because there were such moments 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.210
 that the spheres simply overheated 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:56.310
 they killed me 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:59.610
 and so now I think the boss will die anyway 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.950
 until all this all three spheres are busy for not 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:08.190
 you just need to run away from him in order 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:11.520
 lest he kill me oh I passed this 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:14.010
 currency g hallucinogenic location a 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.640
 which us incited and here the monsters 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.230
 which was at the beginning and we moved and 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.870
 the very beginning of the level that is i think you 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.130
 remember what is included here 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:28.010
 light go here and as you see here 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:32.120
 darkened om-d 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:35.850
 on this I almost went through the third episode 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.190
 I want to express my impressions of the episode 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.080
 turned out pretty good he took a step 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.830
 forward compared to previous 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.110
 episodes 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.540
 and kirill can say thank you for the fact that 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:49.140
 he pays almost everything free 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.500
 time to create this game but of course 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.910
 except for recording letspleyev naturally 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.780
 so I think the fourth episode 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.890
 get much better with more 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.100
 improved graphics 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:04.380
 but with more improved game design 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.090
 this i finish all thanks for 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.130
 view don't forget to subscribe 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:12.740
