00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
neatly I used to just I should do a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.180 
neatly I used to just I should do a
different<00:00:55.050> way<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.260> wasn't<00:00:55.440> very<00:00:55.620> good<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
different way that wasn't very good and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
different way that wasn't very good and
didn't<00:00:56.850> allow<00:00:56.910> me<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> be<00:00:57.420> very<00:00:57.570> precise<00:00:58.050> but

didn't allow me to be very precise but

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.950 
didn't allow me to be very precise but
this<00:00:58.649> does<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.370> it<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.270> makes<00:01:00.420> life<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.930> much

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
