00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.870 
I'm sure you use so many of your ammo
since<00:00:18.600> but<00:00:19.380> now<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:20.189> don't<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.699> worry

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880

about that to get unlimited heavy ammo

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.700 
about that to get unlimited heavy ammo
you<00:00:23.490> can<00:00:23.910> do<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.300> anywhere<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> highly

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
you can do this anywhere but I highly

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.589 
you can do this anywhere but I highly
recommend<00:00:25.980> using<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.060> crotas<00:00:27.420> end

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
recommend using it on the crotas end

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.620 
recommend using it on the crotas end
boss<00:00:28.199> fight<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.769> hard<00:00:29.099> mode<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:30.179> all<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.599> have

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
boss fight on hard mode so all you have

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.229 
boss fight on hard mode so all you have
to<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.320> deplete<00:00:31.920> all<00:00:32.099> your<00:00:32.520> primary<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
to do is deplete all your primary and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.720 
to do is deplete all your primary and
heavy<00:00:33.750> ammo<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.469> then<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.280> need<00:00:35.430> an<00:00:35.550> ice

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
heavy ammo and then you need an ice

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.510 
heavy ammo and then you need an ice
breaker<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.420> well<00:00:36.829> for<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.950> instance<00:00:38.340> I

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
breaker as well for this instance I

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.100 
breaker as well for this instance I
recommend<00:00:38.969> not<00:00:39.180> shooting<00:00:39.510> all<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.719> primary

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
recommend not shooting all your primary

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.080 
recommend not shooting all your primary
email<00:00:40.200> out<00:00:40.649> yet<00:00:40.950> though<00:00:41.160> what<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.790> should<00:00:41.969> do

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
email out yet though what you should do

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.490 
email out yet though what you should do
this<00:00:42.210> wait<00:00:42.480> till<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.780> start<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.469> it

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
this wait till you start it and get it

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.410 
this wait till you start it and get it
about<00:00:43.739> halfway<00:00:43.980> down<00:00:44.399> then<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.239> should<00:00:45.390> go

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
about halfway down then you should go

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.299 
about halfway down then you should go
start<00:00:46.050> up<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> mission<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.770> as<00:00:46.890> soon<00:00:47.070> as<00:00:47.190> you

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
start up the mission and as soon as you

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190 
start up the mission and as soon as you
started<00:00:47.670> start<00:00:48.270> shooting<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.629> rest<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.079> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
started start shooting the rest of it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.080 
started start shooting the rest of it
out<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.620> reason<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.070> because<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.910> wait

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
out the reason is because if you wait

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.150 
out the reason is because if you wait
too<00:00:51.300> long<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:51.870> primary<00:00:52.230> mo<00:00:52.469> replenish

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
too long your primary mo replenish

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.549 
too long your primary mo replenish
itself<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.030> glitch<00:00:54.270> will<00:00:54.300> not<00:00:54.629> work<00:00:54.840> but

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
itself and the glitch will not work but

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.860 
itself and the glitch will not work but
after<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.129> shoot<00:00:56.340> all<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.570> every

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
after you shoot all this and for every

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.670 
after you shoot all this and for every
