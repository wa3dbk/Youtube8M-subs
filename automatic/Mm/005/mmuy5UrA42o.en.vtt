00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:10.520
 hello friends we continue 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.699
 answer the questions of our viewers and 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:17.240
 Now another question reads Svetlana 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:20.150
 good afternoon question mikhail my name is 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.730
 Oleg I live and study in Tallinn 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.310
 download the school year to this day I don't 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.310
 attended university I prefer myself 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.070
 mountain correspondence form of learning success 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.170
 accounting such tactics did not bring me 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.079
 remains one and a half months before the session 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.020
 I give myself a word that in a month from 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.610
 today I will be perfectly ready to surrender 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.310
 mathematical analysis exam 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.770
 individual matched then most likely 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.770
 people have heard the above 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.290
 chuckling I will say this is not real or 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.719
 I wonder what he will do and not 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.860
 looking at all the absurdities and giving my word and 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.210
 perform 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.550
 from stones 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.040
 and a month and a half later, starting the countdown 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.590
 from today I will report a 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.050
 what a huge result 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.729
 thanks for reading the message 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.810
 according to the script, I think if you tell about 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.670
 the above people are required 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.790
 there are those who believe me and 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.890
 just start rooting for me as a general 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.340
 positive power of thought helps to go not 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.380
 Well the first thing that comes to my 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.060
 head 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.310
 we understand that the young check is just 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.479
 wants such support and the author even 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.250
 energy can be support and i 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.680
 not for friends offensive linnett go there 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.890
 a policeman winks over there 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.960
 he fell in behind a citizen and 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.229
 trying to right him so take away 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.569
 and talk with him but like this 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:54.520
 parallel to our topic, I remember 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:58.390
 the famous story somehow does not come out 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.569
 skyway yes like alexander of macedonian 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.899
 walking there past the place where 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.959
 I lived I do not remember literally let's say 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.970
 the pledge of it is Archimedes, so she tells me 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.470
 Aristotle will help there but who was here with 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.980
 so near and he came to talk like that and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.890
 says you know i'm ready for three days with you 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.180
 here to camp you me 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.810
 mathematics taught 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.180
 and he says I 'm sorry your 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.740
 majesty but royal mathematics 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.590
 there are no ways 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.450
 that is, so that in 2 days but of course we 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.060
 don't talk about math in serious 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.650
 such execution gunner need to pass 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.460
 there is some semester course on 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.640
 mathematical analysis 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:48.170
 and for a month I assure you no student 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.570
 student there a day in a technical college on 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.260
 junior courses where study mathanalysis 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.940
 not spent my life not a month so 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.860
 more than one and a half to get ready 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.500
 clamps best will not be three days 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.420
 for which he was preparing for this exam 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.910
 Of course you can want during the semester 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.850
 I did there, but I don't know about that 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.700
 I remember how students were engaged I so 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.650
 feeling they are doing worse now 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.650
 here for for a month and a half you can 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.220
 just miracles do here and how people 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.550
 with higher education in mathematics 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.790
 remembering the analysis I want to say that 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.210
 if you understand 2 relatively uncomplicated 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.700
 things one is called the limit and the other 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.880
 called the derivative here if you this 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.800
 understand something under analysis at your feet in 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.420
 volume of university programs and you will not 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.390
 only an excellent student you will be all around 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.980
 explain these two forms as there 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.980
 around not everything is spinning therefore 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.709
 I personally do not doubt success 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:58.000
 young man and I hope that 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:00.909
 the others also sympathize with him but in 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.440
 Generally and in general there are people who can 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.980
 good at home alone 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.690
 in absentia there somehow you like that young man 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.860
 tried to do but here he somehow did not 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.750
 went so she means either to study 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.120
 do it either tell yourself but it is not 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.100
 my campaign is absolutely unimportant not super 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.410
 I can not like a teacher in absentia 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.139
 the enthusiasm of this i love to classes 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.780
 walk listen there i need external 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.479
 the organization is like there are people 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.130
 amazing learn online so here I am 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.650
 online class in this now 60 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.539
 man i let out have incredible 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.220
 people are they doing it online with me 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:40.350
 so having started so not to occupy therefore 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.240
 just mean in the future you for yourself what 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.140
 then understand from this and there are already people 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.140
 more optimal 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.830
 I wish you pass the exam in mathematics 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.030
 successfully and generally on behalf of those who 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.290
 watching our channel 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.490
 I express the growth of assistance and support 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.910
 energy level thanks for 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.910
 Attention
