00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
thing about Australian internet is that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.310 
thing about Australian internet is that
we<00:01:59.820> actually<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.390> literally<00:02:00.750> don't<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.170> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
we actually like literally don't have a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.789 
we actually like literally don't have a
fast<00:02:01.619> enough<00:02:01.829> upload<00:02:02.100> speed<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:03.030> country

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
fast enough upload speed in the country

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.230 
fast enough upload speed in the country
to<00:02:04.799> support<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.250> 720p<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:05.909> pretty<00:02:06.119> sure

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
to support like 720p and pretty sure

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.839 
to support like 720p and pretty sure
like<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.810> something<00:02:07.079> like<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.350> um<00:02:07.729> like<00:02:08.729> I

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
like it's something like that um like I

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.900 
like it's something like that um like I
don't<00:02:09.000> know<00:02:09.319> no<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.739> we<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.190> like<00:02:11.340> watch<00:02:11.550> we

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
don't know no we do we can like watch we

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.460 
don't know no we do we can like watch we
can<00:02:12.030> do<00:02:12.120> fall<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:12.450> 480<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.959> think

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
can do fall for 480 I think

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.130 
can do fall for 480 I think
it<00:02:13.890> goes<00:02:14.070> up<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.280> 40<00:02:14.550> p<00:02:14.780> other<00:02:15.780> than<00:02:15.900> that

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it goes up to 40 p other than that

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.030 
it goes up to 40 p other than that
though<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.620> really<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.130> can't<00:02:17.430> do<00:02:17.820> 720<00:02:18.390> I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
though we really like can't do 720 I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.520 
though we really like can't do 720 I
think<00:02:20.040> we<00:02:20.100> might<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:20.580> be<00:02:21.000> able<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:21.570> um<00:02:21.840> as

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
think we might just be able to but um as

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.630 
think we might just be able to but um as
far<00:02:22.650> as<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.860> know<00:02:22.980> Robert<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.340> like<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.550> only
