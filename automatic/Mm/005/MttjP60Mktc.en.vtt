00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
original artists renderings one of the

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.019 
original artists renderings one of the
things<00:00:23.080> I<00:00:23.199> like<00:00:23.380> about<00:00:23.410> this<00:00:23.830> one<00:00:24.099> is<00:00:24.429> that<00:00:24.670> it

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
things I like about this one is that it

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.450 
things I like about this one is that it
illustrates<00:00:25.210> for<00:00:25.839> example<00:00:26.349> in<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:26.710> new<00:00:26.949> crown

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
illustrates for example in the new crown

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.120 
illustrates for example in the new crown
just<00:00:28.210> how<00:00:28.449> many<00:00:28.660> individual<00:00:29.410> components<00:00:30.039> are

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
just how many individual components are

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.490 
just how many individual components are
going<00:00:30.249> in<00:00:30.730> with<00:00:30.999> a<00:00:31.390> folding<00:00:31.869> crown<00:00:32.140> which<00:00:32.349> I'll

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
going in with a folding crown which I'll

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.740 
going in with a folding crown which I'll
show<00:00:32.680> you<00:00:32.710> in<00:00:32.860> a<00:00:33.039> second<00:00:33.460> so<00:00:34.329> things<00:00:34.600> you'll

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
show you in a second so things you'll

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.170 
show you in a second so things you'll
see<00:00:34.960> here<00:00:35.350> like<00:00:35.920> a<00:00:35.950> whole<00:00:36.280> new<00:00:36.489> system<00:00:36.760> for

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
see here like a whole new system for

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.660 
see here like a whole new system for
incorporating<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.530> screw<00:00:38.739> down<00:00:38.890> pushers<00:00:39.640> and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
incorporating the screw down pushers and

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.770 
incorporating the screw down pushers and
and<00:00:40.570> so<00:00:40.840> on<00:00:41.020> this<00:00:41.500> contains<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.129> AO<00:00:42.610> seven<00:00:43.600> and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
and so on this contains the AO seven and

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.439 
and so on this contains the AO seven and
a<00:00:43.809> lot<00:00:43.960> of<00:00:44.110> you<00:00:44.230> will<00:00:44.350> recognize<00:00:44.829> that<00:00:44.859> as<00:00:45.579> a

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
a lot of you will recognize that as a

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.930 
a lot of you will recognize that as a
think<00:00:47.350> of<00:00:47.440> it<00:00:47.530> as<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.649> value<00:00:48.370> seventy<00:00:48.670> seven

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
think of it as a value seventy seven

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.060 
think of it as a value seventy seven
fifty<00:00:49.059> but<00:00:49.359> built<00:00:49.600> on<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:49.809> much<00:00:49.960> larger<00:00:50.500> grander

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
fifty but built on a much larger grander

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.160 
fifty but built on a much larger grander
scale<00:00:51.399> and<00:00:51.850> then<00:00:52.059> there's<00:00:52.239> what<00:00:52.390> is<00:00:52.539> allowing

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
scale and then there's what is allowing

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.470 
scale and then there's what is allowing
a<00:00:53.440> case<00:00:53.920> of<00:00:54.160> this<00:00:54.309> particular<00:00:54.609> size<00:00:55.120> out

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
a case of this particular size out

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.930 
a case of this particular size out
they've<00:00:55.660> really<00:00:56.170> gone<00:00:56.680> quite<00:00:57.129> literally<00:00:57.730> back

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
they've really gone quite literally back

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.549 
they've really gone quite literally back
to<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.239> drawing<00:00:58.480> board<00:00:58.809> on<00:00:58.929> quite<00:00:59.199> a<00:00:59.230> bit<00:00:59.440> of

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
to the drawing board on quite a bit of

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.979 
to the drawing board on quite a bit of
this<00:00:59.679> very<00:01:00.370> complex<00:01:00.910> bracelet<00:01:01.510> notice<00:01:01.870> for

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
this very complex bracelet notice for

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.170 
this very complex bracelet notice for
example<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.440> multiple<00:01:02.890> finishes<00:01:03.399> narleen

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
example the multiple finishes narleen

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.060 
example the multiple finishes narleen
and<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:04.479> on<00:01:04.540> here<00:01:05.049> at<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.229> top<00:01:05.500> they've

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
and so on here at the top they've

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.890 
and so on here at the top they've
actually<00:01:06.280> got<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.670> separate<00:01:07.090> steel<00:01:07.330> section

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
actually got the separate steel section

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.590 
actually got the separate steel section
that<00:01:08.380> creates<00:01:08.979> this<00:01:09.189> beautiful

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that creates this beautiful

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.200 
that creates this beautiful
three-dimensional<00:01:10.600> effect<00:01:11.909> based<00:01:12.909> as<00:01:13.119> I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
three-dimensional effect based as I

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.929 
three-dimensional effect based as I
understand<00:01:13.689> it<00:01:13.840> kind<00:01:14.049> of<00:01:14.080> on<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.229> scale<00:01:15.220> sort<00:01:15.850> of

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
understand it kind of on a scale sort of

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.770 
understand it kind of on a scale sort of
a<00:01:16.030> concept<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.680> bezel<00:01:18.549> is<00:01:18.759> completely<00:01:19.360> redone

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
a concept the bezel is completely redone

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.620 
a concept the bezel is completely redone
of<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:21.040> five<00:01:21.579> and<00:01:22.119> there<00:01:22.210> will<00:01:22.299> be<00:01:22.329> five

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
of the five and there will be five

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.450 
of the five and there will be five
stations<00:01:23.170> obviously<00:01:23.680> representing<00:01:24.369> of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
stations obviously representing of

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.950 
stations obviously representing of
course<00:01:24.729> well

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
course well

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.310 
course well
five<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.210> five<00:01:28.390> are<00:01:28.659> going<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:28.930> be<00:01:29.020> left

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
five for the five are going to be left

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.640 
five for the five are going to be left
open<00:01:29.830> and<00:01:30.250> if<00:01:30.340> you'll<00:01:30.490> look<00:01:30.729> try<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.780> get<00:01:31.930> some

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
open and if you'll look try to get some

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.109 
open and if you'll look try to get some
of<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.799> angles<00:01:33.159> here<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.400> where<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.700> can<00:01:33.880> see

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
of the angles here to where you can see

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.080 
of the angles here to where you can see
that<00:01:34.930> indeed<00:01:35.380> for<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.159> five<00:01:36.369> will<00:01:36.640> be<00:01:36.790> open

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
that indeed for the five will be open

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.790 
that indeed for the five will be open
I'm<00:01:37.180> told<00:01:37.390> depending<00:01:37.869> on<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.080> model<00:01:38.290> some<00:01:38.680> of

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
I'm told depending on the model some of

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.200 
I'm told depending on the model some of
them<00:01:38.890> will<00:01:39.009> have<00:01:39.130> different<00:01:39.490> finishes<00:01:39.880> on<00:01:40.180> the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
them will have different finishes on the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.620 
them will have different finishes on the
inside<00:01:40.720> or<00:01:41.110> collars<00:01:41.890> or<00:01:42.100> something<00:01:42.340> like<00:01:42.460> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
inside or collars or something like that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.630 
inside or collars or something like that
and<00:01:43.630> then<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.840> fifth<00:01:44.050> one<00:01:44.140> will<00:01:44.380> have<00:01:44.640> some

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
and then the fifth one will have some

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.660 
and then the fifth one will have some
luminous<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:46.630> then<00:01:46.810> it's<00:01:46.990> also<00:01:47.670> featuring

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
luminous and then it's also featuring

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.580 
luminous and then it's also featuring
the<00:01:49.149> functional<00:01:49.840> screw<00:01:50.110> that<00:01:50.259> you'll<00:01:50.409> see

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
the functional screw that you'll see

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.490 
the functional screw that you'll see
here<00:01:50.619> part<00:01:51.250> of<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.580> real<00:01:52.240> intriguing<00:01:52.690> aspect

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
here part of the real intriguing aspect

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.350 
here part of the real intriguing aspect
in<00:01:53.680> my<00:01:53.860> estimation<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.850> how<00:01:55.119> they're

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
in my estimation is how they're

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.880 
in my estimation is how they're
approaching<00:01:55.869> for<00:01:56.050> example<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.560> screw<00:01:56.770> down

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
approaching for example the screw down

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.520 
approaching for example the screw down
crown<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.670> also<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.240> pushers<00:01:58.780> now<00:01:59.350> when

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
crown and also the pushers now when

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.760 
crown and also the pushers now when
you're<00:01:59.649> looking<00:01:59.679> at<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:02.170> business

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
you're looking at this the business

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.910 
you're looking at this the business
crown<00:02:03.039> itself<00:02:03.520> can<00:02:04.179> actually<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:05.500> do<00:02:05.740> this

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
crown itself can actually I can do this

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.999 
crown itself can actually I can do this
with<00:02:06.130> one<00:02:06.310> in<00:02:06.960> well<00:02:07.960> hold<00:02:08.229> on<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.590> look<00:02:08.769> like

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
with one in well hold on it look like

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.060 
with one in well hold on it look like
you'll<00:02:09.220> see<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.550> here<00:02:09.880> now<00:02:10.539> that's<00:02:10.929> in<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.200> non

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
you'll see it here now that's in the non

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.729 
you'll see it here now that's in the non
operating<00:02:12.700> position<00:02:13.060> cells<00:02:13.630> we<00:02:14.230> say<00:02:14.440> gives

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
operating position cells we say gives

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.290 
operating position cells we say gives
you<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:14.980> panel<00:02:15.310> look<00:02:15.519> from<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.760> top<00:02:15.940> and

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
you this panel look from the top and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.420 
you this panel look from the top and
then<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.870> can<00:02:17.050> hold<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:17.739> when<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.220> actually

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
then you can hold it when you actually

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.370 
then you can hold it when you actually
want<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.910> use<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.480> then<00:02:19.570> from<00:02:19.690> here<00:02:19.750> you

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
want to use it and then from here you

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.810 
want to use it and then from here you
would<00:02:20.500> screw<00:02:20.769> that<00:02:20.980> out<00:02:21.160> counterclockwise

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
would screw that out counterclockwise

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.150 
would screw that out counterclockwise
make<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.510> adjustments<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.200> want<00:02:23.500> then

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
make the adjustments that you want then

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.490 
make the adjustments that you want then
the<00:02:24.400> screw<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.760> back<00:02:24.910> in<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.600> then<00:02:25.959> replace

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
the screw it back in and then replace

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.009 
the screw it back in and then replace
that<00:02:26.680> such<00:02:27.010> now<00:02:27.459> check<00:02:27.730> out<00:02:27.880> how<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.540> screw

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
that such now check out how the screw

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.130 
that such now check out how the screw
down<00:02:29.140> pushers<00:02:29.620> work<00:02:29.980> right<00:02:30.310> now<00:02:30.519> they're

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
down pushers work right now they're

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.390 
down pushers work right now they're
retracted<00:02:32.140> but<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.590> know<00:02:32.709> basically<00:02:32.860> what

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
retracted but you know basically what

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.970 
retracted but you know basically what
looks<00:02:33.579> like<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.790> gear<00:02:34.269> system<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:35.950> that

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
looks like a gear system in this so that

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.490 
looks like a gear system in this so that
when<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.579> are<00:02:36.610> for<00:02:37.360> example<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:38.170> willing<00:02:38.470> to

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
when you are for example you willing to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.530 
when you are for example you willing to
operate<00:02:38.709> this<00:02:39.130> as<00:02:39.250> being<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.519> reset<00:02:40.030> and

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
operate this as being the reset and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.380 
operate this as being the reset and
appear<00:02:41.049> of<00:02:41.140> course<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.850> activate<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.970> chrono

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
appear of course to activate the chrono

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.569 
appear of course to activate the chrono
I'm<00:02:43.959> going<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.260> be<00:02:44.350> able<00:02:44.440> obviously<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.160> for

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
I'm going to be able obviously to for

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:46.850 
I'm going to be able obviously to for
example<00:02:45.910> start<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.239> Crone

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
example start the Crone

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.000 
example start the Crone
stop<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.400> phonograph<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.450> do<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.110> reset<00:02:49.710> and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
stop the phonograph and do a reset and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.570 
stop the phonograph and do a reset and
then<00:02:50.340> when<00:02:50.460> I'm<00:02:50.580> done<00:02:50.610> with<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.600> can

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
then when I'm done with that I can

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.510 
then when I'm done with that I can
rotate<00:02:53.580> these<00:02:53.970> back<00:02:54.360> clockwise<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.100> hope

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
rotate these back clockwise and I hope

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.850 
rotate these back clockwise and I hope
you<00:02:56.700> guys<00:02:56.910> didn't<00:02:57.690> see<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:58.020> because<00:02:58.740> the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
you guys didn't see this because the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.480 
you guys didn't see this because the
actual<00:02:59.100> pusher<00:02:59.580> physically<00:03:01.250> retracts<00:03:02.250> right

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
actual pusher physically retracts right

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.400 
actual pusher physically retracts right
along<00:03:02.760> with<00:03:03.030> them<00:03:03.270> there<00:03:03.720> you'll<00:03:03.900> notice<00:03:04.200> here

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
along with them there you'll notice here

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.950 
along with them there you'll notice here
I'll<00:03:04.740> leave<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.100> one<00:03:05.690> extended<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.870> can
