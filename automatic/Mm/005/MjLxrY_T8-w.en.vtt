these attachments so without further ado
let's<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.420> right<00:01:09.630> into<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.110> now<00:01:11.100> first<00:01:11.369> off

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
let's get right into it now first off

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.190 
let's get right into it now first off
like<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.970> said<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> attachments<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.049> was

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
like I said the attachments that I was

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.020 
like I said the attachments that I was
rocking<00:01:13.530> with<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.860> game<00:01:13.920> play<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
rocking with in this game play with a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.359 
rocking with in this game play with a
ballistic<00:01:15.299> CPU<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.290> also<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> dual<00:01:17.100> band

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
ballistic CPU and also the dual band

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.850 
ballistic CPU and also the dual band
scope<00:01:17.810> idealistic<00:01:18.810> CPU<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.380> those<00:01:19.619> really

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
scope idealistic CPU of those really

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
scope idealistic CPU of those really
don't<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.490> yet<00:01:20.700> basically<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.390> make

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
don't know just yet basically just make

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.050 
don't know just yet basically just make
sure<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.740> sniper<00:01:23.040> doesn't<00:01:23.369> sway<00:01:23.880> as

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
sure that your sniper doesn't sway as

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.030 
sure that your sniper doesn't sway as
much<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.600> would<00:01:24.720> normally<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.560> when

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
much as it would normally do for when

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.340 
much as it would normally do for when
you're<00:01:26.159> actually<00:01:26.310> aiming<00:01:26.909> down<00:01:27.060> your<00:01:27.119> sights

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
you're actually aiming down your sights

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.690 
you're actually aiming down your sights
now<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.189> help<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.579> out

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
now this is not going to be help you out

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.160 
now this is not going to be help you out
a<00:01:29.729> ton<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.329> when<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.540> comes<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:30.930> winning

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
a ton for when it comes to like winning

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.830 
a ton for when it comes to like winning
close-range<00:01:31.740> gunfights<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.210> effect<00:01:33.630> is

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
close-range gunfights but this effect is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.390 
close-range gunfights but this effect is
definitely<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.500> matter<00:01:34.799> quite<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> bit

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
definitely going to matter quite a bit

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.760 
definitely going to matter quite a bit
for<00:01:36.090> when<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> actually<00:01:36.420> find<00:01:36.990> yourself<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.619> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
for when you actually find yourself in a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.859 
for when you actually find yourself in a
medium<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.340> long<00:01:38.549> range<00:01:38.729> engagements<00:01:38.909> just

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
medium to long range engagements just

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
medium to long range engagements just
because<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.259> those<00:01:40.409> ranges<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.159> amount<00:01:41.400> of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
because of those ranges the amount of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.940 
because of those ranges the amount of
sway<00:01:41.790> really<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> matter<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
sway really is going to matter and the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770 
sway really is going to matter and the
ballistic<00:01:44.159> CPU<00:01:44.549> will<00:01:45.090> make<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> lot<00:01:45.600> easier

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
ballistic CPU will make it a lot easier

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
ballistic CPU will make it a lot easier
basically<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> stay<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.920> targets<00:01:47.460> anyway<00:01:48.329> then

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
basically to stay on targets anyway then

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.210 
basically to stay on targets anyway then
after<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:48.990> also<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> dual<00:01:49.979> band

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
after that we also have the dual band

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.370 
after that we also have the dual band
scope<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.670> really<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> only<00:01:51.869> reason<00:01:52.170> why<00:01:52.290> I'm

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
scope and really the only reason why I'm

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.870 
scope and really the only reason why I'm
using<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.710> dual<00:01:52.920> band<00:01:53.100> scope<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.549> because<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
using the dual band scope is because I

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.940 
using the dual band scope is because I
personally<00:01:54.479> don't<00:01:55.170> really<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.740> regular

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
personally don't really like the regular

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.490 
personally don't really like the regular
sniper<00:01:56.490> scope<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> xpr-50<00:01:57.750> perky<00:01:58.320> don't

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
sniper scope on the xpr-50 perky don't

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.050 
sniper scope on the xpr-50 perky don't
really<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> way<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.040> looks<00:01:59.399> it<00:02:00.030> is

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
really like the way it looks it is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.120 
really like the way it looks it is
doesn't<00:02:00.360> feel<00:02:00.719> right<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> me<00:02:01.320> plus<00:02:01.649> I'm<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:02.100> a

whatever<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.950> actually<00:02:08.039> use<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.489> variable

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
whatever I actually use the variable

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.820 
whatever I actually use the variable
scope<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.420> basically<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.869> zoom<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.259> once<00:02:10.500> press

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
scope I basically to zoom in once press

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.100 
scope I basically to zoom in once press
B<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.370> then<00:02:11.849> from<00:02:12.090> there<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.300> can<00:02:12.540> play<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
B and then from there I can play the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.720 
B and then from there I can play the
game<00:02:13.290> so

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
game so

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.640 
game so
you<00:02:14.330> know<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.599> literally<00:02:14.989> is<00:02:15.050> no<00:02:15.140> point<00:02:15.500> in

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
you know that literally is no point in

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.920 
you know that literally is no point in

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
delivering variable scope you can afford

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.449 
delivering variable scope you can afford
switch<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.470> up<00:02:18.620> for<00:02:18.830> anything<00:02:19.010> else<00:02:19.280> that

switch that up for anything else that
you<00:02:19.549> prefer<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.659> after<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.049> for<00:02:21.260> my

secondary pistol I have the b23r

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.690 
secondary pistol I have the b23r
now<00:02:24.290> once<00:02:24.470> again<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.830> can<00:02:25.010> switch<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:25.489> one

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
now once again you can switch this one

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.610 
now once again you can switch this one
up<00:02:25.849> for<00:02:26.030> anything<00:02:26.209> else<00:02:26.420> if<00:02:26.599> you<00:02:26.659> prefer<00:02:26.989> but<00:02:27.260> I

up for anything else if you prefer but I

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.990 
up for anything else if you prefer but I
would<00:02:27.739> personally<00:02:27.980> recommend<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.849> go

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
would personally recommend you to go

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
fight the BT fer the five-seven or T

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.940 
fight the BT fer the five-seven or T
Tech<00:02:31.970> 45<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:33.230> reason<00:02:33.530> for<00:02:33.590> this<00:02:33.709> is<00:02:33.769> because

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
Tech 45 the reason for this is because

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.339 
Tech 45 the reason for this is because
these<00:02:34.340> pistols<00:02:34.849> are<00:02:34.970> also<00:02:35.360> pretty<00:02:35.660> decent<00:02:36.170> at

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
these pistols are also pretty decent at

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.589 
these pistols are also pretty decent at
medium<00:02:36.769> range<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.310> let's<00:02:38.000> face<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.239> the

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
medium range and let's face it the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.170 
medium range and let's face it the
kap-40<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.530> also<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.890> executioner<00:02:40.549> those

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
kap-40 and also the executioner those

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.850 
kap-40 and also the executioner those
two<00:02:41.390> pistols<00:02:41.840> really<00:02:42.200> aren't<00:02:42.410> good<00:02:42.709> at

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
two pistols really aren't good at

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.559 
two pistols really aren't good at
anything<00:02:43.280> apart<00:02:43.640> from<00:02:43.700> winning<00:02:44.060> like<00:02:44.209> really

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
anything apart from winning like really

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.199 
anything apart from winning like really
close<00:02:44.870> range<00:02:45.200> gunfights<00:02:45.790> anyway<00:02:46.790> then<00:02:46.970> after

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
close range gunfights anyway then after

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.300 
close range gunfights anyway then after
that<00:02:47.360> we<00:02:47.540> have<00:02:47.780> light<00:02:48.110> weights<00:02:48.349> now<00:02:49.069> light

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
that we have light weights now light

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.619 
that we have light weights now light
weight<00:02:49.519> as<00:02:49.640> most<00:02:49.879> of<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.090> should<00:02:50.299> know<00:02:50.329> by<00:02:50.599> now

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
weight as most of you should know by now

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.330 
weight as most of you should know by now
basically<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.260> allows<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.950> move<00:02:52.160> around

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
basically this allows you to move around

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.630 
basically this allows you to move around
7%<00:02:52.849> faster<00:02:53.239> now<00:02:54.230> in<00:02:54.349> all<00:02:54.470> honesty<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.220> isn't

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
7% faster now in all honesty this isn't

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.580 
7% faster now in all honesty this isn't
the<00:02:55.730> biggest<00:02:56.060> change<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.840> am<00:02:56.989> fully<00:02:57.319> aware<00:02:57.470> of

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
the biggest change I am fully aware of

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.680 
the biggest change I am fully aware of
that<00:02:57.680> fact<00:02:58.040> but<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.000> thing<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.329> that<00:02:59.540> whenever

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
that fact but the thing is that whenever

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.289 
that fact but the thing is that whenever
we<00:02:59.810> actually<00:02:59.959> use<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.440> sniper<00:03:00.950> rifle<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:02.090> move

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
we actually use a sniper rifle you move

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.150 
we actually use a sniper rifle you move
incredibly<00:03:02.870> slow<00:03:03.379> in<00:03:03.560> fact<00:03:03.799> you<00:03:03.980> move<00:03:04.129> just

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
incredibly slow in fact you move just

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.520 
incredibly slow in fact you move just
too<00:03:04.489> slow<00:03:04.730> these<00:03:04.970> sniper<00:03:05.209> rifles<00:03:05.720> as<00:03:06.349> you

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
too slow these sniper rifles as you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.990 
too slow these sniper rifles as you
would<00:03:06.650> normally<00:03:07.069> do<00:03:07.280> with<00:03:07.489> something<00:03:07.819> like

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
would normally do with something like

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.660 
would normally do with something like
the<00:03:08.150> MK<00:03:08.420> 48<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:08.989> pretty<00:03:09.170> much<00:03:09.260> any<00:03:09.470> LMG<00:03:09.980> or

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
the MK 48 so pretty much any LMG or

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.699 
the MK 48 so pretty much any LMG or
pretty<00:03:10.940> much<00:03:11.000> any<00:03:11.299> launcher<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.049> I<00:03:12.230> hate<00:03:12.530> it

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
pretty much any launcher and I hate it

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.589 
pretty much any launcher and I hate it
when<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:13.010> can't<00:03:13.340> just<00:03:13.549> move<00:03:13.730> from<00:03:14.000> one<00:03:14.180> point<00:03:14.450> to

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
when I can't just move from one point to

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.839 
when I can't just move from one point to
another<00:03:14.690> points<00:03:15.290> with<00:03:15.950> some<00:03:16.160> speed<00:03:16.489> pretty

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
another points with some speed pretty

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.580 
another points with some speed pretty
much<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.209> first<00:03:17.569> off<00:03:17.750> tend<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.139> switch<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:18.500> my

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
much so I first off tend to switch to my

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.550 
much so I first off tend to switch to my
b23r<00:03:19.250> quite<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:19.549> bit<00:03:19.760> but<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.599> also<00:03:20.840> just<00:03:21.019> prefer

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
b23r quite a bit but I also just prefer

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.860 
b23r quite a bit but I also just prefer
to<00:03:21.590> rock<00:03:22.099> light<00:03:22.459> weights<00:03:22.790> over<00:03:23.569> something

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
to rock light weights over something

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.750 
to rock light weights over something
like<00:03:23.900> hardline<00:03:24.530> or<00:03:24.769> ghost<00:03:25.010> or<00:03:25.280> pretty<00:03:25.519> much<00:03:25.639> is

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
like hardline or ghost or pretty much is

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.559 
like hardline or ghost or pretty much is
anything<00:03:26.060> else

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
anything else

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.809 
anything else
am<00:03:27.079> I<00:03:27.260> after<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:27.590> for<00:03:27.889> my<00:03:27.980> two<00:03:28.040> second<00:03:28.639> perks

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
am I after that for my two second perks

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.509 
am I after that for my two second perks
we<00:03:29.060> have<00:03:29.269> toughness<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.989> fast<00:03:30.410> hands<00:03:30.829> now

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
we have toughness and fast hands now

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.069 
we have toughness and fast hands now
toughness<00:03:32.000> is<00:03:32.180> basically<00:03:32.540> just<00:03:32.660> going<00:03:32.900> to

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
toughness is basically just going to

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.629 
toughness is basically just going to
allow<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.319> to<00:03:33.410> win<00:03:33.620> multiple<00:03:33.829> gunfights<00:03:34.400> in<00:03:34.549> a

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
allow you to win multiple gunfights in a

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:35.020 
allow you to win multiple gunfights in a
row

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
row

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.879 
row
just<00:03:35.569> because<00:03:35.840> toughness<00:03:36.380> will<00:03:36.530> make<00:03:36.680> sure

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
just because toughness will make sure

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.729 
just because toughness will make sure
you<00:03:37.069> do<00:03:37.310> not<00:03:37.489> flinch<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:38.060> targets<00:03:38.780> now<00:03:39.530> with<00:03:39.709> a

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
you do not flinch of targets now with a

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.400 
you do not flinch of targets now with a
sniper<00:03:40.190> rifle<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:40.970> know<00:03:41.389> being<00:03:41.720> able<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:42.049> stay

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
sniper rifle you know being able to stay

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.800 
sniper rifle you know being able to stay
on<00:03:42.530> target<00:03:42.799> is<00:03:43.099> definitely<00:03:43.609> key<00:03:43.910> in<00:03:44.510> terms<00:03:44.720> of

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
on target is definitely key in terms of

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.210 
on target is definitely key in terms of
like<00:03:44.930> winning<00:03:45.139> multiple<00:03:45.410> gunfights<00:03:46.040> so

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
like winning multiple gunfights so

like winning multiple gunfights so
toughness<00:03:46.700> is<00:03:46.880> in<00:03:47.000> this<00:03:47.150> case<00:03:47.389> pretty<00:03:48.230> much<00:03:48.349> is

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
toughness is in this case pretty much is

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.949 
toughness is in this case pretty much is
the<00:03:48.530> must-have<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:49.400> ask<00:03:49.549> me<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.180> then<00:03:50.599> after

the must-have you ask me and then after

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.509 
the must-have you ask me and then after
that<00:03:51.049> we<00:03:51.230> also<00:03:51.380> have<00:03:51.650> fast<00:03:51.950> hands<00:03:52.280> when

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
that we also have fast hands when

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.819 
that we also have fast hands when

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
secondary a little bit faster now when

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.449 
secondary a little bit faster now when
it<00:03:57.139> comes<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.379> those<00:03:57.470> random<00:03:57.799> it<00:03:58.010> has<00:03:58.099> close

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
flashbang in this case I am actually

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.140 
flashbang in this case I am actually
using<00:04:24.320> it

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
using it

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.480 
using it
to<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.990> there's<00:04:26.199> nothing<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:26.949> is<00:04:27.040> going<00:04:27.310> to

to that there's nothing that is going to

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.159 
to that there's nothing that is going to
make<00:04:27.669> sure<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:28.030> actually<00:04:28.180> sway<00:04:28.750> off<00:04:28.960> of

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
make sure that actually sway off of

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.110 
make sure that actually sway off of
targets<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.340> is<00:04:30.610> why<00:04:30.759> I<00:04:30.790> went<00:04:31.030> for

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
targets so that is why I went for

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.719 
targets so that is why I went for
tactical<00:04:31.690> mask<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.290> then<00:04:32.919> finally<00:04:33.370> we<00:04:33.550> also

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
tactical mask and then finally we also

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.510 
tactical mask and then finally we also
have<00:04:34.210> to<00:04:34.360> c4<00:04:34.840> which<00:04:35.500> is<00:04:35.680> basically<00:04:36.100> just<00:04:36.220> a

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
have to c4 which is basically just a

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.820 
have to c4 which is basically just a
backup<00:04:36.850> weapon<00:04:37.419> in<00:04:37.509> this<00:04:37.600> case<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:38.199> personally

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
backup weapon in this case I personally

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.409 
backup weapon in this case I personally
tend<00:04:38.979> to<00:04:39.160> use<00:04:39.310> easy<00:04:39.520> for<00:04:39.789> for<00:04:39.970> whenever<00:04:40.180> I<00:04:40.270> have

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
tend to use easy for for whenever I have

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.240 
tend to use easy for for whenever I have
to<00:04:40.539> get<00:04:40.720> out<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:40.990> like<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.139> sticky<00:04:41.500> situation

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250

to get out of like a sticky situation
or<00:04:42.699> whenever<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.270> know<00:04:43.389> that<00:04:43.750> there's<00:04:43.900> like<00:04:44.020> an

that<00:04:46.720> is<00:04:46.870> actually<00:04:47.139> the<00:04:47.229> case<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:47.620> I'll<00:04:47.680> just

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
that is actually the case and I'll just

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.430 
that is actually the case and I'll just
Chuck<00:04:48.100> my<00:04:48.340> c4<00:04:48.550> in<00:04:48.910> there<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.360> then<00:04:50.020> I'll<00:04:50.259> be

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
Chuck my c4 in there and then I'll be

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.749 
Chuck my c4 in there and then I'll be
