00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.789 
smallest and you can see that I have
three<00:01:47.720> applications<00:01:48.290> that<00:01:48.380> are<00:01:48.500> over<00:01:48.619> one

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
three applications that are over one

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.149 
three applications that are over one
gigabyte<00:01:49.280> in<00:01:49.430> size<00:01:49.479> that<00:01:50.479> I<00:01:50.780> could<00:01:51.740> look<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:52.009> in

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
gigabyte in size that I could look to in

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.550 
gigabyte in size that I could look to in
uninstall<00:01:52.700> if<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:53.060> weren't<00:01:53.240> using<00:01:53.600> them<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:54.290> for

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
uninstall if I weren't using them so for

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.319 
uninstall if I weren't using them so for
instance<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:54.979> have<00:01:55.009> CyberLink<00:01:55.820> media<00:01:56.150> suite

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
instance I have CyberLink media suite

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.539 
instance I have CyberLink media suite
essentials<00:01:56.900> here<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.650> I<00:01:57.680> don't<00:01:58.040> use<00:01:58.310> and

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
essentials here that I don't use and

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.580 
essentials here that I don't use and
it's<00:01:59.030> over<00:01:59.240> one<00:01:59.390> gigabyte<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.170> I<00:02:00.200> know<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:00.530> I

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
it's over one gigabyte so I know that I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.260 
it's over one gigabyte so I know that I
could<00:02:00.740> free<00:02:00.950> up<00:02:01.040> a<00:02:01.130> gigabyte<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.520> space<00:02:01.729> if<00:02:02.119> I

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
could free up a gigabyte of space if I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.120 
could free up a gigabyte of space if I
was<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.450> uninstall<00:02:02.689> that<00:02:02.840> program<00:02:03.350> now<00:02:04.070> the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
was to uninstall that program now the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.069 
was to uninstall that program now the
installed<00:02:04.670> on<00:02:04.850> column<00:02:05.060> shows<00:02:05.540> you<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.900> date

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
installed on column shows you the date

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.359 
installed on column shows you the date
in<00:02:06.259> which<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.409> application<00:02:07.100> was<00:02:07.250> installed

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
in which the application was installed

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.490 
in which the application was installed
so<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.420> were<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.539> click<00:02:08.690> on<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:08.959> now
