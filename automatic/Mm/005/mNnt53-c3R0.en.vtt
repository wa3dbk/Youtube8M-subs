00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
scientific study trying to find it if I

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.960 
scientific study trying to find it if I
remember<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.739> link<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:02.339> I<00:01:02.370> did<00:01:02.670> read<00:01:02.850> it

somewhere<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.440> sulfate<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.190> detergent

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
somewhere and the sulfate is a detergent

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.540 
somewhere and the sulfate is a detergent
that<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.750> strip<00:01:07.020> away<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.290> lot<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.159> natural

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.749 
that can strip away a lot of the natural
oils<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.119> natural<00:01:09.270> things<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.170> your<00:01:11.040> scalp<00:01:11.460> so

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.289 
creates oil to replenish and condition
it<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.229> probably<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.190> a<00:01:17.280> long<00:01:17.490> long<00:01:17.820> time<00:01:18.030> ago

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it and probably in a long long time ago

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.350 
it and probably in a long long time ago
when<00:01:18.540> humans<00:01:19.050> didn't<00:01:19.410> bathe<00:01:20.100> regularly<00:01:20.490> um

when humans didn't bathe regularly um

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.480 
when humans didn't bathe regularly um
their<00:01:22.110> hair<00:01:22.350> would<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.560> kind<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> greasy<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
their hair would be kind of greasy to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.219 
their hair would be kind of greasy to
kind<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.210> shine<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.869> Sheen<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
kind of have this shine and Sheen and

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.560 
kind of have this shine and Sheen and
that<00:01:25.350> was<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.310> protect<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.970> hair<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that was really to protect the hair and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.859 
that was really to protect the hair and
nowadays<00:01:27.950> we<00:01:28.970> had<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.119> expectation<00:01:30.479> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
nowadays we had this expectation that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.630 
nowadays we had this expectation that
our<00:01:31.080> hair<00:01:31.320> must<00:01:31.740> look<00:01:32.070> really<00:01:32.340> clean<00:01:32.610> and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
our hair must look really clean and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.270 
our hair must look really clean and
fluffy<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> voluminous<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.039> wash<00:01:35.250> it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
fluffy and voluminous and so we wash it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.340 
fluffy and voluminous and so we wash it
everyday<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.270> that's<00:01:36.390> really<00:01:36.810> not<00:01:37.050> good<00:01:37.320> for

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
everyday and that's really not good for

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.840 
everyday and that's really not good for
it<00:01:37.560> especially<00:01:37.649> if<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.190> use<00:01:38.220> sulfate

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
you're just gonna put it on the ends of

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.670 
you're just gonna put it on the ends of
your<00:04:14.370> hair<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:15.180> what<00:04:15.420> this<00:04:15.540> does<00:04:15.810> is<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.470> helps

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
with some moisture so it doesn't dry out

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.300 
of meat like chicken tofu beans
um<00:04:57.660> peanut<00:04:58.139> butter<00:04:58.349> like<00:04:58.680> things<00:04:58.950> I<00:04:59.070> just<00:04:59.130> have

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
um peanut butter like things I just have

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.610 
um peanut butter like things I just have
a<00:04:59.340> lot<00:04:59.460> of<00:04:59.520> protein<00:04:59.760> because<00:05:00.240> your<00:05:01.050> hair<00:05:01.380> is

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
a lot of protein because your hair is

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
made out of like kind of protein

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.610 
made out of like kind of protein
protists<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:05.700> lot<00:05:05.970> of<00:05:06.180> protein<00:05:06.599> in<00:05:06.630> it<00:05:06.870> has<00:05:07.590> a

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
protists a lot of protein in it has a

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.909 
protists a lot of protein in it has a
lot<00:05:07.919> of<00:05:07.950> protein<00:05:09.200> compounds<00:05:10.200> and<00:05:10.380> complexes

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
lot of protein compounds and complexes

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.839 
lot of protein compounds and complexes
in<00:05:11.039> it<00:05:11.160> so<00:05:11.870> that<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:13.080> why<00:05:13.289> a<00:05:13.680> lot<00:05:14.310> of<00:05:14.580> hair

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
in it so that is why a lot of hair

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.850 
in it so that is why a lot of hair
treatments<00:05:15.360> have<00:05:15.780> carotene<00:05:16.440> because

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
treatments have carotene because

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.620 
treatments have carotene because
carotene<00:05:17.370> helps<00:05:17.639> restore<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.240> rebuild<00:05:18.510> the

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
carotene helps restore and rebuild the

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.070 
carotene helps restore and rebuild the
protein<00:05:19.160> complexes<00:05:20.160> in<00:05:20.340> your<00:05:20.460> hair<00:05:20.930> but<00:05:21.930> if

protein complexes in your hair but if

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.510 
protein complexes in your hair but if

helped people's hair I haven't taken I
don't<00:05:37.260> take<00:05:37.470> vitamins<00:05:37.919> I<00:05:38.460> should<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.300> don't

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
don't take vitamins I should I don't

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.390 
don't take vitamins I should I don't
know<00:05:39.539> why<00:05:39.690> I've<00:05:39.810> just<00:05:39.960> never<00:05:40.139> taken<00:05:40.680> them<00:05:40.830> so<00:05:41.130> I

know why I've just never taken them so I

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.800 
know why I've just never taken them so I
don't<00:05:41.880> really<00:05:41.940> know<00:05:42.150> if<00:05:42.360> they<00:05:42.510> make<00:05:42.780> a
