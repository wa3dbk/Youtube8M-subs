00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 we need to know what we are looking for 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.740
 I know he is open 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.289
 we all talk so that that 's a 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.789
 very important step that is very rare 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.940
 what we have to live has not happened to us 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.940
 never 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:19.040
 to be able to make a transition and that the 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.910
 The coaching staff is open to speak and 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.250
 give us 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.600
 his view of the three years I think 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.550
 who has been here is very important 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.700
 obviously the work of the coaching staff 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.710
 It is impeccable 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.860
 and that of the leaders also goes from the 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.750
 hand because there is a stable campus that 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.860
 they have been together for a long time and today 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.210
 a football team that comes from being 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.460
 a lot of time together I think it 's a 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.110
 advantage over others ever 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.130
 will also play at height will be the 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.860
 affinity occasion for you 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.060
 yes yes I was as a player in 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.420
 Manizales 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.040
 in Colombia that was in height for me 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.650
 it was quite the height that there was with 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.910
 player took me a while to adapt 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.829
 but then remove reach 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.070
 can not take we know in what 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.680
 we are what we have to do if the campus 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.750
 we have and the next campaign 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.550
 to us that has sometimes touched us in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.160
 quilmes out there 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.000
 not playing international cup like that 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.510
 now with the emelec liberators cup 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.010
 but we had a coach that the 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.550
 team was very good that that was another 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.300
 team on a similar issue already 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.640
 from there to adapt 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.290
 to keep doing what was good and 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.140
 with time start to go putting what 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.870
 that our imprint with time 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.680
 it was something that we needed 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.840
 do because the team was fine 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.520
 the quilmes team ends up ascending 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.590
 and then with us doing very good 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.240
 first tournament as for all the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.510
 Ecuador we know that there are many 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.100
 Argentineans who have been here 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.440
 they have always treated us well 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.120
 well and one is always attentive to its 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.300
 suitable for Colombia that touched me 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.250
 be like the player and as a coach 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.860
 so I have the possibility to go then 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.550
 we are trying to get soaked in what 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.280
 is this football from South America and good 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.320
 we are prepared mexico one deals with 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.660
 look to have a fan of what is 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.850
 happening and good as of there is a 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.940
 possibility to go somewhere and you 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.250
 you soak in what is Ecuadorian soccer 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.890
 in this case we are like being very 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.530
 on top of the player in all aspects 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.569
 and in personal care 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.920
 once it has been said is played as 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.020
 lives and I think it's very important 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.920
 we try to advise in the best way 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.020
 that we all try where we are and 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.660
 of the importance of the shield and 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.660
 the shirt and I think that from 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.690
 there are very smart players and I 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.060
 I think if he achieves what he is achieving 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.600
 today in Ã¡lex it is because the player also 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.980
 he is very intelligent and he takes care of himself and tries 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.860
 be delivered to full for what 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.040
 there is this team of the institution and 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.150
 that nothing is to follow we all know that 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.150
 we need to render 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.410
 if we have a hose or a 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.850
 way of explaining things in soccer 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.190
 we all have time to do everything 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.890
 in life and in fire gives you time 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.050
 for everyone to talk on the cell phone to 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.080
 eat to rest to be with the 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.080
 family 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.840
 respect every moment and that of the family 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.430
 the rest of training of 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.300
 share with the player 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.930
 we are open 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.270
 to everything the school already has and 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.300
 that nothing is not not we are not coming with the 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.230
 whip to the contrary we are people 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.590
 ajar and we like to talk and be 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.069
 near the player I like my team 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.499
 he feels protagonist 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.600
 Well you have to see the details how it will be 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:09.330
 a match 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.330
 as if they were the height as there is no longer 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.900
 many things that we will surely start 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.480
 to evaluate but I think the big ones 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.950
 teams do great players 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.110
 but usually how they play 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.050
 omar equipment of telcos as you 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.780
 I would like you to see examples in 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.850
 victory has been this one of a team in 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.410
 which is leading players to 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.880
 through the handling of the ball and 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.280
 attack 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.590
 they have always been like this we have planted 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.810
 our teams with an idea thinking 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.210
 in front of the arch does not mean that 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.070
 you do not also have to know how to defend 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.830
 that it is a great virtue to know how to defend 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.530
 you have to see how to leave them with the ball 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.450
 turned in the act yes I think that 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.310
 tucked inside the arch has its risks 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.590
 we always try to defend it 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.110
 with the value that I do not like to express 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.310
 from outside especially when there is a 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.950
 trainer who is still working 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.590
 for more than a few days 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.810
 probably when I'm inside them 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.210
 can apply certain things or certain 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.310
 manage when we are with the players 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.080
 especially in a game to like a 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.700
 little of the guardiola game of the 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.050
 Guardiola address of the proposal 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.950
 of his game would also be to press 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.810
 quite up against the ball yes but 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.650
 You have to see where in what terrain 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.449
 territory 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.900
 if in height I can go to press 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.960
 but spending my team in a short 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.449
 Timeshare lasts 90 minutes 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.580
 so there is a strategy that I believe 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.389
 that surely you have to raise a 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.389
 different way
