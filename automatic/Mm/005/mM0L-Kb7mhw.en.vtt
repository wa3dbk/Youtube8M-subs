00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:12.140
 &gt;&gt; No, nothing better than a cold beer on a hot summer day .. 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.770
 &gt;&gt; If it has not turned into a warm donkey urine. 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.829
 &gt;&gt; not a deal. 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.619
 &gt;&gt; pour water into the pot and pour in so much salt 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.199
 how much can dissolve there 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.079
 &gt;&gt; further down there figachim starch until 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.870
 the mixture does not thicken and does not look like a dense 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.200
 jelly. 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.920
 &gt;&gt; We pour this stuff into pre-cooked containers. 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.370
 until full, because there is salt in the composition, 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.649
 in a normal refrigerator, these bottles will not tear and 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.559
 they do not even crystallize. 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.059
 &gt;&gt; Yeah man we just made a self-made 3 penny 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.649
 cold batteries. &gt;&gt; let them cool 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.739
 &gt;&gt; Now you have to make the fridge itself, the first thing 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.309
 fell under the arm, an empty battle from the cooler. 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.650
 &gt;&gt; an attempt to cut with a knife fell into hell, therefore 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.070
 had to resort to a more powerful instrument. 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.070
 &gt;&gt; Pieces of penoplex marked and cut will perform 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.530
 the role of the bottom and cover. respectively. 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.049
 &gt;&gt; sticking the bottom on the tape. 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.149
 &gt;&gt; for lack of foil vapor barrier and aluminum 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.619
 scotch tape that would be the best for these 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.619
 Goals cheaply and angrily wrapped in a blanket, and fasten 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.909
 his scotch tape 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.369
 &gt;&gt; result, from a heap of junk for half an hour, you can do 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.289
 a fridge that keeps your drinks cold 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:09.289
 for at least 5 hours, provided that 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.440
 stand in the shade.
