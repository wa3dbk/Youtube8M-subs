00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.770
 I bring you the jailbreak video 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:13.420
 untethered for version 5.1.1 and what 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.280
 which means grass with t3 that goes to 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.810
 do the full jailbreak or the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.220
 jailbreak we need in the 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.140
 computer to learn our 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.640
 device simply sidya 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.230
 it would work as one more application 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.539
 then I'll get to you, it's very 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.939
 recommended because you have no older 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.589
 problems to learn your device and 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.380
 It is also very, very simple to do 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.850
 it's just a click then good 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.160
 let's start with the instructions 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.890
 to make it good before anything is from 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.710
 yerbal works for iphone 4s iphone 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:47.020
 4 iphone 3gs the ipad an ipad2 and ipad 3 and 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.090
 the ipad touch third generation and 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.440
 fourth generation in that means 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.190
 that works for all devices 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.840
 that can reach version 5.1.1 and 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.820
 before doing this jailbreak them 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.100
 I recommend that they restore if they do not 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.180
 there is no problem and for sure 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.050
 is in version 5.1.1 and something else that 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.050
 they need to know is that if they have 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.360
 a code lock your ipod or your iphone 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.310
 your ipad has to be removed since 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.020
 It can bring some problems when doing 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.400
 this procedure so just remove 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.980
 if they have it they just have to 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.090
 do that and well let's start with 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.159
 the procedure for that have to 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.200
 connect your device to the computer 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.119
 and once they connect it if it gets to 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.280
 open itunes for example now close it 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.009
 make sure there is no pro in 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.649
 no open program and above all 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.079
 iTunes can bring collisions with the 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.600
 application then yes they have it open 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.039
 they just close them and they have good 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.780
 to download this program that they 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.840
 I downloaded the link in the description so much 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.729
 for windows mac or for link or in case 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.829
 of windows have to open it by clicking 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.899
 right and select open as 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.710
 administrator if they are in maxim ple 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.990
 they open it normally 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.729
 and well here it will open as you see here 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.090
 it tells us it's a ipod touch fourth 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.190
 generation with ships 5.1.1 that was 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.200
 detected and nothing else we have to tighten 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.119
 the grass button and to begin with 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.289
 then that is what we are going to do here 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.940
 is the ipad they are going to see all the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.100
 procedure this I will do in 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.989
 fast camera so you do not be so 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.880
 time the video but it may take a couple 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.310
 of minutes and it depends on everything 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.670
 have on your device because it's like 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.709
 if in a restoration and good for nothing 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.900
 of the world disconnects the device or what 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.250
 touch just leave it like this 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.230
 minutes that afternoon 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.650
 and well let's start by clicking on 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.650
 grass 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.890
 Let's see 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.069
 i 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.540
 all right 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.620
 ok here the window that appeared 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.690
 tells us that it is ready that what 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.489
 let's enjoy then we go here to 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.140
 device we are going to realize that 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.209
 it will be cydia 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.670
 here is next we will be able to 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.950
 enjoy and already a gilbert simply 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.950
 what we have to do is open serious 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.830
 and 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.959
 although there is a time when the 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:41.209
 step that tells us preparing the system 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.439
 we reopen it and we're going to give 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.109
 account that there will be no knots in the 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.480
 question that we are hacker users or 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.790
 developer and we select user and 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.739
 then in ready and that's how simple we are going to 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.510
 complete this jailbreak this was all 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.739
 so I 'm in any doubt degenerates 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.420

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.250
