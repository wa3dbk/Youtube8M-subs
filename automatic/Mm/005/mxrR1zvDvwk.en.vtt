00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.930
 construction of a ceiling 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.680
 removable durlock 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.080
 Armed with the structure to build 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.090
 detachable ceilings durlock it 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.559
 You must assemble a profile structure 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.320
 bi metallic sheet steel 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.840
 galvanized with pre view painted in 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.080
 white on which the 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.410
 removable plates durlock on the 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.760
 walls will be marked the desired height 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.160
 transporting this measure with level to 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.710
 all the perimeter and drawing a line 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.040
 continue with chalk thread using a 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.010
 laser level 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.620
 and the perimeter profiles l will be set 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.260
 on the wall placing fixings with 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.600
 a separation of 60 centimeters and of 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.410
 so that the edge of the profile matches 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.410
 with the guide line 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.360
 on the perimeter profiles is 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.780
 will indicate the location of the profiles 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.430
 stringers and crossbars the marks 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.800
 of the stringers are transported to the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.370
 cover drawing reference lines 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.680
 proven 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.810
 on these lines the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.630
 fixings with a maximum separation of 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.000
 one meter 20 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.799
 of the fixings already installed 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.799
 hang the suspension elements 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.920
 The end of the stringers should be 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.140
 cut so that the notches 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.860
 crossbars match the modulation 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.860
 expected 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.820
 the stringers profiles are located 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.460
 hanging the elements of 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.409
 suspension using the perforations 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.770
 circulars provided in the soul of 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.770
 profile 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.070
 if necessary, join stringers 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.150
 uses the locking system of 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.220
 heads 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.380
 the level and 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.540
 alignment of the stringers and correct it 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.200
 by regulating the elements 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.200
 of suspension 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.990
 to place the crossbars 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.540
 they introduce the extremes at the same time 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.430
 of two crossbeams profiles making the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.540
 fit them through the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.540
 head system 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.890
 plated 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.500
 using gloves the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.420
 durlock plates from below leaving them 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.160
 descend until they support all their 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.770
 perimeter on the structure of 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.230
 profiles is armed 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.330
 you should start by placing the plates 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.750
 entire ending with the installation 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.760
 of the plates with cut-outs 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.250
 the plates a pin is used 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.110
 first cutting the paper from the front of 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.900
 the plate to make a cut 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.420
 prolix then breaks the core of 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.920
 plaster and finally the paper is cut 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.920
 the back side of the plate
