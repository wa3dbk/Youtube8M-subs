oncologist<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.570> my<00:01:03.719> life<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:05.280> wouldn't<00:01:05.820> be

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
oncologist in my life that wouldn't be

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.950 
oncologist in my life that wouldn't be
classified<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> sociopath<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:09.810> can

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
classified as a sociopath and you can

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.370 
classified as a sociopath and you can
define<00:01:10.260> sociopaths<00:01:11.270> yeah<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.110> hear

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that has no social conscience that would

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.870 
that has no social conscience that would
do<00:01:16.770> whatever<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.220> takes<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.580> further

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
do whatever it takes to further

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.399 
do whatever it takes to further
themselves<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> expense<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.110> others

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
themselves at the expense of others

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.789 
themselves at the expense of others
that's<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.820> perfectly<00:01:21.299> good<00:01:21.590> definition<00:01:22.590> no

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that's a perfectly good definition no

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.109 
that's a perfectly good definition no
remorse<00:01:23.600> yet<00:01:24.600> they're<00:01:24.840> willing<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.200> give

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
remorse yet they're willing to give

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.910 
remorse yet they're willing to give
chemicals<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> person<00:01:27.869> knowing<00:01:28.770> that

they're not going to help the person

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.210 
they're not going to help the person
especially<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> oncologist<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.040> been

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
especially if the oncologist has been

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.800 
especially if the oncologist has been
doing<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.610> anything<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.420> he<00:01:33.509> liked<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
time at all knowing that it causes harm

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.620 
time at all knowing that it causes harm
collecting<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> money<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.030> moving

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.749 
on to the next patient and that by
definition<00:01:44.570> would<00:01:45.570> make<00:01:46.259> them<00:01:46.759> sociopathic

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
definition would make them sociopathic

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.389 
definition would make them sociopathic

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
there I know there are exceptions but

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.219 
there I know there are exceptions but
the<00:02:03.329> exceptions<00:02:04.170> I've<00:02:04.920> only<00:02:05.579> met<00:02:05.880> one<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.479> 30

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the exceptions I've only met one in 30

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.639 
the exceptions I've only met one in 30
years<00:02:07.789> who<00:02:08.789> actually<00:02:09.360> did<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> television<00:02:10.259> show

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
years who actually did a television show

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.940 
years who actually did a television show
with<00:02:11.099> me

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
with me

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.250 
with me
and<00:02:12.040> went<00:02:12.970> over<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.810> years<00:02:15.840> cancer<00:02:16.840> report

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
and went over that years cancer report

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.740 
and went over that years cancer report
from<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.190> American<00:02:18.550> Cancer<00:02:18.760> Society<00:02:19.599> in

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
from the American Cancer Society in

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.550 
from the American Cancer Society in
which<00:02:20.560> they<00:02:20.769> showed<00:02:21.099> that<00:02:22.230> there<00:02:23.230> had<00:02:23.349> been<00:02:23.530> a

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
which they showed that there had been a

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.210 
which they showed that there had been a
decrease<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.459> prostate<00:02:25.150> carry<00:02:25.680> cancer<00:02:26.680> which

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
decrease in prostate carry cancer which

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.190 
decrease in prostate carry cancer which
was<00:02:27.400> all<00:02:27.550> they<00:02:27.670> could<00:02:27.700> show<00:02:28.030> was<00:02:28.209> positive<00:02:28.810> in

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
was all they could show was positive in

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.300 
was all they could show was positive in
one<00:02:30.010> area<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.550> country<00:02:31.680> well<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.950> read<00:02:33.280> the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
one area of the country well I read the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.339 
one area of the country well I read the
same<00:02:33.580> report<00:02:34.000> she<00:02:34.180> did<00:02:34.420> only<00:02:35.019> I<00:02:35.050> went<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.319> little

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
same report she did only I went a little

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.780 
same report she did only I went a little
bit<00:02:35.560> further<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.220> did<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.370> little<00:02:36.489> bit<00:02:36.700> of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
bit further and did a little bit of

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.520 
bit further and did a little bit of
research<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.510> found<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:37.989> area<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.410> the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
research and found that that area of the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.539 
research and found that that area of the
country<00:02:38.910> did<00:02:39.910> not<00:02:40.150> do<00:02:40.480> nor<00:02:41.010> had<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.160> lowest

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
country did not do nor had the lowest

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.930 
country did not do nor had the lowest
rate<00:02:42.849> of<00:02:42.989> rectal<00:02:43.989> or<00:02:44.140> prostate<00:02:44.590> exams<00:02:45.010> in<00:02:45.340> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
rate of rectal or prostate exams in the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.470 
rate of rectal or prostate exams in the
country<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:48.370> area<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:49.120> had<00:02:49.269> the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
country so the area that had the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.319 
country so the area that had the
decrease<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.440> prostate<00:02:50.860> cancer<00:02:51.310> was<00:02:52.120> not

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
decrease in prostate cancer was not

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.120 
decrease in prostate cancer was not
getting<00:02:52.510> treated<00:02:52.840> for<00:02:53.110> prostate<00:02:53.230> cancer<00:02:53.590> or

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
getting treated for prostate cancer or

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.850 
getting treated for prostate cancer or
tested<00:02:54.700> for<00:02:54.819> prostate<00:02:54.940> cancer<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:56.530> they<00:02:56.709> had

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
tested for prostate cancer so they had

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.160 
tested for prostate cancer so they had
the<00:02:57.010> lowest<00:02:57.690> number<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.720> deaths<00:02:59.019> from

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
the lowest number of deaths from

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.370 
the lowest number of deaths from
prostate<00:02:59.620> cancer<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:01.390> gave<00:03:01.930> this<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.319> her

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
prostate cancer and I gave this to her

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.300 
prostate cancer and I gave this to her
on<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.650> show<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.280> she<00:03:03.880> gave<00:03:04.060> me<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:05.310> really
