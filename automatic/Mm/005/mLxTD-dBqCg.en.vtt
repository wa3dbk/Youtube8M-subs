00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:12.050
 The evolution of smartphones is not really ending. 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:16.520
 Even we, who deal with it every day, are amazed 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.050
 Among them, the most eye-catching smartphones these days are the Galaxy Note Apps 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.950
 I can not help it. 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.660
 Expression only uses flexible display to extend screen to border 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.730
 It is a smartphone. 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:33.640
 I am the God of Korea, Yoo Jung Kim So from now on Galaxy Note lg Max 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.640
 Let's look at how to use the feature edge screen 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:51.610
 First, on the edge screen, you can decorate it like a smartphone lock screen, 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:57.040
 You can easily check various notifications. 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:02.100
 The default icon at the bottom of the original Android OS screen is also the edge screen 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:06.960
 It also has the advantage of being able to use the screen more widely by moving it. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.840
 The following are tendeyo learn a panel edge of the screen, the desired number of panels 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.119
 You can set up 7 panels 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.229
 The way to set it is to push the edge screen from bottom to top 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.229
 Touch the icon. 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.920
 Frequently used functions such as phone or message daily internet camera 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.299
 I have a main panel of collections. 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.740
 Here is a panel where you can check whether the message is received with the weather 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:38.049
 There is 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.240
 We use these two as basics and the other five follow our usual habits 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:45.729
 I recommend you choose. 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:50.549
 Galaxy Music App Milk, Next News 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:55.830
 If you like sports, you can play sports results 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.830
 I think you'll like the panel to let me know in real time . 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:07.350
 Edge screens can also be used with extended functionality 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.350
 We've got an additional panel available for download. 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.819
 The presentation of the rc note looks useful . 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.440
 There's even a game that uses street edge screens to compete 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.840
 It's a game. 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:27.340
 It looks good for killing time rather than being so funny. 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:31.570
 I would like to add more panels because of its scalability. 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:36.220
 You can even customize the Edge screen to suit your taste. 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.600
 So that you can see the motto or something you decided on by putting it in a message. 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.010
 I did. 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.570
 You can set up a separate screen for edge screams that change the background 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.010
 There is 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:51.720
 Since the edge screen is turned on when the ExpressMail is set, 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.720
 Good for expressing personality. 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:01.439
 Night-time watch is one of the features that make good use of the edge screen. 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:05.159
 If you set the night time ahead of time, you will not see the edge screen 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:11.069
 Show time only through 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:16.260
 It's a comfortable function when you want to check your time at any time. 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:18.420
 Lastly, I have a quick tool feature , 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.970
 If you sweep it, you can get it. 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:30.239
 Including a ruler function that can measure up to 10cm, a stopwatch timer 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:33.540
 I have gathered a number of functions that need to be run quickly , 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.970
 Especially, the scale function is surprisingly fun. 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.970
 You can use this liquid like a rod. 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:49.069
 So far , I've looked at how to use the lg scream of Galaxy Note Edge . 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.069
