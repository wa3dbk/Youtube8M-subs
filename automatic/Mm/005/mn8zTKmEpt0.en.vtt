00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
exactly say either one of them is very

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.310 
exactly say either one of them is very
competitive<00:00:55.579> but<00:00:56.719> like<00:00:57.719> i<00:00:57.750> said<00:00:57.870> i<00:00:58.020> could<00:00:58.050> just

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
competitive but like i said i could just

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.319 
competitive but like i said i could just
basically<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.489> whole<00:00:59.609> premise<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> deck

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
basically the whole premise of the deck

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.939 
basically the whole premise of the deck
as<00:01:00.480> i<00:01:00.600> wanted<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.960> deck<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.620> really

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
as i wanted a deck that can be really

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.680 
as i wanted a deck that can be really
versatile<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.670> make<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.090> about<00:01:03.210> any<00:01:03.510> kind

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
versatile and make just about any kind

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.200 
versatile and make just about any kind
of<00:01:03.840> monster<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:05.250> only<00:01:05.430> thing<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.790> i<00:01:05.820> believe

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
of monster the only thing that i believe

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.670 
of monster the only thing that i believe
this<00:01:06.450> deck<00:01:06.659> can't<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:08.869> really<00:01:09.869> low<00:01:10.229> level

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
this deck can't do is really low level

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.070 
this deck can't do is really low level
synchros<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.460> then<00:01:11.580> any<00:01:12.119> exceed<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.930> would

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
synchros and then any exceed that would

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.910 
synchros and then any exceed that would
be<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.409> rank<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.040> don't<00:01:14.220> know<00:01:14.280> five<00:01:15.530> seven<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
be like rank I don't know five seven and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.600 
be like rank I don't know five seven and
then<00:01:18.080> 9<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.290> above<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.740> guess<00:01:19.920> actually<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> guess

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
then 9 or above I guess actually I guess

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.880 
then 9 or above I guess actually I guess
I<00:01:20.700> could<00:01:20.850> make<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> 10<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.080> i<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.290> drop<00:01:22.409> ee<00:01:22.860> 0

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
I could make a 10 if i can drop ee 0

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.240 
I could make a 10 if i can drop ee 0
which<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.310> doable<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.909> deck<00:01:24.150> thanks<00:01:24.990> to

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
right it's just like I said it's

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.390 
right it's just like I said it's
completely<00:03:13.500> just<00:03:13.860> fun<00:03:14.250> based<00:03:14.490> it's<00:03:14.820> not<00:03:15.350> I

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
completely just fun based it's not I

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.770 
completely just fun based it's not I
don't<00:03:17.400> know<00:03:17.490> it's<00:03:17.730> not<00:03:17.910> competitive<00:03:18.209> at<00:03:18.510> all<00:03:18.720> I

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
don't know it's not competitive at all I

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.110 
don't know it's not competitive at all I
would<00:03:19.080> say<00:03:19.130> just<00:03:20.130> because<00:03:20.310> it's<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:20.850> random

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
would say just because it's so random

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.000 
would say just because it's so random
it's<00:03:21.480> too<00:03:21.750> many<00:03:21.930> engines<00:03:22.350> in<00:03:22.590> my<00:03:22.709> opinion

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
it's too many engines in my opinion

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.780 
it's too many engines in my opinion
trying<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.489> be<00:03:23.580> shoved<00:03:23.790> into<00:03:23.790> one<00:03:24.180> deck<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:26.730> I

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
trying to be shoved into one deck and I

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.850 
trying to be shoved into one deck and I
mean<00:03:26.940> they<00:03:27.060> don't<00:03:27.180> directly<00:03:27.750> play<00:03:28.739> off<00:03:28.830> of

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
mean they don't directly play off of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.020 
mean they don't directly play off of
each<00:03:29.070> other<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.340> mean<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.640> reason<00:03:29.670> I'm

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
each other I mean the reason I'm

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.570 
each other I mean the reason I'm
combining<00:03:30.390> them<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.930> they<00:03:31.230> both<00:03:31.590> kind<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.130> work

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
combining them is they both kind of work

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.460 
combining them is they both kind of work
when<00:03:32.850> they're<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.120> graveyard<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:34.350> top

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
when they're in the graveyard and on top

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.110 
when they're in the graveyard and on top
of<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.770> just<00:03:35.040> always<00:03:35.220> wanted<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.670> combine

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
of that I just always wanted to combine

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.880 
of that I just always wanted to combine
a<00:03:36.270> deck<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.570> uses<00:03:37.020> solar<00:03:37.200> recharge<00:03:37.650> and

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
a deck that uses solar recharge and

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.370 
a deck that uses solar recharge and
destiny<00:03:38.280> draw<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.820> same<00:03:39.060> deck<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:40.230> just

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
destiny draw in the same deck it just

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.500 
destiny draw in the same deck it just
seems<00:03:40.500> like<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.650> really<00:03:40.709> cool<00:03:41.150> combo<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.180> mean

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
seems like a really cool combo I mean

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.449 
seems like a really cool combo I mean
