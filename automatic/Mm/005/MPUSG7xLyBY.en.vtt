00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
complete puddles so the basic idea the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.960 
complete puddles so the basic idea the
game<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.350> these<00:01:13.590> squares<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.310> each

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
game is you have these squares and each

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.300 
game is you have these squares and each
of<00:01:15.150> them<00:01:15.240> has<00:01:15.420> four<00:01:15.689> triangles<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.350> what

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
of them has four triangles and what

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.340 
of them has four triangles and what
you're<00:01:17.430> supposed<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.630> rotate<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
you're supposed to do is you rotate the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.609 
you're supposed to do is you rotate the
squares<00:01:20.299> until<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:22.020> match<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.409> color

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
squares until you can match the color

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.270 
squares until you can match the color
next<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.450> pull<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> selector<00:01:25.049> over<00:01:25.409> rotate

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
next to it pull the selector over rotate

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.300 
next to it pull the selector over rotate
so<00:01:26.520> we're<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.820> from<00:01:27.119> orange<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.600> orange

isn't<00:02:01.079> how<00:02:01.469> many<00:02:01.649> times<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.130> rotate<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
isn't how many times you rotate the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.690 
isn't how many times you rotate the
square<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.530> how<00:02:04.530> many<00:02:04.590> times<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.250> connect

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
square it's how many times you connect

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.410 
square it's how many times you connect
the<00:02:05.909> squares<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.920> basically<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.879> faster<00:02:09.300> you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
the squares to basically the faster you

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.450 
the squares to basically the faster you
go<00:02:10.550> in<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:12.120> fewest<00:02:12.450> moves

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
go in the fewest moves

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.050 
go in the fewest moves
the<00:02:15.460> better<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.880> do<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:18.190> there<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:18.460> go<00:02:18.490> we've

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
the better you do so there we go we've

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.240 
the better you do so there we go we've
completed<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.720> one<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.740> tells<00:02:20.890> us<00:02:21.130> we

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
completed that one and it tells us we

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.790 
completed that one and it tells us we
can<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.520> better<00:02:21.700> which<00:02:21.970> I'm<00:02:22.900> sure<00:02:23.200> we<00:02:23.350> can<00:02:23.500> but

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
can do better which I'm sure we can but

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.260 
can do better which I'm sure we can but
it's<00:02:23.950> tough<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.370> do<00:02:24.490> these<00:02:24.610> puzzles<00:02:25.090> when

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
it's tough to do these puzzles when

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.020 
it's tough to do these puzzles when
you're<00:02:25.390> actually<00:02:25.540> for<00:02:25.960> few<00:02:26.140> yeah<00:02:26.760> let's<00:02:27.760> see

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
you're actually for few yeah let's see

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.090 
you're actually for few yeah let's see
so<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:28.840> one<00:02:29.020> sometimes<00:02:29.710> they'll<00:02:29.980> be

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
so this one sometimes they'll be

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.410 
so this one sometimes they'll be
multiple<00:02:31.680> squares<00:02:32.700> my<00:02:33.700> all<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.000> them<00:02:34.090> must<00:02:34.270> be

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
multiple squares my all of them must be

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.240 
multiple squares my all of them must be
filled<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.720> win<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.960> level<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.750> can<00:02:37.930> see

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
filled to win the level so you can see

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.090 
filled to win the level so you can see
sometimes<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.400> got<00:02:39.490> to<00:02:39.610> do<00:02:39.700> this<00:02:40.980> rotate<00:02:41.980> it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
sometimes you got to do this rotate it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.630 
sometimes you got to do this rotate it
this<00:02:42.370> way<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:44.710> this<00:02:44.830> will<00:02:45.010> be<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.220> last<00:02:45.340> level

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
this way and this will be the last level

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.600 
this way and this will be the last level
we<00:02:45.910> go<00:02:46.090> through<00:02:46.710> this<00:02:47.710> pretty<00:02:48.040> much<00:02:48.250> gives<00:02:48.550> you

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
we go through this pretty much gives you

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.420 
we go through this pretty much gives you
a<00:02:48.670> good<00:02:48.790> idea<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:49.210> what<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.200> need<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.500> do<00:02:50.650> in

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
a good idea of what you need to do in

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.030 
a good idea of what you need to do in
order<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.150> complete<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.510> puzzles<00:02:52.990> so<00:02:53.680> is

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
order to complete the puzzles so is

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.660 
order to complete the puzzles so is
that's<00:02:54.910> not<00:02:55.090> our<00:02:55.240> best<00:02:55.620> alright<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.400> there<00:02:58.120> are

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
that's not our best alright so there are

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.820 
that's not our best alright so there are
all<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.730> these<00:03:00.970> beginner<00:03:01.480> levels<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.680> is

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
all of these beginner levels this is

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.710 
all of these beginner levels this is
what<00:03:02.980> happens<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.640> is<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.880> pause<00:03:04.060> menu<00:03:04.330> so

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
what happens this is the pause menu so

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.710 
what happens this is the pause menu so
what<00:03:04.900> we're<00:03:05.050> going<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.230> do<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:06.570> we're<00:03:07.570> going<00:03:07.660> to

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.250 
what we're going to do is we're going to
forfeit<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:09.300> here<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.420> gives<00:03:10.570> us<00:03:10.750> our<00:03:10.930> score

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
forfeit so here it gives us our score

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.140 
forfeit so here it gives us our score
and<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.980> also<00:03:12.130> tells<00:03:12.490> you<00:03:12.670> what<00:03:12.820> your<00:03:12.970> best

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
and it also tells you what your best

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.930 
and it also tells you what your best
score<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:15.070> we're<00:03:15.250> going<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.430> hit<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.730> main

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
score is so we're going to hit the main

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.440 
score is so we're going to hit the main
menu<00:03:16.560> also<00:03:17.560> another<00:03:18.310> cool<00:03:18.640> part<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.060> wrote<00:03:19.270> a

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
menu also another cool part of wrote a

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.620 
menu also another cool part of wrote a
go<00:03:19.600> is<00:03:19.980> high<00:03:20.980> scores<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:22.120> can<00:03:22.240> see<00:03:22.390> there's

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
go is high scores you can see there's

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.020 
go is high scores you can see there's
gain<00:03:22.870> center<00:03:23.200> integration<00:03:23.740> so<00:03:24.610> if<00:03:24.790> that's

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
gain center integration so if that's

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.600 
gain center integration so if that's
your<00:03:25.240> thing<00:03:26.640> definitely<00:03:27.640> handy<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:29.610> really

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
that's that's about it the game has 40

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.490 
that's that's about it the game has 40
levels<00:03:34.720> total<00:03:36.150> each<00:03:37.150> one<00:03:37.540> gets<00:03:38.110> progressively

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
levels total each one gets progressively

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.230 
levels total each one gets progressively
harder<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:40.020> from<00:03:41.020> what<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.320> read<00:03:41.560> on<00:03:41.620> the

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
harder and from what I read on the

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.050 
harder and from what I read on the
website<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.960> developers<00:03:44.440> website<00:03:45.030> there<00:03:46.030> are

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
website the developers website there are

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.250 
website the developers website there are
over<00:03:46.480> two<00:03:46.930> million<00:03:47.260> different<00:03:47.770> ways<00:03:47.800> to<00:03:49.260> so

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
over two million different ways to so

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.520 
over two million different ways to so
you<00:03:50.320> have<00:03:50.560> basically<00:03:51.250> solve<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:53.020> puzzles<00:03:53.410> in

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
you have basically solve the puzzles in

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.020 
you have basically solve the puzzles in
the<00:03:53.560> game<00:03:53.770> so<00:03:54.660> definitely<00:03:55.660> not<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:56.730> one<00:03:57.730> way<00:03:57.970> to

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
the game so definitely not a one way to

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.540 
the game so definitely not a one way to
solve<00:03:58.990> everything<00:03:59.470> type<00:03:59.890> again<00:04:00.190> which<00:04:00.370> is

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
solve everything type again which is

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.780 
solve everything type again which is
great<00:04:00.790> because<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:01.840> means<00:04:01.990> you<00:04:02.590> can<00:04:03.010> play<00:04:03.760> it

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
great because that means you can play it

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.850 
great because that means you can play it
over<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.180> over<00:04:04.360> again<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:04.810> solve<00:04:05.380> puzzles

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
over and over again and solve puzzles

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.280 
over and over again and solve puzzles
different<00:04:06.250> times<00:04:06.460> each<00:04:07.450> time<00:04:08.430> for<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.520> price

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
different times each time for the price

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.140 
different times each time for the price
currently<00:04:11.290> free<00:04:11.590> it's<00:04:11.920> definitely<00:04:12.610> worth

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
currently free it's definitely worth

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.180
