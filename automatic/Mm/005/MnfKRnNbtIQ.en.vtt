00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
 hi everyone these young games 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.450
 today I propose a 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.759
 presentation of a product that comes out of 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.920
 the ordinary and that is called energy 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.470
 android dual dongle tv which is basically 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.300
 a small box that plugs into hdmi 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.100
 on your television and that allows you 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.590
 to have the android system directly 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.160
 on your telly wholesale it's like a 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.199
 apple tv 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.340
 but with the android system you go 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.740
 so be able to download 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.600
 games apps on the pstore 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.130
 stadiums and widgets on your desktop 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.430
 in you are transforming your 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.530
 TV in android tv or in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.579
 a pc you probably need you 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.079
 ask but how do we do to 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.250
 navigate well it's very simple you 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.789
 have a remote that is provided 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.440
 with 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.420
 but what I advise you is 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.570
 connect you either by bus all by 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.120
 a usb socket with a mouse and a 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.000
 wireless keyboard since simply 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.260
 by having using a mouse you 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.120
 be able to do the gestures like 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.280
 you're used to doing with the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 finger while on the remote this 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.680
 not possible 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.270
 you have several features that 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.640
 available to you already you have to know that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.670
 you can read files on a 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.170
 usb key or by a socket sd so 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.700
 basically there for example age to a movie 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.830
 which is on a usb key and well I can 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.320
 read it in full hd directly on the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.580
 television which is rather practical 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.930
 you can surf the internet so 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.909
 use all the applications that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.830
 go to the web youtube facebook twitter 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.750
 any one you can even 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.600
 share the screen of your smartphone on 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.189
 television screen television 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.290
 and the smartphone must be connected by 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.270
 report to the same here at home the terminal 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.009
 wifi is far enough away from the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.140
 television of the coup it's not very fluid 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.570
 so to have optimal use 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.890
 plan to put the wifi terminal price of 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.899
 your televisions as I wanted said 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.540
 you can plug in a sd card as well 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.850
 that a usb card on the small device 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.869
 that looks like the usb key and you have 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.729
 an application that will be interesting 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.310
 at that time explore that allows you 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.649
 to basically explore the content of each 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.579
 device that you 're going to plug in and this 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.840
 that you also need to know is that 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.149
 when you're going to put pictures of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.189
 videos or even music and well the 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.299
 android system will detect them and the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.920
 automatically put in the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.450
 basic applications so all 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.649
 photos are going to be in the app 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.580
 pictures all the music in 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.250
 the mu application 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.460
 ic and all the videos in 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.080
 the video application this time box has 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.540
 a tive dongle it comes with this 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.010
 box with very young packaging behind 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.840
 you have all the information on the 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.560
 product then you had to ruined 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.480
 jelly bean of the 4.2 a processor 2 hearts 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.150

 wifi etc etc we want to open it 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.260
 so first we have this little 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.140
 casing which is super light is enough 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.080
 easy to transport he has 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.950
 the impression that it is a usb key 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.840
 slightly larger 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.860
 you next go a notice that I 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.790
 advise you to read in a whole 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.550
 what else do we have 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.500
 we have a remote control that is rather 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.160
 practice at the top you have everything that 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.530
 shortcuts shortcuts or you put gold 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.720
 twitter facebook in the middle you have 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.300
 everything that is direction button for 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.920
 navigate and at the bottom we find 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.900
 numbers as well as letters 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.060
 the remote control works with two 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.190
 AA batteries that come with 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.470
 for those who do not know all the 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.690
 devices that work in hdmi they 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.820
 can not feed themselves so they 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.280
 need a cable that allows everything 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.560
 to simply give energy then 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.350
 we have this cable that is provided 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.110
 with a usb cable also with an output 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.050
 antenna that will be useful to use the 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.140
 remote control and navigate the system 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.530
 we also have a cable that allows 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.959
 transform usb micro into usb after 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.690
 you have a usb power adapter that 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.040
 will power your housing if 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.320
 you do not have a USB port on your 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.300
 TV and finally we have some papers 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.230
 advertising and stickers 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.600
 from the brand energy systems 1 i 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.680
 picked up the case then left you 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.720
 have a micro usb port left here you 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.880
 have a also a micro usb port but who 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.090
 allows to load the case on the right a 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.880
 usb port and right you have a button 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.000
 reset and there a sd port to add 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.289
 the memory to install your case 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 it's very simple you need a 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.790
 TV with a hdmi port 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.100
 you plug this box into the port 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.530
 hdmi and after it needs feeding 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.220
 to power the case you take the 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:38.340
 cable you put it here then it will 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.170
 the loaded with the usb port is with a 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.420
 USB port that on your TV is 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.640
 with the AC adapter as I 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.050
 say before and the second cable you 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.120
 can connect it to the left of 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.580
 the device allowing you to 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.910
 use it to connect USB keys 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.680
 as you wish the cable that 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.270
 allows to feed the teen gaw tv 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.350
 has an antenna 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.060
 and well this antenna must be put 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.580
 near the television to use well 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.710
 the remote is the last step 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.110
 turn on the television the case goes 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.730
 normally turn on automatically and 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.640
 then after about thirty seconds 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.650
 you will be able to use it energy 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.850
