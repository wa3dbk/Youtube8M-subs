00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.070
 the first thing to do is that you 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.270
 have washed your vehicle either at the station 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.590
 either at home but you make a 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.790
 complete washing of the vehicle as 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.660
 hall where he used to 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.590
 do and then we will pass you 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.470
 products so there I'm going to do you 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.810
 the demonstration on a hood already I 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.619
 shows you the different products a 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.420
 by a the first product that is the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.730
 abrasive paste 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.850
 it's a polish that will allow 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.520
 to eliminate the micro scratches so the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.190
 medium-sized scratch pickups is from 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.740
 large size so he has a grain a 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.270
 grosgrain actually this polish then 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.640
 in a second time we will use 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.380
 the anti hologram because following the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.800
 passage of this product there is a risk 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.480
 important of appearance of the logram 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.129
 so it's just these little circles that 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.660
 appear this optical effect on the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.030
 bodywork that is quite unpleasant 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.100
 so we will use this paste with a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.940
 extremely fine grain that will remove 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.220
 holograms 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.670
 so that was trial of the products of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.340
 renovation will be applied with with 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.960
 chord pad and a rotary machine 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.100
 we have two legs we have a third 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.520
 pack that's there I'll show you 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.520
 see you later 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.360
 first step the passage of the dough 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.040
 abrasives so with a font at 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.390
 rotary 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.620
 it's better you can do it at the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.130
 hand in hand it's going to be a lot more 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.320
 working 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.020
 a small amount of 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.000
 pints you put a little bit on 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.020
 the pad a little bit on the body 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.220
 we do not need to put a lot of 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.220
 you put a small amount 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.960
 go we will start with the use 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.399
 the flexible pad initially and 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.560
 then the yellow then 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.390
 will use the white for the finish that 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.100
 is the hardest step and we start 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.970
 on a rotational speed of about 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.560
 2000 rpm 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.200
 we start not too fast and with a 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.090
 pretty strong pressure in a first 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.290
 time and it will decrease the pressure by the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.380
 following by increasing the speed of 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.380
 rotation 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.390
 once you have passed the product 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.650
 everywhere with the yellow soft pad you 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.170
 pass a second time with the pad 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.440
 harder for finishing with the pad 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.440
 White 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.630
 the abrasive prat residues the 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.160
 last residues you years the real ones 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.310
 with the silk cloth insufflons 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.500
 microfiber 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.120
 that you have in the trade or so 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.620
 the microfiber cloth carpreaux which is 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.330
 provided in the complete pack of 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.790
 treatment 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:25.290
 you remove the last residues here 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.300
 when you have more residue at all 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.060
 abrasive pasta 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.170
 the body is ready to receive the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.170
 anti hologram treatment 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.270
 so here I spent the dough 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.610
 brazil especially the hood from 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.930
 now I'm going to switch to products 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.650
 anti hologram 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.840
 so it will apply with a pack 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.220
 special who is the orange colored college 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.530
 so this time we try well 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.970
 moisten the pad with the product 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.850
 okay so we're going to care 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.870
 with your finger either with if you have a 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.580
 utensil it is necessary that the pad are well 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.960
 moisten everywhere with the product it is 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.940
 important that once you have 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.240
 apply the product on especially the pad 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.590
 you have moisten the pad well 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.520
 so we apply at first 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.489
 so with an orientation of 650 laps 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.060
 minute ideally around 1000 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.670
 minute rounds 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.190
 if the polisher allows it you 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.100
 start with moderate pressure on 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.780
 the pad and with movements of 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.880
 8- shaped movements of accor is 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.090
 gradually decrease you the 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.090
 pressure 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.940
 once you have spent well 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.770
 rogram lenses everywhere you in 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.510
 finish are going to pass the police is with 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.250
 a slight pressure it will help 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.030
 finish and after you remove the residue 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.030
 with a cloth 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.560
 just like for the abrasive paste the 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.210
 last residues of anti products 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.889
 hologram without lips have very 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.889
 easily with a microfiber cloth 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.280
 after passing the abrasive paste and the 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.260
 anti hologram treatment on the hood 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.710
 we get a perfect body 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.889
 smooth whose who is ready to receive the 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.889
 treatment
