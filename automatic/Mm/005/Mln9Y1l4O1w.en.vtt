00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Tempranito just started the carnival 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.569
 cajamarquino an impressive volley from 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.970
 utc about the Christian alliance this 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.980
 army of chiroque and so many joys 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.690
 had given the town of andoas and the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.940
 loretana community in general not for the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.279
 surprise but surprising breakthrough that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.810
 had not in the different stages of the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.740
 Peru cup but I think yesterday good 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.480
 with this 7 to 0 that fit is already in 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.220
 condemned and it seems to me that in this case 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.720
 if outside of that cup but see it as 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.369
 peru as it is said openly and I think 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.369
 that here the series is settled not from 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.809
 italy practically with the with the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.430
 access at the end we did not see the first goal 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.010
 of the match of martín copa then it comes 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.510
 this powerful shot of fringe to carry 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.079
 at minute 28 there were two goals 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.790
 followed 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.660
 raul experienced german player 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.570
 I will mark at 37 helium 3 0 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.649
 from 3 to 0 minutes 37 already ends with the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.480
 two we know of any great 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.699
 free kick specialist pompo 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.559
 lamb that puts the 40 2 minutes must 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.899
 only does it with the 40 way 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.629
 new rest the kilo of olga and you 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.920
 for day at minute 67 it becomes again 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.229
 present in the padilla marker 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.270
 again on lemma left us a shot 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.600
 of medium distance in 60 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.009
 in the final part 188 nicolás the with 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.280
 this long distance shot can 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.000
 own the final 7 to 0 which is the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.280
 plant 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.860
 it seems to me that if not that good well no 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.450
 mentioned in the Peruvian Cup can not be 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.789
 give nothing for granted 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.490
 we do not know of results that are given 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.219
 return by difference of 4 to the use of 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.049
 five but one almost catalyst in a 70 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.360
 to a team as experienced as the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.189
 that has made the utc is pretty 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.140
 difficult they wanted to be Christian with these 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.399
 young players that anyway to 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.489
 who must be recognized for merit 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.929
 to have come so far in Peru cup 

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:44.640
 it is quite complicated that they can 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.289
 review if it is a well-known level 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.579
 in differences of schools that 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.619
 jumped in evidence in this key 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.130
 yesterday's eliminator commented to us 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.119
 Bache several that affected party 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.610
 transmission box and that you 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.899
 he wins the match to that Christian 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.819
 basically by the contribution of their 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.159
 lateral rights not that they were with 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.229
 Renzo Guevara red víctor all you 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.179
 they won the duel to their bookmarks 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.729
 the opposites to those of christian and by 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.380
 there you the most forceful service 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.970
 of more powerful rules in attack by 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.540
 This came in achieving goals 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.700
 the act 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.290
 yes good a way 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.390
 sad in which he is saying goodbye 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.580
 well not finally the area to be 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.120
 Christian makes me remember a little bit 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.310
 Peru in the American Cup of Bolivia 97 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.260
 that also advanced well exceeding 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.390
 teams that were paper were favorites 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.420
 rafael but that good finally will continue 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.819
 going in the semifinals with 7 to 0 that and 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.170
 good spot not definitely everything 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.300
 done in the campaign does 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.910
 just in that year in 1997 also 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.220
 was there was actually the last 7 to 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.810
 0 we are already looking at just one 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.340
 national stage this elaboration of the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.799
 final analysis of the cup peru 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.510
 also the last final that as 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.110
 I knew him in class teams not come 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.180
 from Thursday 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.800
 in 98 and then I well effort the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.720
 regular stage not the ones that are played up 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.980
 of that opportunity right now juan 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.160
 aurich who finally consecrated 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.420
 champion he won 7 to 0 to do and there he is 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.090
 moving then you can daniel 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.770
 valderrama i ni mujica luis the rose 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.990
 alejandro pósito adrián penal towers of the 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.100
 Archer Ivan Chaves and finally the 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.720
 carlos the banhvi warrior 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.210
 I liked that final, not with 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.790
 then of want diagonal in the 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.560
 National Stadium 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.880
 the reason does not seem this new 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.880
 system but new realities 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:34.040
 practically 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:35.780
 let's go but people my love yes 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.580
 indeed also richer more 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.320
 colorful I think a triplet that a 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.420
 little saved Spanish 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.770
 from the 70s to the 60s in the 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.450
 decentralized also with people who 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.580
 populated the stadiums from very early 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.010
 to see the triplets not something that 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.990
 I even find it difficult to know 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.210
 repeat again for how it is right now 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.210
 in Peru 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.190
 what is not difficult what does follow 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.140
 watching are the winners year after year 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.270
 for others not every year they look 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.400
 these outrageous outputs but every 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.790
 some time we can find these 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.350
 bulging victories that are not really 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.330
 unexpected especially by the stage 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.190
 national is not that national stage 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
 because good one more level is expected 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.220
 elevated now all teams that 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.930
 participate except 70 yesterday 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.090
 brought up the most thrashing 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.860
 scandalous that there have been in the in the 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.780
 Peruvian Cup and the one that from the stage 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.540
 national and we have seen then we have armed 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.880
 the bolus is ready 19 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.680
 against lions in the semifinals of 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.500
 rematch of the goal but 2000e became 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.420
 as definitely determining that is 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.820
 sure they advance to the final really not 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.340
 it's damage in the year 2000 stays stays 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.530
 a tris to access the final distance 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.090
 he flew in rematch also 05 in 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.470
 how much can we even determine from 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.120
 that key is the most bulky marker 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.690
 until now in the history of the stage 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.670
 national in the global 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:05.450
 and then we have this melgar 80 do in 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.990
 the final of the year 67 and an 80 also 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:12.140
 of more than 80 the Salesians 69 and then 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.540
 is the 70 that we just reviewed the 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.580
 yesterday's game between etc and encourages 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.230
 Christians are the five parties with 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.190
 most scandalous marker in history 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.210
 of the cup peru 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.210
 starting from the national stage
