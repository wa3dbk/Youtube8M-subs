I think that all of them are a little

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.779 
I think that all of them are a little
bit<00:00:24.660> helpful<00:00:24.869> least<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.859> first<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.519> for

it good it didn't taste like linen but

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.340 
it good it didn't taste like linen but
could<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.550> iron<00:02:59.790> anything<00:03:00.450> with<00:03:00.959> that<00:03:00.989> iron

just okay well I think this is just one
example<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:11.520> something<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.270> should

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
example of something that you should

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.789 
example of something that you should
have<00:03:12.750> as<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> perspective<00:03:13.320> as<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.560> go<00:03:13.680> into

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
have as a perspective as you go into

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.680 
have as a perspective as you go into
college<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.459> all<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.910> these<00:03:15.030> hacks<00:03:15.390> that

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
college that all of these hacks that

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.120 
college that all of these hacks that
make<00:03:15.810> up<00:03:15.959> these<00:03:16.080> fun<00:03:16.320> BuzzFeed<00:03:16.769> lists<00:03:17.040> and

everything<00:03:17.430> some<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.030> them<00:03:18.120> are<00:03:18.330> actually

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
everything some of them are actually

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.880 
everything some of them are actually
helpful<00:03:19.140> especially<00:03:19.230> when<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.680> have<00:03:19.769> limited

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
helpful especially when you have limited

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
resources like in a college dorm and so

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.750 
resources like in a college dorm and so

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
it may work with some cops but if a cop

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.620 
it may work with some cops but if a cop
goes<00:04:58.980> up<00:04:59.160> your<00:04:59.340> car<00:04:59.520> and<00:04:59.700> sees<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.450> you've

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
done that I have to imagine they're

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.830 
done that I have to imagine they're
gonna<00:05:02.670> try<00:05:02.850> to<00:05:02.880> get<00:05:03.060> you<00:05:03.180> for<00:05:03.360> something<00:05:03.540> worse

there's<00:05:19.020> a<00:05:19.080> lot<00:05:19.200> of<00:05:19.230> truth<00:05:19.440> to<00:05:19.590> that

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
there's a lot of truth to that

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.050 
there's a lot of truth to that
especially<00:05:20.040> because<00:05:20.400> in<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.640> very<00:05:20.790> beginning

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
especially because in the very beginning

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.960 
especially because in the very beginning
people<00:05:22.010> want<00:05:23.010> to<00:05:23.160> make<00:05:23.340> friends<00:05:23.700> right<00:05:23.820> so

everybody<00:05:24.120> sort<00:05:24.360> of<00:05:24.450> in<00:05:24.540> the<00:05:24.630> same<00:05:24.780> boat<00:05:24.990> and

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
everybody sort of in the same boat and

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.380 
everybody sort of in the same boat and
like<00:05:25.290> feeling<00:05:25.590> sort<00:05:25.980> of<00:05:26.040> disconnected<00:05:26.760> lonely

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
like feeling sort of disconnected lonely

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.720 
like feeling sort of disconnected lonely
like<00:05:27.780> like<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.470> need<00:05:28.650> to<00:05:28.710> find<00:05:28.950> a<00:05:29.070> group<00:05:29.370> right

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
so a lot of people make it a huge effort

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.290 
so a lot of people make it a huge effort
in<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:31.920> very<00:05:32.100> beginning<00:05:32.280> to<00:05:32.730> find<00:05:32.940> that<00:05:33.060> group

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
in the very beginning to find that group

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.600 
in the very beginning to find that group
and<00:05:33.510> then<00:05:33.810> afterwards<00:05:34.350> they<00:05:34.530> they<00:05:35.100> don't<00:05:35.370> so

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
and then afterwards they they don't so

and then afterwards they they don't so
if<00:05:35.700> you're<00:05:35.820> that<00:05:35.940> person<00:05:36.150> you're<00:05:36.390> in<00:05:36.510> the

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
if you're that person you're in the

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.060 
if you're that person you're in the
small<00:05:36.810> minority<00:05:37.470> that<00:05:37.500> didn't<00:05:37.890> make<00:05:37.950> the

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
small minority that didn't make the

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.620 
small minority that didn't make the
effort<00:05:38.100> freshman<00:05:38.790> year<00:05:39.060> you<00:05:39.240> might<00:05:39.360> have<00:05:39.570> a

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
effort freshman year you might have a

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.600 
effort freshman year you might have a
much<00:05:39.870> harder<00:05:40.080> time<00:05:40.260> you're<00:05:41.040> sucking<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.490> air

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
much harder time you're sucking the air

much harder time you're sucking the air
yeah<00:05:41.970> yeah<00:05:42.360> I<00:05:42.570> think<00:05:42.840> that's<00:05:42.990> a<00:05:43.050> great<00:05:43.140> point

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
yeah yeah I think that's a great point
