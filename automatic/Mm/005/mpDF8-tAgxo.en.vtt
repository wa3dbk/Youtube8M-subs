this<00:00:15.900> time<00:00:16.139> from<00:00:16.440> Apulia<00:00:19.850> now<00:00:20.960> this<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.230> is

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
this time from Apulia now this one is

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.679 
this time from Apulia now this one is
about<00:00:22.580> 20-some<00:00:23.580> thousand<00:00:24.029> dollars<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.570> this

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
about 20-some thousand dollars and this

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.640 
about 20-some thousand dollars and this
one<00:00:24.960> was<00:00:25.350> about<00:00:25.740> 70<00:00:26.369> when<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.760> could<00:00:26.910> get<00:00:27.060> one

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
one was about 70 when you could get one

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.300 
one was about 70 when you could get one
so<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.769> thought<00:00:28.920> it'd<00:00:29.070> be<00:00:29.099> interesting

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
