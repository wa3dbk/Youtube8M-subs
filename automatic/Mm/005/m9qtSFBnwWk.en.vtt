00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.199
 I am here because I am the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.829
 it's my nickname 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.899
 the advised price to our realities 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.379
 I'm 35 years old and I'm very soon 26 years old 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.870
 and for a little over two years now I have been ordering on the internet 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.519
 started on these factors 4 because the game was back in 2008 there 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.230
 was to be interested in a maximum of two years in the discipline 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.530
 to interest maximum of people in the discipline it was necessary a game quote on 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.700
 go back in time 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.440
 at the discipline level 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.060
 press what is done by Montreal four well to auxerre society 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.900
 indeed 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.520
 more recently so attractive training 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.370
 spent two years of activity on youtube is part of it I directly 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.610
 very little on the net like that that it allowed me even time I was not 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.560
 a lot at my beginnings 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.979
 to systematically have criticisms it allows to progress if I would have 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.630
 do it all alone with my own judgment by binding for that I 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.380
 follow me 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.200
 well it could never have been really good obviously 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.200
 the opinion of the public the opinion of the life of real criticism 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.009
 on them on the internet but still today a well understood 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.589
 south is far from unanimous 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:20.639
 I am since the age of eight years of detention if it is of course not 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.639
 would be no wonder of his super slouch 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:26.950
 I got right away 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.079
 intoxicated for garcia times 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.809
 the age of 10 I was extremely lucky to receive a candle or at the 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:35.409
 house I fell directly so that on an extraordinary machine that 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.989
 has gone dancing will be in force phenomenal games and the marquette so 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.869
 we can say if the Germans with their heads in their hands 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:45.229
 I have a big period the college of these objects a little stopped at this 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:46.299
 activity 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.469
 finally you take in around two thousand souls 2000 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.009
 for investors in games such as marco pinotti was super 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:54.239
 List viewers 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.849
 and haiti whenever possible will be more and more interested 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.120
 really that is to say not just or even play the game like that for 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.460
 to have fun let me go beyond this stage 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.350
 because I also wanted his powers to the liga subject of the 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.229
 approach what I like 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.499
 give to people ie I was young I really wanted to understand this 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:15.619
 that was going on in the match not obvious that I saw playing really 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:19.369
 dubois after these two games I was able to see on the head of the water 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:23.349
 for internet from 2002 the commentator's control if if that's 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.369
 just flat to animate the video is maybe to explain a little bit everything 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:28.379
 is happening but 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.069
 the data of real interests videos sipa the commentator cease 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.680
 the players themselves that's if the match can even because the commentator and 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.949
 to highlight is precisely the interest of these matches 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.729
 real and real stars the real ones 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.179
 real talents 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.159
 it is only the players of his troops 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.169
 long live the matches 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.190
 more than commentator 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.849
 it's just highlighting too
