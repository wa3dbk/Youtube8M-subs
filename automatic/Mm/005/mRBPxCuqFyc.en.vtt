but 50 subs are a so we want to continue

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.470 
but 50 subs are a so we want to continue
that<00:00:34.350> rate<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:35.070> want<00:00:35.280> continue<00:00:35.760> doing<00:00:36.059> exactly

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
that rate we want continue doing exactly

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.040 
that rate we want continue doing exactly
what<00:00:36.660> we're<00:00:36.930> doing<00:00:37.940> but<00:00:38.940> yeah<00:00:39.360> let's<00:00:39.629> talk

what we're doing but yeah let's talk

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.959 
what we're doing but yeah let's talk
about<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> filter<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:40.950> bit<00:00:41.070> this

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
about the filter a little bit this

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.569 
about the filter a little bit this
filter<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.899> my<00:00:43.050> 26<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.190> water<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.550> crystal

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
filter is on my 26 the water is crystal

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.540 
filter is on my 26 the water is crystal
clear<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:46.320> he's<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.010> adding<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.489> his

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
clear so he's going to be adding to his

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.510 
clear so he's going to be adding to his
25<00:00:48.020> it's<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:50.460> solid<00:00:50.670> filter<00:00:51.120> um

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
25 it's just a it's a solid filter um

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.310 
25 it's just a it's a solid filter um
but<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.670> got<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> problem<00:00:54.120> today<00:00:54.649> we<00:00:55.649> unboxed<00:00:56.219> it

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
but we got a problem today we unboxed it

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:05.090 
but we got a problem today we unboxed it
the<00:00:58.320> primer<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.070> was<00:00:59.219> broken<00:01:00.079> see<00:01:03.439> ya<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.890> can

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the primer it was broken see ya you can

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.490 
the primer it was broken see ya you can
click<00:01:05.460> right<00:01:05.519> there<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.780> it's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
click right there and then just it's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.039 
click right there and then just it's
just<00:01:07.650> empty<00:01:07.979> into<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> filter<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.750> would

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
just empty into the filter so it would

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.250 
just empty into the filter so it would
leak<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:11.430> wouldn't<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:11.909> started<00:01:12.479> so

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
leak and it wouldn't get started so

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.249 
leak and it wouldn't get started so
unfortunately<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.369> has<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.760> returned

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
unfortunately that has to be returned

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.690 
unfortunately that has to be returned
but<00:01:16.259> wilson<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:16.799> still<00:01:17.040> bust<00:01:17.250> out<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> little

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
but wilson will still bust out a little

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.600 
but wilson will still bust out a little
video<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.689> guys<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:21.080> canisters<00:01:22.610> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
video for you guys but on canisters the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.780 
video for you guys but on canisters the
filtration<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> ton<00:01:25.229> better<00:01:25.590> than<00:01:26.400> hang<00:01:26.640> on

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
filtration is a ton better than hang on

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.499 
filtration is a ton better than hang on
bad<00:01:27.210> filters<00:01:27.659> um<00:01:28.400> hang<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.520> back<00:01:29.759> they<00:01:30.270> just

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
bad filters um hang on back they just

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.929 
bad filters um hang on back they just
have<00:01:30.659> less<00:01:30.900> stages<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.619> filtration<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
have less stages of filtration it's a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.140 
have less stages of filtration it's a
less<00:01:33.119> thorough<00:01:33.540> filtration<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.880> it's<00:01:35.880> just

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
less thorough filtration and it's just

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.910 
less thorough filtration and it's just
not<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> same<00:01:36.960> standards<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
more of a true gallons per hour a more

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.480 
more of a true gallons per hour a more
true<00:01:46.950> flow<00:01:47.540> high<00:01:48.540> flow<00:01:49.020> rate<00:01:49.490> better

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
true flow high flow rate better

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.940 
true flow high flow rate better
filtration<00:01:51.119> overall<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.460> trust<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
filtration overall it's you can trust it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.510 
filtration overall it's you can trust it
tight<00:01:55.950> I'll<00:01:56.689> say<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.920> trust<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.399> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
tight I'll say you can trust it to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.359 
tight I'll say you can trust it to
filter<00:02:00.079> what<00:02:01.079> needs<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.500> filtered<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.130> it

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
filter what needs to be filtered if it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.969 
filter what needs to be filtered if it
can<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.060> says<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.630> filter<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> 45<00:02:04.590> gallon

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
can if it says it can filter a 45 gallon

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.940 
can if it says it can filter a 45 gallon
it<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.969> filter<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> 45<00:02:06.780> gallon<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.770> might

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
it can filter a 45 gallon but you might

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.790 
it can filter a 45 gallon but you might
want<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.310> still<00:02:08.670> upgrade<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.270> next

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
want to still upgrade to the next

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.370 
want to still upgrade to the next
sure<00:02:09.890> but<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:11.000> true<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.720> flow<00:02:11.960> is<00:02:12.020> much

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
sure but the true the flow is much

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.510 
sure but the true the flow is much
better<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:14.350> it's<00:02:15.350> much<00:02:15.950> better<00:02:16.160> for<00:02:16.310> your

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
better and it's much better for your

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.920 
better and it's much better for your
fish<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.810> look<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.350> aquarium<00:02:18.830> um<00:02:19.220> uh

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
fish and the look of the aquarium um uh

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.380 
fish and the look of the aquarium um uh
/<00:02:20.930> filtration<00:02:21.830> is<00:02:21.980> also<00:02:22.370> better<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:23.120> why<00:02:23.360> i

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
/ filtration is also better that's why i

we're most most on hang on backs have

we're most most on hang on backs have

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
one maybe two so you definitely want to

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.069 
one maybe two so you definitely want to

look into cancers of you

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.710 
look into cancers of you
ever<00:04:21.229> tried<00:04:21.919> on<00:04:22.099> before<00:04:22.280> I'm<00:04:23.180> sure<00:04:23.419> a<00:04:23.449> lot<00:04:23.539> of

ever tried on before I'm sure a lot of

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.999 
ever tried on before I'm sure a lot of
you<00:04:23.870> have<00:04:24.080> but<00:04:24.580> it's<00:04:25.580> solid<00:04:26.360> it's<00:04:27.009> unfortunate

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
you have but it's solid it's unfortunate

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.730 
you have but it's solid it's unfortunate
that<00:04:28.039> this<00:04:28.280> has<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.610> be<00:04:28.699> returned<00:04:29.060> but<00:04:29.740> another

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
that this has to be returned but another

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.379 
that this has to be returned but another
one<00:04:30.979> hopefully<00:04:31.669> would<00:04:31.789> become<00:04:32.150> in<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.330> few<00:04:32.539> days

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
one hopefully would become in a few days

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.189 
one hopefully would become in a few days
also<00:04:35.389> so<00:04:35.569> you<00:04:35.629> won't<00:04:35.870> read<00:04:36.080> instead<00:04:36.560> of<00:04:36.830> carbon

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
also so you won't read instead of carbon

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.339 
also so you won't read instead of carbon
your<00:04:39.199> juicy<00:04:39.919> champion<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:41.780> does<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.020> better<00:04:42.229> job

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
your juicy champion it does a better job

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.429 
your juicy champion it does a better job
in<00:04:42.680> carbon<00:04:43.129> and<00:04:43.639> it<00:04:43.939> is<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.719> might<00:04:44.990> be<00:04:45.139> a<00:04:45.169> myth

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:45.439 
in carbon and it is it might be a myth

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.749 
in carbon and it is it might be a myth
but<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.919> said<00:04:46.159> that<00:04:46.189> carbon<00:04:46.819> removes<00:04:46.969> some<00:04:47.740> on
