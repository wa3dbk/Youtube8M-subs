 yeah talking about hotel it's crazy 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.220

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.819
 video games in games in the slightest 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.560
 town 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.780
 even though in the village there are two 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.420
 houses of three pnj a dog there is a 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.800
 hotel by the way I know we are trying 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.750
 both like dogs in general 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.800
 but I tell you in general they 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.349

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.119

 is there the day never sleeps 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.130
 so who said too much no I like 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.110
 hotels when you've done too much 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.209
 smashed like you are three years between the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.250
 word plaster he is dislocated and beaten sleeps 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.479
 at the hotel and bassa are all 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.819
 frankly you have an illness 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.950
 incurable that even house hip hop dr 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.360
 quarry kind ray mission impossible 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.430
 you go to the hotel you talk to 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.470
 guys who do not sleep and bim you're cured 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.750
 the hotel is a bit of a breakdown at every 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.860
 times hello I would like to take a 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.760
 room because I have an affection 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.860
 incurable 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.980
 okay you pay in cash without 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.470
 card i have my life card i'm at the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.920
 cmu was the third party paying 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.690
 she's real real life hotel 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.880
 in truth he does not care and if what we have 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.030
 read the price that it costs but the worst 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.450
 do not even suggest you back up 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.890
 to say that would be weird yes sir 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.489
 the hotel i would like to register my 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.190
 progression 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.140
 of course sir I'm listening to you then 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.450
 I was born very young in Upper Normandy 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.250
 but I do not remember when 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.650
 I was 4 years ago Frederic Besnard 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.019
 he was beating me and he told me 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.800
 release you're useless we get stuck 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.660
 touch anything or so I would you it would 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.310
 a little long anyway 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.310
 and after you go to bed and there you have 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.200
 always the famous little music that 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.940
 pass when you fall asleep but in real 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.940
 frankly that would be too good mouko 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.190
 no but it's true in the games there are 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.170
 always music but that's who 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.170
 who plays it why we do not see them 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.099
 damn it was music 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.489
 extradiÃ©gÃ©tique we j'mets do chopper 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.489
 of diet 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.840
 the trainee he had stayed but just 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.520
 not why she had the party if you 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.580
 watch this video is that I have 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.290
 managed to climb alone 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.910
 yeah no but basically it was too much 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.080
 not won the computer he made me a 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.480
 blue screen of death 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.890
 after he asked me do you want 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.060
 start in serious safe mode it 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.340
 there is a safe mode 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.540
 that means that the normal mode is the 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.940
 failed mode 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.920
 no, but when did they say 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.570
 then we will do two modes the mode 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.010
 with failure and safe mode but the 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.380
 normal base mode this will be the mode 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.580
 failure 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.470
 No, but it's too stupid 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.510
 maybe I come back to the hotels 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.370
 so the last time I went 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.240
 in a hotel it was to go to the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.510
 japan expo 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.280
 this is a very subtle second transition and 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.830
 well how there was too much cosplay 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.820
 I like cosplay prevents the 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.910
 times are there they look too much 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.770
 awesome batman kind too dark or 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.390
 too mystical sephiroth tos not their 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.850
 talk and then when you hear them 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.200
 speak then I'm happy that 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.330
 because I find a character enough 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.250
 charismatic it works well but the 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.950
 chicks ah yeah I admit that we 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.050
 cease times they are really not 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.700
 so much a ticket what anyway the 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.410
 cosplays it's mostly an excuse for 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.270
 them a little alluring everyone with 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.400
 more or less subtlety and elegance 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.780
 even helpless guys there are some 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.910
 do that just to show their muscles 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.780
 all year long they are holding back and there 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.669
 it's the disguise 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.190
 go ahead I dances you every 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.090
 muscles that I have what web in kratos me 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.669
 I like how he is 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.190
 psychologically it's a character 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.290
 complex that with many facets as 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.550
 well as smoking areas close enough to the 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.860
 refreshments have there I when you backed up 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.240
 like the beach character and inspires the 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.750
 Cosplay is the right plan to get 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.940
 value 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.280
 except that sometimes we 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.470
 not too what what nick you I am 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.840
 wolverine of the is anyway and I am 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.550
 wild 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.100
 yeah that was a bit my favorite 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.600
 it's both funny and embarrassing a little 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.370
 like a child who gets hurt 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.910
 that's it for me if you liked 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.560
 you can love and otherwise you can 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.720
 to share so that other people they 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.210
 love and this a lot of people like 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.050
 after I will be kony and maybe I 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.050
 will be in an ad 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:08.370
 o o 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.690
 I am a little strong anyway 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.980
 could make music videos 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.980
 as the dreamer dreams
