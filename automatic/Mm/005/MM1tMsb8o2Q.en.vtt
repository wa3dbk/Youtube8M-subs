00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.010
 the application reads only two formats 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.130
 this is both pdf 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.010

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.150
 it's pretty quick to make money 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.520
 change orientation 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.850
 With the help of the lock button we will help 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.910
 locked as you see orientation 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.450
 preserved 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.739
 there we can 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.820
 adjust the brightness level here 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.670
 two fingers autocrat lead 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.410
 brightness is added 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.390
 if down the brightness decreases 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.840
 also possible on p long stage on words

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.810
 Nothing is accidental sata ports from art I give 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.310
 and also it is possible on Parnassus we do not know 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.100
 What is this word 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.480
 we can search his services boil stated 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.000
 in the Internet 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000

 open the draft federal budget 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.440
 This is the only concert in which I 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.310
 was 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.350
 she is 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.170
 on hand but actually this file 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.990
 contains four thousand page you 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.500
 can see how fast everything works 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.990
 program support process copes 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.630
 just great 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.219
 can also be approached removed 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.440

 I am very comfortable reading room 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.470
 and in other more convenient will take that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.409
 this is a reader 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.419
 the fact is that if you use and 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:16.729
 amazonian 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.259
 e-book readers 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.609
 who can you sync 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:22.799
 reading process 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.820
 for example if you read on books 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.330
 and then you could continue the scene with 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.739
 same moment 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.819
 on your mobile device 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.030
 programs called amazon kim usd 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.659
 and you can download it for free icq 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.219
 the second application is called he tab 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.859
 glorification is a reflection by 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.159
 one click virtually you can 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.119

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.559
 it may be 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:51.689
 Of course all applications can be 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.089
 call history 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.509
 this is the most history of your browser 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:00.109
 and also search would help the player on others 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.079
 places

 can clear the memory card that same 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:09.199
 convenient but 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.639
 find now the android folder in which we 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.649
 and save all application cache 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:18.019
 but is serving what we are removing applications 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.069
 maklish remains here this program red 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.679
 font marked 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.339

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.899
 tick 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:30.029

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:00.839
 and on which it is very convenient to exhibit 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:04.089
 call time but no 15 45 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.499
 in May we will often leave the alarm for 15 46 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.759
 if we have time of course set 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.529

 waiting for 15 46 look at the construction site that we can 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.349

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.409
 have a nap colors turn repeat 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:41.159
 after three days 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:43.800

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.889

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.509
 understandably 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.050
 also here there is a setting that we 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.990
 can we 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.130
 tick and embed 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.860
 turning the phone over 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.729
 with the help there dacha approximate sti of

 doze a great alarm clock 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.080
 the main thing is that it is convenient to exhibit 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.979
 time you can create several boutiques 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.770

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.199
 beautiful 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.620
 recent applications called up dollars 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.430
 funds this app helps you keep track 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.919
 for statistics 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.629
 that is, you will see how much 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.100
 megabytes of traffic you spent 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.260
 how many minutes did you talk and how many 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.090
 SMS you have a look 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.840
 at the construction site what can we do 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.919
 can do 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.060
 so we have it all displayed 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.159
 notifications in this way 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.229
 but I don't like it very much 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:50.300

 the very same we are building various exceptions 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.639
 add here for example here's a goal 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.999
 if some number then it will not be considered 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.180
 go back 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.610
 dad look further we can tune in 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.520
 tariff plan settings 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.349
 that is, how much we 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.969
 ha must in a month and not exceed the limit 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:17.509

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.089
 I do not know anyone there can market together 

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:22.689
 allow only one gigabyte dynamo cues 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:24.909
 the program will warn it if we 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:26.279
 will it exceed 100 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.739
 in the same with calls and message 

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:32.080

 handed down to individual tap you can 

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:34.789
 look 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:37.369
 In principle, this one is very comfortable. 

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:40.490
 occupies one cell only them all in 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.009
