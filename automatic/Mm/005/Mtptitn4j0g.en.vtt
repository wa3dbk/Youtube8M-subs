 adaro 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.020
 good afternoon friends of the movement avoid for red and we are in the field of 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.829
 chiriqui 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.529
 and I'm going to show you the basics 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.529
 to fly helicopters 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.359
 first of all it is important to turn on the control before he the helicopter 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.970
 then we lose control once I learned the control and we checked that 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.420
 we have the right model of the cost in the control we proceed to turn on the 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.180
 helicopter we connect the battery 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.690
 the battery has to wait at least 1 2 seconds before it has gone 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.700
 is activated and can work well 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.170
 we proceed love by lifting the antenna 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.170
 the one that without antenna nova run signal the helicopter with 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.880
 very little night back 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.440
 and we started little by little to give the accelerator so that the helicopter 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.440
 Vallejo who did not resign 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.190
 once helicopter in which he pulled out of revolutions 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.210
 It is always important to have the tail facing you 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.710
 6 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.020
 While the tail is looking like this, the controls on the left and 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.650
 right they will always keep the left and the right remember that what 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.790
 which is driving to 15 on the left and right of the helicopter news of 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.640
 straight 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.930
 since if the helicopter is facing 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.770
 base to remain the left the helicopter which has been able to do the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.770
 right if you have to be very careful savior 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.400
 At first you have to concentrate on maintaining a stable flight 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.580
 that we had a lot that does not go down much and that does not move much towards the sides 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.320
 that does it by means of the controls 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.320
 efe the fidel elevator and the spoiler 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.329
 once he masters that 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.329
 we proceed to do some more advanced maneuvers 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:16.249
 elevating just from the floor at the beginning can keep you a foot off the floor thing 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.089
 that if you have any problems you can lower the helicopter level without having 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.419
 no mishap 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.419
 after this we can raise not a little more 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.239
 now we proceed to make another maneuver that we are nov xinhua 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.489
 this consists of the fact that the helicopter completely in front of you 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.680
 which makes the left and right controls or the elevator change from 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.199
 left direction 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.519
 left you do not do the same left and helicopters so you have 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.519
 be aware of that 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:04.459
 good friend that would be all 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.829
 as for the basics 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.889
 d for the helicopter flight this looks simple but requires a lot 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.349
 practice 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.549
 and work hours 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.769
 Approve once 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.769
 to the practice session it is always important to keep in mind 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.939
 the order of the helicopter compost shutdown must always approve 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:25.199
 first the helicopter 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:29.929
 disconnecting the Mexican from what is actually totally uninhabited 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:34.279
 and then proceeds to disconnect the remote control to good friend of jovenmanÃ­a 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:37.999
 I hope this with zero units served to improve your rocket flight 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:38.209
