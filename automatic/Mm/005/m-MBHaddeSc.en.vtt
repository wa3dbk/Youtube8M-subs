00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 about everything in order to prevent 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.330
 flood in the south of Kazakhstan was 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.460
 impossible about it today in the country 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.910
 declared the main rescuer of the country, Vladimir 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.250
 god 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.559
 Slavic area where I flooded immediately 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.910
 several villages are ongoing 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.369
 elimination of consequences 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.350
 Dozens of rescue workers work in the region. 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.000
 teams and and special equipment at the same time 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.980
 it turned out that with the onset of heat 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.320
 some more regions may flood 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.900
 country artem petrov appreciated the degree 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.850
 the imminent danger is still recently completely 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.100
 flooded and village Kyzylorda 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.989
 areas today look quite 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.120
 differently after the flood in 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.309
 affected area has become colder and 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.820
 boobs streets turned into solid 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.980
 rink 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.350
 villagers do not move away from their homes there 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.329
 danger of falling under the ice of cattle 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.719
 Now, many do not keep barns and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.719
 roofs 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.370
 Yaga foundation our coat of arms here see the water 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.649
 broke down the foundation fell my barn 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.809
 Now we pray the main thing that the house stood 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.820
 on site we fortified not from houses 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.769
 we carry clay there but if it rains 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.720
 we will stay homeless 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.600
 And some villagers are already literally home. 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.970
 bursting at the seams here is a powerful water pressure 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.460
 blured the foundation of the building tilted 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.100
 truly cracked the house only miraculously not 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.439
 collapsed develop wives never 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.090
 thought that this could never happen 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.490
 it was not good that no one 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.680
 family safety suffered but soon 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.829
 again it will get warmer and worse 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.540
 so as not to get worse, sand falls asleep 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.579
 not only the streets of this village but also 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.920

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.869

 25 trucks are working two 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.659
 loader 2 excavator handlers we 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.939

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.590
