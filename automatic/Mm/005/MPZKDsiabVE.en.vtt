00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
cottage and my trees I took a Stickles

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.930 
cottage and my trees I took a Stickles
which<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.649> icicle<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> color

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
which is icicle I think it's the color

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.930 
which is icicle I think it's the color
of<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.510> while<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.290> still<00:00:40.500> wet<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.950> put<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
of it and while it was still wet I put a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.420 
of it and while it was still wet I put a
white<00:00:42.750> glittered<00:00:43.290> embossing<00:00:43.649> powder<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
white glittered embossing powder on the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
white glittered embossing powder on the
trees<00:00:44.750> heated<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.410> bit

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
trees heated it up just a little bit

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.040 
trees heated it up just a little bit
with<00:00:46.620> my<00:00:46.739> heat<00:00:46.950> tool<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.690> until<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.780> started

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
with my heat tool and until it started

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.660 
with my heat tool and until it started
just<00:00:49.260> started<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> blister<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
just started to blister and then I

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.819 
just started to blister and then I
stopped<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.960> because<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.500> let<00:00:52.649> it

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
stopped it because if you let it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.770 
stopped it because if you let it
blister<00:00:53.309> too<00:00:53.579> much<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.329> flake

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
blister too much it will actually flake

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.049 
blister too much it will actually flake
off<00:00:55.020> once<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.469> dry<00:00:55.710> then<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.489> set<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.910> aside

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
off once it's dry then I set that aside

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.849 
off once it's dry then I set that aside
and<00:00:57.329> let<00:00:57.390> those<00:00:57.600> dry<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.199> then<00:00:58.410> later<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.710> that

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and let those dry and then later on that

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.130 
and let those dry and then later on that
I<00:00:59.039> will<00:00:59.219> assemble<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.640> actual<00:01:00.059> picture<00:01:00.449> but

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
I will assemble the actual picture but

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.529 
I will assemble the actual picture but
to<00:01:01.289> give<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.680> snow<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.550> look<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.420> it's

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
to give the snow the look I have or it's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.719 
to give the snow the look I have or it's
kind<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.989> torn<00:01:04.530> locust<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> did<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.700> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
kind of that torn locust what I did is I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.300 
kind of that torn locust what I did is I
took<00:01:05.880> some<00:01:06.270> white<00:01:06.479> glittery<00:01:07.380> paper<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.189> I

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
took some white glittery paper and I

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.340 
took some white glittery paper and I
just<00:01:08.549> tore<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.790> edges<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.080> gives<00:01:10.229> us

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
just tore the edges so that it gives us

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.570 
just tore the edges so that it gives us
that<00:01:10.880> rough<00:01:11.880> edge<00:01:12.060> look<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:14.010> now<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.400> set

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
that rough edge look so now I can set

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.910 
that rough edge look so now I can set
that<00:01:14.729> aside<00:01:15.290> then<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.939> make<00:01:17.939> my<00:01:17.970> window<00:01:18.750> my<00:01:19.619> snow

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that aside then I make my window my snow

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.300 
that aside then I make my window my snow
globe<00:01:20.130> windows<00:01:21.140> first<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.380> cut<00:01:22.590> 2<00:01:22.920> sheets<00:01:23.220> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
globe windows first it's cut 2 sheets of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.190 
globe windows first it's cut 2 sheets of
acetate<00:01:23.520> paper<00:01:24.150> which<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.540> cut<00:01:24.750> slightly

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
acetate paper which is cut slightly

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.450 
acetate paper which is cut slightly
larger<00:01:26.009> than<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.880> actual<00:01:27.060> window<00:01:27.659> itself<00:01:28.460> so

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
larger than the actual window itself so

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.219 
larger than the actual window itself so
that<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.909> put<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> glue<00:01:30.420> down<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> sides

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that I can put the glue down the sides

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.370 
that I can put the glue down the sides
and<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.560> won't<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.890> seen<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.400> window<00:01:33.350> but<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
dimensional tape a double-sided tape on

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.160 
dimensional tape a double-sided tape on
there<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.009> cut<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.280> strips<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:42.990> real

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
there and I cut it strips so it's real

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.960 
there and I cut it strips so it's real
small<00:01:43.409> strips<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:43.920> they<00:01:44.009> won't<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.310> seen<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.880> I

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
leaking out if it does leak out then you

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.990 
leaking out if it does leak out then you
need<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.709> repair<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.220> pull<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.520> apart<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.970> little
