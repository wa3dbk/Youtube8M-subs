is already run so then it can get all
these<00:01:31.229> files<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.950> then<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:32.970> run<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
these files and then you just run the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.710 
these files and then you just run the
