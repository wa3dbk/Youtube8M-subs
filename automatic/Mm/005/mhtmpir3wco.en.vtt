00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
offensive team of the year because we're

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:23.910

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
team and then after this I don't think

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.449 
team and then after this I don't think
any<00:03:26.260> better<00:03:26.500> cards<00:03:26.800> would<00:03:26.860> be<00:03:26.920> coming<00:03:27.220> out<00:03:27.310> so
