00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.410
 appearance also allows you to put the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.860
 color of the theme that I have it in blue 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.410
 because my theme is blue 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.730
 and hides the application rod or in those of 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.340

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.019

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.960
 see tweets about soccer creates a filter and 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.460
 you avoid those tweets too for 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.440
 block users in case someone has 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.920
