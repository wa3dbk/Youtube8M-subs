00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
simple packaging nothing too outlandish

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.030 
simple packaging nothing too outlandish
out<00:04:11.859> of<00:04:12.099> the<00:04:12.220> way<00:04:12.370> but<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:14.290> cable<00:04:14.650> seems<00:04:14.889> like

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
out of the way but the cable seems like

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.860 
out of the way but the cable seems like
it's<00:04:15.220> pretty<00:04:15.370> long<00:04:15.639> as<00:04:15.819> well<00:04:16.090> just<00:04:16.479> go<00:04:16.630> in<00:04:16.720> and

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
it's pretty long as well just go in and

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.689 
it's pretty long as well just go in and
get<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:17.079> some<00:04:17.259> tag<00:04:17.560> little<00:04:17.889> quick<00:04:19.349> twisty<00:04:20.349> ties

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.710 

this<00:04:24.699> is<00:04:24.849> good<00:04:25.030> for<00:04:25.150> some<00:04:25.330> time<00:04:25.479> when<00:04:25.599> you

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
this is good for some time when you

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.120 
this is good for some time when you
don't<00:04:25.930> want<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.139> game<00:04:26.349> with<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.650> headset<00:04:26.949> on

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
don't want to game with the headset on

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.890 
don't want to game with the headset on
then<00:04:27.759> you<00:04:27.880> just<00:04:28.120> want<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.360> be<00:04:28.509> able<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.750> you

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
then you just want to be able to you

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.570 
then you just want to be able to you
know<00:04:28.990> game<00:04:29.229> via<00:04:29.440> TV<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:29.979> have<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.099> headset<00:04:30.520> on
