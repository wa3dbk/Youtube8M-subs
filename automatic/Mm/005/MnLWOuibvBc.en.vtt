for<00:02:52.470> example<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.310> rotavator<00:02:53.760> attachment

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
for example the rotavator attachment

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.780 
for example the rotavator attachment
will<00:02:54.690> be<00:02:54.780> used<00:02:55.050> in<00:02:55.320> first<00:02:55.620> gear<00:02:55.980> whilst<00:02:56.580> the

side may be used in second or third

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.730 
side may be used in second or third
third<00:02:59.400> gear<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.880> a<00:02:59.910> good<00:03:00.180> walking<00:03:00.390> speed<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.650> if

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
third gear is a good walking speed so if

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.740 
third gear is a good walking speed so if
you<00:03:01.800> have<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> large<00:03:02.280> area<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.760> cut<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:03.630> the

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
you have a large area to cut with the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.110 
you have a large area to cut with the
flail<00:03:03.990> or<00:03:04.170> side<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:04.710> example<00:03:04.770> you'll<00:03:05.640> get<00:03:05.850> the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
flail or side for example you'll get the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.910 
flail or side for example you'll get the
job<00:03:06.330> done<00:03:06.510> quickly<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.050> efficiently<00:03:07.470> to
