to be testing the edmee English IPA we
brewed<00:00:10.190> we<00:00:11.190> did<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.490> with<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.809> can<00:00:13.080> kit

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
brewed we did this with the this can kit

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.060 
brewed we did this with the this can kit
and<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.299> was<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.450> two<00:00:15.599> pounds<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.350> dry<00:00:16.890> malt

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and the was it two pounds of dry malt

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.820 
and the was it two pounds of dry malt
extract<00:00:17.359> unhooked<00:00:18.380> this<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> one<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.770> we

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
extract unhooked this is the one that we

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.349 
extract unhooked this is the one that we
decided<00:00:20.279> not<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.460> add<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.880> hops<00:00:21.029> because<00:00:21.270> I

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
decided not to add the hops because I

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.509 
decided not to add the hops because I
thought<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.990> extract<00:00:22.949> itself<00:00:23.310> was

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
thought that the extract itself was

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.859 
thought that the extract itself was
pretty<00:00:23.550> happy<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.330> let's<00:00:25.199> see<00:00:25.350> how<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.560> goes

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
pretty happy so let's see how it goes

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.840 
carbonation doesn't have hot much much
smell<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.780> it

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:02:07.140 

let's<00:01:44.510> give<00:01:44.659> it<00:01:44.689> a<00:01:44.780> taste

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.920 

okay<00:02:09.280> in<00:02:10.280> flavor<00:02:11.090> it's<00:02:11.480> actually<00:02:11.900> very

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
okay in flavor it's actually very

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.180 
okay in flavor it's actually very
similar<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.830> Cooper's<00:02:13.280> draft<00:02:13.640> kit<00:02:15.190> it's

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
similar to the Cooper's draft kit it's

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.400 
similar to the Cooper's draft kit it's
got<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.340> little<00:02:16.490> bit<00:02:16.640> more<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:19.900> think<00:02:20.900> it's

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
got a little bit more of a I think it's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.210 
got a little bit more of a I think it's
a<00:02:21.530> hoppy<00:02:21.950> type<00:02:22.400> by<00:02:22.610> it's<00:02:22.850> more<00:02:23.000> like<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:24.220> an

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
a hoppy type by it's more like that an

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.650 
a hoppy type by it's more like that an
attack<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.790> your<00:02:25.970> tongue<00:02:26.150> if<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.480> makes

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
attack on your tongue if that makes

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.150 
attack on your tongue if that makes
sense<00:02:26.840> it's<00:02:27.140> um<00:02:28.300> it's<00:02:29.300> it's<00:02:30.020> not<00:02:30.290> super<00:02:30.950> hoppy

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
sense it's um it's it's not super hoppy

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.340 
sense it's um it's it's not super hoppy
which<00:02:31.550> is<00:02:31.670> good<00:02:31.850> for<00:02:31.880> me<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.210> don't<00:02:32.840> like<00:02:32.960> super

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
which is good for me I don't like super

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:41.150 
which is good for me I don't like super

know<00:05:56.789> about<00:05:56.909> I<00:05:57.120> don't<00:05:57.330> know<00:05:57.539> because<00:05:57.990> it<00:05:58.139> does

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
know about I don't know because it does

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.230 
know about I don't know because it does
say<00:05:58.470> here<00:05:58.500> it<00:05:58.800> says<00:05:58.979> hop<00:05:59.250> extract<00:05:59.729> in<00:06:00.120> the

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
say here it says hop extract in the

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.500 
say here it says hop extract in the
ingredients<00:06:00.750> so<00:06:01.229> I<00:06:01.260> don't<00:06:01.440> know<00:06:01.530> if<00:06:01.590> they<00:06:01.710> used

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
ingredients so I don't know if they used

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.990 
ingredients so I don't know if they used
I'm<00:06:03.510> assumin<00:06:03.990> eased<00:06:04.169> Hopsin<00:06:04.770> in<00:06:05.039> this<00:06:05.310> part<00:06:05.940> of

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
I'm assumin eased Hopsin in this part of

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.250 
I'm assumin eased Hopsin in this part of
it<00:06:06.120> for<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.330> bittering<00:06:06.659> but<00:06:06.810> I<00:06:06.840> don't<00:06:07.080> know

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
it for the bittering but I don't know

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.279 
it for the bittering but I don't know
with<00:06:07.500> a<00:06:07.530> hop<00:06:07.710> extract<00:06:08.010> if<00:06:08.909> you<00:06:09.090> guys<00:06:09.240> have<00:06:09.630> any

with a hop extract if you guys have any

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:11.959 
with a hop extract if you guys have any

below<00:06:12.239> that<00:06:13.049> be<00:06:13.409> interesting<00:06:13.559> to<00:06:13.889> figure<00:06:14.099> out

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
below that be interesting to figure out

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:17.689 
below that be interesting to figure out
but<00:06:15.409> but<00:06:16.409> yeah<00:06:16.559> like<00:06:16.889> I<00:06:16.919> said<00:06:17.129> it's<00:06:17.309> a<00:06:17.459> it's

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
but but yeah like I said it's a it's

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:19.309 
but but yeah like I said it's a it's
pretty<00:06:17.909> good<00:06:18.059> brew<00:06:18.269> if<00:06:18.449> i<00:06:18.599> were<00:06:18.719> to<00:06:18.869> brew<00:06:19.169> this

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 
pretty good brew if i were to brew this

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.559 
pretty good brew if i were to brew this
one<00:06:19.499> again<00:06:19.619> I<00:06:19.919> may<00:06:20.189> actually<00:06:20.429> add<00:06:20.849> a<00:06:20.879> splash<00:06:21.239> of

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569 
one again I may actually add a splash of

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:26.089 
one again I may actually add a splash of
a<00:06:21.829> Roma<00:06:22.829> hops<00:06:23.039> at<00:06:23.309> the<00:06:23.699> end<00:06:23.819> of<00:06:24.739> if<00:06:25.739> i<00:06:25.889> did<00:06:26.069> a

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
a Roma hops at the end of if i did a

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.959 
a Roma hops at the end of if i did a
boil<00:06:26.339> on<00:06:27.679> you<00:06:28.679> could<00:06:28.860> probably<00:06:29.099> make<00:06:29.489> this<00:06:29.549> kit

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:29.969 
boil on you could probably make this kit

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.119 
boil on you could probably make this kit
very<00:06:30.239> similar<00:06:30.749> to<00:06:30.779> the<00:06:31.049> Cooper's<00:06:31.649> kits<00:06:31.949> where

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:32.129 
very similar to the Cooper's kits where

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:33.979 
very similar to the Cooper's kits where
you<00:06:32.219> just<00:06:32.369> use<00:06:32.579> like<00:06:32.610> boiled<00:06:33.059> water<00:06:33.239> and<00:06:33.599> then

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:33.989 
you just use like boiled water and then

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:36.889 
you just use like boiled water and then
just<00:06:34.110> top<00:06:34.319> it<00:06:34.349> off<00:06:34.559> with<00:06:35.069> cold<00:06:35.129> you<00:06:35.759> know<00:06:35.909> or

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:36.899 
just top it off with cold you know or

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:40.159 
just top it off with cold you know or
you<00:06:37.199> could<00:06:37.379> do<00:06:37.589> a<00:06:37.619> boil<00:06:37.949> and<00:06:38.189> add<00:06:38.489> the<00:06:39.169> extra

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
you could do a boil and add the extra

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.809 
you could do a boil and add the extra
bittering<00:06:40.889> hops<00:06:40.919> at<00:06:41.219> the<00:06:41.309> beginning<00:06:41.639> and

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 
bittering hops at the beginning and

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:43.850 
bittering hops at the beginning and
aroma<00:06:42.360> hops<00:06:42.509> at<00:06:42.719> the<00:06:42.839> end<00:06:42.959> and<00:06:43.139> I<00:06:43.469> think<00:06:43.709> that

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
aroma hops at the end and I think that

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.989 
aroma hops at the end and I think that
you'd<00:06:43.979> get<00:06:44.279> you<00:06:44.819> get<00:06:44.999> a<00:06:45.029> much<00:06:45.179> happier<00:06:45.479> brew<00:06:46.439> um

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:46.999 
you'd get you get a much happier brew um

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:49.639 
you'd get you get a much happier brew um
but<00:06:47.999> yeah<00:06:48.779> you<00:06:49.079> know<00:06:49.199> I<00:06:49.229> would<00:06:49.439> almost

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:49.649 
but yeah you know I would almost

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:51.919 
but yeah you know I would almost
recommend<00:06:50.129> not<00:06:50.579> doing<00:06:50.639> that<00:06:51.089> for<00:06:51.599> the<00:06:51.629> first

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:51.929 
recommend not doing that for the first

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:54.529 
recommend not doing that for the first
time<00:06:52.829> you<00:06:53.009> go<00:06:53.159> around<00:06:53.369> with<00:06:53.519> this<00:06:53.669> just<00:06:54.179> to<00:06:54.329> see

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 
time you go around with this just to see

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.689 
time you go around with this just to see
if<00:06:54.839> it's<00:06:55.199> getting<00:06:55.409> the<00:06:55.799> hop<00:06:56.009> notes<00:06:56.309> that<00:06:56.579> you

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.699 
if it's getting the hop notes that you

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.100 
if it's getting the hop notes that you
want<00:06:56.939> I<00:06:58.039> found<00:06:59.039> that<00:06:59.189> that's<00:06:59.399> kind<00:06:59.669> of<00:06:59.789> a<00:07:00.110> real

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
want I found that that's kind of a real

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.779 
want I found that that's kind of a real
touchy<00:07:01.319> thing<00:07:01.589> when<00:07:01.739> it<00:07:01.860> comes<00:07:02.069> to<00:07:02.339> the<00:07:02.549> canned

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:02.789 
touchy thing when it comes to the canned

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.879 
touchy thing when it comes to the canned
kits<00:07:03.149> is<00:07:03.419> how<00:07:03.959> much<00:07:04.259> of<00:07:04.499> that<00:07:04.529> hop

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889 
kits is how much of that hop

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:07.579 
kits is how much of that hop
accentuation<00:07:05.639> comes<00:07:05.939> out<00:07:06.149> you<00:07:07.079> almost<00:07:07.289> always

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:07.589 
accentuation comes out you almost always

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:10.759 
accentuation comes out you almost always
have<00:07:07.829> like<00:07:07.979> a<00:07:08.009> base<00:07:08.309> malty<00:07:08.939> like<00:07:09.869> a<00:07:09.959> base<00:07:10.169> multi

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:10.769 
have like a base malty like a base multi

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:13.969 
have like a base malty like a base multi
note<00:07:11.369> a<00:07:11.610> base<00:07:11.819> multi<00:07:12.299> flavor<00:07:12.599> and<00:07:12.899> then<00:07:13.529> the

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 
note a base multi flavor and then the

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:18.049 
note a base multi flavor and then the
hops<00:07:14.219> are<00:07:14.579> kind<00:07:14.819> of<00:07:14.969> where<00:07:16.909> were<00:07:17.909> the

00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:18.059 
hops are kind of where were the

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:20.439 
hops are kind of where were the
variances<00:07:18.569> in<00:07:18.719> between<00:07:19.019> the<00:07:19.110> cans<00:07:19.319> come<00:07:19.649> so

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:20.449 
variances in between the cans come so

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.089 
variances in between the cans come so
yeah<00:07:21.449> yeah<00:07:21.599> like<00:07:21.839> I<00:07:21.929> said<00:07:21.959> all<00:07:22.349> being<00:07:22.589> said<00:07:22.829> i
