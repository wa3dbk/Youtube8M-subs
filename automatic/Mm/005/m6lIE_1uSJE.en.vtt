I<00:00:11.210> think<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.300> can<00:00:12.870> find<00:00:13.050> any<00:00:13.230> device<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.830> know

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
I think we can find any device you know

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.580 
I think we can find any device you know
we<00:00:14.309> can<00:00:14.490> make<00:00:14.520> our<00:00:14.790> driver<00:00:15.030> smiling<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:15.690> yes

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
we can make our driver smiling but yes

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.010 
we can make our driver smiling but yes
it's<00:00:16.800> true<00:00:16.950> that<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> team<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:18.020> reputation

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
it's true that the team is a reputation

it's true that the team is a reputation
is<00:00:19.500> good<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.920> terms<00:00:20.040> of<00:00:20.160> innovation<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.880> we

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
is good in terms of innovation and we

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150 
is good in terms of innovation and we
brought<00:00:21.599> through<00:00:22.290> the<00:00:22.439> last<00:00:22.650> year's<00:00:22.890> from

one<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:27.029> definitely<00:00:28.020> we<00:00:28.169> have<00:00:28.349> some<00:00:28.590> this

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
one but definitely we have some this

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:37.569 
one but definitely we have some this

understand the details or other ways of
mechanics<00:01:09.810> are<00:01:10.080> walking<00:01:10.440> and<00:01:10.620> some<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.430> them

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
mechanics are walking and some of them

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.030 
mechanics are walking and some of them
just<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:12.120> to<00:01:12.210> understand<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> effect<00:01:13.050> or<00:01:13.260> or

you

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.210 

target<00:02:09.879> is<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.629> we<00:02:11.110> have<00:02:11.230> two<00:02:11.409> two<00:02:11.620> targets<00:02:12.040> I'd

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
target is in we have two two targets I'd

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.500 
target is in we have two two targets I'd
say<00:02:12.400> first<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.909> do<00:02:13.030> better<00:02:13.209> in<00:02:13.390> the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
say first to do better in the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.600 
say first to do better in the
championship<00:02:14.049> so<00:02:14.349> we<00:02:14.530> would<00:02:14.650> like<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.830> Tobias

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
championship so we would like to Tobias

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.890 
championship so we would like to Tobias
Lee<00:02:15.760> match<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.150> first<00:02:16.390> place<00:02:16.629> on<00:02:16.840> the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
Lee match the first place on the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.000 
Lee match the first place on the
championship<00:02:17.409> which<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.680> better<00:02:17.830> than

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
championship which is better than

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.190 
championship which is better than
thieves<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:19.180> obviously<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.690> second<00:02:20.019> one<00:02:20.170> is

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
thieves and obviously the second one is

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.930 
thieves and obviously the second one is
to<00:02:20.799> keep<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:22.110> upward<00:02:23.110> spiral<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:24.610> make<00:02:24.790> sure

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
to keep this upward spiral to make sure

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.149 
to keep this upward spiral to make sure
that<00:02:25.209> what<00:02:25.659> we<00:02:25.690> what<00:02:26.200> we<00:02:26.230> want<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.680> achieve<00:02:26.799> in

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
that what we what we want to achieve in

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.830 
that what we what we want to achieve in
in<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.549> near<00:02:27.700> future<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.299> couple<00:02:28.599> of<00:02:28.659> years

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
in the near future in a couple of years

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.380 
in the near future in a couple of years

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
we own the good path to do it and we see

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:41.090 
we own the good path to do it and we see
some<00:02:31.569> good<00:02:31.750> progress<00:02:31.959> through<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.470> years
