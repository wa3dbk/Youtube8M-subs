00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.370
 c- this new video 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.590
 this time he handed out a self-installable icons frustrated a 2 7 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:11.169
 in which I have climbed 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:15.499
 two files one are some mac icons and others are black musicians 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.820
 that are very elegant what there is 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.250
 and in these moments demo applied what we are 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.159
 and get to know the property 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.089
 good we like brown cargo 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.390
 it has made us vibrate 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.679
 desktop riot burke we will give you right click to access here 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.740
 good to the stupor that I already have it anyway I'm going to give 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.960
 Yes to everything 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.950
 let's move in the same way with the second very ungrateful file 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.950
 Right click to access 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.570
 in this we can eliminate it and I'm going to leave it here 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.400
 and we are going to see the first folder with which we are going to change 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 in this case they are tico no mack 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.570
 these icons 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.720
 are not 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.030
 created by me 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.309
 are from the user 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.090
 0 0 49 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.720
 the credits I'm going to him 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 because although it gives you just and cheeky of 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.400
 of your channel 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.070
 Thus 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.070
 I repeat again injured and the credits 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.510
 good to be able to install what they are 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.250
 icons 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.170
 The first thing we are going to do and if not start 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.110
 control Panel 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.560
 user account 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.670
 user account again 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.670
 change user account control settings 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.010
 you in praise itati 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.580
 the social smoke leaf down 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.310
 we wanted to accept 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.750
 and we restart our behavior 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.750
 once rebooted plus the computer I do not love started again 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.860
 team 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.320
 local disk hundred 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.640
 windows 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.610
 and you how to swim vetra attend 32 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.020
 here it is 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.280
 and we are going to change 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.280
 three files or what's 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:08.969
 here it is 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:10.539
 let's go to the folder 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.499
 in this case do 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.569
 more icons 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.010
 let's go to the data folder 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.150
 maybe in 32 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
 let's change these three files in this case 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.269
 there we are going to take the accounts the total control of the 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.629
 of these troops 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.469
 therefore we do not go to our 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.429
 files and that in 32 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.699
 let's put images 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.699
 gilmar 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.439
 the point of the ltce that we are going to 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.109
 the mosquito net made properties 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.809
 we are in avoiding 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.609
 and we will take these two 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.609
 these horrendous who are our administrators 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.609
 menzi theme 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.579
 bustelo will have to deny here 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.809
 take cadavid 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.989
 we're going to put him in allow we stay in africa 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.049
 select humanizers 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:05.829
 and we give 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.979
 in the same way and allow 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.510
 that age user let's look by default 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.869
 in my case reading execution 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.869
 I have marked inept hurricane 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.779
 well now let's take 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:21.339
 the self control you want most 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:23.539
 image 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.629
 therefore some write 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.629
 images 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.919
 the mosquito net made 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.049
 properties 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.569
 security 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:36.819
 erika 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.669
 and here where we put in allow 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.789
 in the same way 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.299
 with the archives 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.299
 the most important are chem to sherry 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:51.899
 now we are going to 32 papers 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.269
 32 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.319
 fiji of the fact properties 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.939
 security critics 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.889
 ideas we have in the same way 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.829
 once determined what is 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.909
 made these procedures 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.959
 we can install 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.209
 usually 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.439
 I do not know if with or without any problem 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:20.759
 let's open again the mac icons folder 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.390
 or if you want you can open it in the second folder 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.059
 in this case 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:28.059
 music with moss 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.020
 let's go to the folder 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.020
 and we give here they do not say of law 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.270
 he does not write me in fact that cÃºper as minister 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.400
 Here he asks us to press any key to do 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.340
 so that it can be modified 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.949
 in my case do the test 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.129
 again we go to more icons 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.180
 he named 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.599
 we are not here there are 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.990
 right click to execute as minister 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.080
 here we are going to 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.949
 select 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.430
 option 1 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.240
 in this case moody's izik monreal we want to install what I am 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.319
 of the icons 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.900
 7600 for pretending 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.919
 I also forgot to tell them 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.550
 I would have said from the beginning of the video 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.280
 what this actually works for 32 bits 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.229
 the driver for 32 bits 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:33.170
 nasrallah I do not know if it's for 64 bits 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.749
 I have not tried 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:37.789
 for those people who are trying to approve, they tell me 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.879
 through 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.719
 here we are going to select the 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.099
 option 1 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.099
 we give in mind 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.949
 start to change 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.119
 we're going to wait 

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:01.119
 rule all this 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.979
 will expose all the speakers more we are alarmed 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:08.749
 the genome again 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:12.689
 and here they ask us if we want to restart as he could 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.689
 you select option 1 and give it in mind 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.330
 I'm not going to give because 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.210
 cut and video 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.139
 I am going to select option 2 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.129
 obviously you choose option 1 partic 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.279
 can restart 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:31.749
 and good as they come to me has changed me 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:34.749
 these icons in hand asking for your comments 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.289
 private messages that 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.449
 good people I hope you liked this 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.509

 put 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.789
 hand privately down depending on your taste I send a greeting 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:53.789
 photo my friends who are watching
