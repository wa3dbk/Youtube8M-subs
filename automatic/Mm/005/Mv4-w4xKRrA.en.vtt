forward<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:30.720> backwards<00:02:35.220> when<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.430> do<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
forward and backwards when you do the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.440 
forward and backwards when you do the
woofman<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:38.410> forward<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.940> backwards

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
woofman the forward and the backwards

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.010 
woofman the forward and the backwards
you<00:02:41.140> actually<00:02:41.620> loosen<00:02:42.490> up<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:43.090> tension<00:02:43.570> of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
you actually loosen up the tension of

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.090 
you actually loosen up the tension of
the<00:02:44.080> muscle<00:02:45.040> which<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.490> going<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.910> be<00:02:46.030> pulling

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the muscle which is going to be pulling

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.920 
the muscle which is going to be pulling
so<00:02:48.100> that<00:02:48.280> way<00:02:48.460> you<00:02:48.520> can<00:02:48.730> get<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.910> relief<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.570> it

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
so that way you can get a relief and it
