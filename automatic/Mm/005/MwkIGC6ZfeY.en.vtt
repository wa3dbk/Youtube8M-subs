00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.839
 Hello everyone on our channel 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.950
 nek si in ukraine today would like to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.309
 tell about one of their experiences 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:17.480
 for the last half starvation 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:20.939
 I tried a very large number 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.990
 various bases some just 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.289
 for the sake of the test others for the reason that I 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.570
 really wanted to experience and 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.669
 feel first hand 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.610
 so famous but in reality 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.430
 legendary grounds like for example whom 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:46.079
 500 logs per roll thunder 555 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:50.219
 oval ogs blue thunder 550 and many 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.010
 others just the same I tried the base 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.219
 nixie companies and you know some 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.989
 the grounds lingered for a long time 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:04.939
 here as for example both boxing on 500 but 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:09.720
 on time and you know i couldn't forget about 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:12.510
 those sensations that play or quality 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.619
 games that were presented to me by mine 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.520
 favorite base mix arirang i 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.750
 I will bring it closer we actually 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.540
 on the channel you can see a video about 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.810
 this basis on my website tt romanko 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.479
 You can read more about him and now I 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.350
 I'll show you for the sake of what I shoot this video 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.659
 Well first of all, to say what really 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.470
 until I met the grounds better than 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:47.970
 nexia arirang or base which 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.640
 served as his prototype for tibhar inka 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.909
 which company lexi made to order 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.140
 tibhar means here too lining pay 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.380
 attention yasaka 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:04.950
 cancer for 9 means on the other hand i 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.099
 set yourself yolo explode sensitive on 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.959
 in fact you can read see 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:15.080
 these lining actually 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.530
 It was so I was ready to pick up 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.390
 on this basis your loved ones 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:27.230
 time-tested personal experiences and 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.380
 Of course in great preference they are 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.849
 just for my game donic barracuda 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.940
 baracuda but then I got 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.920
 interest in the pad yasaka cancer for 9 very 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.690
 great interest because heard very 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.769
 many good reviews and 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.400
 yolo explode and and elephants compare often with 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:53.269
 barracuda my means explode sense these 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.290
 Here is this pad sensitive it is softer than 40 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.330
 degrees of hardness stated on the scale ate 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.980
 I will say this a little softer than the tributary 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.930
 barracuda big sam means at the beginning of aioli 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.269
 This is not the cover that I would like to 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.750
 do pr 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:15.109
 but in no way inferior barracuda peak 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.079
 the same control 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:21.890
 too arc rotation and also I would 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:24.709
 said that the pad is still more 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:30.829
 control here for this game where you 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:33.200
 put emphasis on the beginning ie first 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.829
 code where you put the emphasis is to 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.690
 all control return on the table and can 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.790
 be complete or flat strike or 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.760
 still a series of rotations this pad 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.389
 super and now cancer for 9 dear 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.940
 friends for nine is not easy 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:52.420
 good pad she really 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.380
 replaced me with a barracuda 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.310
 the first thing that impressed me and todes 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.990
 or assertive y to the pad think that in 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.410
 the camera will not be visible you can 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.290
 watch this on the internet second 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.520
 pad quickly really fast 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.950
 probably faster than non barracuda 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.580
 I know how to estimate the percentage but faster 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.700
 than the barracuda here but has the strongest 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.190
 rotation and just awesome for 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.270
 such speed control as soon as I 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:31.050
 I put this cover I even became 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.450
 short feed with rotation and without doing 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.280
 much better than before doing the barrack 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.690
 let me know what caused it 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.060
 My opinion is that this is due to mild 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.730
 very soft top lining then 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.130
 There is also a short feed lining. 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.440
 have become much more effective as with 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.640
 rotation and without can leave under 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.800
 the second grid itself 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:58.980
 when it comes to twisting or about such 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.370
 control let's say not aggressive 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.000
 the game 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.000
 these pads is a masterpiece means 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.980
 I recommend you to try first 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.220
 queue based nixi ariran masterpiece 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.200
 it is this foundation that replaced me 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.740
 my favorite butterfly and for sale 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.200
 and if you play barracuda you want 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.870
 try something else but 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.150
 do not lose anything I recommend sugar 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.940
 raksa della all this you can find on 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.300
