00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610 

now<00:00:00.719> that<00:00:00.989> you've<00:00:01.079> seen<00:00:01.110> both<00:00:01.469> these

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
now that you've seen both these

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.320 
now that you've seen both these
unboxings<00:00:02.250> I<00:00:02.429> think<00:00:02.760> it's<00:00:02.909> time<00:00:03.060> you<00:00:03.090> see

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
unboxings I think it's time you see

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.289 
unboxings I think it's time you see
these<00:00:03.510> my<00:00:03.720> side<00:00:04.140> by<00:00:04.380> side<00:00:04.799> so<00:00:05.759> here<00:00:06.120> we<00:00:06.270> have

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
these my side by side so here we have

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.169 
these my side by side so here we have
the<00:00:06.690> cooler<00:00:06.930> master<00:00:07.319> storm<00:00:07.760> alcohol<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:08.940> this

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
the cooler master storm alcohol and this

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.360 
the cooler master storm alcohol and this
is<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.360> result<00:00:09.510> so<00:00:10.200> from<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> looks<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.219> it

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
is the result so from the looks of it

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.070 
is the result so from the looks of it
you<00:00:11.519> can<00:00:11.610> easily<00:00:11.790> gather<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.480> both<00:00:12.929> these

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
you can easily gather that both these

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.379 
you can easily gather that both these
mice<00:00:13.290> look<00:00:13.559> absolutely<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.400> same<00:00:14.580> except<00:00:15.210> for

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
mice look absolutely the same except for

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.050 
mice look absolutely the same except for
the<00:00:15.450> fact<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.049> missile<00:00:16.440> has<00:00:16.880> grips<00:00:17.880> on

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the fact that the missile has grips on

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.670 
the fact that the missile has grips on
the<00:00:18.150> side<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.170> about<00:00:19.230> ripping<00:00:19.529> on

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the side that is it about ripping on

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.890 
the side that is it about ripping on
both<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> sides<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.570> alcohol<00:00:21.570> doesn't

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
both the sides and the alcohol doesn't

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
both the sides and the alcohol doesn't
so<00:00:22.680> that's<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.420> other<00:00:24.420> than<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.720> fact<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.199> it

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
so that's it other than the fact that it

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.730 
so that's it other than the fact that it
also<00:00:26.220> doesn't<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> silver<00:00:27.840> accents<00:00:28.590> and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
also doesn't have the silver accents and

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.790 
also doesn't have the silver accents and
the<00:00:29.609> massage<00:00:30.330> as<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.080> alcohol<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.470> different

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
the massage as so alcohol is different

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.340 
the massage as so alcohol is different
in<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:31.920> sense<00:00:32.719> moving<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> back<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
in that sense moving to the back of the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.650 
in that sense moving to the back of the
mouse<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.280> see<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.700> both<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.329> them<00:00:36.450> have

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
mouse you can see that both of them have

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.130 
mouse you can see that both of them have
a<00:00:36.690> CM<00:00:37.320> sound<00:00:37.559> over<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> back<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
a CM sound over at the back so on the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
a CM sound over at the back so on the
alcohol<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.160> four<00:00:41.489> LED<00:00:41.940> configuration

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
alcohol you have four LED configuration

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.880 
alcohol you have four LED configuration
options<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.930> depend<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> DPI

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
options that depend on the DPI

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770 
options that depend on the DPI
adjustment<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.430> if<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.730> adjust<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.450> decay<00:00:45.750> of

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
adjustment so if you adjust the decay of

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.770 
adjustment so if you adjust the decay of
the<00:00:45.899> mouse<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.320> color<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.450> logo<00:00:48.450> changes

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the mouse the color of the logo changes

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.360 
the mouse the color of the logo changes
depending<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> decay<00:00:49.649> assessment<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
depending on the decay assessment so you

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.340 
depending on the decay assessment so you
can<00:00:50.520> configure<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.059> using<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.480> software<00:00:51.629> in

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
can configure that using the software in

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.639 
can configure that using the software in
the<00:00:52.530> measure<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:54.030> basically<00:00:54.780> has<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.440> lot<00:00:55.620> of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the measure it basically has a lot of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.029 
the measure it basically has a lot of
color<00:00:56.640> options<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.800> can

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
color options not just for and you can

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.000 
color options not just for and you can
know<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> lot<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.180> combinations<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:01.010> options

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
know do a lot of combinations of options

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.010 
know do a lot of combinations of options
on<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.520> back<00:01:04.100> knowing<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> top<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.869> can

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
on the back knowing to the top you can

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.149 
on the back knowing to the top you can
see<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.229> there<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.770> subtle<00:01:07.920> difference

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
see that there is a subtle difference

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.780 
see that there is a subtle difference
between<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> scroll<00:01:08.970> wheel<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:10.159> on<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
between the scroll wheel so on the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.649 
between the scroll wheel so on the
alcohol<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:13.350> has<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> black<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.659> scroll

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
alcohol it has a black of the scroll

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.800 
alcohol it has a black of the scroll
wheel<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.259> sides<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> Mossad<00:01:17.810> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
wheel on the sides and on the Mossad the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.130 
wheel on the sides and on the Mossad the
color<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.979> scroll<00:01:20.700> wheel<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:21.030> same<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
color of the scroll wheel is same as the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.609 
color of the scroll wheel is same as the
logo<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.479> it<00:01:24.479> actually<00:01:24.810> lights<00:01:25.020> up<00:01:25.229> when

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
logo so it's it actually lights up when

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.270 
logo so it's it actually lights up when
the<00:01:25.710> mouse<00:01:25.860> lights<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.280> both

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the mouse lights up so that's the both

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.210 
the mouse lights up so that's the both
the<00:01:29.310> mice<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.780> same<00:01:30.990> DK<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.890> meant

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the mice have the same DK I just meant

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.260 
the mice have the same DK I just meant
options<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.180> top<00:01:33.890> right<00:01:34.970> below<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.060> from

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
options at the top right below this from

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.450 
options at the top right below this from
Valyria<00:01:37.280> moving<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.460> side<00:01:40.280> both<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
Valyria moving to the side both the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
Valyria moving to the side both the
alcohol<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> Mossad<00:01:42.920> have<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:45.079> forward

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
alcohol and the Mossad have a forward

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.230 
alcohol and the Mossad have a forward
and<00:01:46.200> backward<00:01:46.470> operation<00:01:46.799> buttons<00:01:50.119> both<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and backward operation buttons both the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.149 
and backward operation buttons both the
alcohol<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.659> Mossad<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.409> backward<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
alcohol and Mossad have a backward and

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.100 
alcohol and Mossad have a backward and
forward<00:01:53.220> operation<00:01:53.670> button<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> side<00:01:54.360> so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
forward operation button on the side so

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.810 
forward operation button on the side so
you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.320> easily<00:01:55.829> map<00:01:56.130> these<00:01:56.340> using<00:01:56.729> this

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you can easily map these using this

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.030 
you can easily map these using this
software<00:01:59.149> the<00:02:00.149> other<00:02:00.439> major<00:02:01.439> difference<00:02:01.890> I

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
software the other major difference I

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.010 
software the other major difference I
would<00:02:02.189> say<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.579> actually<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.420> sensor<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
would say is actually the sensor of the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.589 
would say is actually the sensor of the
two<00:02:04.770> mice<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.560> alcohol<00:02:07.560> has<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.710> 4000<00:02:08.250> DBA

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
two mice so the alcohol has a 4000 DBA

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.380 
two mice so the alcohol has a 4000 DBA
optical<00:02:09.599> sensor<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.310> mazha<00:02:11.310> has<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> 8200

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
optical sensor and the mazha has a 8200

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.250 
optical sensor and the mazha has a 8200
DPI<00:02:12.720> late

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
DPI late

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.679 
DPI late
the<00:02:13.319> sensor<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.159> both<00:02:14.430> these<00:02:14.580> answers<00:02:15.030> are<00:02:15.060> go

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
the sensor so both these answers are go

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.369 
the sensor so both these answers are go
sensors<00:02:16.049> but<00:02:16.409> there's<00:02:16.799> their<00:02:17.129> difference<00:02:17.879> and

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
sensors but there's their difference and

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.440 
sensors but there's their difference and
both<00:02:19.379> of<00:02:19.409> them<00:02:19.620> have<00:02:19.799> omron<00:02:20.370> switches<00:02:20.450> so

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
both of them have omron switches so

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.229 
both of them have omron switches so
that's<00:02:21.689> it<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:23.280> next<00:02:23.549> difference<00:02:23.849> I<00:02:24.030> would

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
that's it the next difference I would

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.170 
that's it the next difference I would
say<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.650> cable<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.670> size<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
say is the cable so the size of the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.809 
say is the cable so the size of the
cable<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.540> similar<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:29.129> alka<00:02:29.459> as<00:02:29.579> well<00:02:29.700> as

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
cable is similar in the alka as well as

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.670 
cable is similar in the alka as well as
a<00:02:29.849> bizarre<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.720> alcohol<00:02:31.110> doesn't<00:02:31.409> have<00:02:31.650> a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
a bizarre but the alcohol doesn't have a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.550 
a bizarre but the alcohol doesn't have a
braided<00:02:32.190> cable<00:02:32.489> aunty<00:02:32.900> Masada's<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.319> that's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
braided cable aunty Masada's so that's

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.380 
braided cable aunty Masada's so that's
there<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.430> get<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.819> added<00:02:36.030> durability

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
there and you get the added durability

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.069 
there and you get the added durability
with<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.260> cable<00:02:38.269> moving<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.750> bottom<00:02:40.019> of

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
with this cable moving to the bottom of

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.740 
with this cable moving to the bottom of
the<00:02:40.200> mice<00:02:40.459> it's<00:02:41.459> absolutely<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.239> same<00:02:42.450> there

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the mice it's absolutely the same there

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.280 
the mice it's absolutely the same there
is<00:02:42.870> no<00:02:43.079> not<00:02:43.319> much<00:02:43.530> difference<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.010> see

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
is no not much difference you can see

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.349 
is no not much difference you can see
the<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.709> def<00:02:46.890> lon<00:02:47.069> feet<00:02:47.280> at<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.120> bottom

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
the you have def lon feet at the bottom

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.680 
the you have def lon feet at the bottom
and<00:02:49.159> yeah<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:50.519> CM<00:02:50.819> saw<00:02:50.970> blow<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.420> said

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
and yeah the CM saw blow that said

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.869 
and yeah the CM saw blow that said
nothing<00:02:52.290> else<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:54.349> this<00:02:55.349> was<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.879> side-by-side

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
nothing else so this was a side-by-side

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.990 
nothing else so this was a side-by-side
comparison<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.829> CM<00:02:58.829> some<00:02:59.069> alcohol<00:02:59.760> and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
comparison of the CM some alcohol and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.099 
comparison of the CM some alcohol and
mizzer<00:03:00.329> so<00:03:01.019> stay<00:03:01.290> tuned<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.739> thanks
