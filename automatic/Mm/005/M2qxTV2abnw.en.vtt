to<00:02:10.200> mention<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.950> these<00:02:11.459> things<00:02:11.640> are<00:02:11.849> still

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
to mention that these things are still

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.309 
to mention that these things are still
the<00:02:12.450> best<00:02:12.530> if<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.739> haven't<00:02:14.220> tried<00:02:14.870> ed<00:02:15.870> singing

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
the best if you haven't tried ed singing

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.120 
the best if you haven't tried ed singing
a<00:02:16.560> fixed<00:02:17.010> blade<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.819> need<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.180> try<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:19.130> can't

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
a fixed blade you need to try it I can't

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.710 
a fixed blade you need to try it I can't
explain<00:02:20.660> exactly<00:02:21.660> what<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.500> differences<00:02:22.980> are

explain exactly what the differences are
but<00:02:24.720> for<00:02:24.989> some<00:02:25.140> reason<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.709> fixed<00:02:26.340> blade<00:02:26.519> feels

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
but for some reason a fixed blade feels

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.479 
but for some reason a fixed blade feels
so<00:02:27.150> much<00:02:27.329> more<00:02:27.390> usable<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.440> an<00:02:28.620> everyday<00:02:28.890> basis
