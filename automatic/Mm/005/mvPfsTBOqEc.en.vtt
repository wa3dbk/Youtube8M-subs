00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hello dear friends with you I am Yuri 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.060
 Aksyonov this gameplay today we 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.480
 look at another great game 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.160
 called space marshals 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.009
 game developer is a company 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.650
 pixel byte known for its race 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.850
 miracles racing and this time they decided 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.199
 zafigachit not racing from a tactical shooter 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.199
 and performed in such an atmosphere 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.779
 wild west but about the future with what 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.750
 the whole story begins supposedly in 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.149
 the space exists above the closed prison 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.160
 for dangerous criminals and represents 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.920
 screaming yourself spaceship 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.230
 but once the most cunning 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.530
 the criminal who constantly ran out 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.510
 all prisons of the world and the universe 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.300
 hijacking this space prison it's 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.649
 just unheard of insolence and in my 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.410
 the look begins with this 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.440
 the actual storytelling of the game we 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.289
 we are some former marshal ex 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.590
 a cop but for some kind of offense 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.530
 this policeman was jailed and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.020
 was in it and in this prison people are not 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.010
 just like that they sit in 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.350
 peculiar anabiosis and now after 7 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.420
 months of hibernation come out our main 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.290
 hero and after that you begin 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.009
 main game 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.350
 we go from this prison to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.390
 some kind of neighboring planet and on her 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.400
 start playing by genre this game 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.280
 Introduces a dual stick shooter with 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.829
 third-person view in the wild entourage 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.680
 west but with modern weapon cannons 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.840
 grenades and other attributes of what 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.240
 we will need to do in all these 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.979
 missions we will need either the same 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.810
 stealth mode either in the same mode 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.649
 daredevil but still more 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.000
 degree in stealth mode cracking down on 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.060
 the bandits who occupied this 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.740
 the planet made its base of it as 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.200
 travel we will collect 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.659
 necessary evidence necessary various 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.229
 items parts and also find more 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.049
 members of our team brought together we 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.659
 As a result, we can catch all the same and return 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.569
 to this terrible person's prison 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.879
 escapes from prison and steals space 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.260
 prison on the schedule the game looks very 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.049
 nice 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.269
 everything is beautiful here and the world and 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.049
 our main character and minor 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.140
 characters 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:25.140
 and the opponents themselves are also on schedule 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.000
 yourself not on the door beautiful effects from 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.610
 firing laser weapons also 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.890
 but the most important is the shadow 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.629
 the shadows in this game are really 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.879
 quality and thanks to the developers then 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.310
 that so worked on them and on 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.989
 dynamic lighting after 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.480
 passing each mission you will 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.120
 find yourself at your base at base you 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.400
 you can do what you can change 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.019
 equip your hero may 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.569
 at the same time be two species 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.480
 firearm it for example 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.690
 light gun and weapon or maybe 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.730
 for example rifle sniper something else 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.250
 besides all this, you can also 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.549
 use bombs and grenades mines and 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.709
 pebbles for what it needs pebbles need 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.560
 in order to distract opponents 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.569
 entice them and kill well, and I pomegranate 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.780
 I think you know what you need 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.690
 to make a pass or 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.849
 destroy immediately the whole crowd of gangsters 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.859
 after completing each mission you 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.500
 it will be necessary to decide what 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:28.410
 it is sometimes very difficult to get a reward 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.019
 make a choice you offer for example 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.269
 new body armor or new type of weapon i 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.519
 Here, for example, took a sniper rifle and 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.109
 I did not regret because thanks to her I 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.530
 I can from a fairly long distance 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.989
 kill enemies and go unnoticed 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.449
 but you need to be careful because if 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.120
 you will be noticed from a distance 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:50.370
 the rifle will not be fired 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.190
 comme il faut when i installed this game i 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.530
 for some reason I expected from her a certain similarity 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.169
 xcom but in the end got something else 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.959
 but it did not disappoint me 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:04.829
 on the contrary, I really liked the game like 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.260
 in terms of graphics both in terms of gameplay so 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.599
 and in terms of plot interesting plot 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.180
 exciting and still not gonna be you 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.819
 hold up longer run faster swing 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.010
 the game and don't forget to put a thumbs up 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:21.829
 under the video, thank you very much for 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.829
 attention to all for now and see you soon
