right whatever it's really good yeah
it's<00:00:41.820> got<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.060> think<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.750> right<00:00:42.899> amount

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
it's got I think just the right amount

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.139 
it's got I think just the right amount
of<00:00:43.320> realistic<00:00:43.739> elements<00:00:44.399> enough<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.000> make<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
of realistic elements enough to make it

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.540 
of realistic elements enough to make it
believable<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:46.079> fun<00:00:46.530> at<00:00:46.830> the<00:00:46.980> same<00:00:47.160> time<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
believable but fun at the same time and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.060 
believable but fun at the same time and
not<00:00:47.610> overly<00:00:47.970> a<00:00:48.090> crime<00:00:48.900> yeah<00:00:49.560> that's<00:00:49.800> probably

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
not overly a crime yeah that's probably

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.770 
not overly a crime yeah that's probably
the<00:00:50.250> best<00:00:50.370> way<00:00:50.520> actually<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> you're<00:00:51.540> wearing

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
it's a little room it's a good time we

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.190 
it's a little room it's a good time we
we<00:00:59.700> did<00:00:59.850> an<00:00:59.940> entire<00:01:00.060> game<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.450> about<00:01:00.720> 15

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
we did an entire game in about 15

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.600 
we did an entire game in about 15
minutes<00:01:01.440> which<00:01:01.710> i<00:01:01.830> think<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.040> about<00:01:02.250> how<00:01:02.400> long

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
minutes which i think is about how long

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.609 
minutes which i think is about how long
it<00:01:02.760> takes<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.060> do<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:04.140> got<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> find<00:01:04.530> your

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
it takes to do one you got to find your

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.440 
it takes to do one you got to find your
way<00:01:04.769> into<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> bank<00:01:05.339> vault<00:01:05.640> basically<00:01:06.180> and
