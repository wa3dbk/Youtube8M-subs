00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:10.670
 hello today we are going to cook lamb stew 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.180
 with potatoes the leg ingredients of 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:18.380
 Lamb cut onions and garlic tomatoes 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:22.160
 potatoes carrots thyme peas and 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.720
 parsley and a splash of white wine 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.870
 We started by chopping the onion and the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.870
 garlic 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.119
 then we paste the tomato 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.280
 we remove the nuggets and chop 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.720
 finally we cut the carrots in 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.380
 slices and now we go with the lamb what 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.380
 we pepper 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.740
 and we achieved it in a casserole with a little 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.740
 of oil 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:04.309
 when it's ready we take out the lamb 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.750
 we remove the oil and add the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.290
 vegetables with a splash of oil 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:14.480
 clean then the garlic 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.480
 and a few minutes later the tomato 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.730
 we pepper and add also the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.190
 Thyme and chopped parsley 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.010
 when everything is well poached we add 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.730
 a teaspoon of flour and sautÃ© a 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.730
 couple of minutes 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.990
 It's time for the white wine that 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.990
 let's reduce 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.120
 now we incorporate the lamb and water without 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.060
 cover it all 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.690
 and finally we add the carrots and 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.690
 the potatoes 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.730
 a little more water and we leave it in the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.190
 fire 45 minutes 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.800
 when ten minutes remain we add the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.840
 green peas 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.840
 and this is the final result 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.560
 and now on the plate 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.390
 a sprig of thyme to decorate and that 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.390
 it's all until soon
