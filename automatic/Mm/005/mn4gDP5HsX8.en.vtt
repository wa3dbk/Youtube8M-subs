really<00:02:23.080> really<00:02:23.349> amazing<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:23.920> was<00:02:24.129> really

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
really really amazing and I was really

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.729 
really really amazing and I was really
impressed<00:02:24.670> my<00:02:25.569> only<00:02:25.840> issue<00:02:25.989> is<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.409> I<00:02:26.440> feel

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
impressed my only issue is that I feel

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.530 
impressed my only issue is that I feel
like<00:02:26.769> they<00:02:27.069> focused<00:02:27.489> way<00:02:27.849> too<00:02:27.909> much<00:02:28.239> on<00:02:28.420> the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
like they focused way too much on the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.569 
like they focused way too much on the
graphical<00:02:28.989> overhaul<00:02:29.319> because<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:30.129> gameplay

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
graphical overhaul because the gameplay

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.319 
graphical overhaul because the gameplay
and<00:02:30.640> controls<00:02:30.790> have<00:02:31.720> suffered<00:02:32.260> majorly<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:33.700> was

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
and controls have suffered majorly I was

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.390 
and controls have suffered majorly I was
initially<00:02:34.720> really<00:02:35.470> excited<00:02:35.950> about<00:02:36.129> the<00:02:36.280> new

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
initially really excited about the new

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.800 
initially really excited about the new
camera<00:02:36.819> angle<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.390> third-person

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
camera angle of the third-person

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.509 
camera angle of the third-person
perspective<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.680> kind<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:38.950> like<00:02:39.069> that<00:02:39.220> over

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
perspective I kind of like that over

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.369 
perspective I kind of like that over
shoulder<00:02:39.909> the<00:02:40.060> review<00:02:40.629> that<00:02:40.659> we<00:02:40.810> got<00:02:41.230> in

Skyrim<00:02:41.890> that<00:02:42.069> kind<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.400> thing<00:02:42.579> and<00:02:42.849> so<00:02:43.540> that's

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
Skyrim that kind of thing and so that's

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.539 
Skyrim that kind of thing and so that's
what<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:43.989> saw<00:02:44.290> coming<00:02:44.709> up<00:02:44.829> in<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.010> previews<00:02:45.519> of

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
what I saw coming up in the previews of

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.569 
what I saw coming up in the previews of
Raven<00:02:46.269> sword<00:02:46.510> shadow<00:02:46.780> lands<00:02:47.109> and<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:48.160> control

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
Raven sword shadow lands and the control

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:49.710 
Raven sword shadow lands and the control
scheme<00:02:48.819> even<00:02:49.120> looked<00:02:49.269> pretty<00:02:49.510> good<00:02:49.660> and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
scheme even looked pretty good and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.530 
scheme even looked pretty good and
fairly<00:02:50.379> simple<00:02:50.799> but<00:02:51.099> once<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.549> got<00:02:51.700> my<00:02:51.819> hands<00:02:52.329> on

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
fairly simple but once I got my hands on

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.420 
fairly simple but once I got my hands on
the<00:02:52.720> game<00:02:52.900> i<00:02:52.930> felt<00:02:53.379> quite<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.829> bit<00:02:54.040> different

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
the game i felt quite a bit different

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.339 
the game i felt quite a bit different
although<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.359> looked<00:02:55.540> good<00:02:55.690> in<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.870> previews

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
although it looked good in the previews

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.800 
although it looked good in the previews
that<00:02:56.379> does<00:02:56.709> not<00:02:56.859> play<00:02:57.250> super<00:02:58.090> well<00:02:58.269> at<00:02:58.629> least

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
that does not play super well at least

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.080 
that does not play super well at least
not<00:02:59.049> right<00:02:59.290> now<00:02:59.640> what<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:00.909> is<00:03:01.060> a

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
not right now what you have is a

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.149 
not right now what you have is a
floating<00:03:01.569> joystick<00:03:02.049> on<00:03:02.079> the<00:03:02.379> left<00:03:02.620> as<00:03:02.829> far<00:03:03.040> as

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
floating joystick on the left as far as

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.220 
floating joystick on the left as far as
controls<00:03:03.609> go<00:03:03.849> and<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.329> floating<00:03:04.659> joystick<00:03:05.079> on

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
controls go and the floating joystick on

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.539 
controls go and the floating joystick on
the<00:03:05.319> left<00:03:05.530> works<00:03:05.799> right<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.220> move<00:03:06.370> your

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
the left works right to move your

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.210 
the left works right to move your
character<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.209> works<00:03:07.390> really<00:03:07.629> good<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:09.040> then

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
character it works really good and then

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.589 
character it works really good and then
on<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.459> right<00:03:09.640> there<00:03:09.879> are<00:03:09.970> two<00:03:10.000> buttons

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
on the right there are two buttons

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.660 
on the right there are two buttons
there's<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.930> jump<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:11.530> an<00:03:11.650> attack<00:03:12.069> button<00:03:12.489> and

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
there's a jump and an attack button and

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.910 
there's a jump and an attack button and
the<00:03:13.209> attack<00:03:13.510> button<00:03:13.780> also<00:03:13.989> serves<00:03:14.409> the<00:03:14.590> double

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
the attack button also serves the double

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.740 
the attack button also serves the double
function<00:03:15.129> if<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.489> tap<00:03:15.879> the<00:03:16.090> attack<00:03:16.419> it

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
function if you tap the attack it

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.830 
function if you tap the attack it
obviously<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:17.829> an<00:03:18.099> attack<00:03:18.459> if<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:19.150> pulled<00:03:19.690> it

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
obviously is an attack if you pulled it

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.509 
obviously is an attack if you pulled it
in<00:03:19.989> that's<00:03:20.200> when<00:03:20.440> your<00:03:20.590> shield<00:03:20.919> kind<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.280> comes

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
in that's when your shield kind of comes

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.879 
in that's when your shield kind of comes
up<00:03:21.639> and<00:03:21.819> it<00:03:21.880> becomes<00:03:22.150> your<00:03:22.389> defense<00:03:22.829> now<00:03:23.829> the

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
up and it becomes your defense now the

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.830 
up and it becomes your defense now the
main<00:03:24.310> issues<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.819> have<00:03:25.000> with<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.209> game<00:03:25.239> come<00:03:25.690> on

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
main issues I have with the game come on

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.589 
main issues I have with the game come on
two<00:03:26.079> fronts<00:03:26.319> first<00:03:27.130> of<00:03:27.340> all<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.579> AI<00:03:28.060> seems

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
two fronts first of all the AI seems

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.750 
two fronts first of all the AI seems
really<00:03:29.200> really<00:03:29.349> glitchy<00:03:29.739> there<00:03:30.340> were<00:03:30.459> also<00:03:30.730> a

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
really really glitchy there were also a

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.460 
really really glitchy there were also a
couple<00:03:30.970> times<00:03:31.329> I<00:03:31.510> loaded<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.930> game<00:03:32.109> in<00:03:32.319> and

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
couple times I loaded the game in and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.110 
couple times I loaded the game in and
out<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.739> I<00:03:32.769> would<00:03:32.919> just<00:03:33.069> be<00:03:33.280> appearing<00:03:33.879> and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
out and I would just be appearing and

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.650 
out and I would just be appearing and
dying<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:34.959> this<00:03:35.169> open<00:03:36.040> world<00:03:36.220> glitch<00:03:36.760> against

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
dying in this open world glitch against

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.240 
dying in this open world glitch against
the<00:03:37.750> wallpaper<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.530> there<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.799> definitely

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
the wallpaper so there is definitely

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.550 
the wallpaper so there is definitely
some<00:03:39.519> glitches<00:03:40.359> in<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.870> games<00:03:41.079> that<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.349> ran

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
some glitches in the games that I ran

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.379 
some glitches in the games that I ran
too<00:03:41.769> but<00:03:42.010> especially<00:03:42.549> with<00:03:42.699> the<00:03:42.790> AI<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.329> the

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
too but especially with the AI and the

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.150 
too but especially with the AI and the
way<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.690> they<00:03:43.810> attack<00:03:44.169> it's<00:03:44.379> just<00:03:44.560> not<00:03:44.739> super

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
way that they attack it's just not super

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.490 
way that they attack it's just not super
good<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.579> then<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.389> other<00:03:46.569> major<00:03:46.810> issue<00:03:47.169> is

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
good and then the other major issue is

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.199 
good and then the other major issue is
with<00:03:47.709> how<00:03:47.980> your<00:03:48.250> character<00:03:48.669> looks<00:03:48.910> around

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
with how your character looks around

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.580 
with how your character looks around
which<00:03:49.419> is<00:03:49.569> very<00:03:49.810> important<00:03:50.319> when<00:03:50.470> you're

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
which is very important when you're

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.189 
which is very important when you're
maneuvering<00:03:50.859> around<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.790> game<00:03:52.000> there<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:52.930> no

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
maneuvering around the game there is no

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.159 
maneuvering around the game there is no
floating<00:03:53.590> analog<00:03:54.220> stick<00:03:54.549> on<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:55.269> right<00:03:55.840> side

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
floating analog stick on the right side

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.589 
floating analog stick on the right side
of<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.410> screen<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:57.459> where<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.060> see<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.419> two

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
of the screen so where you see the two

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.449 
of the screen so where you see the two
buttons<00:03:59.019> in<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.440> video<00:03:59.739> there's<00:04:00.040> nothing

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
buttons in the video there's nothing

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.949 
buttons in the video there's nothing
underneath<00:04:00.730> that<00:04:01.000> if<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.269> would<00:04:01.449> press<00:04:01.690> over

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
underneath that if I would press over

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.780 
underneath that if I would press over
there<00:04:02.079> nothing<00:04:02.590> happens<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.220> actually<00:04:03.400> have<00:04:03.669> to

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
there nothing happens I actually have to

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.250 
there nothing happens I actually have to
remove<00:04:04.150> with<00:04:04.329> my<00:04:04.449> right<00:04:04.750> hand<00:04:04.780> which<00:04:05.230> is

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
remove with my right hand which is

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.890 
remove with my right hand which is
really<00:04:05.680> awkward<00:04:05.889> on<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.370> iPad<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.629> middle

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
really awkward on the iPad to the middle

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.259 
really awkward on the iPad to the middle
of<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.109> screen<00:04:08.319> to<00:04:08.709> move<00:04:08.919> the<00:04:09.790> character

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
of the screen to move the character

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.420 
of the screen to move the character
camera<00:04:10.750> around<00:04:10.989> feel<00:04:11.319> to<00:04:11.530> see<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:11.949> it<00:04:12.040> just<00:04:12.220> is

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
camera around feel to see and it just is

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.000 
camera around feel to see and it just is
really<00:04:12.459> broken<00:04:13.299> and<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.199> worst<00:04:14.440> part<00:04:14.650> is<00:04:14.799> that

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
really broken and the worst part is that

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.420 
really broken and the worst part is that
none<00:04:15.220> of<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.430> controls

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
none of the controls

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.390 
none of the controls
be<00:04:16.519> changed<00:04:17.000> for<00:04:17.329> those<00:04:18.049> settings<00:04:18.919> so<00:04:19.190> you're

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
be changed for those settings so you're

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.090 
be changed for those settings so you're
stuck<00:04:19.759> playing<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:20.329> way<00:04:20.509> so<00:04:21.320> that's<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:21.919> major

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
stuck playing that way so that's a major

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.770 
stuck playing that way so that's a major
reason<00:04:22.639> for<00:04:22.669> me<00:04:22.970> why<00:04:23.150> I<00:04:23.180> feel<00:04:23.419> like<00:04:23.600> Raven

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
reason for me why I feel like Raven

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.140 
reason for me why I feel like Raven
sword<00:04:24.199> Shadowlands<00:04:24.740> feels<00:04:25.100> a<00:04:25.280> bit<00:04:25.490> rushed<00:04:25.759> and

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
sword Shadowlands feels a bit rushed and

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.320 
sword Shadowlands feels a bit rushed and
kind<00:04:26.720> of<00:04:26.870> broken<00:04:27.259> at<00:04:27.350> this<00:04:27.500> point<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:29.120> is<00:04:29.180> a

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
kind of broken at this point it is a

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.999 
kind of broken at this point it is a
great<00:04:29.720> leap<00:04:29.960> forward<00:04:30.350> in<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.530> graphical

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
great leap forward in the graphical

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.879 
great leap forward in the graphical
world<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.400> iOS<00:04:31.759> action<00:04:32.330> RPGs<00:04:32.840> but<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:33.560> leaves<00:04:33.740> a

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
world of iOS action RPGs but it leaves a

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.350 
world of iOS action RPGs but it leaves a
lot<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.130> be<00:04:34.280> desired<00:04:34.550> in<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.030> control

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
lot to be desired in the control

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.020 
lot to be desired in the control
elements<00:04:35.900> now<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.080> say<00:04:36.380> all<00:04:36.410> of<00:04:36.560> that<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:37.880> know

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
elements now I say all of that to know

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.730 
elements now I say all of that to know
that<00:04:38.240> crescent<00:04:38.690> moon<00:04:38.810> is<00:04:39.050> good<00:04:39.320> at<00:04:39.470> doing

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
that crescent moon is good at doing

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.310 
that crescent moon is good at doing
updates<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.490> so<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.300> believe<00:04:41.570> that<00:04:41.750> these<00:04:42.080> are

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
updates and so I believe that these are

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.450 
updates and so I believe that these are
the<00:04:42.440> types<00:04:42.650> of<00:04:42.800> things<00:04:43.039> that<00:04:43.130> can<00:04:43.340> be<00:04:43.430> changed

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
the types of things that can be changed

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.180 
the types of things that can be changed
in<00:04:43.970> updates<00:04:44.330> so<00:04:44.570> hopefully<00:04:45.050> they<00:04:45.650> come<00:04:45.889> along

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
in updates so hopefully they come along

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.520 
in updates so hopefully they come along
give<00:04:46.610> us<00:04:46.729> an<00:04:46.880> update<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.479> we're<00:04:48.169> able<00:04:48.289> to

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
give us an update and we're able to

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.560 
give us an update and we're able to
customize<00:04:49.009> our<00:04:49.190> control<00:04:49.550> scheme<00:04:49.849> and<00:04:50.120> really

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
customize our control scheme and really

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.939 
customize our control scheme and really
really<00:04:50.840> play<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.169> game<00:04:51.349> the<00:04:51.500> way<00:04:51.530> it's<00:04:51.800> meant

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
really play the game the way it's meant

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.189 
really play the game the way it's meant
to<00:04:52.099> be<00:04:52.220> played<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:52.490> think<00:04:52.849> once<00:04:53.750> it's<00:04:53.990> more

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
to be played I think once it's more

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.980 
to be played I think once it's more
polished<00:04:54.650> that's<00:04:54.889> when<00:04:55.130> I'll<00:04:55.220> really<00:04:55.550> dive<00:04:55.759> in

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
polished that's when I'll really dive in

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.719 
polished that's when I'll really dive in
so<00:04:56.990> this<00:04:57.139> has<00:04:57.289> been<00:04:57.410> my<00:04:57.470> first<00:04:57.830> look<00:04:58.099> at<00:04:58.340> Raven

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
so this has been my first look at Raven

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.189 
so this has been my first look at Raven
sword<00:04:58.940> Shadowlands<00:04:59.449> I<00:04:59.599> hope<00:04:59.780> you<00:04:59.900> enjoy<00:05:00.169> I

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199
