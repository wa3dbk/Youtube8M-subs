00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.210
 and hi everyone today we get 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.300
 found to test you a little cable 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.540
 provided by max heide point fr one of 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.099
 sponsors of the site and the youtube channel 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.309
 I show you all this after the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.309
 single 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
 eni 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.410
 here is the jingle is now over 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.239
 I'm going to talk a little bit more about 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.760
 this adapter so in this case and 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.690
 a mini displayport or hdmi adapter 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.220
 so towards the pmi so what is 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.590
 the interest of this cable so he has everything 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.900
 just the goal it's going to be 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.630
 convert your mini port display port 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.990
 or thunderbolt because the fall asleep on 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.550
 thunderbolt actually takes the thunder bowl 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.710
 it is an asset of the mini display not in 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.330
 somehow thunderbolt circle it's going 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.180
 to be to transfer data all that 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.920
 and the millet display port it was pretty much 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.259
 near the same principle but to plug 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.300
 other screens and all that is so we 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.160
 transforms our mini port display port 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.750
 thunderbolt it depend on which you 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.320
 have but that this fact about 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.880
 the same thing for this cable the vera of 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.759
 the age of friends so it was provided to me 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.330
 by mach wright point tiny one of the 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.190
 sponsors already played and listened to 18 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.860
 90 euros on their website 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.410
 better than 19 euros 90 so right now 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.450
 there is a small promotion so you 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.130
 unpack his very quickly it's not going 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.750
 to be exceptional it's a cable in 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.979
 my truck i'm going to do that fast 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.440
 so it's good to stick if you 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:02.090
 worry about the transport there is no 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.950
 worry he will not escape so that's it 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.500
 so I'm going to put it back as it sounds 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.899
 a little bit more pretty 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.920
 so here is the very good taste finally I 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.599
 can not you guys yet is a good 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.569
 call in any case of saverne aspect is a 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.130
 pretty good case and I'll tell you 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.400
 all this so I 'm going to show you a 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.840
 little usefulness of this cable 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.420
 already here I'm going to remove the little cache 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.010
 for you see that it's good mini 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.150
 display port or cnder paul as you 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.750
 so here it is here on that side 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.970
 the mini port display port and this side 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.310
 there a calendar or with a small color 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.739
 golden very nice elsewhere 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.599
 the hdmi now i'm going to show you 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.790
 how to connect your external display to 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.769
 your imac or your mac or your macbook 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.980
 pro mac mini finally as you want 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:54.040
 so here is the welcome way there is a 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.569
 external screen here samsung in france on 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.319
 brand card at the same time as 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.940
 I connected to the imac here 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.519
 already an adapter it was really for 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.639
 to show you this is me I have a small 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.079
 adapter here pretty much in the same 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.000
 kind but this one there is more practical 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.190
 because it's directly integrated the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.340
 continues if I have to add a cable and 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.799
 it's just a tiny adapter 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.480
 up there then we will remove all the bazaar 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.810
 hop we'll unplug her screen here 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.959
 it was a game you branches that 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.959
 so now I 'm going to come plug 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.470
 the hdmi cable so if it bothers you 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.209
 not accuse you ask 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.299
 so we wait a few seconds we go 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.829
 avoid touching the helicopter 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.419
 you had the video previously 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.720
 logically it is not yet how 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:44.319
 I go out that then you cry do not know 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.659
 If you see 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.959
 no then my oldest the mini display 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.400
 Harbor 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.169
 here I disconnected this cable so has a 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.989
 list the ports and we will deny each other 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:01.180
 to hdmi and for you show not here 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.090
 like that you will have seen everything I cried 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.319
 so the trick of the mici but considering that it 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.430
 is going to be pretty galley but actually I 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.870
 will you let me take you back 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.760
 indexed plugged in and so that's it 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.560
 find I just branch and so the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.660
 cable so you saw me hook up the 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.480
 side mini display port behind lille 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.370
 go I show you if you see that's it 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.920
 he is there the cable and I plugged in 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.200
 the other here the white cable that is going to 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.720
 connect to the mac and ben simply 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.150
 then you will have the 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.470
 monitors here so the occupant in 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.880
 the occurrence me when he's plugged in he 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.530
 immediately detected but if you 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.260
 did not know by chance you do 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.410
 detect the monitors and me there he goes 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.830
 do nothing but that's what you can do 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.840
 you can plug in your so your 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.030
 mac to your external screen now 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.260
 you can hook up a tv or something 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.020
 like that it's like you want or even 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.000
 a video projector if you wish 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.860
 the cable handles that perfectly well 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.080
 so compared to my old 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.510
 adapter it works very very well 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.890
 so here you see little things 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.710
 like that on the screen but it's because 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.570
 that the camera convert him to 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.410
 so the screen is not blocking him anymore 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.400
 that before it works very very well 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.870
 so I think that's pretty much everything 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.990
 what can I tell you so I'm going 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.920
 recommend you here is a max to point 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:24.430
 fr so who provided me this cable other 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.850
 at the price of 18 euros 90 and it works very 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.190
 very well 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.720
 so you can plug into your mac 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.680
 finally all the maths with a port 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.770
 mini display port so like the imac and 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.510
 macbook pro and macbook pro retina by 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.860
 example we could even plug 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.409
 two so it'll be maybe I 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.179
 will do a little later 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.489
 maybe a little later I show the 

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:47.309
 limits how would I do but that's it 

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:50.129
 so this is a camille displayport to 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:51.959
 hdmi so 1.8 leads so that's it if you 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:55.199
 want to fit another screen a little 

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:56.969
 further, for example, you can see 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.929
 so I tell you next time so 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.929
 I thank you 

00:05:57.929 --> 00:06:03.809
 creel to the next today so 

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:06.649
 I showed you test the HDMI Cable 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:10.909
 finally miss the ports to hdmi 

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:10.909
 I tell you next time
