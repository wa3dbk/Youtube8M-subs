00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
mainly because we do challenge our

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.640

this<00:00:46.559> concept<00:00:47.040> of<00:00:47.190> mixing<00:00:47.670> up<00:00:47.850> some<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.269> your

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
this concept of mixing up some of your

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.779 
this concept of mixing up some of your
other<00:00:48.420> troops<00:00:49.019> in<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.979> the<00:00:50.100> dragons<00:00:50.579> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
other troops in with the dragons is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.939 
other troops in with the dragons is
because<00:00:51.719> dragons<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> very<00:00:52.649> expensive

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
because dragons are a very expensive

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.040 
because dragons are a very expensive
troop<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.940> any<00:00:54.090> time<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.629> fill<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
troop so any time you can fill in the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.380 
troop so any time you can fill in the
extra<00:00:55.170> army<00:00:55.649> camp<00:00:55.829> space<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.370> troops<00:00:56.760> that

them more to to run straighter for the

them more to to run straighter for the
core<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.450> base<00:02:09.660> oftentimes<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.039> downfall

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
core of the base oftentimes the downfall

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.760 
core of the base oftentimes the downfall
with<00:02:11.940> dragons<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.510> people<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:13.140> spam<00:02:13.379> them<00:02:13.560> in

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
with dragons is people just spam them in

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.850 
with dragons is people just spam them in
one<00:02:14.069> section<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.000> they<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:15.840> fly<00:02:16.410> left<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
one section and they just fly left and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.350 
one section and they just fly left and
right<00:02:17.010> similar<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.519> pekka's<00:02:17.879> that<00:02:18.090> kind<00:02:18.300> of

right similar to pekka's that kind of

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.180 
right similar to pekka's that kind of
run<00:02:18.540> left<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:18.959> right<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.290> don't<00:02:19.769> go<00:02:19.950> for<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
run left and right and don't go for the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.910 
run left and right and don't go for the
town<00:02:20.459> hall<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.239> what<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.569> did<00:02:21.750> here<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.260> you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
town hall so what you did here is you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.830 
town hall so what you did here is you
pretty<00:02:23.160> much<00:02:23.220> just<00:02:23.640> took<00:02:24.300> out<00:02:24.480> surrounding

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
pretty much just took out surrounding

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.510 
pretty much just took out surrounding
structures<00:02:25.050> have<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> clear<00:02:26.010> path<00:02:26.220> of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
structures have a clear path of

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.920 
structures have a clear path of
buildings<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.120> town<00:02:27.330> hall<00:02:27.510> you're

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
buildings to the town hall you're

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.600 
buildings to the town hall you're
basically<00:02:28.080> leading<00:02:28.650> your<00:02:28.860> dragons<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.580> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
basically leading your dragons to the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.550 
basically leading your dragons to the
core<00:02:30.210> of<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.420> base

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
core of the base

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.650 
core of the base
then<00:02:31.770> after<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.489> all<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:33.180> have<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.390> do<00:02:33.540> is

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
then after that all you have to do is

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.570 
then after that all you have to do is
clear<00:02:33.959> up<00:02:34.200> extra<00:02:34.680> percentage<00:02:34.950> points<00:02:35.430> for

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
clear up extra percentage points for

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.000 
clear up extra percentage points for
that<00:02:35.670> second<00:02:36.180> star<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.020> really<00:02:37.440> perfect

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
that second star so really perfect

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.770 
that second star so really perfect
deployment<00:02:38.550> but<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> highly<00:02:39.239> encourage<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.630> to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
deployment but I highly encourage you to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.390 
deployment but I highly encourage you to
watch<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.110> video<00:02:40.349> back<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.860> more<00:02:40.950> time<00:02:41.010> not

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
watch this video back one more time not

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.010 
watch this video back one more time not
just<00:02:41.430> because<00:02:41.760> it's<00:02:42.209> an<00:02:42.390> effective<00:02:42.750> strategy

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
just because it's an effective strategy

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.680 
just because it's an effective strategy
but<00:02:43.980> also<00:02:44.280> helps<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.730> cut<00:02:44.940> down<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.330> some<00:02:45.540> of

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
but also helps to cut down on some of

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.690 
but also helps to cut down on some of
the<00:02:45.810> elixir<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.440> spend<00:02:46.770> on<00:02:46.980> your<00:02:47.310> army

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
the elixir that you spend on your army

keep in mind you're trading in some

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.910 
keep in mind you're trading in some
dragons<00:02:50.700> for<00:02:51.269> some<00:02:51.720> balloons<00:02:52.170> instead<00:02:52.709> and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
dragons for some balloons instead and
