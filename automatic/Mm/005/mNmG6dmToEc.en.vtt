00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.840
 [music] 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.689
 yes and yes 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.920
 Well, Christmas trees, needles 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.200
 again twenty five yesterday was twenty 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.730
 five the day before yesterday was 25 pose-day 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:50.280
 also no progress so often 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:50.280
 there is progress and then such a 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:01:02.830
 then progress again and so 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.350
 some great inventions which 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:14.040
 continue to move the progress of science and technology 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:17.310
 what does it mean 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.310
 by screws 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.469
 hedgehog and do not you think that we 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:31.929
 stopped in their development not only 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:33.819
 need to generalize no really first I thought 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.979
 that this is just my problem and now 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.979
 it is clear that there is no progress anywhere 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:02:02.590
 You see you give a dandelion does not grow 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:02:09.069
 need some we will do such that 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:12.519
 progress on the label flashes us that 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:17.849
 need we need an idea video and what needs 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:20.920
 brain you have a paw wings are not important hands 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.690
 able to embody the ideas of the brain too 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:29.430
 so consider that a great invention 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:35.340
 in our pocket they woke me up 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:40.560

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:26.490
 [music] 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:46.959
 you can't even imagine needle trees 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.959
 in short, he came up with such a thing 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.540
 in short, I 'll draw everything 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.540
 and bring 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.899
 [music] 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:49.890
 go away from destroy okay so be I 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.270

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.979

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:08.560
 front wheel and you come better rear 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:10.090
 before the back is true it 's you 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:16.390

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:21.760
 I never saw a bicycle 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:24.669
 bicycle books I have to read you 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.990
 I understand what you are hinting that this is 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.540
 no one is going to progress 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.859
 prepare for a spike 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.859
 [music] 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:46.259

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:58.099
 lack of information 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:59.669
 cave you live very old 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.599
