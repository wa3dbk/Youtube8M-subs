00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.740
 very good and they were paid minecraft 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.330
 to bring a new one but I engraf 1.7 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.650
 point you have called love is that you 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.540
 transfunctional comfort that yes I did not see 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.950
 download it and install it and well then 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.509
 it brings us different from the one that two 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.599
 they are going to be added to our game 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.009
 then we have the fire in the first place 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.869
 skeleton that will be the genre of fire 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.150
 let's see it here to see if you see the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.640
 face to see wall that you donne 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.170
 but good comes nothing happens I 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.760
 to tell a little about him you can stay 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.710
 what you have pointed out here because of course 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.750
 to learn everything is impossible not 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.980
 I know what bad sun damages the water and if you 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.659
 attacks causes you fire for two 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.040
 seconds, that is, you know cubes of 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:48.780
 water to be able to kill this guy where 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.150
 more love and more love and more love and is 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.559
 well when he dies he ends up giving us this 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.330
 bone that is he 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.159
 flame bone and that the bird stays this 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.589
 can pose to get two of 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.720
 coal is then worth one bone 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.100
 flame skeleton we get two carbon 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.949
 also advertised to burn things 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.630
 then we have the skeleton is a 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.159
 clipper skeleton as you see here as no 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.590
 you have skin you will see center dynamite 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.869
 then the bad thing is that it burns in the light 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.400
 of the good day the bad the good and the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.050
 Clip explosion is a normal pressure 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.560
 and it's pulling for small worth because 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.630
 I 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.829
 here is using what I'm going to put here 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.049
 this fire and vale explodes as you see a 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.450
 normal explosion and you're 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.159
 then we have skeleton fraud 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.500
 there is no here because when we are 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.289
 in biome to be 300 as we are now 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.360
 It is worth dying then this is it 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.979
 it's a skeleton so a little more to its 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.350
 side although it looks reddish because of the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.880
 damage but good this way in the place 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.399
 and in contract dies to the sun and the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.100
 desert on table in jungle in savannah and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.690
 sneijder is worth east in a cave 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.909
 wherever you are, as long as you are 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.000
 some of these languages or the sun 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.110
 another pawn then dies 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.700
 different will spoil this bone 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.649
 that is the frozen bone and that the mind 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.810
 creation we can change by a cube of 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.630
 good ice is a block of ice 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.179
 then we have liang the skeleton that 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.640
 exposes in the jungle and good in the sun and already 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.560
 is the only one we knit we have at min 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.239
 the skeleton that is this as you see 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.370
 I have to also the the cap of 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.870
 this of my hero and how we have the 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.239
 hat, nothing night vision 2 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.400
 exposed in cave and does not die in the sun 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.200
 then cool pretty cool 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.100
 also the little bit of this one but also 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.780
 of the skeleton 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.610
 is a derman but shaped like 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.110
 skeleton is worth it because it 's the same is what 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.210
 same then is that as linderman 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.650
 it damages the water and I do not look at it 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.510
 attack in another way because I was not going to 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.130
 get to attack it is worth then as I say 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.230
 is an anderman with a skeleton shape and 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.090
 afterwards we have the pirate of 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.620
 pirate skeleton skeleton exposes in the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.810
 beaches worth where there has been more than 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.700
 The beach exposes the sun to damage 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.230
 bad but has aquatic breathing or 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.320
 we can also find it under 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.330
 the water of the ball reminds me a lot 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.010
 the secret of pirates of the Caribbean is a 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.660
 lots and good when we kill ourselves by 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.820
 European is the sword that is the pyre 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.220
 chase war or the pirates war hello spyro 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.630
 word or whatever you want 50 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.580
 weakness and 7 attack damage so that is 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.050
 pretty cool, then we have the 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.180
 next wants ton that does not harm the 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.610
 Sun does not receive damage by fall or is it 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.950
 as a little stronger than the others 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.230
 ok and if we throw it for example then 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.880
 you are going to see what damage by fall 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.380
 has then pretty cool too 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.760
 when we kill him we get this bone 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.080
 that they have ball and when 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.670
 we got four meters once from 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.040
 creation we get a blockade if target 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.500
 and finally we have the 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.109
 is that you brain that the name does not come out 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.420
 what is this is the skeleton with half 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.090
 head out I want brain when after 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.099
 of dead then when you hit 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.560
 William and also fired underwater 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.290
 has 100 points of damage and makes 10 points 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.760
 of damage per blow or two strokes 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.709
 it kills you okay if you do not have the armor 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.030
 so be very careful with him and when 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.920
 we kill so we can be surrounded by 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.090
 star of the level or bones is worth separate 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.680
 of all this apart what does not see each 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.389
 one of these two that I have also taught 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.680
 european bones all or at least 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.389
 should they stumble when the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.430
 we kill all of us here 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.750
 so then we physicists have already 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.250
 finished with this mode I hope that you 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.329
 have liked a lot you can press 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.090
 the like it's favorite we'll see you in the 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.090
 next video and see you later 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:25.740
