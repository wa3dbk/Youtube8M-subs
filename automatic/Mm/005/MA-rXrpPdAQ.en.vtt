the<00:00:10.950> video<00:00:11.190> Goku<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.610> Super<00:00:11.849> Saiyan<00:00:12.059> 4<00:00:12.330> so

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
the video Goku and Super Saiyan 4 so

experts<00:00:14.460> were<00:00:15.030> an<00:00:15.120> extra<00:00:15.480> because<00:00:15.719> if<00:00:15.929> they

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
experts were an extra because if they

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.380 
experts were an extra because if they
work<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.710> would<00:00:16.859> know<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.130> GT<00:00:17.699> was<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:18.029> Canon

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
work it would know that GT was in Canon

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.910 
work it would know that GT was in Canon
and<00:00:18.510> therefore<00:00:18.930> Super<00:00:19.140> Saiyan<00:00:19.320> 4<00:00:19.560> doesn't

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
and therefore Super Saiyan 4 doesn't

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.450 
and therefore Super Saiyan 4 doesn't
exist

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
exist

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.580

used the scatter on in the first episode
of<00:00:57.719> Dragon<00:00:57.960> Ball<00:00:58.079> Z<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.949> know<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
of Dragon Ball Z we know that the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.920 
of Dragon Ball Z we know that the
average<00:00:59.609> human<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.030> roughly<00:01:00.359> has<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> par<00:01:00.780> level

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
average human is roughly has a par level

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.189 
average human is roughly has a par level
of<00:01:01.079> roughly<00:01:01.350> about<00:01:01.410> 5<00:01:01.920> right<00:01:02.250> which<00:01:02.579> means

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
of roughly about 5 right which means

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.270 
of roughly about 5 right which means
Superman's<00:01:04.199> power<00:01:04.439> level<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.860> roughly<00:01:05.189> about

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
Superman's power level is roughly about

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.490 
Superman's power level is roughly about
15,000<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.299> when<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.510> compare<00:01:06.720> 15<00:01:07.049> thousands

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
15,000 and when you compare 15 thousands

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.480 
15,000 and when you compare 15 thousands
of<00:01:07.590> billions<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:09.290> a<00:01:10.290> difference<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:10.710> so

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
of billions of a difference there so

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.390 
of billions of a difference there so
yeah<00:01:11.700> Goku<00:01:12.659> has<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> power<00:01:13.170> level<00:01:13.320> unlock<00:01:14.100> there

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
yeah Goku has a power level unlock there

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.399 
yeah Goku has a power level unlock there
and<00:01:14.610> again<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:14.970> I'm<00:01:15.060> wrong<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.570> Super<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:15.930> level

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and again if I'm wrong in Super my level

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
and again if I'm wrong in Super my level
please<00:01:16.740> let<00:01:17.009> me<00:01:17.100> know<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> comments<00:01:18.090> below

please let me know in the comments below

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.300 
please let me know in the comments below
so<00:01:18.570> let's<00:01:19.380> look<00:01:19.439> at<00:01:19.560> something<00:01:19.770> else<00:01:19.799> Mouse<00:01:20.040> I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
so let's look at something else Mouse I

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.830 
so let's look at something else Mouse I
would<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.000> can't<00:01:21.210> win<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> strength<00:01:21.659> alone

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
would see you can't win a strength alone

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.270 
would see you can't win a strength alone
you<00:01:22.020> got<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.590> got<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:22.950> fast

right tax you know since that's that
fast<00:01:26.729> let's<00:01:26.939> talk<00:01:27.060> about<00:01:27.180> speed<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.740> know

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
fast let's talk about speed so we know

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.069 
fast let's talk about speed so we know
that<00:01:28.890> Superman's<00:01:29.400> speed<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.240> roughly

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that Superman's speed is roughly

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.719 
that Superman's speed is roughly
slightly<00:01:31.710> faster<00:01:32.100> than<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> speed<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.549> light

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
slightly faster than the speed of light

which is how fast Goku is when he first

saga<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:37.979> he<00:01:38.100> becomes<00:01:38.400> much<00:01:38.850> more<00:01:39.119> faster

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
saga but he becomes much more faster

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.030 
saga but he becomes much more faster
much<00:01:40.079> more<00:01:40.110> powerful<00:01:40.650> by<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.740> end<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
much more powerful by the end of the

much more powerful by the end of the
series<00:01:41.340> which<00:01:41.970> means<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.570> theoretically<00:01:42.840> he

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
series which means that theoretically he

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
series which means that theoretically he
should<00:01:43.619> be<00:01:43.710> way<00:01:43.950> way<00:01:44.159> fast<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> speed<00:01:44.820> light

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
should be way way fast in a speed light

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.670 
should be way way fast in a speed light
maybe<00:01:45.210> two<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:45.720> three<00:01:45.899> times<00:01:46.020> faster<00:01:46.439> speed

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
maybe two or three times faster speed

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.200 
maybe two or three times faster speed
light<00:01:46.799> by<00:01:46.979> time<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.340> end<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> series<00:01:47.909> average

thus<00:01:48.720> automatically<00:01:49.619> makes<00:01:50.070> me<00:01:50.159> go<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.460> you

and faster than armed Superman what that

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.060 
and faster than armed Superman what that
means

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
means

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.920 
means
Goku<00:01:53.640> stronger<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.240> faster<00:01:54.450> than<00:01:54.659> Superman
