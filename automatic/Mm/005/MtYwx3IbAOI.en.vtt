00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
on another team in a different light and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.549 
on another team in a different light and
that's<00:00:57.360> really<00:00:57.660> what's<00:00:57.870> important<00:00:58.410> because

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
that's really what's important because

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.889 
that's really what's important because
the<00:00:58.890> coach<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.340> has<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.820> put<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.539> slot

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the coach that has you put you in a slot

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.139 
the coach that has you put you in a slot
based<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.039> he<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.309> available<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.969> him

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
based on what he has available to him

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.660 
based on what he has available to him
but<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.409> said<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.830> played<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.250> another

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
but like I said if you played on another

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.539 
but like I said if you played on another
team<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.600> play<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> next<00:01:07.049> level<00:01:07.549> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
team or you play at the next level the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.300 
team or you play at the next level the
configuration<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.900> team<00:01:10.229> might<00:01:10.890> put<00:01:11.159> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
configuration of that team might put you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.520 
configuration of that team might put you
in<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.549> different<00:01:11.790> role<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.049> very<00:01:13.229> very

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
in a different role so it's very very

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.890 
in a different role so it's very very
important<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.189> understand<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.900> so

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
important that you understand that so

the<00:05:04.950> disconnect<00:05:05.580> is<00:05:05.760> with<00:05:06.060> defenseman<00:05:06.570> and<00:05:06.900> I

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
the disconnect is with defenseman and I

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.379 
the disconnect is with defenseman and I

think it's a very important point and

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.409 
think it's a very important point and
it's<00:05:09.540> one<00:05:09.750> of<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:09.960> my<00:05:10.169> real<00:05:10.650> pet<00:05:10.919> peeves<00:05:11.419> every

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
it's one of the my real pet peeves every

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.690 
it's one of the my real pet peeves every
defenseman<00:05:13.139> has<00:05:13.530> to<00:05:13.770> be<00:05:13.919> able<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.220> make<00:05:14.400> plays
