to expect in games like this this game

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.740 
to expect in games like this this game
had<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.350> big<00:02:20.740> budget<00:02:21.250> behind<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.880> there's<00:02:22.450> no

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
had a big budget behind it there's no

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.120 
had a big budget behind it there's no
excuse<00:02:23.350> for<00:02:23.380> this

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
excuse for this

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.760 
excuse for this
it<00:02:24.520> kills<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.210> immersion<00:02:25.600> if<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.530> want<00:02:26.710> to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
it kills the immersion if you want to

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.250 
it kills the immersion if you want to
make<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.070> living<00:02:27.520> breathing<00:02:27.730> city<00:02:28.270> do<00:02:29.110> it

make this a living breathing city do it

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.320 
make this a living breathing city do it
right<00:02:29.500> but<00:02:30.190> they<00:02:30.250> don't<00:02:30.430> care<00:02:30.610> about<00:02:30.700> quality

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
right but they don't care about quality

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.000 
right but they don't care about quality
Ubisoft<00:02:31.810> doesn't<00:02:32.080> care<00:02:32.230> about<00:02:32.290> quality<00:02:32.890> what

takes one bullet to take down the
pedestrians<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.930> game<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:54.010> know

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
pedestrians in this game and you know

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.380 
pedestrians in this game and you know
you<00:02:54.190> might<00:02:54.400> be<00:02:54.460> thinking<00:02:54.580> well<00:02:54.940> that's<00:02:55.030> fine

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
you might be thinking well that's fine

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.110 
you might be thinking well that's fine
you<00:02:55.840> shoot<00:02:56.050> them<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.290> head<00:02:56.410> they're<00:02:56.800> dead

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
the legs even their tippy-toe one shot

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.110 
the legs even their tippy-toe one shot
and<00:03:05.200> they're<00:03:05.800> dead<00:03:06.130> I<00:03:06.460> mean<00:03:06.760> what<00:03:06.880> do<00:03:06.940> they<00:03:07.000> do

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
and they're dead I mean what do they do

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.030 
and they're dead I mean what do they do
they<00:03:07.780> just<00:03:07.810> Center<00:03:08.260> out<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.470> their<00:03:08.590> cubicles

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
they just Center out of their cubicles

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.920 
they just Center out of their cubicles
I'm<00:03:09.160> like<00:03:09.310> yeah<00:03:09.460> this<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.880> great<00:03:10.060> idea<00:03:10.300> let's

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
I'm like yeah this is a great idea let's

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.260 
I'm like yeah this is a great idea let's
make<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.200> where<00:03:11.440> one<00:03:11.920> shot<00:03:12.250> kills<00:03:12.580> all<00:03:12.820> that

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
make it where one shot kills all that

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.030 
make it where one shot kills all that
sounds<00:03:13.570> like<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:13.750> would<00:03:13.840> be<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.990> cheat<00:03:14.290> code<00:03:14.320> but

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
sounds like it would be a cheat code but

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.760 
sounds like it would be a cheat code but
to<00:03:15.160> have<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.340> just<00:03:15.730> in<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.480> game<00:03:16.750> that's<00:03:17.560> a

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
to have it just in the game that's a

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.280 
to have it just in the game that's a
little<00:03:17.950> odd<00:03:18.160> but<00:03:19.150> it's<00:03:19.330> funny<00:03:19.630> it's<00:03:20.050> kind<00:03:20.230> of

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
little odd but it's funny it's kind of

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.070 
little odd but it's funny it's kind of
ironic<00:03:20.410> because<00:03:21.340> once<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.120> criminal<00:03:22.420> pops<00:03:22.810> up

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
ironic because once a criminal pops up

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.050 
ironic because once a criminal pops up
on<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.350> map<00:03:23.590> he<00:03:24.010> doesn't<00:03:24.310> go<00:03:24.400> down<00:03:24.610> in<00:03:24.820> one

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
on the map he doesn't go down in one

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.470 
on the map he doesn't go down in one
shot

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
shot

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.610 
shot
oh<00:03:25.750> no<00:03:26.620> he<00:03:27.520> becomes<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:28.090> bullet<00:03:28.540> sponge<00:03:28.989> and<00:03:29.350> as

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
oh no he becomes a bullet sponge and as

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.949 
oh no he becomes a bullet sponge and as
I<00:03:29.830> took<00:03:29.890> down<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.580> criminal<00:03:31.180> as<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.510> can<00:03:31.660> see

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
I took down that criminal as you can see

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.810 
I took down that criminal as you can see
from<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.440> video<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.920> took<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.100> few<00:03:33.370> shots<00:03:33.610> to

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
from the video it took a few shots to

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.760 
from the video it took a few shots to
take<00:03:34.060> him<00:03:34.209> down<00:03:34.420> which<00:03:34.630> was<00:03:34.840> uh<00:03:34.900> like<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.530> said

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
take him down which was uh like I said

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.500 
take him down which was uh like I said
earlier<00:03:36.040> kind<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.459> ironic<00:03:36.910> considering<00:03:37.270> the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
earlier kind of ironic considering the

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.440 
earlier kind of ironic considering the
the<00:03:38.080> normal<00:03:38.350> pedestrians<00:03:39.190> only<00:03:39.459> take<00:03:40.180> one

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
the normal pedestrians only take one

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.110 
the normal pedestrians only take one
shot<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:40.989> then<00:03:41.080> they're<00:03:41.200> done<00:03:41.430> but<00:03:42.430> what<00:03:43.090> I

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
shot and then they're done but what I

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.510 
shot and then they're done but what I
really<00:03:43.450> want<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.660> focus<00:03:43.840> on<00:03:44.200> right<00:03:44.980> now<00:03:45.250> is

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
really want to focus on right now is

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.000 
really want to focus on right now is
that<00:03:45.760> once<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.330> went<00:03:46.540> up<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.959> body<00:03:47.230> there

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
that once I went up to the body there

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.440 
that once I went up to the body there
was<00:03:48.160> no<00:03:48.400> gore<00:03:49.239> or<00:03:49.630> blood<00:03:50.440> or<00:03:51.070> anything<00:03:51.450> like
