00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hi girls then this is the trick 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.089
 today I wanted to do a nice trick 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.179
 colored 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.740
 maybe because I don't know after the magician e 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.590
 it continues to rain continues to be there 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.260
 clouds weather sucks and does not want to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.760
 crazy of spring of summer therefore 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.320
 he wants to do a colorful trick and this 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.779
 what came out then 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.039
 annoy you like me very much 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.779
 because precisely despite being colored and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.930
 beautiful is beautiful and delicate 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.240
 in the sense that there are no color steps 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.070
 in the end it is vast, wrapping these vi 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.350
 I leave the tutorial that is better this way 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.360
 you can judge by the sun and do me 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.489
 know what you think I send you a 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.340
 big kiss 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:48.360
 hello as always, little prize over the whole 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:51.239
 part but then I take this eye shadow 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.910
 creamy Alaska and this old rose 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.100
 very nice and inside contains 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.360
 rose petals jojoba oil in the di 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.079
 sweet almonds therefore have held up a lot 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.239
 particular but above all the super thing 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.799
 pretty and that even if in an eye shadow 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.799
 creamy you see that does not leave 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.110
 absolutely no mercy there is perfect 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.700
 stays there like an eye shadow like a 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.790
 any normal powder eye shadow 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.229
 so you do n't even need to go 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.970
 to put on a powder eye shadow 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.560
 because so many times for example 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.659
 what i do my creamy bretti 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.939
 those that don't last that long because they go 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.740
 to immediately create the folds and go 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.850
 above with a powder eye shadow 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.220
 same color with this is not there 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.920
 absolutely need so i go to 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.829
 take it with his little brush is 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.220
 the only thing you have to be careful about 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.220
 and that must be faded immediately because yes 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.010
 it dries and then you don't go anymore 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.010
 can do anything so put it on 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.750
 I'm going to make another pass and even if 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.740
 go and make another pass don't go to 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.990
 forming the folds does not accumulate ed 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.430
 it really is you this moment 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.830
 really doing a lot for this 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.200
 it's a moment because it's really difficult 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.910
 find creamy eyeshadows that that in fact 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.600
 remain on the flood do not go to 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.930
 create crap around and yes 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.090
 manage to blend well 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.120
 see that I carry it up high 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.540
 towards the eyebrow 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.560
 continuing to blur after which I take 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.420
 a blue pencil and one to draw one 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.600
 line on the trough of the eyelashes 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.600
 lower 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.319
 I resume this eyeliner that this 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.140
 blue that shows green reflections 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:11.180
 very nice and I also go with this a 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.470
 draw a line over the pencil 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:20.579
 because you see that the color I love 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:22.530
 much brighter more beautiful trace 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.359
 a line also the attachment of the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:33.090
 upper lashes this time the little one 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:35.459
 black eyeliner and try to get it up 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.180
 to give you see this form beautiful struggles 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.180
 licata 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:58.170
 now I'm going to make a second tab 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.170
 with the blue one 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.630
 let's put this mascara on here 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.660
 large plast of the cover and we notice both 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:17.290
 superior solitude than with inferior ones 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:20.440
 from the bad scar black I like neither you 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.790
 nor a lot especially when when 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.270
 we put beautiful colored eyeliner 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.190
 no because otherwise you go to lose a 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.870
 little this eye contour that 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.870
 I think it is very beautiful 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.290
 then as always I have to put the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.290
 runner below 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.490
 now I'm going to do some talking 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.210
 then of course apple also put a little 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:31.980
 of plus these peach roses number 46 of 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:34.820
 debora and for this very delicate pink 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.820
 very nice 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.640
 on the lips this goes to put 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:55.500
 very short news of the Aev not this 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.500
 number 70 and is another hotel 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.620
 this then final result of 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.629
 makeup with this antique pink eyeshadow 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.400
 on the eyes this blue line below 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.919
 the lipstick news 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.360
 and I like it so much because it is 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.250
 colored 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.400
 it seems to me that we are in any case tones 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.289
 quite delicate enough light and 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.569
 nothing let me know how I stand for what 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.930
 you think you like it if you like it 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:36.080
 and I just greet you and instead go in the 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:40.130
 next video I do hello my name is 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.199

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.729
 recovering 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:45.729
