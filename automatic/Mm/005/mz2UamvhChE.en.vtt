can also use the pots with soft drinks
instead<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:43.910> potatoes<00:01:44.420> although<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.410> need<00:01:45.680> to

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
instead of potatoes although you need to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.500 
instead of potatoes although you need to
make<00:01:46.010> sure<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.610> plates<00:01:46.880> do<00:01:47.090> not<00:01:47.270> touch<00:01:47.450> each
