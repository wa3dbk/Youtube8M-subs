00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.990
 talk to her to continue her 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.120
 once 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.049
 Today I talk a little bit about 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.020
 circulation and commerce population because 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.780
 still need to circulate through a table a 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.740
 only the one of the filter fighting in the 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.190
 movie 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.830
 We can not leave the water standing still. 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.980
 of reasons is the first is the 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.860
 differences in temperature and 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.410
 Oxygen however is not given as 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.829
 a higher part of the dacon where water 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:45.379
 as in the lower part 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:47.920
 The reason is accumulation of 30 by 30 scuts 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.920
 dead 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.609
 this accumulation of food and nitrite it does not 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.489
 can run because when the decomposition 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:01.370
 or how the sun is a desert food in 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.960
 for they end up bringing injury 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.729
 ammonia liquid nitrite peak 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.560
 personal issues with a problem then 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.770
 President to have a good situation 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.649
 also efficient for each frame 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.140
 needs a certain amount 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:22.700
 situation and not had a circulation 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.680
 freshwater aquariums with non- freshwater 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.170
 there may be a lot of cotton circulation 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.950
 losing carbon dioxide is a movement 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.950
 above the surface 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.390
 saltwater aquarium several detained and 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.390
 eight soft corals need not have 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.939
 can benefit 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.759
 Hard coral chord already has a 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.149
 stronger status of coral type is 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.539
 coral paulo already lives in an area in the north 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.820
 teresa very strong situation already so 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.740
 that they have the ones they put 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.289
 for studies right? 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.600
 the focus on the bombs that we have 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.289
 today market 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.830
 Initially we used these 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:11.160
 small circulation pumps 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:15.060
 He used this little leather but only if 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.950
 does this before the invention of the bombs 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.209
 Strange, we used that kind of a lot . 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:24.420
 bomb or here's a thousand bomb 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.630
 liters / hour forgiveness and 303 hours and consumes 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.360
 8 vacancies 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.209
 she has a flow of it is concentrated by 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.790
 this output had a flow it has a 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.769
 pump that has a certain pressure but a 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.260
 Big theme flow is afterwards with the 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:48.359
 invention of the hands strings we have here in the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.209
 case is a thesis for 6 045 and the difference 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.780
 her to that other pump is a 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.600
 telethon 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.319
 the empire of this as if it were a form 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.860
 of a helle gives this bomb consumes 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.550
 incentives and the flow of it from 4,500 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:10.180
 liters per hour or the same as 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.870
 this pump consumes up - which is only 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.260
 this moves almost 15 times 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.020
 what is this movement and with this 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.300
 skin type and we have a very 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:27.459
 diffuse right ie the water circulation 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.590
 well-open stream gets a 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.310
 great area right? 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:39.700
 so today this more efficient type 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:42.610
 to buy a pump for 4 there is a 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.069
 a lot of people who ride almost never 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.160
 is a soul entering an exit from a 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:52.060
 actions in the aquarium where bitter a collection 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:57.130
 wise and returns for another 1 more leave 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.890
 13 have magnetic pumps at the 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.930
 own the marine technician who some 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.420
 depends on the outside and another part 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.519
 from the inside also some very 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.220
 efficient is that it has a controller 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.709
 that moves is that it controls the 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.930
 turns off the pump that by resonance 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.209
 you can move the whole mass 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.810
 almost I have here really 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.859
 I do not believe he even has a bomb coming down 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.859
 really is 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.250
 very interesting and today other brands 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.100
 also innovating with the controller 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.620
 separated is to divide the control 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.970
 variable is close to this effect is a 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.080
 how much circulation do you intend 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:44.259
 wait for almost a good job 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.210
 general personal recommendation is that you 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.150
 knows a circulation about ten 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.340
 times in all of the places that is near 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.310
 books on the subject but then 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.419
 average of 2 thousand liters hour 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.639
 this would put to fresh water is the 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:06.760
 saltwater work 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:09.970
 I would put in one for 200 liters and 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.220
 two of 2000 by a mixed appliance or 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.570
 or stop soft corals such as those 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.300
 hard 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.630
 the really hard coral aquarium is 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.430
 increase the circulation 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.310
 would put too much thing lines 40 times 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.130
 with 11 total dry air side themes 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.560
 as situation and if from today I 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.660
 I have approximately x only of bombs of 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:37.810
 circulation 7,500 liters hour is 4,500 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:41.010
 of maximum power but with a 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:44.470
 strange of the 3 thousand liters hour 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.960
 As everyone is getting adefal already 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.440
 it is difficult to maintain supposed fields 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.690
 by the growth of the pres, then I'm already 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.680
 seeing the alternatives to increase the 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:59.710
 I have seen, especially in the form 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.960
 water dollar salty nor need to have 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.490
 circulation in all corners precisely 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.020
 to prevent the accumulation of debris 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.729
 punished more than 40 hard courts 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.620
 can not have a quantity of matter 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.050
 very large organic but exploitation 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.159
 I'm not a fan of corals 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:20.919
 So not only remembering today we have the 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.330
 options of the songs bombs that the 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.490
 people put on top of the filter 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.150
 biological 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:29.310
 projects can still be used more 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.900
 it is not better or so old that the 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:37.680
 spending compared with the laws 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.810
 spent a lot of money and the flow 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.020
 water is much lower than it would be 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.880
 an extreme pump and gas with practically 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.620
 same thing and has a son who arrived 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.300
 much bigger 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:53.310
 is then an investment accommodation for 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.620
 who will ride for corals 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.490
 depending on the type of coral makes a 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:04.080
 more or less 30 times since the 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:08.159
 Total water volume of salt for and good 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.169
 luck to try to position your 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:13.080
 pumps in the best way that all 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:16.319
 volume of water circulates in a 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.090
 same without stirring the substrate this is a 

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:20.190
 big secret big problem all 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.139
 world has I stayed more than a month 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:26.580
 positioning a pump by switching a 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:29.060
 place to find the newest ideal point 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:32.250
 tunnel in which that be a bit 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.710
 or reposition any of the 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:37.050
 two pumps or put one more pump 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.349
 to resolve all the fields in the 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:43.469
 person from your club from all corners 

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:46.259
 demand a little work is a 

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:48.810
 little patience but no doubt 

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:53.340
 here others live, they can find the tone 

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:56.009
 Okay ok then this channel tip 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.889
 Moderator, do the book today. 

00:07:56.009 --> 00:08:00.840
 I hope to do it in the rivers soon and 

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:01.710
 so it was in time we managed to destroy 

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.710
 on the internet 

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:07.310
 ok guys a hug the river Brazil your
