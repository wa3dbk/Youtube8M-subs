home<00:00:36.010> to<00:00:36.160> it

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
home to it

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.340 
home to it
and<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.240> players<00:00:37.480> you<00:00:37.690> could<00:00:37.810> sense<00:00:38.110> them

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
and the players you could sense them

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.080 
and the players you could sense them
responding<00:00:39.040> to<00:00:39.220> the<00:00:39.310> proportions<00:00:39.820> of<00:00:39.970> the

responding to the proportions of the
room<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:40.560> for<00:00:41.560> a<00:00:41.620> piece<00:00:41.800> like<00:00:41.830> Brandenburg<00:00:42.460> 3

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
room and for a piece like Brandenburg 3

room and for a piece like Brandenburg 3
which<00:00:43.090> is<00:00:43.120> a<00:00:43.960> series<00:00:44.770> of<00:00:44.800> Trinity's<00:00:45.340> you<00:00:46.240> sense

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
which is a series of Trinity's you sense

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.960 
which is a series of Trinity's you sense
that<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.470> each<00:00:47.710> of<00:00:47.950> these<00:00:48.070> little<00:00:48.460> groupings

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
that the each of these little groupings

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.570 
that the each of these little groupings
are<00:00:49.240> interlocking<00:00:49.840> and<00:00:50.340> responding<00:00:51.340> so

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
are interlocking and responding so

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.700 
are interlocking and responding so
beautifully<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.990> sound<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.500> the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
to the suddenly produced in that in that

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.380 
to the suddenly produced in that in that
hall<00:00:56.170> you<00:00:56.620> pick<00:00:56.920> up<00:00:57.160> some<00:00:57.910> of<00:00:58.030> a<00:00:58.120> sort<00:00:58.330> of

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
hall you pick up some of a sort of

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.360 
hall you pick up some of a sort of
ghosts<00:00:58.810> and<00:00:58.960> shadows<00:00:58.990> of<00:00:59.560> this<00:00:59.740> his<00:01:00.190> own

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
ghosts and shadows of this his own

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.220 
ghosts and shadows of this his own
personality<00:01:00.820> so<00:01:01.750> there's<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.050> tremendous

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
personality so there's a tremendous

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.619 
personality so there's a tremendous
sense<00:01:02.740> of<00:01:02.920> discovery<00:01:03.400> and<00:01:03.790> as<00:01:04.030> far<00:01:04.360> as<00:01:04.420> we're

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
sense of discovery and as far as we're

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.050 
sense of discovery and as far as we're
concerned<00:01:04.659> rediscovery<00:01:05.650> of<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.490> ambient

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
concerned rediscovery of the the ambient

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.030 
concerned rediscovery of the the ambient
sounds<00:01:07.690> of<00:01:07.840> that<00:01:07.960> music<00:01:08.380> in<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.770> particular

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
sounds of that music in that particular

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.370 
sounds of that music in that particular
context<00:01:09.670> which<00:01:09.790> is<00:01:09.960> intoxicating

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:24.490

our<00:01:25.500> functioning<00:01:26.010> as<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.160> group<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.700> this

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
our functioning as a group in this

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.890 
our functioning as a group in this
particular<00:01:27.510> outfit<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.670> very<00:01:29.780> very<00:01:30.780> much

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
particular outfit is very very much

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.490 
particular outfit is very very much
linked<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.670> Jonathan<00:01:32.670> Donald's<00:01:33.000> approach

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
linked with Jonathan Donald's approach

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.160 
linked with Jonathan Donald's approach
and<00:01:34.500> most<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.640> us<00:01:35.730> we<00:01:35.970> play<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.510> I<00:01:36.810> have<00:01:37.020> also

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
and most of us we play now I have also

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.840 
and most of us we play now I have also
played<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.620> pocket<00:01:37.980> that's<00:01:38.160> a<00:01:38.280> pilgrimage

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
played in the pocket that's a pilgrimage

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.560 
played in the pocket that's a pilgrimage
eight<00:01:39.660> years<00:01:39.930> ago<00:01:40.050> and<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:41.160> done<00:01:41.370> a<00:01:41.670> year<00:01:42.090> of

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
eight years ago and have done a year of

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.830 
eight years ago and have done a year of
Bach<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:43.680> him<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.940> gave<00:01:45.150> us<00:01:45.180> some<00:01:45.330> kind

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
Bach with him and that gave us some kind

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.150 
Bach with him and that gave us some kind
of<00:01:46.020> formation<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.310> language<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
of formation in a language and it's a

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.520 
of formation in a language and it's a
continuous<00:01:50.729> journey<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:52.050> John<00:01:52.260> Eliot

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
continuous journey with John Eliot

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.340 
continuous journey with John Eliot
exploring<00:01:53.280> draft<00:01:53.520> language<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.140> think

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
exploring draft language and I think

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.340 
exploring draft language and I think
we're<00:01:55.500> very<00:01:55.530> steeped<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.930> because

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
we're very steeped in that and because

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.650 
we're very steeped in that and because
of<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.800> come<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.220> with<00:01:59.910> some<00:02:00.240> kind<00:02:00.509> of

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
of that we come to with some kind of

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.050 
of that we come to with some kind of
preconceived<00:02:01.440> grammar<00:02:01.800> for<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> language

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
preconceived grammar for the language

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.999 
preconceived grammar for the language
when<00:02:03.900> we<00:02:04.020> approach<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> species<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.950> that

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
when we approach the species and that

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.249 
when we approach the species and that
was<00:02:05.729> very<00:02:05.910> much<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.150> unifying<00:02:06.630> factor<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.200> that

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
was very much a unifying factor and that

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.840 
was very much a unifying factor and that
was<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:08.040> that<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.310> made<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
was that I think that that made the

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.270 
was that I think that that made the
process<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.920> assimilating<00:02:10.920> these<00:02:11.040> pieces

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
process of assimilating these pieces

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:23.470 
process of assimilating these pieces
much<00:02:11.670> easier

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.390 

when<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.600> know<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:25.110> right<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:26.130> so

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
when you know it's right it's so

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.520 
when you know it's right it's so
obviously<00:02:26.820> right<00:02:26.880> there<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.690> an<00:02:27.810> immediate<00:02:28.260> a

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
obviously right there is an immediate a

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.830 
obviously right there is an immediate a
sense<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.950> proportion<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.790> elegance<00:02:30.570> about

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
sense of proportion and elegance about

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.260 
sense of proportion and elegance about
the<00:02:31.410> music<00:02:31.680> making<00:02:31.860> but<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.400> no<00:02:32.610> sense<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:33.120> it

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
the music making but in no sense is it

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.910 
the music making but in no sense is it
artificial<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:34.320> something<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.770> is

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
artificial it's something that is

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.240 
artificial it's something that is
actually<00:02:35.190> intrinsic<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.390> physical

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
actually intrinsic to the physical

00:02:37.250 --> 00:03:06.140 
actually intrinsic to the physical
sensation<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.460> music

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.220 

because<00:03:07.150> it's<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.420> crystallization<00:03:08.140> of

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
because it's a crystallization of

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.839 
because it's a crystallization of
something<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.709> we've<00:03:08.920> gone<00:03:09.069> through<00:03:09.129> some

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
something that we've gone through some

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.900 
something that we've gone through some
kind<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.120> process<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.709> end<00:03:12.489> result<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.819> a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
kind of process the end result of a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.820 
kind of process the end result of a
process<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.390> very<00:03:13.569> different<00:03:13.989> from<00:03:14.200> from<00:03:14.709> its

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
process is very different from from its

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.699 
process is very different from from its
beginning<00:03:15.220> we<00:03:16.180> do<00:03:16.360> one<00:03:16.870> or<00:03:16.989> two<00:03:17.019> consists<00:03:17.560> and

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
beginning we do one or two consists and

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.650 
beginning we do one or two consists and
we<00:03:17.800> leave<00:03:17.950> them<00:03:18.129> for<00:03:18.340> couple<00:03:18.459> months<00:03:18.879> then<00:03:19.599> we

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
we leave them for couple months then we

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.750 
we leave them for couple months then we
come<00:03:19.840> back<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.920> that<00:03:21.129> time<00:03:21.340> of<00:03:21.519> reflection

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
come back and that time of reflection

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.869 
come back and that time of reflection
and<00:03:22.390> time<00:03:23.319> of<00:03:23.530> in<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.040> think<00:03:24.280> settling<00:03:24.670> down

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
and time of in a think settling down

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.199 
and time of in a think settling down
always<00:03:25.870> has<00:03:26.170> an<00:03:26.290> effect<00:03:26.640> by<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.700> time<00:03:27.970> that<00:03:28.150> we

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
always has an effect by the time that we

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.390 
always has an effect by the time that we
get<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.569> do<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:29.260> cut<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.680> Paris<00:03:29.980> concert

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
get to do to cut to the Paris concert

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.430 
get to do to cut to the Paris concert
and<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:31.120> will<00:03:31.239> be<00:03:31.330> taken<00:03:31.599> life<00:03:31.840> for<00:03:32.410> a

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
and that will be taken life for a

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.430 
and that will be taken life for a
recording<00:03:32.950> we<00:03:33.519> will<00:03:33.549> be<00:03:33.849> completely<00:03:34.629> free<00:03:35.620> and

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
recording we will be completely free and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.839 
recording we will be completely free and
we<00:03:38.440> can<00:03:38.470> just<00:03:38.829> play<00:03:39.010> with<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.280> pendant<00:03:39.670> and

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
we can just play with the pendant and

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.990 
we can just play with the pendant and
with<00:03:40.840> real<00:03:41.140> pure<00:03:41.680> enjoyment<00:03:42.040> because<00:03:42.519> all<00:03:42.849> the

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
with real pure enjoyment because all the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000 
with real pure enjoyment because all the
work<00:03:43.209> would<00:03:43.510> have<00:03:43.540> been<00:03:43.690> done<00:03:43.810> that<00:03:44.769> that's

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
work would have been done that that's

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.940 
work would have been done that that's
for<00:03:45.220> me<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.579> ultimate<00:03:45.849> goal<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.920> there<00:03:47.920> I

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
for me the ultimate goal and there I

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.800 
for me the ultimate goal and there I
think<00:03:48.489> that<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.269> best<00:03:49.420> recording

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
think that that the best recording

00:03:49.810 --> 00:04:04.280 
think that that the best recording
hopefully<00:03:50.200> will<00:03:50.349> be<00:03:50.440> different

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.440 

we've<00:04:05.290> tried<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.650> structure<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.280> whole<00:04:06.580> and

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
we've tried to structure this whole and

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.130 
we've tried to structure this whole and
Brandenburg<00:04:08.290> project<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:09.340> in<00:04:10.239> ways<00:04:10.750> that

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
Brandenburg project and in ways that

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.710 
Brandenburg project and in ways that
mean<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.220> we<00:04:12.340> have<00:04:12.730> taken<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.209> music<00:04:13.330> to

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
mean that we have taken the music to

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.809 
mean that we have taken the music to
different<00:04:14.140> places<00:04:14.440> that<00:04:15.190> we<00:04:15.250> rehearsed<00:04:15.459> in

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
different places that we rehearsed in

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.150 
different places that we rehearsed in
London<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.269> then<00:04:16.389> taking<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.169> Curtin<00:04:17.620> the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
London and then taking it to Curtin the

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.650 
London and then taking it to Curtin the
very<00:04:19.380> place<00:04:20.380> of<00:04:20.620> origin<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:21.100> that<00:04:21.220> music<00:04:21.660> and

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
very place of origin of that music and

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.810 
very place of origin of that music and
that<00:04:22.919> influenced<00:04:23.919> us<00:04:24.040> all<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.190> think<00:04:24.460> in<00:04:24.699> our

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
that influenced us all I think in our

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.340 
that influenced us all I think in our
approach<00:04:25.120> in<00:04:25.300> is<00:04:25.449> and<00:04:25.690> has<00:04:25.780> stayed<00:04:26.020> with<00:04:26.199> us

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
approach in is and has stayed with us

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.469 
approach in is and has stayed with us
and<00:04:26.680> from<00:04:27.070> there<00:04:27.220> we<00:04:27.340> took<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.760> Pisa<00:04:28.030> and

and from there we took it to Pisa and

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.030 
and from there we took it to Pisa and
that<00:04:28.660> brought<00:04:28.900> quite<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.350> different<00:04:29.830> type<00:04:30.010> of

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
that brought quite a different type of

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.310 
that brought quite a different type of
dynamic<00:04:30.580> in<00:04:30.729> a<00:04:30.790> different<00:04:31.060> atmosphere<00:04:31.290> to<00:04:32.290> the
