feeling<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.740> terms<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.939> display

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
feeling for now in terms of the display

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.340 
feeling for now in terms of the display
I<00:01:19.080> think<00:01:19.439> guys<00:01:19.619> insane<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.759> about<00:01:20.990> 577<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
I think guys insane it's about 577 and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.490 
I think guys insane it's about 577 and
PPI<00:01:23.220> obviously<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.909> not<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.390> about<00:01:24.570> pixel<00:01:25.320> is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
PPI obviously is not just about pixel is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.560 
PPI obviously is not just about pixel is
about<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.950> color<00:01:26.310> saturation<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.299> viewing

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
about the color saturation the viewing

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.140 
about the color saturation the viewing
angles<00:01:27.900> etc<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.619> think<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.670> by<00:01:29.820> far<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
angles etc I think this is by far the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.620 
angles etc I think this is by far the
best<00:01:30.509> display<00:01:31.320> I've<00:01:31.500> seen<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.040> ages<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.700> haven't

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
best display I've seen in ages I haven't

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.490 
best display I've seen in ages I haven't
used<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.369> 2k<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.400> quad<00:01:36.060> HD<00:01:36.420> screen<00:01:36.750> before<00:01:36.930> I've

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
used a 2k or quad HD screen before I've

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.590 
used a 2k or quad HD screen before I've
user<00:01:37.890> experience<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.820> free<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.450> plus

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
user experience it free and a one plus

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.590 
user experience it free and a one plus
one<00:01:39.720> obviously<00:01:40.470> they're<00:01:40.710> 1080p<00:01:41.310> ponds<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.210> for

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
one obviously they're 1080p ponds so for

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600 
one obviously they're 1080p ponds so for
me<00:01:42.750> anyway<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.590> would<00:01:43.829> look<00:01:44.040> much<00:01:44.310> better

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
me anyway this would look much better

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.450 
me anyway this would look much better
but<00:01:45.600> let<00:01:45.780> me<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.259> guys<00:01:46.409> use<00:01:46.740> our<00:01:46.950> 2k

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
but let me know if you guys use our 2k

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.539 
but let me know if you guys use our 2k
display<00:01:47.640> phones<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.689> Howie<00:01:49.470> how<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.159> found

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
display phones and Howie how you found

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.550 
display phones and Howie how you found
the<00:01:50.700> screen<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.270> honestly<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.439> is

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the screen I honestly think this is

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.520 
the screen I honestly think this is
insane<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> phone<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.060> terms<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.810> camera<00:01:55.259> so

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
insane for a phone in terms of camera so

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.190 
insane for a phone in terms of camera so
camera<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.130> launches<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.790> 0.7<00:01:57.630> seconds<00:01:58.049> if

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
camera just launches in 0.7 seconds if

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.230 
camera just launches in 0.7 seconds if
you<00:01:58.229> don't<00:01:58.469> put<00:01:58.590> up<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> home<00:01:59.009> bar<00:01:59.219> night<00:01:59.490> you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
you don't put up the home bar night you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:41.809 
you don't put up the home bar night you
are<00:02:00.329> saying<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> camera

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.460 

so<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:42.970> front<00:02:43.209> you've<00:02:43.390> got<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.750> five-minute

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
so the front you've got the five-minute

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.860 
so the front you've got the five-minute
pixel<00:02:44.799> here<00:02:45.099> and<00:02:45.310> at<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.120> back<00:02:46.269> in<00:02:46.480> verse<00:02:46.659> 16

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
pixel here and at the back in verse 16

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.009 
pixel here and at the back in verse 16
megapixel<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:48.370> both<00:02:48.519> have<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.760> picture<00:02:49.299> of<00:02:49.329> 1.9

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
megapixel the both have a picture of 1.9

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.920 
megapixel the both have a picture of 1.9
and<00:02:50.700> overall<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.939> be<00:02:52.090> honest<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.480> really<00:02:52.510> love

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930

protruding bumps or Samsung knew that by

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.210 
protruding bumps or Samsung knew that by
making<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:59.079> protruding<00:02:59.620> they'll<00:02:59.799> be<00:02:59.950> able<00:03:00.010> to

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
making a protruding they'll be able to

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.869 
making a protruding they'll be able to
help<00:03:00.609> the<00:03:01.000> camera<00:03:01.709> collies<00:03:02.709> in<00:03:03.129> terms<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.609> the

help the camera collies in terms of the
performance<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:05.260> performance<00:03:05.290> for<00:03:06.099> me<00:03:06.250> has

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
performance the performance for me has

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.220 
performance the performance for me has
been<00:03:06.489> very<00:03:06.970> good<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.359> like<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.930> fact<00:03:08.079> that

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
been very good I like the fact that

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.759 
been very good I like the fact that
Samsung<00:03:08.799> have<00:03:09.010> trimmed<00:03:09.370> down<00:03:09.549> TouchWiz<00:03:10.180> and

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
Samsung have trimmed down TouchWiz and

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.259 
Samsung have trimmed down TouchWiz and
drastically<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:12.159> made<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.730> lot<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.209> stuff

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
drastically and made a lot of this stuff

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.379 
drastically and made a lot of this stuff
optionally<00:03:14.430> downloadable<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:16.000> if<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.239> guys

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
optionally downloadable so if you guys

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.000 
optionally downloadable so if you guys
want<00:03:16.659> to<00:03:16.780> get<00:03:16.959> any<00:03:17.139> of<00:03:17.290> those<00:03:17.440> stuff<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.829> can

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
want to get any of those stuff you can

want to get any of those stuff you can
download<00:03:18.250> them<00:03:18.609> is<00:03:18.849> trimmed<00:03:19.629> down<00:03:19.810> now<00:03:20.109> so

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
download them is trimmed down now so

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500 
download them is trimmed down now so
basically<00:03:21.340> help<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.670> performance<00:03:22.209> of<00:03:22.299> it

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
basically help the performance of it

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.440 
basically help the performance of it
much<00:03:23.139> more<00:03:23.439> obviously<00:03:24.280> scored<00:03:24.639> 64-bit

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
much more obviously scored 64-bit

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.500 
much more obviously scored 64-bit
octa-core<00:03:25.599> processor<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:27.040> battery<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.790> so

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
octa-core processor the battery and so

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.420 
octa-core processor the battery and so
it's<00:03:28.659> got<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.930> wireless<00:03:29.139> charging<00:03:29.680> for<00:03:30.310> the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
it's got the wireless charging for the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.369 
it's got the wireless charging for the
wireless<00:03:30.579> charger<00:03:31.120> with<00:03:31.299> me<00:03:31.329> I<00:03:31.689> can<00:03:32.170> show<00:03:32.319> you

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
wireless charger with me I can show you

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.009 
wireless charger with me I can show you
to<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:33.060> I've<00:03:34.060> actually<00:03:34.269> done<00:03:34.569> a<00:03:34.629> separate

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
to you I've actually done a separate

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.819 
to you I've actually done a separate
video<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:37.109> but<00:03:38.109> you<00:03:38.199> could<00:03:38.379> do<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.530> full

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
video of that but you could do a full

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.069 
video of that but you could do a full
charge<00:03:39.069> takes<00:03:39.190> one<00:03:39.730> hour<00:03:39.760> 20<00:03:40.090> minutes<00:03:40.569> with

charge takes one hour 20 minutes with
the<00:03:41.199> wireless<00:03:41.379> charger<00:03:41.889> obviously<00:03:42.340> take

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
the wireless charger obviously take

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.460 
the wireless charger obviously take
slightly<00:03:42.910> longer<00:03:43.060> but<00:03:43.660> anyway<00:03:43.989> guys<00:03:44.199> that's

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
the fingerprinting revamp so what you

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.030 
the fingerprinting revamp so what you
could<00:04:22.280> do<00:04:22.460> is<00:04:22.790> you<00:04:23.150> go<00:04:23.510> into<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:25.330> lock<00:04:26.330> screen

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
could do is you go into the lock screen

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:35.080 
could do is you go into the lock screen
and<00:04:28.040> you're<00:04:29.030> going<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:32.950> fingerprint<00:04:34.090> now

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
and you're going to fingerprint now

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.930 
and you're going to fingerprint now
instead<00:04:35.389> of<00:04:35.450> swiping<00:04:35.720> it<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.350> could<00:04:36.560> just

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
instead of swiping it you could just

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.870 
instead of swiping it you could just
quickly<00:04:38.380> put<00:04:39.380> your<00:04:39.500> finger<00:04:39.800> on<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.160> you

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
quickly put your finger on and you

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.730 
quickly put your finger on and you
basically<00:04:41.120> are<00:04:41.479> look<00:04:41.840> so<00:04:42.050> it's<00:04:42.169> much<00:04:42.350> more<00:04:42.380> so

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
basically are look so it's much more so

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.050 
basically are look so it's much more so
if<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:42.919> don't<00:04:43.070> have<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.370> swipe<00:04:43.550> it<00:04:43.729> anymore

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
if you don't have to swipe it anymore

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.520 
if you don't have to swipe it anymore
just<00:04:44.330> put<00:04:44.570> your<00:04:44.660> finger<00:04:44.930> on<00:04:44.960> any<00:04:45.260> work

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
just put your finger on any work

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.010 
just put your finger on any work
straight<00:04:45.830> away<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.669> that's<00:04:46.880> very<00:04:46.940> good<00:04:47.300> anyway
