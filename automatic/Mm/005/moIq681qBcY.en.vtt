it's only loose when this sucker gets

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.170 
it's only loose when this sucker gets
hot<00:04:20.930> after<00:04:21.380> usage<00:04:21.769> and<00:04:21.980> only<00:04:22.760> then<00:04:22.940> can<00:04:23.090> i

hot after usage and only then can i
change<00:04:23.360> my<00:04:23.600> batteries<00:04:27.460> so<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.760> lesson<00:04:28.940> is

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
change my batteries so the lesson is

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.180 
change my batteries so the lesson is
don't<00:04:30.920> put<00:04:31.340> soda<00:04:31.760> cans<00:04:32.090> in<00:04:32.480> the<00:04:32.890> laptop<00:04:33.890> bag

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
welcome to part 2 this is the reassembly

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.560 
welcome to part 2 this is the reassembly
of<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.280> stylistic<00:04:43.669> 3500<00:04:44.630> tablet<00:04:45.730> now<00:04:46.730> I've

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
of the stylistic 3500 tablet now I've

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.720 
of the stylistic 3500 tablet now I've
already<00:04:47.720> gone<00:04:48.050> ahead<00:04:48.200> put<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.250> speaker<00:04:49.550> back

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
already gone ahead put the speaker back

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.030 
already gone ahead put the speaker back
in<00:04:49.970> threaded<00:04:50.870> it<00:04:50.990> through<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:51.350> channel<00:04:51.740> it's

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
in threaded it through the channel it's

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.240 
in threaded it through the channel it's
important<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.490> do<00:04:52.669> that<00:04:53.710> next<00:04:54.710> we've<00:04:54.950> got<00:04:54.980> the

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
important to do that next we've got the

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.640 
important to do that next we've got the
mainboard<00:04:55.669> I<00:04:55.990> would<00:04:56.990> normally<00:04:57.140> put<00:04:57.500> this

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
mainboard I would normally put this

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.790 
mainboard I would normally put this
straight<00:04:57.950> in<00:04:58.160> but<00:04:58.880> remember<00:05:00.640> the<00:05:01.640> serial<00:05:02.480> port

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
straight in but remember the serial port

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.040 
straight in but remember the serial port
must<00:05:03.800> clip<00:05:04.190> on<00:05:04.400> right<00:05:04.820> here<00:05:05.180> underneath<00:05:05.780> the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
must clip on right here underneath the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.820 
must clip on right here underneath the
main<00:05:06.230> board<00:05:06.560> in<00:05:07.210> addition<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:10.190> heat<00:05:10.460> pipe

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
main board in addition the heat pipe

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.040 
main board in addition the heat pipe
passes<00:05:12.830> through<00:05:13.100> and<00:05:13.310> mounts<00:05:13.850> to<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.480> serial

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
passes through and mounts to the serial

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.470 
passes through and mounts to the serial
port<00:05:16.540> so<00:05:18.520> my<00:05:19.520> recommendation<00:05:19.760> is<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:20.510> go<00:05:20.810> ahead

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
port so my recommendation is to go ahead

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.369 
port so my recommendation is to go ahead
reattach

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
then once that's attached again it's

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.149 
then once that's attached again it's
