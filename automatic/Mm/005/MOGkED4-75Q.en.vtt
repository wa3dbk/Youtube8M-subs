I'd<00:00:30.599> probably<00:00:30.810> recommend<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.980> doing

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
I'd probably recommend not doing

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.799 
I'd probably recommend not doing
anything<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.450> get<00:00:33.630> caught<00:00:34.460> if

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
anything because if you get caught if

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.850 
anything because if you get caught if
someone<00:00:36.809> sees<00:00:36.989> your<00:00:37.170> screen<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:37.800> see

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
someone sees your screen and they see

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
someone sees your screen and they see
you<00:00:38.160> trying<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.790> these<00:00:39.270> sites<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
you trying to get on these sites in the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.959 
you trying to get on these sites in the
first<00:00:39.960> place<00:00:40.140> you'll<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.559> banned<00:00:40.800> anyway<00:00:41.190> but

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
first place you'll get banned anyway but

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.270 
first place you'll get banned anyway but
if<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.170> really<00:00:43.379> want<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> go<00:00:43.649> ahead<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
if you really want to go ahead and do it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.369 
if you really want to go ahead and do it
the<00:00:44.969> way<00:00:45.149> I'd<00:00:45.300> recommend<00:00:45.629> doing<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.200> because

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the way I'd recommend doing it because

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.319 
the way I'd recommend doing it because
your<00:00:46.800> command<00:00:47.460> prompts<00:00:47.670> blocked<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.239> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
your command prompts blocked so you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.139 
your command prompts blocked so you
can't<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.629> anything<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> command<00:00:49.379> prompt

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
can't do anything for the command prompt

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.520 
can't do anything for the command prompt
yeah<00:00:51.149> even<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.809> could<00:00:51.960> get<00:00:52.050> hold<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.379> their

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
yeah even if you could get hold of their

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.310 
yeah even if you could get hold of their
IP<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> ip's<00:00:53.340> blocked<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.199> you'll<00:00:55.199> get

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
IP the ip's blocked and you'll get

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.170 
IP the ip's blocked and you'll get
banned<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.770> use<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> proxy<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.520> there<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
banned if you use a proxy so there is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.979 
banned if you use a proxy so there is
another<00:00:57.420> way<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.600> go<00:00:57.840> about<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.340> I<00:00:59.989> wouldn't

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
another way to go about this I wouldn't

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.020 
another way to go about this I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:01.739> I'll<00:01:02.010> say<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.460> anyway<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
recommend it but I'll say it anyway and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.660 
recommend it but I'll say it anyway and
I've<00:01:03.600> done<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> video<00:01:04.739> previously<00:01:05.280> on

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
I've done a video previously on

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.340 
I've done a video previously on
something<00:01:06.060> called<00:01:06.240> remote<00:01:06.479> access<00:01:07.080> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
something called remote access and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.950 
something called remote access and
basically<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.880> install<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> client<00:01:09.689> on

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
basically you can install the client on

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.740 
basically you can install the client on
your<00:01:10.080> computer<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.390> run<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
your computer and it can run in the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.480 
your computer and it can run in the
taskbar<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.040> access<00:01:14.430> your

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
taskbar and then you can access your

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.120 
taskbar and then you can access your
computer<00:01:14.820> from<00:01:15.240> anywhere<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.409> instead<00:01:17.070> of

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
computer from anywhere so instead of

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.710 
computer from anywhere so instead of
trying<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.759> directly<00:01:18.150> connect<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> these

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
trying to directly connect to these

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.580 
trying to directly connect to these
websites<00:01:19.259> through<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:21.229> these<00:01:22.229> addresses

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
websites through your these addresses

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.170 
websites through your these addresses
that<00:01:22.979> you're<00:01:23.100> finding<00:01:23.490> all<00:01:23.610> these<00:01:23.700> proxies<00:01:24.150> or

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that you're finding all these proxies or

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.149 
that you're finding all these proxies or
things<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.990> instead<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.890> doing

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
things like that and instead of doing

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.320 
things like that and instead of doing
that<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.610> connect<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.119> own

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that you can connect to your own

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.109 
that you can connect to your own
computer<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.170> then<00:01:28.650> view<00:01:29.579> your<00:01:29.610> own<00:01:29.939> computer

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
computer and then view your own computer

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.910 
computer and then view your own computer
as<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:30.840> you're<00:01:30.960> sitting<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.350> front<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
as if you're sitting in front of it and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.170 
as if you're sitting in front of it and
then<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.280> access<00:01:32.549> your<00:01:32.610> website<00:01:32.909> through

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
then you can access your website through

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.700 
then you can access your website through
that<00:01:33.329> because<00:01:33.509> you're<00:01:33.810> technically<00:01:34.439> not

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that because you're technically not

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.170

these websites you use in your own

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.499 
these websites you use in your own

because you're connecting to yourself so

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.700 
because you're connecting to yourself so
you<00:01:39.570> gotta<00:01:39.720> make<00:01:39.869> sure<00:01:39.900> your<00:01:40.170> computer's<00:01:40.560> on

things

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.790 
things
but<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.360> 1i<00:02:09.510> most<00:02:09.960> recommend<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.590> doing

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
but the 1i most recommend for doing

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.040 
but the 1i most recommend for doing
something<00:02:11.010> like<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.930> something<00:02:12.930> for

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
something like this is something for

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.600 
something like this is something for
logmein<00:02:13.230> com<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:14.070> i've<00:02:14.100> said<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.400> previously

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
logmein com and i've said it previously

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.630 
logmein com and i've said it previously
all<00:02:14.910> set<00:02:15.150> again<00:02:16.160> basically<00:02:17.160> go<00:02:17.400> on<00:02:17.460> logmein

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
all set again basically go on logmein

com you download what this little client
is<00:02:21.300> got<00:02:21.540> because<00:02:21.720> logmein<00:02:22.200> are<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.380> same

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
is got because logmein are the same

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.880 
is got because logmein are the same
people<00:02:22.710> who<00:02:22.890> do<00:02:23.220> hamachi<00:02:23.610> which<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.860> what<00:02:25.860> I

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
people who do hamachi which is what I

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.220 
people who do hamachi which is what I
explained<00:02:26.460> what<00:02:26.490> I'm<00:02:26.970> not<00:02:27.630> quite<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.840> while<00:02:27.990> ago

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
explained what I'm not quite a while ago

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.300 
explained what I'm not quite a while ago
I<00:02:28.260> think<00:02:28.470> yesterday<00:02:28.620> or<00:02:28.950> something<00:02:29.160> like<00:02:29.250> that

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
I think yesterday or something like that

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.710 
I think yesterday or something like that
where<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.730> talked<00:02:30.000> about<00:02:30.180> virtual<00:02:30.570> private

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
where I talked about virtual private

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.060 
where I talked about virtual private
networks<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.470> can<00:02:31.620> Network<00:02:31.920> your

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
networks and you can Network your

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.410 
networks and you can Network your
computers<00:02:32.430> up<00:02:32.580> you're<00:02:33.060> not<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.360> use

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
computers up you're not going to use

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.090 
computers up you're not going to use
hamachi<00:02:33.690> for<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.230> time<00:02:34.410> being<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.890> don't

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
hamachi for the time being so I don't

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.570 
hamachi for the time being so I don't
think<00:02:35.280> you'd<00:02:36.000> be<00:02:36.150> able<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.420> do<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.810> using

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
think you'd be able to do that using

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
think you'd be able to do that using
your<00:02:38.580> college<00:02:38.850> network<00:02:39.060> because<00:02:39.450> they're

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
your college network because they're

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.240 
your college network because they're
probably<00:02:39.780> got<00:02:40.320> security<00:02:40.710> or<00:02:40.890> something<00:02:41.160> or

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
probably got security or something or

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.450 
probably got security or something or
well<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.560> assuming<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.250> logmein

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
well so this is assuming that logmein

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.270 
well so this is assuming that logmein
com<00:02:44.750> isn't<00:02:45.750> unblocked<00:02:46.200> now<00:02:46.740> it<00:02:46.950> should

com isn't unblocked now it should

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.870 
com isn't unblocked now it should
be<00:02:47.310> unblocked<00:02:49.430> because<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.550> doesn't<00:02:50.580> say

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
be unblocked because it doesn't say

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.550 
be unblocked because it doesn't say

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
anything about proxy alerts when it says

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.590 
anything about proxy alerts when it says
is<00:02:52.650> about<00:02:52.680> as<00:02:52.920> remote<00:02:53.190> access<00:02:53.640> but<00:02:53.880> if<00:02:54.120> your

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
is about as remote access but if your

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.930 
is about as remote access but if your
college<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.200> or<00:02:55.710> school<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.130> clever<00:02:56.430> then

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
college is or school is clever then

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.250 
college is or school is clever then
they've<00:02:57.090> already<00:02:57.270> blocked<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.720> as<00:02:57.900> well<00:02:58.020> and

they've already blocked this as well and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
actually prove useful if you've

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.450

prove<00:03:20.070> useful<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.850> could<00:03:20.970> argue<00:03:21.450> that

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
prove useful so you could argue that

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.540 
prove useful so you could argue that
this<00:03:21.990> is<00:03:22.140> useful<00:03:22.350> but<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:23.810> really<00:03:24.810> just<00:03:25.550> your

with things like having problems
accessing<00:04:14.070> websites<00:04:14.430> because<00:04:14.910> you're<00:04:15.240> going

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
accessing websites because you're going

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.720 
accessing websites because you're going
through<00:04:15.870> your<00:04:16.020> own<00:04:16.109> computer<00:04:16.580> instead

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
through your own computer instead

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.740 
through your own computer instead
of<00:04:17.790> whatever<00:04:18.660> computer<00:04:19.140> you're<00:04:19.290> using<00:04:19.400> so

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
of whatever computer you're using so

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.180 
of whatever computer you're using so
again<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:22.020> can<00:04:22.170> argue<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.770> fact<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.040> you

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
again you can argue the fact that you

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.560 
again you can argue the fact that you
might<00:04:23.370> need<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.580> connect<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.000> home<00:04:24.180> for<00:04:24.390> some

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
might need to connect to home for some

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.210 
might need to connect to home for some
reason<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.080> get<00:04:25.350> some<00:04:25.560> work<00:04:25.710> or<00:04:25.980> something

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
reason to get some work or something

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.670 
reason to get some work or something
like<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.340> but<00:04:26.700> either<00:04:27.480> way<00:04:27.750> this<00:04:27.960> is<00:04:28.140> as<00:04:28.530> an

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
like that but either way this is as an

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.780 
like that but either way this is as an
alternative<00:04:29.100> way<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.250> do<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.550> because

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
alternative way to do it because

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.970 
alternative way to do it because
otherwise<00:04:30.600> you're<00:04:30.930> going<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.110> keep<00:04:31.410> tryna<00:04:31.680> and

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
otherwise you're going to keep tryna and

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.730 
otherwise you're going to keep tryna and
I<00:04:32.730> don't<00:04:33.150> know<00:04:33.240> do<00:04:33.630> these<00:04:33.900> special<00:04:34.290> hex<00:04:34.560> that

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
I don't know do these special hex that

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.200 
I don't know do these special hex that
people<00:04:35.160> say<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.640> you<00:04:35.760> can<00:04:35.880> get<00:04:36.030> through

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
people say that you can get through

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.900 
people say that you can get through
proxies<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:36.870> things<00:04:37.050> like<00:04:37.140> that<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.910> 41

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
proxies and things like that and 41

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.420 
proxies and things like that and 41
proxies<00:04:39.570> are<00:04:39.600> incredibly<00:04:40.200> slow<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:40.890> another

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
proxies are incredibly slow and another

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.690 
proxies are incredibly slow and another
one<00:04:41.730> is<00:04:41.910> that<00:04:42.090> they<00:04:42.330> usually<00:04:42.960> don't<00:04:43.700> connect

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
one is that they usually don't connect

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.400 
one is that they usually don't connect
to<00:04:44.850> specific<00:04:45.270> websites<00:04:45.630> you<00:04:45.840> want<00:04:46.020> anyway<00:04:46.350> so

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
to specific websites you want anyway so

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.010 
to specific websites you want anyway so
it's<00:04:47.250> better<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.730> just<00:04:47.940> view<00:04:48.210> your<00:04:48.360> own<00:04:48.480> PC<00:04:48.900> at

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
it's better to just view your own PC at

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.500 
it's better to just view your own PC at
home<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.530> then<00:04:50.190> access<00:04:51.030> your<00:04:51.150> sites<00:04:51.330> because

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
home and then access your sites because

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.080 
home and then access your sites because
then<00:04:51.690> you've<00:04:51.780> got<00:04:51.870> unlimited<00:04:51.960> access<00:04:52.350> so

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
then you've got unlimited access so

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
then you've got unlimited access so
that's<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.330> only<00:04:54.360> thing<00:04:54.630> I<00:04:54.750> can<00:04:54.810> really

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
that's the only thing I can really

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.260 
that's the only thing I can really
suggest<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.860> mean<00:04:56.040> again<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.640> I<00:04:56.880> strongly

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
suggest I mean again I I strongly

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.820 
suggest I mean again I I strongly
recommend<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.660> don't<00:04:57.900> really<00:04:58.320> do<00:04:58.620> this

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
recommend you don't really do this

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.930 
recommend you don't really do this
because<00:04:58.950> if<00:04:59.160> you<00:04:59.250> get<00:04:59.370> caught<00:04:59.610> doing<00:04:59.820> this

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
because if you get caught doing this

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.390
