and<00:00:29.789> then<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.390> pump<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.720> level<00:00:30.990> up<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.289> course

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529

it's<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> add<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> little<00:00:32.250> bit<00:00:32.430> more

extremely<00:05:16.280> well<00:05:16.540> it<00:05:17.540> has<00:05:17.720> one<00:05:18.110> primary<00:05:18.560> sound

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
extremely well it has one primary sound

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.010 
extremely well it has one primary sound
but<00:05:19.910> it<00:05:20.000> works<00:05:20.180> really<00:05:20.420> well<00:05:20.600> with<00:05:20.750> almost

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
but it works really well with almost

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.290 
but it works really well with almost
everything<00:05:21.320> I<00:05:21.500> plugged<00:05:21.800> in<00:05:21.980> through<00:05:22.160> it<00:05:22.310> the

everything I plugged in through it the

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.450 
everything I plugged in through it the
downside<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:23.960> this<00:05:24.050> pedal<00:05:24.380> for<00:05:24.530> me<00:05:24.620> is<00:05:24.890> that<00:05:25.220> it

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
downside to this pedal for me is that it

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.220 
downside to this pedal for me is that it
really<00:05:25.820> wants<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.360> have<00:05:26.480> your<00:05:26.630> guitar<00:05:26.750> plugged

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
really wants to have your guitar plugged

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.340 
really wants to have your guitar plugged
directly<00:05:27.410> in<00:05:28.240> almost<00:05:29.240> any<00:05:29.450> pedal<00:05:29.870> in<00:05:30.020> front<00:05:30.260> of

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
directly in almost any pedal in front of

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.960 
directly in almost any pedal in front of
this<00:05:30.470> pedal<00:05:30.710> kind<00:05:31.430> of<00:05:31.520> takes<00:05:31.700> some<00:05:31.760> of<00:05:31.880> the

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
this pedal kind of takes some of the

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.240 
this pedal kind of takes some of the
magic<00:05:32.090> out<00:05:32.390> of<00:05:32.420> it<00:05:32.570> for<00:05:32.810> me<00:05:32.840> I<00:05:33.110> can<00:05:33.800> fit<00:05:34.010> it<00:05:34.130> out

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
magic out of it for me I can fit it out

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.330 
magic out of it for me I can fit it out
in<00:05:34.370> some<00:05:34.580> odd<00:05:34.700> ways<00:05:35.230> so<00:05:36.230> when<00:05:37.040> I'm<00:05:37.160> in<00:05:37.190> a

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
in some odd ways so when I'm in a

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.190 
in some odd ways so when I'm in a
position<00:05:37.640> where<00:05:38.030> I<00:05:38.330> just<00:05:38.630> need<00:05:38.780> you<00:05:39.080> know<00:05:39.170> a

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270

if you back this down let me put this

back to the bridge pick up normal tone
about<00:06:11.900> the<00:06:12.230> lowest<00:06:12.500> setting<00:06:13.010> you<00:06:13.040> can<00:06:13.220> get<00:06:13.430> is

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
about the lowest setting you can get is

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.910 
about the lowest setting you can get is
about<00:06:13.850> to<00:06:14.000> play<00:06:14.300> to<00:06:14.360> me<00:06:14.660> that's<00:06:15.020> usable<00:06:15.650> and

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
about to play to me that's usable and

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.350 
about to play to me that's usable and
it's<00:06:16.160> a<00:06:16.220> clean<00:06:16.490> sound<00:06:16.790> but<00:06:16.970> it<00:06:17.060> still<00:06:17.180> has<00:06:17.300> a

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
it's a clean sound but it still has a

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:25.840 
it's a clean sound but it still has a
little<00:06:17.570> hair<00:06:17.750> to<00:06:17.930> it<00:06:24.010> so<00:06:25.010> this<00:06:25.160> is<00:06:25.220> your<00:06:25.370> sort

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
little hair to it so this is your sort

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.280 
little hair to it so this is your sort
of<00:06:25.910> clean<00:06:26.120> tone<00:06:26.360> then<00:06:26.570> you've<00:06:26.690> got<00:06:26.810> no<00:06:26.960> problem

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.290 
of clean tone then you've got no problem

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.650
