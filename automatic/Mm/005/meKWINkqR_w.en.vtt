00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.569 

I've<00:01:07.990> got<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.259> say<00:01:08.409> it<00:01:08.619> describes<00:01:09.100> itself<00:01:09.399> as

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
I've got to say it describes itself as

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.459 
I've got to say it describes itself as
ginger<00:01:09.880> ale<00:01:10.180> but<00:01:10.210> in<00:01:10.570> many<00:01:10.750> ways<00:01:10.810> it<00:01:11.110> tastes

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469

ginger ale but in many ways it tastes
more<00:01:11.649> like<00:01:11.710> lemonade<00:01:12.460> would<00:01:12.729> you<00:01:12.850> believe<00:01:13.000> it

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299

more like lemonade would you believe it
let's<00:01:13.689> give<00:01:13.869> it<00:01:13.899> another<00:01:14.170> test<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:19.030> quite

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
let's give it another test was quite

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.389 
let's give it another test was quite
strong<00:01:19.719> actually<00:01:20.079> you're<00:01:20.170> not<00:01:20.200> too<00:01:20.439> busy<00:01:20.679> but

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
strong actually you're not too busy but

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:22.919 
strong actually you're not too busy but
it's<00:01:21.549> only<00:01:21.759> got<00:01:21.939> a<00:01:21.969> strong<00:01:22.270> flavor<00:01:22.600> when<00:01:22.810> it

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
it's only got a strong flavor when it

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:28.040 
it's only got a strong flavor when it
goes<00:01:23.140> down<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.860> throat

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.970 

I<00:01:28.910> certainly<00:01:29.910> got<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.120> very<00:01:30.480> cooling<00:01:31.050> flavor<00:01:31.410> by

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980

feeling<00:01:32.370> cool<00:01:32.610> ready<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.510> I<00:01:33.630> was<00:01:33.750> sweating

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
feeling cool ready and I was sweating

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.340 
feeling cool ready and I was sweating
like<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> pig<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:34.890> sauna<00:01:35.160> but<00:01:36.060> hopefully<00:01:36.690> some

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
like a pig in a sauna but hopefully some

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.810 
like a pig in a sauna but hopefully some
of<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.530> sweat<00:01:37.800> will<00:01:37.950> evaporate<00:01:38.160> and<00:01:38.640> sort<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
of that sweat will evaporate and sort of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.910 
of that sweat will evaporate and sort of
disappeared<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:40.050> it's<00:01:40.230> definitely<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:40.890> of

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
disappeared but it's definitely one of

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.810 
disappeared but it's definitely one of
those<00:01:41.130> drinks<00:01:41.430> i<00:01:41.640> would<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:44.490> cool<00:01:44.670> me
