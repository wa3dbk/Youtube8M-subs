00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.529
 So I actually answer today 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.620
 no, it's not april fools 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.119
 really true and we will 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.020
 officially i have to start in the middle of june 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:19.189
 possible there my personal alone 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.210
 with regular presence of problems 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.619
 from all different areas 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.029
 of course, many out of the world 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.310
 Germany has thought so far 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.449
 that some planning is not quite so 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.859
 I always want to be on the safe side 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.119
 current turn the other question 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.220
 answer as you are right now 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.780
 posed 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.300
 on the one hand paid for the first time 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.760
 he should not be the last gpk to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.230
 luck is not so good on and on 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.670
 his side dsl capsule the other 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.550
 video already said that support me 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.110
 For example, my studio area lie 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.190
 can one say so yes that I am there the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.199
 chance for the s expected 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.550
 because when I finally no longer outside 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.430
 permanently employed but independently 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.629
 and will be in the order of esl so to speak 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.399
 Of course, it has many reasons 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.050
 Man if you used this room and me 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.329

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.739
 that of course settle everything with it me 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.420
 then all my money in part 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.800
 at least from the tax deduct what 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.320
 All this includes of course that is very 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.149
 normal and of course has a lot 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.950
 to do things that so many and so 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.959

 financially secure and I want there 

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.500

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.240

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.630
