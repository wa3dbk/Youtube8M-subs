00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.809
 hi everyone knows fra big 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.730
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.189
 first gameplay on gta 5 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.130
 in fact this comment is so it's 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.990
 my very first face how tahri on 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.460
 on a gameplay so I've already done a 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.519
 tutorial but calmly knew nothing to do 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.099
 so forgive me if I'm a little less 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.110
 comfortable but no it's the first time 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.200
 so here I am happy with my 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.850
 little did you see well yeah that has 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.590
 look good so we'll do the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.010
 very first mission to throw at 5 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.090
 so it'll be in two gameplay the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.570
 first where I actually am doing 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.840
 comment 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.210
 like there and I'm doing the first mission 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.000
 I will explain everything to 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.530
 know so frozen already done 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.789
 because in fact I did a live on 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.770
 twitter i struggled ban 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.780
 unfortunately after I do them 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.010
 especially of range and I have not been ban 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.189
 I 'm not even if they can 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.570
 banish and so I have already posted 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.159
 yesterday in preview of course a live 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.500
 so we'll restart so we have the game 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.549
 in French what is good and here I am 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.549
 will you leave the kinematics 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.280
 good throughout the game there will be some 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.280
 small cutscenes like that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.700
 I'm sorry I'm a little tired 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.700
 because we are in the morning and 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.490
 so there are plenty of people who have 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.640
 criticized the graphics of gta 5 but 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.380
 seriously 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.410
 so I will not put in better 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.310
 quality on youtube but it's really 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.220
 beautiful from the critics they said 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.720
 yeah that's not it's not terrible but 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.240
 good for xbox 360 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.060
 I still find it extra so that 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:33.250
 help not been confirmed yet to make 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.390
 to appear the phone we will make a 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.810
 little bang I leave you the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.810
 thematic 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.910
 here 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.230
 so that has not been confirmed yet on 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.989
 xbox and ps4 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.900
 I really hope they'll come out a 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.959
 gta even if on this vote it's already not 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.959
 wrong 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.400
 then objects are indicated by the 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.739
 robert good it's okay it's not very 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:13.050
 complicated that's ready I'll make a 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:16.200
 second part of gta 5 red but 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.630
 later I do not know when or I 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.769
 would put a longer gameplay I would 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.239
 wander in the city etc 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.819
 while that's just the first 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:28.290
 mission we have to go see what's 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.760
 really not bad at all you can 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.400
 change character in course hop 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:45.330
 little animation and boom 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:47.040
 hatch mott the guy he's shocked because 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.700
 that he is the guy who died but that's it 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.700
 a little obliged 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:10.909
 or and in addition to the level of sound a little 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.390
 modified at the level for example of the 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.519
 gameplay 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.860
 when you shoot it's really better 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.199
 you actually feel like I 'm leaving like 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.940
 explained but it's much better 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.889
 and also the graphics and there are 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.539
 many more details while the 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.570
 map to the east it is huge 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:29.570
 it's a sick thing so do not hesitate 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.430
 not to look at my photos on facebook 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.800
 so I posted a lot and on 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.460
 twitter but on facebook finds that 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.520
 it's more fun to see them but I have 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.930
 how many fucking balls I have not bad 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.010
 is going to go cops who are dying enough 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.050
 quickly I remember it's more 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.130
 what the key to charge in a bag 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.740
 open to this is it really not 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.479
 wrong I take standards with the most of 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.350
 balls anyway 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.510
 and while you have a small 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.410
 slowed down and sometimes when you killed 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.860
 someone I see that there is a small 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.320
 flash 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.380
 here is there a little square flash on 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.599
 the screen is really huge 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.650
 and also I will talk to you in the 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.099
 next video of all 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.440
 new 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.389
 so I can not do it too much because it's 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.680
 just a gameplay of the first mission 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.310
 so I can not talk too much about the game 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.010
 it's just to show you here is a 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.120
 short video preview to 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.360
 quickly choose the character 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.430
 appropriate supported beautiful movement on the 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.270
 beautiful game for now I have not 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.270
 need to change mekin 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.729
 so I do not know where we are 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:43.259
 it is just a small map 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.520
 map appendix we're going to have that 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.789
 I do not remember who is 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.110
 the game year and so it may be 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:54.180
 that she will be in the same I do not know 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.469
 at all here we go hop directly 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.099
 small cutscenes 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.099
 I will let you 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:41.119
 and that's where the 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:45.020
 so sorry gameplay I can not you 

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:46.699
 show more here I will do other 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.969
 live so I hope to banish them from 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:54.860
 twitch gpo is an email but otherwise 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:56.509
 will be on ustream hdtv a little full of 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.490
 full of streaming sites 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.229
 so here it is fra big I hope 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.229
 that you liked this little video in 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:04.490
 the first time actually this comment 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:05.869
 tell me by comments if you like 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.610
 well even if it's just this is the 

00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:10.699
 first time so it's normal that I 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:14.080
 be a little less comfortable and that's it 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:14.080
 go kisses everyone
