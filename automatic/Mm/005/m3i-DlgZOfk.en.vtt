 he will inform the forest and we 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.250

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.720
 in the middle of the garden show grounds of 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.789

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.979
 Cuckoo Clock This cuckoo calls everyone

 the hour and reminds of the 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.360
 black forest watch industry he here 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.209
 We grew up in this room 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.090
 have two model railway facilities one 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.400
 the holzpolter a hair 0 track and on 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.010
 a very large garden track on almost 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.220
 400 meters track length we go one 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.209
 Joy is especially for the children 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.250
 prime minister mappus took his time 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.400
 for a quick tour of the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.400
 terrain 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.330
 He let himself be brief in the walk-in polder 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.819
 to inform about the forest after the 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.530
 had moved albatross also took us 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.530
 the showroom in Augenschein 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.670
 because it's an exciting topic 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.890
 certain scenes on this model train 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.959
 readjusted what is it in her 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.120
 our model is about that here 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.010
 want to show the complete process of 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.989
 forest to the work we just want this 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.459
 the thoughts of the many people 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.130
 form is not aware what is hanging 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.800
 everything on the ball in shape in the form of the 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.330
 bring people closer and we want 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.010
 this cluster forest wood like it is in 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.600
 jargon simply means to represent 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.610
 to show how to start in the forest 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.910
 and how he got off to the sawmill and 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.989
 At the same time we also show scenes 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.090
 of forestry and also of the 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.280
 normal life is easy in the forest 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.700
 play because the forest is more than just 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.040
 a limited factor already exists 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.840
 getting big contributions from almost 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.690
 administrations on state garden shows and 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.040
 in this series, the ministry also has 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.150
 decided that it too on this 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.430
 horticultural show again a contribution 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.170
 and then we thought together 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.670
 what can you do and then it is 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.410
 the ideas were just this 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.260
 oversized wood floors we ourselves 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.000
 here are easy to build and that 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.500
 already I think a funny thing 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.360
 be a gentleman in here right now 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.850
 said it does that 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.650
 pile of wood but in that the bgh is 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.660
 a possibility offers here now 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.130
 also to give a railway place or 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.989
 also for exhibitions for 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.739
 events place to give green 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.329
 classroom 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.359
 that's the funny thing about this whole 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.880
 By the way, history is driven on 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.950
 the m채rklin karl ice the facility is very 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.940
 Worth seeing and offers the model railroader 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.940
 many suggestions 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.140
 who deals with the subject forest in detail 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.850
 he should be busy then 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.310
 brisk step to the next 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.700
 Model train attraction open one 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.070
 beautiful lgb plant we have the 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.800
 gondola friends brigachtal das 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.590
 created from which numerous lgb banner 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.600
 have always dreamed 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.200
 a garden path on generous 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.940
 Radien through extensive terrain leads 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.060
 the plant is running on the first day 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.770
 garden show your impression both 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.370
 the weather has gone through 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.890
 despite all the adverse predictions has so 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.560
 Little rained spectators are too 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.810
 Enough there today the technology 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.460
 work eyes all over here 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.220
 There are also kids out there now 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.890
 again stones on the rail throws 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.570
 do not contribute anything to the more robust 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.880
 So do not worry 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.010
 even if it would rain heavily the train 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.200
 would drive so long as watch 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.580
 represent the train we drive from 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.670
 himself sitting in the dry 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.800
 So a problem for trains 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.690
 come now in use 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.640
 we have a mountain route on the the 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.730
 Rhaetian Railway reverses five we have 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.750
 on the outside a level system on the rule 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.940
 Track vehicles are falling 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.250
 still the plant is a bit sparse because of 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.170
 severe winter at the foot of the Black Forest 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.640
 does not really have the vegetation yet 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.100
 brought to development 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.420
 but in a few weeks should be here 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.220
 show more green 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.080
 particularly impressive is the 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.210
 Bergstrecke succeeded on the 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.350
 classics from the lbb program 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.750
 give a cease 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.910
 Of course, the legendary one may also do so 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.580
 crocodile of the Rhaetian Railway not 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:05.000
 missing with a freight train it rolls over 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.100
 an imposing viaduct gentleman this train 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.210
 One would like to always go away with 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.210
 accompany the eyes 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.870
 come to the horticultural show 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.590
 Of course not only garden banner on 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.380
 your costs 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.510
 also all those who just call 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.520

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.950
 can thrive here at the 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.580
 Planting the world pleases you , too 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.580
 once over
