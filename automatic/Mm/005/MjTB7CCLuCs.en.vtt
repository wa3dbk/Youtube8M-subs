three times in last year four days right
down<00:00:49.979> by<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.250> cinnamon<00:00:51.229> well<00:00:52.549> it<00:00:53.549> was<00:00:53.789> above

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
down by the cinnamon well it was above

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.079 
down by the cinnamon well it was above
the<00:00:54.390> cinnamon<00:00:54.869> when<00:00:55.049> we<00:00:55.199> first<00:00:55.469> saw<00:00:56.089> first

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
the cinnamon when we first saw first

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.789 
the cinnamon when we first saw first
time<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.479> saw<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.930> right<00:00:58.140> below<00:00:58.320> covered

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
time we saw it is right below covered

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.609 
time we saw it is right below covered
wagon<00:00:59.190> so<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.239> may<00:01:00.479> have<00:01:00.780> come<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.199> what<00:01:01.500> we

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:01.619 
wagon so it may have come out what we

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:04.279 
wagon so it may have come out what we
saw<00:01:01.829> was<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.219> dark<00:01:02.519> brown<00:01:02.760> soupy<00:01:03.299> water<00:01:03.570> so

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:04.289 
saw was this dark brown soupy water so

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.450 
saw was this dark brown soupy water so
we<00:01:04.470> thought<00:01:04.739> well<00:01:05.369> maybe<00:01:05.399> it<00:01:06.119> come<00:01:06.899> out<00:01:07.050> of<00:01:07.460> out

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
we thought well maybe it come out of out

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.730 
we thought well maybe it come out of out
of<00:01:10.610> parent<00:01:11.610> Creek<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:13.229> places<00:01:13.409> up

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
of parent Creek and there are places up

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.499 
of parent Creek and there are places up
there<00:01:13.770> where<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.190> might<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.550> been<00:01:14.850> well<00:01:15.179> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
there where it might have been well you

know<00:01:15.539> to<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:15.960> forecast<00:01:16.530> been<00:01:16.770> closed<00:01:17.039> up

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
know to the forecast been closed up

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:27.130 
know to the forecast been closed up
pretty<00:01:17.460> good

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:02:10.910 

let's<00:01:27.620> go<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:27.890> bridge

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.729 

well<00:02:11.920> it's<00:02:12.159> it<00:02:12.519> started<00:02:13.150> at<00:02:13.420> least<00:02:13.719> 20<00:02:14.139> 15

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
well it's it started at least 20 15

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:36.140 
well it's it started at least 20 15
miles<00:02:15.010> upstream<00:02:15.519> at<00:02:15.760> least

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.760 

it<00:02:37.150> may<00:02:37.330> take<00:02:37.570> out<00:02:37.780> those<00:02:37.990> trees<00:02:38.350> on<00:02:38.590> that

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
it may take out those trees on that

00:02:38.770 --> 00:03:19.690 
it may take out those trees on that
corner<00:02:39.160> by<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.370> time<00:02:39.610> it's<00:02:39.820> done

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:31.280 

the<00:03:20.180> sound<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.020> amazing<00:03:21.530> it's<00:03:21.860> crunchy

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.309 

that's<00:03:31.890> this<00:03:32.099> big

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
that's this big

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.899 
that's this big
problem<00:03:34.040> is<00:03:34.159> I<00:03:34.280> don't<00:03:34.310> know<00:03:34.489> where<00:03:34.640> it<00:03:34.700> came

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
problem is I don't know where it came

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:36.399 
problem is I don't know where it came
from<00:03:34.969> and<00:03:35.450> I've<00:03:35.569> just<00:03:35.810> driven<00:03:36.049> down<00:03:36.349> from

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
from and I've just driven down from

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.160 
from and I've just driven down from
wasn't<00:03:37.370> up<00:03:37.430> at<00:03:37.579> our<00:03:37.730> place<00:03:37.760> we're<00:03:38.689> 20<00:03:38.989> miles

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
wasn't up at our place we're 20 miles

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.530 
wasn't up at our place we're 20 miles
upstream<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:40.219> was<00:03:40.370> not<00:03:40.549> there<00:03:40.819> thank<00:03:41.359> God

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
upstream it was not there thank God

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.819 
upstream it was not there thank God
because<00:03:41.659> it<00:03:41.900> would<00:03:42.019> have<00:03:42.109> taken<00:03:42.290> our<00:03:42.590> bridge

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
because it would have taken our bridge

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.389 
because it would have taken our bridge
out<00:03:43.389> but
