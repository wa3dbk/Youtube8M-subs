00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.100
 Hi Landing Support for the channel 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:15.620
 I think that many people who are already starting to run are also going to run from now on 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:21.330
 Although I think that there are people that are not only still running about 12 times and after those who think 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:26.940
 There is a long-lasting cost reduction to start running 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:35.079
 I will tell you a little bit about the secret today 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:39.480
 It is definitely not long-lasting if you do your best suddenly as a reason not to last long 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:43.440
 Today 40 minutes or 50 minutes 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.860
 Because 40 minutes and 50 minutes are very hard from the beginning 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:52.600
 Because the knees and ankles are a big burden after that 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.600
 It is easy to feel 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.030
 At first, really it does not may be another 8 Mocha 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.340
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.380
 Running only for about 10 minutes is totally different 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.380
 And ten minutes is quite long 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:15.450
 So first, it continues actually lengthen the running of that try a little short of the target 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.450
 It will be an important goal 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:24.390
 After that you don't do it every day If you are a competitor, you can do it every day 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.390
 But 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:35.170
 People who are doing for good health can do it about three times a week 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.600
 If you do it 4 times a week or 5 times, it will put a strain on your body 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.150
 Injuries and easiness 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:48.720
 After that taking too much burden on the little body to running for health 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:51.680
 As there is a possibility that it will not be effective, I want you to be careful there a little 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.980
 When it's time to start doing 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.570
 I think i went there q 2 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.170
 Don't do it all 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.230
 And it was tough to run 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.830
 Initially 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.570
 It is okay to walk early 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.820
 Even Haier machine 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.830
 It is quite tight 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.730
 I 'm going to try 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.940
 About 30 minutes a motivated 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.970
 I hope that you are half- ripened 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.170
 Please try to walk in about 10 minutes a little 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:29.319
 I'm tired and tired 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:31.670
 I think it is an ant to try from then on because there is less burden on knees and ankles 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.020
 Please try by all means try 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.950
 Well then 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.950
