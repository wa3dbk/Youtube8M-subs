development for about three years on and
off<00:01:02.460> now<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.760> think<00:01:03.559> created<00:01:04.559> by<00:01:04.710> Jones<00:01:05.159> Games

who I've been talking to on YouTube and

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.570 
who I've been talking to on YouTube and
by<00:01:08.790> email<00:01:09.180> as<00:01:09.360> well<00:01:09.950> I'm<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.159> sure<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.400> anybody

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
by email as well I'm not sure if anybody

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.190 
by email as well I'm not sure if anybody
else<00:01:11.880> actually<00:01:12.210> has<00:01:12.360> any<00:01:12.540> gameplay<00:01:12.840> footage

of<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.590> video<00:01:14.000> game<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.380> yet<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.770> think<00:01:17.549> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
of this video game out yet I think I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.039 
of this video game out yet I think I
might<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.210> only<00:01:18.330> one<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.630> he<00:01:18.689> sent<00:01:18.930> this

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
might be the only one that he sent this

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.210 
might be the only one that he sent this
to<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.470> can't<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.830> sure

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
to I can't be sure

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.120 
to I can't be sure
uh-huh

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
uh-huh

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.390 
uh-huh
so<00:01:22.970> first<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.360> foremost<00:01:24.009> there<00:01:25.009> have<00:01:25.220> been

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
so first and foremost there have been

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.620 
so first and foremost there have been
changes<00:01:25.909> made<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.180> this<00:01:26.600> game<00:01:26.869> there<00:01:27.140> are

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
changes made to this game there are

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.050 
changes made to this game there are
obvious<00:01:29.630> visual<00:01:30.110> improvements<00:01:33.850> which<00:01:34.850> you

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060

obvious visual improvements which you
will<00:01:35.270> recognize<00:01:35.960> if<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.290> have<00:01:36.409> watched<00:01:36.649> my

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
will recognize if you have watched my

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.389 
will recognize if you have watched my
playthrough<00:01:37.220> of<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.430> first<00:01:37.670> phobia<00:01:38.270> game

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
playthrough of the first phobia game

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.609 
playthrough of the first phobia game
it's<00:01:40.399> actually<00:01:40.759> kind<00:01:41.360> of<00:01:41.479> up<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.750> scratch<00:01:42.259> with

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
it's actually kind of up to scratch with

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.070 
it's actually kind of up to scratch with
the<00:01:43.039> newest<00:01:43.369> amnesia<00:01:43.729> as<00:01:44.119> well<00:01:44.479> which<00:01:44.869> is

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
the newest amnesia as well which is

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.560 
the newest amnesia as well which is
really<00:01:45.380> impressive

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
really impressive

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.399 
really impressive
considering<00:01:47.570> this<00:01:47.659> is<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.840> game<00:01:48.080> made<00:01:48.229> by<00:01:48.289> a

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
considering this is a game made by a

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.930 
considering this is a game made by a
single<00:01:48.830> guy<00:01:49.009> in<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.580> really<00:01:49.909> outdated<00:01:50.240> engine

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
single guy in a really outdated engine

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.719 
single guy in a really outdated engine
so<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.270> first<00:01:53.479> thing<00:01:54.159> this<00:01:55.159> must<00:01:55.429> be<00:01:55.610> the

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
so the first thing this must be the

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.279 
so the first thing this must be the
garage<00:01:55.880> there<00:01:56.300> is<00:01:56.360> bound<00:01:56.569> to<00:01:56.630> be<00:01:56.720> fuel<00:01:56.960> in<00:01:57.110> here

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
garage there is bound to be fuel in here

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.590 
garage there is bound to be fuel in here
I'm<00:01:57.619> guessing<00:01:57.950> I'm<00:01:58.250> kind<00:01:58.909> of<00:01:59.030> stuck<00:01:59.390> in<00:01:59.509> this

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
I'm guessing I'm kind of stuck in this

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.139 
I'm guessing I'm kind of stuck in this
big<00:01:59.810> mansion<00:02:00.020> because<00:02:00.470> my<00:02:00.560> car<00:02:00.770> broke<00:02:01.039> down

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
very much the same as the first one the

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.020 
very much the same as the first one the
first<00:02:05.149> big<00:02:05.539> difference<00:02:05.659> is<00:02:06.050> there<00:02:06.289> are<00:02:07.030> pretty

first big difference is there are pretty
involving<00:02:08.479> puzzles<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:09.110> this<00:02:09.289> one<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:10.220> I'll

show you guys it's locked with a puzzle
the<00:02:13.430> idea<00:02:13.730> here<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:15.489> basically<00:02:16.489> go<00:02:17.239> through

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the idea here is to basically go through

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.270 
the idea here is to basically go through
all<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.720> these<00:02:17.959> numbers<00:02:18.140> check<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.890> pictures

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
all of these numbers check the pictures

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.910 
all of these numbers check the pictures
and<00:02:19.400> match<00:02:19.580> them<00:02:19.850> up<00:02:19.970> together<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:21.560> make<00:02:21.739> them

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
and match them up together to make them

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.410 
and match them up together to make them
a<00:02:21.950> full<00:02:22.370> picture<00:02:22.580> which<00:02:22.910> will<00:02:23.060> unlock<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
a full picture which will unlock the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.259 
a full picture which will unlock the
safe<00:02:23.860> behind<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.489> I<00:02:25.519> do<00:02:25.640> actually<00:02:25.910> have

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
safe behind it so I do actually have

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.050 
safe behind it so I do actually have
this<00:02:26.510> put<00:02:26.959> down<00:02:27.170> here<00:02:27.440> six<00:02:28.280> three<00:02:28.459> two<00:02:28.640> eight

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
this put down here six three two eight

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.009 
this put down here six three two eight
nine<00:02:29.390> one<00:02:29.720> seven<00:02:30.380> four<00:02:30.799> five<00:02:31.160> there<00:02:31.610> we<00:02:31.700> go

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
nine one seven four five there we go

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.199 
nine one seven four five there we go
that<00:02:33.019> took<00:02:33.260> me<00:02:33.440> about<00:02:33.829> 25<00:02:34.549> minutes<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.970> figure

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
that took me about 25 minutes to figure

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.580 
that took me about 25 minutes to figure
out<00:02:37.660> maybe<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.840> little<00:02:38.900> bit<00:02:39.260> difficult<00:02:41.470> but<00:02:42.470> it

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
out maybe a little bit difficult but it

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.699 
out maybe a little bit difficult but it
does<00:02:42.739> mean<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:44.410> there<00:02:45.410> have<00:02:45.590> been

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
does mean that there have been

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.650 
does mean that there have been
improvements<00:02:45.950> made<00:02:46.430> in<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.670> form<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:47.090> puzzles

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
improvements made in the form of puzzles

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.590 
improvements made in the form of puzzles
which<00:02:47.900> weren't<00:02:48.079> really<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.120> first<00:02:50.299> game

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
which weren't really in the first game

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.930 
which weren't really in the first game
to<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.799> best<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.130> my<00:02:52.190> knowledge<00:02:52.220> from<00:02:52.609> I<00:02:52.790> can

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
to the best of my knowledge from I can

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.430 
to the best of my knowledge from I can
remember<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.420> was<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.540> lot<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.870> running<00:02:54.410> around

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
remember it was a lot of running around

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.400 
remember it was a lot of running around
away<00:02:55.010> from<00:02:55.340> monsters<00:02:55.989> there's<00:02:56.989> nothing<00:02:57.290> use

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
away from monsters there's nothing use

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.440 
away from monsters there's nothing use
from<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.680> lockers<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.900> picking<00:02:59.900> items<00:02:59.989> up

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
from the lockers and picking items up

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.640 
from the lockers and picking items up
it's<00:03:02.450> not<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.750> bash<00:03:02.930> on<00:03:03.109> the<00:03:03.200> first<00:03:03.440> game

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
it's not to bash on the first game

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.229 
it's not to bash on the first game
there's<00:03:03.859> no<00:03:04.010> fuel<00:03:04.340> in<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.609> garage<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.060> don't

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
there's no fuel in the garage I don't

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.390 
there's no fuel in the garage I don't
know<00:03:05.329> what's<00:03:05.480> dino<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:06.019> should<00:03:06.950> head<00:03:07.100> back<00:03:07.130> to

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
know what's dino I should head back to

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.740 
know what's dino I should head back to
the<00:03:07.489> main<00:03:07.670> area<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.120> think<00:03:08.269> about<00:03:08.480> my<00:03:08.570> next

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
the main area and think about my next

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.390 
the main area and think about my next
move<00:03:08.840> tomorrow

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
move tomorrow

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.729 
move tomorrow
or<00:03:10.940> we<00:03:11.360> could<00:03:11.569> try<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.230> progress<00:03:12.440> right<00:03:12.680> now

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
or we could try and progress right now

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.630 
or we could try and progress right now
so<00:03:13.430> there<00:03:13.580> is<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.700> sprint<00:03:14.000> mechanic<00:03:15.519> which<00:03:16.519> you

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
so there is a sprint mechanic which you

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.580 
so there is a sprint mechanic which you
can<00:03:16.849> use<00:03:17.150> there<00:03:17.390> is<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.510> ducking<00:03:17.900> mechanic<00:03:18.290> I

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
can use there is a ducking mechanic I

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.410 
can use there is a ducking mechanic I
haven't<00:03:19.459> figured<00:03:19.580> out<00:03:19.730> anything<00:03:20.120> else<00:03:20.299> if

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
haven't figured out anything else if

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.809 
haven't figured out anything else if
there<00:03:20.569> has<00:03:20.690> been<00:03:20.720> anything<00:03:21.019> else<00:03:24.819> implemented

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
there has been anything else implemented

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.930 
there has been anything else implemented
into<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.030> game<00:03:27.190> right<00:03:28.190> now<00:03:28.340> which<00:03:28.549> is<00:03:28.700> looking

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
into the game right now which is looking

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.470 
into the game right now which is looking
for<00:03:29.120> progress

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.660 

as<00:03:33.140> I<00:03:33.230> say<00:03:33.379> it<00:03:33.470> does<00:03:33.590> look<00:03:33.769> really<00:03:34.159> nice<00:03:34.310> in

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
as I say it does look really nice in

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.570 
as I say it does look really nice in
comparison<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.330> first<00:03:35.540> game<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:37.430> there

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
comparison to the first game and there

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.030 
comparison to the first game and there
have<00:03:37.700> been<00:03:37.849> improvements<00:03:38.090> made<00:03:38.599> in<00:03:38.860> enemy<00:03:39.860> AI

hopefully he will uh he will say yes and

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.400 
hopefully he will uh he will say yes and
I'm<00:04:29.960> here<00:04:30.260> to<00:04:30.440> bring<00:04:30.560> you<00:04:30.680> guys<00:04:30.889> this<00:04:31.190> updates

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
I'm here to bring you guys this updates

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.860 
I'm here to bring you guys this updates
but<00:04:33.410> for<00:04:33.590> now<00:04:33.800> let's<00:04:34.270> head<00:04:35.270> into<00:04:35.419> this<00:04:35.600> crawl

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
but for now let's head into this crawl

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.070 
but for now let's head into this crawl
space<00:04:39.039> and<00:04:40.039> find<00:04:40.340> our<00:04:40.490> way<00:04:40.520> out<00:04:40.880> not<00:04:41.720> that<00:04:41.930> way

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
space and find our way out not that way

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.050 
space and find our way out not that way
I<00:04:42.110> think<00:04:42.289> it's<00:04:42.530> this<00:04:42.680> way<00:04:43.180> quite<00:04:44.180> possibly

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
I think it's this way quite possibly

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.029 
I think it's this way quite possibly
through<00:04:47.060> here<00:04:48.099> there<00:04:49.099> we<00:04:49.190> go<00:04:49.310> cool<00:04:50.770> as<00:04:51.770> in<00:04:51.950> the

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
through here there we go cool as in the

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:52.570 
through here there we go cool as in the
first<00:04:52.190> game

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
first game

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.760 
first game
everything<00:04:53.389> is<00:04:53.510> very<00:04:53.840> dark<00:04:54.169> so<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.500> will

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
everything is very dark so I will

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.200 
everything is very dark so I will
probably<00:04:55.550> need<00:04:55.700> to<00:04:57.099> do<00:04:58.099> this<00:04:58.220> in<00:04:58.400> post<00:04:58.580> light

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
probably need to do this in post light

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.360 
probably need to do this in post light
be<00:04:59.389> game<00:04:59.599> up<00:04:59.750> and<00:04:59.900> post<00:05:00.080> which<00:05:00.950> was<00:05:01.099> a<00:05:01.160> big

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
be game up and post which was a big

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.560 
be game up and post which was a big
problem<00:05:01.550> in<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:01.880> first<00:05:02.000> game

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
problem in the first game

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.719 
problem in the first game
it<00:05:03.229> added<00:05:03.470> a<00:05:03.650> hell<00:05:03.770> of<00:05:03.800> a<00:05:03.919> lot<00:05:04.070> of<00:05:04.099> tension<00:05:04.280> and

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
it added a hell of a lot of tension and

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.190 
it added a hell of a lot of tension and
it<00:05:05.030> still<00:05:05.270> does<00:05:05.479> add<00:05:05.690> a<00:05:05.720> hell<00:05:05.870> of<00:05:05.900> a<00:05:06.020> lot<00:05:06.169> of

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
it still does add a hell of a lot of

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.830 
it still does add a hell of a lot of
tension<00:05:07.120> especially<00:05:08.120> with<00:05:08.240> these<00:05:08.389> flickering

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
tension especially with these flickering

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.100 
tension especially with these flickering
lights<00:05:09.050> as<00:05:09.229> well<00:05:09.580> but<00:05:10.580> when<00:05:11.419> I<00:05:11.539> recorded<00:05:11.990> the

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
lights as well but when I recorded the

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.960 
lights as well but when I recorded the
first<00:05:12.229> game<00:05:12.530> nobody<00:05:13.310> could<00:05:13.430> see<00:05:13.610> anything

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.890 

which<00:05:16.970> was<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.479> little<00:05:17.750> bit<00:05:17.870> disappointing<00:05:18.470> I

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
which was a little bit disappointing I

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.780 
which was a little bit disappointing I
should<00:05:20.900> get<00:05:21.050> a<00:05:21.080> warning<00:05:21.349> here

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.760 

the<00:05:24.790> floor<00:05:25.000> seems<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.390> be<00:05:25.480> on<00:05:26.290> the<00:05:26.470> verge<00:05:26.590> of

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
the floor seems to be on the verge of

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.960 
the floor seems to be on the verge of
collapsing<00:05:27.370> I<00:05:27.610> need<00:05:28.450> to<00:05:28.510> be<00:05:28.600> careful<00:05:29.790> mm-hmm<00:05:30.790> I

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
collapsing I need to be careful mm-hmm I

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.790 
collapsing I need to be careful mm-hmm I
have<00:05:31.240> in<00:05:31.330> fact<00:05:31.510> figured<00:05:31.900> this<00:05:32.020> out<00:05:32.200> it<00:05:32.470> took<00:05:32.650> me

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
have in fact figured this out it took me

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.360 
have in fact figured this out it took me
quite<00:05:33.250> a<00:05:33.700> while<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:34.390> idea<00:05:34.690> is<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:35.290> get<00:05:36.190> onto

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
quite a while the idea is to get onto

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.630 
quite a while the idea is to get onto
these<00:05:36.610> beams<00:05:36.880> here<00:05:37.680> see<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:39.010> dividing<00:05:39.430> beams

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
these beams here see the dividing beams

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.720 
these beams here see the dividing beams
and<00:05:39.910> then<00:05:40.840> from<00:05:41.050> here<00:05:41.340> we<00:05:42.340> can<00:05:42.430> just<00:05:42.610> run

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
and then from here we can just run

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:49.980 
and then from here we can just run
around<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:43.030> outside<00:05:48.300> so<00:05:49.300> there<00:05:49.630> you<00:05:49.720> have<00:05:49.870> it

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
around the outside so there you have it

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.540 
around the outside so there you have it

liking<00:06:18.370> the<00:06:18.810> pacing<00:06:19.810> of<00:06:19.930> the<00:06:19.960> game<00:06:20.050> as<00:06:20.320> well

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
liking the pacing of the game as well

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.490 
liking the pacing of the game as well
the<00:06:21.640> first<00:06:21.820> game<00:06:22.060> was<00:06:22.300> a<00:06:22.330> little<00:06:22.600> bit<00:06:22.810> slow<00:06:23.140> the

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
the first game was a little bit slow the

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.080 
the first game was a little bit slow the
controls<00:06:23.920> were<00:06:24.010> a<00:06:24.100> little<00:06:24.340> bit<00:06:24.460> clunky<00:06:24.640> and

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
controls were a little bit clunky and

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.480 
controls were a little bit clunky and
the<00:06:25.210> monsters<00:06:25.600> weren't<00:06:25.900> exactly<00:06:26.490> difficult

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
the monsters weren't exactly difficult

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.020 
the monsters weren't exactly difficult
to<00:06:27.610> evade<00:06:28.170> but<00:06:29.170> from<00:06:29.410> what<00:06:29.590> we've<00:06:29.740> seen<00:06:29.820> in<00:06:30.820> the

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
to evade but from what we've seen in the

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.460 
to evade but from what we've seen in the
video<00:06:31.270> that<00:06:31.330> he<00:06:31.570> released<00:06:31.870> the<00:06:32.140> monsters

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
video that he released the monsters

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.030 
video that he released the monsters
