activate torment and start attacking the

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.390 
activate torment and start attacking the
own<00:01:40.160> dragons<00:01:40.640> with<00:01:40.850> water<00:01:41.090> surged<00:01:42.100> I'm<00:01:43.100> just

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
own dragons with water surged I'm just

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.030 
own dragons with water surged I'm just
using<00:01:43.580> momentum<00:01:43.909> for<00:01:44.479> this<00:01:44.630> task<00:01:44.950> although<00:01:45.950> it

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
using momentum for this task although it

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.770 
using momentum for this task although it
is<00:01:46.160> worth<00:01:46.340> noting<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:47.030> can<00:01:47.210> be<00:01:47.360> worth<00:01:47.540> it

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
is worth noting that it can be worth it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.290 
is worth noting that it can be worth it
to<00:01:47.810> use<00:01:48.050> abilities<00:01:48.320> here<00:01:48.979> and<00:01:49.820> I<00:01:49.880> guess<00:01:50.090> that's

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
to use abilities here and I guess that's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.150 
to use abilities here and I guess that's
just<00:01:50.479> because<00:01:50.630> of<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:50.990> slow<00:01:51.350> speed<00:01:51.410> of<00:01:52.040> the

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
just because of the slow speed of the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.460 
just because of the slow speed of the
chaotic<00:01:52.610> staff<00:01:52.940> it<00:01:53.360> means<00:01:54.050> that<00:01:54.110> using

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
chaotic staff it means that using

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.200 
chaotic staff it means that using
abilities<00:01:54.950> can<00:01:55.280> really<00:01:55.610> increase<00:01:55.790> your

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
abilities can really increase your

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.390 
abilities can really increase your
attack<00:01:56.570> speed<00:01:56.900> which<00:01:57.530> results<00:01:58.100> in<00:01:58.220> more

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
attack speed which results in more

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.109 
attack speed which results in more
Slayer<00:01:58.850> XP<00:01:59.390> per<00:01:59.600> hour<00:01:59.780> in<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.200> long<00:02:00.380> run<00:02:01.119> also
