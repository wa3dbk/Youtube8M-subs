 It is white now with the boat which does in the style which does not talk

 Raw death will speak today it does not come this I'd just become not the first time speak in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.730
 But this one was submerged 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.560
 Submersed 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.910
 I think people who always watch videos are articles 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.940
 If you let the bar run outside 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.790
 Worth bread not falling 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.820
 I got water in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.350
 Hey you 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:47.399
 Maybe it's broken, and if it's pretty, it's a cat Plarail toy and it's submerged 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.550
 It is often broken because it is my experience 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.040
 Naa I hope if you have not broken Naa Mechau 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.690

 Oh Oh taken do it 3 loading weight was taken out immediately ne 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:06.640
 Uh, because I dropped it out 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:11.920
 If there was a power supply purpose then that time 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.180
 I kept it hot, but because the sound was on for a long time and the water went in 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.970
 The 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:21.920
 It moved even after it fell , but it moved 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.640
 There is a movement that is common here, but after a week or so it's often broken 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.060
 you know 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 Head it because water had entered into, so that it continued to move all the way to turn it immediately at that time 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.290
 Passed about two months from there left to it by hand or move the Mashitaddde this move 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.960
 Hey 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.979

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.440
 Patch guess pile loss this is it patcher pile force is quite 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.980
 It was of over Oh 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.920
 This is different 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:52.780

 I bought overland road mail order limited items of 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:04.030
 No its wonder if mail order Hey did was selfish 4005 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.649
 But this alone it certainly my memory is a little vague 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.800
 It is sunny fortunate that it is a great disaster here. 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.460
 Pas Chuaguju ago 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:19.410

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.580
 I turn this all the way here 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.510
 Datte happens you Nami 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:35.590
 It was after Re Mashitaa's 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:40.239
 It was a simple two-cell battery 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.360

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:47.040
 It's gone What now?'Ll bring emotional single-2 battery 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.950
 Well then this AA battery 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.650
 Let's put it in motion 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.709
 I'm'm here 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.480
 I want it to work, because if it's broken with this, it won't work 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:04.769
 It was broken 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.769
 It doesn't work even if it's inserted, so I hope it works but I'll put it in 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.870
 The 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.890
 vaio is doing well 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.890
 It was not broken 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.360
 Big 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.730
 Big 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.800
 Good 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.470
 It said it was good 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:39.340
 Pretty really Plarail sunk and あ year 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:43.810
 Part Pokute this Te burn of here in the most I'm here this after the 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.520
 For example, if you let me go down in New York before, for example, I'm not really on purpose but really 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.620
 And it got more and more entered in the self-feeling 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.580
 That conner is broken 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.540
 It's all about this still broken problem here at all 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:02.120
 And accidentally get water in the here and here Dekoko 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.850
 If you remove it here, you may not be able to open here, as it may become 9 companies in the a little more amateur 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.970
 As much as I think is good 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:13.150
 Those who are good at that voice should be attached separately even if they are not here 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:17.130
 The reason why it was good this time was not this time 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:23.790
 I was submerged but it was a good match 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.660
 Move immediately after the submerged caster is most likely in the immediate addition Tsu A'a Rutte events broken have Meza in this 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.610
 You 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:34.650
 And keep the Mamapon Is the I move immediately after being immersed as this pattern 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.420
 It feels like it will not move by any means , so the water gets in it. 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.150
 It 's like electricity 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.200
 There is no place 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:45.040
 Oh when you accidentally because to the wrong sport I mean 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:49.129
 For now, put it on immediately and put it out there 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.910
 In the book and keep moving here as it is 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:54.600
 Like this 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:58.500
 And warm this face and that moisture 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.160

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:07.780

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.260

 from here 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:57.720
 It seems like this is a plus if it is broken when showing the equipment so much moderately 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:02.139
 Why minus 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:08.189
