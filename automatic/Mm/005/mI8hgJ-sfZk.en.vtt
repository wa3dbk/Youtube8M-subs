 attention and something that many of you have 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.830
 asked mostly in the comments 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.590
 is if the microsoft conference is going 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.840
 to retransmit live because there are bad 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.000
 news because microsoft does not 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.010
 relayed his conference in 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.960

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.670

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.570
 you will have all the information here 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.390
 a few days ago that microsoft said or 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.160
 he has already confirmed it totally today 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.900

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.400

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.970

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.220

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.670

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.340
 more appropriate to do it and good said 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.979
