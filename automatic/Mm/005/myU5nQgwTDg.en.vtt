measure it to my measuring tape so to

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.630 
measure it to my measuring tape so to

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
make sure that we're trying to play it

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.480 
make sure that we're trying to play it
okay<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:04.679> this<00:02:05.679> is<00:02:05.860> supposed<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.159> be<00:02:06.220> 12

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
okay so this this is supposed to be 12

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
okay so this this is supposed to be 12
inches<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:08.579> it<00:02:09.579> comes<00:02:10.269> up<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.959> be<00:02:11.170> about<00:02:11.500> 14

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
inches and it comes up to be about 14

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.979 
inches and it comes up to be about 14
don't<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.600> can<00:02:13.810> see<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.880> that's<00:02:15.880> great<00:02:16.360> and

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
don't you can see that that's great and

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.050 
don't you can see that that's great and
I<00:02:17.079> thought<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.560> fit<00:02:17.829> the<00:02:18.340> ends<00:02:18.850> are<00:02:18.970> a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
I thought that the fit the ends are a

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.110 
I thought that the fit the ends are a
bit<00:02:19.510> thin<00:02:19.989> I<00:02:20.519> don't<00:02:21.519> know<00:02:21.579> how<00:02:21.790> I'm<00:02:21.940> going<00:02:22.060> to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
bit thin I don't know how I'm going to

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.970 
bit thin I don't know how I'm going to
do<00:02:22.239> when<00:02:22.390> i<00:02:22.420> install<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.079> but<00:02:23.410> I'll<00:02:23.620> probably

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
do when i install it but I'll probably

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.819 
do when i install it but I'll probably
turn<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.430> off<00:02:24.549> so<00:02:25.320> we'll<00:02:26.320> probably<00:02:26.500> end<00:02:26.620> up

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
turn it off so we'll probably end up

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.599 
turn it off so we'll probably end up
being<00:02:28.470> like<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.769> length<00:02:29.980> it's<00:02:30.190> supposed<00:02:30.489> to

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
being like the length it's supposed to

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:37.690 
being like the length it's supposed to
me<00:02:30.760> um<00:02:32.190> see<00:02:33.190> ya<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.489> this<00:02:33.820> 14

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.620 

and<00:02:37.790> enter<00:02:38.750> FIFA<00:02:39.290> 16

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630
