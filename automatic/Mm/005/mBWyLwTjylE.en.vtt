00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.730 
more that I really care though I really
like<00:05:26.460> how<00:05:26.700> the<00:05:26.760> keys<00:05:27.150> are<00:05:27.360> spaced<00:05:27.630> out<00:05:27.930> there's

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
like how the keys are spaced out there's

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.440 
like how the keys are spaced out there's
only<00:05:28.890> one<00:05:29.220> thing<00:05:29.490> which<00:05:29.700> you<00:05:29.729> really<00:05:30.240> need<00:05:30.419> to

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
only one thing which you really need to

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.659 
only one thing which you really need to
get<00:05:30.720> used<00:05:30.960> to<00:05:31.229> if<00:05:31.470> you<00:05:31.680> have<00:05:31.950> been<00:05:31.979> using<00:05:32.190> the

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
get used to if you have been using the

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.180 
get used to if you have been using the
previous<00:05:33.150> version<00:05:33.720> and<00:05:33.960> that<00:05:34.590> is<00:05:34.740> this<00:05:34.950> key

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
previous version and that is this key

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.640 
previous version and that is this key
here<00:05:35.490> in<00:05:35.669> the<00:05:35.760> bottom<00:05:35.940> right-hand<00:05:36.300> corner

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
here in the bottom right-hand corner

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.650 
here in the bottom right-hand corner
they<00:05:37.650> have<00:05:37.860> recently<00:05:38.370> changed<00:05:38.460> it<00:05:39.090> now<00:05:39.270> so<00:05:39.600> you

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
they have recently changed it now so you

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.260 
they have recently changed it now so you
have<00:05:39.810> on<00:05:40.229> all<00:05:40.470> of<00:05:40.650> these<00:05:40.830> different<00:05:41.640> options

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
have on all of these different options

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.460 
have on all of these different options
on<00:05:42.540> the<00:05:42.630> monkey<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.890> have<00:05:44.100> ?<00:05:44.640> full<00:05:45.600> stop<00:05:46.020> comma

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
on the monkey you have ? full stop comma

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.210 
on the monkey you have ? full stop comma
and<00:05:46.820> !<00:05:48.169> it's<00:05:49.169> a<00:05:49.290> little<00:05:49.530> bit<00:05:49.680> annoying<00:05:49.950> having

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
and ! it's a little bit annoying having

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.830 
and ! it's a little bit annoying having
the<00:05:50.430> more<00:05:50.610> than<00:05:50.760> the<00:05:50.880> one<00:05:51.060> key<00:05:51.300> now<00:05:51.540> rather

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
the more than the one key now rather

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.630 
the more than the one key now rather
than<00:05:51.990> two<00:05:52.320> though<00:05:52.350> you<00:05:52.590> get<00:05:52.830> used<00:05:53.040> to<00:05:53.190> it<00:05:53.400> I

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
than two though you get used to it I

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.700 
than two though you get used to it I
believe<00:05:54.510> that<00:05:54.540> they<00:05:54.840> did<00:05:55.050> that<00:05:55.229> because<00:05:55.410> they

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
believe that they did that because they

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.620 
believe that they did that because they
wanted<00:05:55.950> to<00:05:56.130> make<00:05:56.250> the<00:05:56.520> space<00:05:56.729> bar<00:05:57.030> longer<00:05:57.479> or

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
wanted to make the space bar longer or

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.100 
wanted to make the space bar longer or
something<00:05:58.050> like<00:05:58.200> that<00:05:59.419> though<00:06:00.419> anyhow<00:06:00.870> that

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
something like that though anyhow that

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.500 
something like that though anyhow that
is<00:06:01.260> pretty<00:06:01.560> much<00:06:01.740> all<00:06:02.010> I<00:06:02.070> have<00:06:02.580> to<00:06:02.790> show<00:06:02.820> you<00:06:03.030> in

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510
