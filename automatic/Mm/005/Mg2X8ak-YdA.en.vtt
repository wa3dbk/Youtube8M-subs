00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 without a single nail screw and a drop of glue 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.690
 in just three weeks this one was assembled 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.269
 two-storey house all thanks to the new to 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.800
 Yekaterinburg technology double beam then 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.240
 there is a design consists of two 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.639
 planed boards between which 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.949
 there is insulation on one side of the house 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.140
 wooden and breathe here is awesome 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.449
 easy on the other hand it costs much 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.880
 cheaper than a solid building or 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.519
 Knotted timber hostess did not even think 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.189
 what can build a house for the price 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:32.940
 small city apartment i am always 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.940
 wanted a house but really thought it meant 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:42.899
 torment us and expensive and is not available for me 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.690
 I had an apartment, I sold them I went 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.550
 buy another but then lay a brand 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.390
 not an option to build a wooden 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.390
 house about the author suit and the house is completely peak 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.850
 and box foundation and communication 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.829
 no less than three million in this house 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.140
 about 100 squares two bedrooms and 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.270
 living room kitchen and huge bathroom 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.369
 this premise alone convinces 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.080
 the house is warm and comfortable heating 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.760
 electric just in case there is 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.890
 firewood is still located house in 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.049
 collective garden and interruptions can be 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.030
 but tatyana lives here constantly was 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.610
 pleasantly surprised when I got the first one 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.100
 winter receipt of payment all together 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.049
 light and electric heating spilled out all over 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.939
 2 and a half thousand rubles that 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.920
 much more profitable than in the city 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.650
 up plus fresh air smell of wood 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.540
 two-story space in the fact that the house is warm 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.060
 we made sure while shooting these days 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.369
 outside the city it was minus 30 however no 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.320
 there was no ice kroshev on the walls of the house 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.540
 By the way, the facade of it is not additionally 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.409
 insulated just painted ordinary facade 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.969
 paint 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.829
 I must say that the house was built by 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.990
 double beam technologies like all 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.999
 wooden construction shrinks but 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.520
 it is quite small within one 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:51.600
 percent the building itself is very durable for 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.119
 permanent homes 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.009
 double compound plus is used 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.319
 technological breaks every 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.780
 3-4 meters and in this way you can 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.670
 Build shuya more comfortable in the bath in general 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.039
 remember the name of this technology 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.759
 double beam sure very soon she 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.750
 will conquer 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.750
 love of the Urals
