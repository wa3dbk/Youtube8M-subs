00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.790
 knew youtube friends 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 i'm rigging and today i'm going to be you 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.990
 a new series brings some sort of 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.180
 my breakdown york to say and then 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.040
 so no spots you show the songs 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.849
 and of course also counter for the hague 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.060
 lich 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:29.160
 john spots and of course also roll-out 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.529
 and what we are going to do we are going to start with 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.090
 stand or imagine before we tense up 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.530
 london pastor 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.570
 so we go straight to the first no 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.690
 mock up the opponent's name 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.120
 comes close off and first thing 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.120
 I have to do is just stand behind wall 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.380
 a we after the first lamppost and bomb 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.210
 the guy who is light to him again and 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.560
 totally toast 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.080
 You can of course also use the minis 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.390
 you just do the same it 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.000
 first difference deck do me is to the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.170
 tank walking on the tank climbing on the look 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.290
 from the tank 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.450
 germs and look at the chimney 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.500
 the house that is just in front of it and 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.970
 boom 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.250
 opponent who stands on other side 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.740
 is totally toast 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.079
 Now you suggest is exciting to 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.370
 gas station or building can be found there 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.290
 somewhere near 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.979
 and so does the losing hear a lot 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.780
 good counter for its iq grenade 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.220
 left of and pines and grown green 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.979
 about the house 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.560
 guaranteed that you then kill it 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.260
 again there is another hijack 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.490
 and voila this is not in a row which do not 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.640
 enough of you 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.100
 so repentance we are going a fourth 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.600
 no spot search and that is because it is gone 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.330
 pastor china 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.369
 i suggest you the nmi is so flag on 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.600
 the flaps and you are in your area 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.729
 from a playground 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.610
 first thing i have to do is unique 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.010
 towards the flag don't throw that over it 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.080
 house say if the shed and 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.049
 voila I 've checked the flag again and again 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.000
 of course as a bonus the hassle 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.799
 so there were almost no spots on it 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.689
 stars or let of course know if that 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.900
 you may have the more child there there 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.090
 missed something but let's move on to 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.709
 de has songs and we start with this 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.150
 the statue 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.709
 first i had a target on ingredient 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.549
 children and he a perfect overview 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.079
 good suitcases on the van eck bnn docks 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.669
 his previous is just hit behind 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.210
 scale the statue and give your life 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.460
 back 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.360
 then there are no cans at the 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.760
 doctor 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.680
 so imagine the eliminates flag 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.840
 and you know the knife goes around the corner 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.880
 come then can go after the doctor 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.760
 stand and hell and pecked hot glitch them 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.290
 will probably never see 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.770
 Of course you can also put on the tractor beam 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.300
 and 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.450
 and behind the driver's cab it 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.580
 clit and maybe even better if 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.050
 now someone is standing outside the zipper 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.940
 behind those boxes you can do that too 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.900
 counter by going on the funnel 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.550
 to jump 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.680
 most of the time you sit in the trees and 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.490
 so off but if you can not 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.890
 see 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.170
 then you can detect again on the wash pass 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.460
 jump and have a whole 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.830
 overview about that angle not ok about 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.800
 to the jump spots and be the first 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.060
 You can get into this building by wondering through 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.230
 the garbage bin your children 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.720
 probably 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.730
 and then enter the window and you can 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.530
 in medical that big surprise you too 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.840
 another hard point is handy but it is useful 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.660
 then in the blue building can also go through 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.210
 jump the shelter into the window 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.150
 can draw here on the 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.650
 get the delivery van in that building and then 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.630
 in an overview and then of course you have 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.940
 also the green paper and other side 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.150
 here on the roof and feel connects 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.310
 inside so finally I want what I do 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.370
 have the spots free donut appspots with 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.350
 semi suitcase and hereby pastor china 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.410
 just keep my delivery van 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.830
 of course also take a look of course 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.740
 but with my mission bay so if you 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.840
 know that the wine comes from c then looks 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.900
 just head towards the sheet or there is 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.910
 where we go now comes 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.990
 can also do this if you know the ven 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.060
 of arrival 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.780
 ground at that pick-up truck in green 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.930
 mieke to the flag 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.210
 then you still have the nation c 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.190
 the who so why these boxes hang you 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.990
 always sees what I am about 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.540
 of course somewhere will never be in full 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.880
 about cover are here in the area where 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.109
 hanging around suspects something wrong with two 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.890
 people do and then I can do 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.920
 easy covers therefore the coal shed 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.870
 these are just about the college we use 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.820
 it is a lot but in saying there 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.169
 you get the hang of it quite easily 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.819
 to remember 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.949
 it is of course very handy if you 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:40.169
 For example, competitive plays inhabit 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.409
 media gaming or something 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.870
 so always handy because of you but this is 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.699
 so what let us know with broad then where 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.289
 you of course think so too 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.990
 know if we have missed something 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.960
 because of course we do n't know everything either 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.999
 and then i see you in the next 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.629
 let me see more 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:03.949
 who they are in the evening is the if the what 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.949
 slower in the day
