00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
sauce other than this one this is the

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.830 
sauce other than this one this is the
best<00:01:28.289> so<00:01:29.070> we'll<00:01:29.280> take<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:30.210> little<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.630> this

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
best so we'll take just a little of this

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.289 
best so we'll take just a little of this
and<00:01:31.140> again<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.159> my<00:01:32.340> interpretation<00:01:32.670> of

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
and again this is my interpretation of

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.270 
and again this is my interpretation of
the<00:01:33.450> dish<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:34.380> don't<00:01:34.590> give<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.890> too<00:01:35.100> many

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the dish they don't give out too many

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.569 
the dish they don't give out too many
facts<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.939> what's<00:01:36.179> in<00:01:36.359> it<00:01:36.770> none<00:01:37.770> actually<00:01:38.039> so

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
facts on what's in it none actually so

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.190 
facts on what's in it none actually so
this<00:01:39.149> is<00:01:39.359> what<00:01:39.570> makes<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.259> taste<00:01:40.530> close<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.579> me

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
this is what makes it taste close for me

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.630 
this is what makes it taste close for me
then<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.289> put<00:01:43.439> some<00:01:43.619> black<00:01:43.829> pepper<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.399> here

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
then we put some black pepper in here

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.020 
then we put some black pepper in here
and<00:01:45.590> we'll<00:01:46.590> make<00:01:46.770> our<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.189> compound

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450

steaks or grilled chicken and I know

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.610 
steaks or grilled chicken and I know
this<00:02:18.300> actually<00:02:18.660> needs<00:02:18.870> just<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.230> little<00:02:19.260> more

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
this actually needs just a little more

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.869 
this actually needs just a little more
of<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.010> Worcestershire<00:02:20.610> sauce

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
of the Worcestershire sauce

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.130 
of the Worcestershire sauce
so<00:02:23.879> we'll<00:02:24.030> put<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:24.299> little<00:02:24.690> more<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.170> there<00:02:27.140> all

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
so we'll put a little more in there all

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.339 
so we'll put a little more in there all
right<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:29.580> now<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.299> well<00:02:30.870> combined

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
right so now that this is well combined

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.670 
right so now that this is well combined
let's<00:02:32.040> take<00:02:32.250> our<00:02:32.430> toast<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.030> butter<00:02:33.629> it<00:02:33.900> and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
let's take our toast and butter it and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.940 
let's take our toast and butter it and
this<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> good<00:02:36.049> you<00:02:37.049> know<00:02:37.140> artisan<00:02:37.739> type

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
this is a good you know artisan type

bread<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.489> good<00:02:38.640> stout<00:02:38.940> bread<00:02:39.299> I<00:02:39.510> don't

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
bread it's a good stout bread I don't

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.270 
bread it's a good stout bread I don't
think<00:02:40.049> they<00:02:40.170> used<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.620> bread<00:02:40.829> like<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.010> I

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
think they used a bread like this I

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.729 
think they used a bread like this I
think<00:02:41.340> they<00:02:41.579> probably<00:02:41.730> use<00:02:42.180> more<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.780> sort

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
think they probably use more of a sort

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.369 
think they probably use more of a sort
of<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.890> Texas<00:02:44.489> toast<00:02:44.790> or<00:02:45.120> whatever<00:02:45.569> but<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:46.230> is

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
of a Texas toast or whatever but this is

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.940 
of a Texas toast or whatever but this is
the<00:02:46.500> one<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.769> I've<00:02:46.920> chosen<00:02:47.790> today<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:49.260> this

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the one that I've chosen today and this

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.680 
the one that I've chosen today and this
has<00:02:50.099> been<00:02:50.250> toasted<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:50.940> I've<00:02:51.060> done<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.390> for

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
has been toasted and I've done that for

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.020 
has been toasted and I've done that for
a<00:02:51.720> reason<00:02:52.049> because<00:02:52.140> this<00:02:52.470> butter<00:02:52.849> will<00:02:53.849> make

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
a reason because this butter will make

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.449 
a reason because this butter will make
it<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.239> little<00:02:54.390> bit<00:02:54.569> soggy<00:02:54.920> if<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.129> bread<00:02:56.340> is

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
it a little bit soggy if the bread is

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.460 
it a little bit soggy if the bread is
not<00:02:56.640> toasted<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:58.109> is<00:02:58.260> not<00:02:58.410> a

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
not toasted and this is not a

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.920 
not toasted and this is not a
low-calorie<00:02:59.010> dish<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.670> if<00:02:59.760> you're<00:02:59.940> afraid<00:03:00.720> of

broiler in a few minutes now the type of
beef<00:03:57.600> I've<00:03:57.930> chosen<00:03:58.230> here<00:03:58.769> again<00:03:59.370> this<00:03:59.519> is

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
beef I've chosen here again this is

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.970 
beef I've chosen here again this is
flank<00:04:00.060> steak<00:04:00.390> flank<00:04:00.810> steak<00:04:01.110> comes<00:04:01.680> from<00:04:01.890> the

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
flank steak flank steak comes from the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.280 
flank steak flank steak comes from the
underside<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.910> animal<00:04:03.330> it<00:04:03.840> actually<00:04:04.019> gets

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
underside of the animal it actually gets

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.220 
underside of the animal it actually gets
a<00:04:04.470> lot<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:05.420> movement<00:04:06.420> because<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.780> animal<00:04:07.140> is

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
a lot of movement because the animal is

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.280 
a lot of movement because the animal is
moving<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:08.069> it<00:04:08.610> can<00:04:08.910> be<00:04:09.090> tough<00:04:09.360> particularly

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
moving so it can be tough particularly

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.600 
moving so it can be tough particularly
if<00:04:10.440> you<00:04:10.560> don't<00:04:10.739> cut<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.160> against<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.519> grain

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
if you don't cut it against the grain

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.360 
if you don't cut it against the grain
and<00:04:12.090> if<00:04:12.569> my<00:04:12.750> cameraman<00:04:13.500> can<00:04:13.739> get<00:04:13.890> in<00:04:14.010> close

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
and if my cameraman can get in close

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.710 
and if my cameraman can get in close
here<00:04:14.640> I'm<00:04:14.730> actually<00:04:14.880> going<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.180> lift<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:15.630> up

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
here I'm actually going to lift it up

here I'm actually going to lift it up
you<00:04:16.290> can<00:04:16.500> see<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:17.430> there<00:04:17.669> is<00:04:17.700> very<00:04:18.299> distinct

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
you can see that there is very distinct

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.190 
you can see that there is very distinct
grain<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:20.130> runs<00:04:20.400> like<00:04:20.669> this<00:04:20.910> fall<00:04:21.299> in<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.989> row

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
grain that runs like this fall in a row

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.080 
grain that runs like this fall in a row
and<00:04:22.470> you've<00:04:22.919> heard<00:04:23.070> people<00:04:23.490> say<00:04:23.640> cut<00:04:23.970> it

against the grain I'm going to give you
a<00:04:25.410> great<00:04:25.650> demonstration<00:04:25.890> here<00:04:26.580> if<00:04:26.760> you<00:04:27.210> cut<00:04:27.450> it

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
do is cut against the grain
