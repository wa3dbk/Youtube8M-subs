generation<00:03:46.600> on<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:48.709> high<00:03:48.920> beams<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.340> consider

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
generation on the high beams I consider

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.210 
generation on the high beams I consider
that<00:03:50.769> you<00:03:51.769> should<00:03:52.010> have<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:53.750> pair<00:03:54.680> of<00:03:54.709> bulbs

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
that you should have a pair of bulbs

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:03.159 
that you should have a pair of bulbs
that<00:03:55.480> give<00:03:56.480> you<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.900> longest<00:03:58.989> being<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:02.169> these

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
that give you the longest being so these

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:04.850 
that give you the longest being so these
ones<00:04:03.500> have

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
ones have

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.840 
ones have
Plus<00:04:05.730> with<00:04:06.440> 130<00:04:07.440> percent<00:04:07.680> more<00:04:08.220> being<00:04:08.520> length

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
Plus with 130 percent more being length

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.370 
Plus with 130 percent more being length
and<00:04:09.240> that's<00:04:10.230> why<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:11.160> seemed<00:04:11.900> normal<00:04:12.900> to

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
and that's why you it seemed normal to

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.150 
and that's why you it seemed normal to
me<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:14.040> use<00:04:14.250> them<00:04:14.460> they're<00:04:15.080> their<00:04:16.160> color

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
me to use them they're their color

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.080 
me to use them they're their color
temperature<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:17.850> of<00:04:19.760> 37<00:04:20.760> 100<00:04:21.660> K<00:04:21.930> but<00:04:22.970> even<00:04:23.970> the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
temperature is of 37 100 K but even the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.850 
temperature is of 37 100 K but even the
previous<00:04:24.510> generation<00:04:26.750> plus<00:04:27.750> 100<00:04:28.380> percent

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
previous generation plus 100 percent

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.760 
previous generation plus 100 percent
they<00:04:29.730> were<00:04:29.790> so<00:04:30.300> intense<00:04:30.750> on<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.940> high<00:04:32.940> beams

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
they were so intense on the high beams

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.060 
they were so intense on the high beams
that<00:04:34.770> sometimes<00:04:35.730> I<00:04:35.940> was<00:04:36.450> being<00:04:37.200> blinded<00:04:37.650> by

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
that sometimes I was being blinded by

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.640 
that sometimes I was being blinded by
the<00:04:38.210> light<00:04:39.410> reflected<00:04:40.410> from<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:43.400> roadsides

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
the light reflected from the roadsides

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.790 
the light reflected from the roadsides
so<00:04:46.650> these<00:04:47.460> ones<00:04:47.760> should<00:04:48.360> be<00:04:48.390> even<00:04:49.050> even<00:04:49.530> better

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
so these ones should be even even better

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.150 
so these ones should be even even better
as<00:04:50.640> you<00:04:50.790> could<00:04:51.210> already<00:04:51.780> tell<00:04:52.080> though<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:52.770> see

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
as you could already tell though and see

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:00.400
