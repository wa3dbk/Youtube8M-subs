00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
legend John Randle I think that's the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.890 
legend John Randle I think that's the
best<00:02:35.070> move<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.430> do<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.300> right<00:02:36.450> currently

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
best move to do and right currently

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.170 
best move to do and right currently
there<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.170> not<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> bass<00:02:37.920> John<00:02:38.370> rounds<00:02:38.730> up<00:02:38.940> bass

overall I really like this car when I

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.569 
overall I really like this car when I
first<00:03:57.329> got<00:03:57.510> into<00:03:57.750> for<00:03:57.930> whatever<00:03:58.530> reason<00:03:59.040> he

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
first got into for whatever reason he

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.520 
first got into for whatever reason he
never<00:03:59.790> forced<00:04:00.239> fumbles<00:04:00.690> with<00:04:00.780> his<00:04:00.989> crazy<00:04:01.230> hit

never forced fumbles with his crazy hit

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.590 
never forced fumbles with his crazy hit
powder<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:02.100> think<00:04:02.489> he<00:04:02.549> has<00:04:02.670> like<00:04:02.820> 99<00:04:03.239> hit<00:04:03.390> power

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
powder I think he has like 99 hit power

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.789 
powder I think he has like 99 hit power
and<00:04:03.750> his<00:04:03.840> catch<00:04:04.019> was<00:04:04.200> really<00:04:04.410> good<00:04:04.560> too

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799

for<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.760> linebacker<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:09.780> think<00:04:09.989> 99<00:04:10.410> hit<00:04:10.590> pair

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
for a linebacker and I think 99 hit pair

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.979 
for a linebacker and I think 99 hit pair
but<00:04:10.920> we<00:04:11.010> just<00:04:11.130> never<00:04:11.430> saw<00:04:11.880> that<00:04:12.180> hit<00:04:12.750> power

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.380 
but we just never saw that hit power
come<00:04:13.260> through<00:04:13.500> 99<00:04:14.070> hit<00:04:14.340> power<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:14.850> power<00:04:15.180> move

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
come through 99 hit power and power move

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.890

the<00:04:39.580> ledger<00:04:39.760> one<00:04:40.000> will<00:04:40.180> be<00:04:40.300> good<00:04:40.570> enough<00:04:40.960> but

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
the ledger one will be good enough but

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.230 
the ledger one will be good enough but
if<00:04:41.889> I<00:04:41.980> see<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.280> ultra<00:04:42.610> legend<00:04:42.880> for<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.060> right

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
if I see the ultra legend for the right

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.790 
if I see the ultra legend for the right
price<00:04:43.480> I<00:04:43.690> probably<00:04:43.930> scooped<00:04:44.200> that<00:04:44.230> one<00:04:44.530> too

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
price I probably scooped that one too
