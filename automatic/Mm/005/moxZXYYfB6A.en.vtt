 ecological of ex sonia are very compact usb port 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.350
 how long the phone loads the system 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.390
 we have a whole series of colored covers that said in the packaging 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.190
 final there will be only one more cover in addition to that of the phone 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.969

 pierpaoli polaris stereo look like olymia 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.230
 that I am olimia 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.210

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.090
 rubbers 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.780
 then we have charger but that causes synchronization vs swift 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.039
 micro 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.039
 usp 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.059
 instruction manual 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:27.029
 Teletutto 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:29.299
 some information on the star 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.790
 we are not the so-called personal weigher 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.639
 earth hardware 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.710
 something more in depth we will see 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.499
 eni in a week 10 days 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.899
 we unlock that if the arms interface love you Italian 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.620
 the screen is of Rome capacitive and plastic type 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.010
 therefore for this it manages to have these very compact dimensions 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.010
 but also to me 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:57.689
 coachmen 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.719
 save 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.059
 cow insert the card I have not yet put 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.159
 so 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.759
 the dimensions are 83 for 50 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:13.189
 for 16 millimeters then very very very very small it really is 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.229
 really tiny 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:16.270
 11 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.429
 compared awn 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:21.809
 a credit card 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:23.570
 these are the dimensions 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.399
 then 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:28.619
 very small weight of only 80 grams 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.049
 as we said 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.189
 eeeh an android from mounts the 1st pressure. you are very fast the processor from 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.189
 600 girls see how it reacts very well 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.089
 it is not multi ita shake 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:51.250
 is a smr quadripartite 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.959
 we said that diana purchases 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.689
 two buttons for volume travel the button dedicated to the room the part 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.839
 rear 5 megapixel camera 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:06.369
 this here you see the speaker the led flash and written xperia 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.100
 in the lower part we find the door instead 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.329
 micro sd 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.369
 it's possible to apply geographic tags let's say yes 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:19.120
 photos with geolocation present therefore also the gps 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.059
 to locate 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:26.050
 our images port said micro or ast to synchronize and recharge 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.809
 holes for the microphone 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:34.389
 I want to do and see below because this phone is practically the 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.659
 first model of sony erikson with android that is not so taken the 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:41.560
 battery the built-in son jackson battery provides a 2-year warranty 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.780
 so no problem even to replace the sim housing 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.059
 nicolato card slot 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:49.409
 sd 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:54.399
 2 gigabytes the integrated the speaker as you can see in cancun filter que 

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:57.249
 if the antenna 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:59.910
 nothing on the left side 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.900
 instead we have in the lower part as we said father objects, 5 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.960
 millimeters e 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.559
 this brief space space this near the geca 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:12.299
 and to apply a wired remote control that in this way is not present but 

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:15.299
 perhaps between places to buy as an accessory 8 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.870
 in the upper part button to browse to unlock the screen but also 

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:26.089
 turn off we also have the audio capsule between the mechanical buttons 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:28.990
 as we have already seen only xperia x10 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.189
 this is the mini version 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:32.620
 repeat 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.960
 ehm logo dystonia rixam 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.710
 and therefore at the level of alboran 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.440
 to these characteristics 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.740
 the autofocus camera does not even miss the fm radio with rds 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.960
 see also in the application of course let it start 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.960
 connect the akg k headphones let's all be there 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:56.740
 radio 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.290
 perfect is loading all the stations through the rds 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.169
 search for current channels 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.949
 very quick here's all very shy toso jackson. so much about this 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.409
 small smartphone 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.750
 even that price 249 euros should reach the market therefore considerable 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.419
 perfect I immediately took the synchrony you can turn it off 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.650
 let's go out 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.050
 koelliker interfaced 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.699
 similar to that of xperia 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.729
 conai 4 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.330
 with the addition of l4 functions in the corners this to manage a screen 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.369
 very small 

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:40.859
 he came to vienna so straightforward there is no way schipa of course it is 

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.680
 You can see little pictures 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.600
 programs management in with these four active corners and the possibility 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.439
 of 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:51.870
 put the applications we want we can optimize 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.800
 1 message is written with 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.889
 the alphanumeric keyboard t9 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:00.969
 so by itself 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:03.969
 that I live in - coming to them for any problem 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:09.800
 and these are the beautiful pope menus 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.340
 where there are 9 panel applications, of course, it is possible to add others 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.759
 we are on an android is one. 6 then 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.889
 many applications available 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:23.190
 this as we said a preview of the aira film boxing 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.480
 that rare 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.960
 that with 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.430
