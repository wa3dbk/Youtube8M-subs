from<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> front-facing<00:00:30.420> camera<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:32.489> very

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
from the front-facing camera it is very

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.340 
from the front-facing camera it is very
important<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.540> point<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> sensor

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
important that you point the sensor

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.530 
important that you point the sensor
directly<00:00:34.530> at<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> light<00:00:35.280> source<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.820> it

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
directly at the light source as it

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.080 
directly at the light source as it
doesn't<00:00:36.690> measure<00:00:36.960> off<00:00:37.200> angles<00:00:37.649> well<00:00:38.090> this

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
doesn't measure off angles well this

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.270 
doesn't measure off angles well this
takes<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.480> little<00:00:39.750> bit<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.960> practice<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.559> after

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
takes a little bit of practice but after

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.979 
takes a little bit of practice but after
that<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.670> will<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.879> able<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.180> hit<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.780> spot

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
that you will be able to hit the spot

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.470 
that you will be able to hit the spot
every<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.739> essentially<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.120> want<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
every time essentially you just want to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.380 
every time essentially you just want to
maximize<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> reading<00:00:46.559> from<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> sensor<00:00:47.390> you

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
maximize the reading from the sensor you

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.180 
maximize the reading from the sensor you
can<00:00:48.539> start<00:00:48.809> stock<00:00:49.079> metering<00:00:49.559> using<00:00:49.980> either

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
can start stock metering using either

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
can start stock metering using either
the<00:00:50.340> centered<00:00:50.760> button<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.930> volume

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the centered button or the volume

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.470 
the centered button or the volume
buttons<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:54.980> you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.340> I've<00:00:56.550> drastically

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
buttons as you can see I've drastically

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.459 
buttons as you can see I've drastically
changed<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.930> layout

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
changed the layout

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.049 
changed the layout
hopefully<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.250> new<00:00:59.399> layout<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> bit

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
hopefully this new layout is a bit

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.450 
hopefully this new layout is a bit
clearer<00:01:00.390> than<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> old<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:02.039> value<00:01:02.340> being

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
clearer than the old the value being

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.950 
clearer than the old the value being
calculated<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.210> highlighted<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.899> light

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
calculated is highlighted in light

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.469 
calculated is highlighted in light
purple<00:01:04.470> while<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> other<00:01:05.519> values<00:01:05.939> are<00:01:06.119> medium

purple while the other values are medium

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.960 
purple while the other values are medium
and<00:01:06.540> dark<00:01:06.720> purple<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.520> select<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> value<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and dark purple to select the value to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.899 
and dark purple to select the value to
calculate<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.659> long<00:01:10.080> press<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.530> value

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
calculate for long press on the value

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.700 
calculate for long press on the value
like<00:01:11.909> before<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.600> change<00:01:12.810> one<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> values

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
like before to change one of the values

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.219 
like before to change one of the values
test<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.700> value<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.180> dialogue<00:01:15.659> screen<00:01:16.080> will

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
test the value a dialogue screen will

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.440 
test the value a dialogue screen will
appear<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.299> we're
