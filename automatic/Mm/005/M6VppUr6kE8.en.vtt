like every handheld platform that's ever
existed<00:00:50.059> at<00:00:50.570> this<00:00:50.780> point<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:51.410> I've<00:00:51.620> you<00:00:52.010> know

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
existed at this point so I've you know

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.369 
existed at this point so I've you know
I've<00:00:52.160> seen<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:52.670> on<00:00:53.050> on<00:00:54.050> my<00:00:55.269> iPad<00:00:56.269> 3<00:00:56.690> with<00:00:57.230> the

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
I've seen it on on my iPad 3 with the

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.090 
I've seen it on on my iPad 3 with the
retina<00:00:57.920> display<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:58.730> all<00:00:58.850> that<00:00:59.239> um<00:00:59.830> this<00:01:00.830> is

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
retina display and all that um this is

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.869 
retina display and all that um this is
still<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.110> best-looking<00:01:03.110> way<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:04.370> obviously

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
still the best-looking way and obviously

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.789 
still the best-looking way and obviously
it's<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.210> best<00:01:05.390> controlling<00:01:06.020> way<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:08.270> play<00:01:08.600> it

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
it's the best controlling way to play it

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.820 
it's the best controlling way to play it
so<00:01:10.600> what<00:01:11.600> is<00:01:11.780> it<00:01:11.990> if<00:01:12.380> you<00:01:12.590> don't<00:01:12.799> know<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:13.369> is<00:01:13.640> a

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
so what is it if you don't know it is a

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.820 
so what is it if you don't know it is a
typical<00:01:15.830> Grand<00:01:16.549> Theft<00:01:16.700> Auto<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.750> just<00:01:18.590> about

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
typical Grand Theft Auto and just about

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.890 
typical Grand Theft Auto and just about
every<00:01:19.130> way<00:01:19.280> except<00:01:20.090> for<00:01:20.390> it<00:01:20.689> is<00:01:22.600> played<00:01:23.600> by<00:01:23.840> the

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
every way except for it is played by the

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.260

more<00:01:24.350> old-school<00:01:24.710> Grand<00:01:25.369> Theft<00:01:25.580> Auto<00:01:25.790> one<00:01:26.119> or

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
one and two camera angle so it's a

other<00:02:48.709> than<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.550> perspective<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:50.959> the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
other than the perspective but the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.860 
other than the perspective but the
perspective<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:51.680> actually<00:02:52.070> kind<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.370> neat<00:02:52.870> for

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
perspective is actually kind of neat for

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.170 
perspective is actually kind of neat for
some<00:02:54.050> people<00:02:54.340> actually<00:02:55.340> liked<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:55.940> more<00:02:56.120> than

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
some people actually liked it more than

some people actually liked it more than
than<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:58.090> than<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.120> old<00:02:59.420> art<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.620> old<00:03:00.770> than

the<00:03:01.340> new<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.500> just<00:03:03.709> got<00:03:03.860> wasted<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.489> you

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
the new so I just got wasted and you

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.340

hospital just like the the 3d ones so
really<00:03:12.380> I<00:03:12.410> mean<00:03:12.739> if<00:03:13.010> you're<00:03:13.489> on<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.640> fence<00:03:13.820> as

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
really I mean if you're on the fence as

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.090 
really I mean if you're on the fence as
to<00:03:14.239> whether<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.840> should<00:03:14.900> buy<00:03:15.050> this<00:03:15.380> game<00:03:15.890> or

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
to whether you should buy this game or

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.949 
to whether you should buy this game or
not<00:03:16.130> it's<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:17.030> depends<00:03:17.720> on<00:03:18.070> whether<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.959> think

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
not it's it depends on whether you think

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.630 
not it's it depends on whether you think
you<00:03:21.080> like<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:21.830> for<00:03:22.010> some<00:03:22.160> people<00:03:22.489> they<00:03:22.610> just

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
you like it's for some people they just

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.580 
you like it's for some people they just
can't<00:03:23.060> get<00:03:23.180> into<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.720> perspective<00:03:24.320> I<00:03:24.410> don't

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
can't get into the perspective I don't

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.590 
can't get into the perspective I don't
know<00:03:24.709> if<00:03:24.830> it's<00:03:24.950> younger<00:03:25.220> gamers<00:03:25.549> or<00:03:25.910> what<00:03:26.150> that

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
know if it's younger gamers or what that

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.330 
know if it's younger gamers or what that
just<00:03:27.230> aren't<00:03:27.440> used<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:28.130> this<00:03:28.580> style<00:03:28.880> of<00:03:28.970> game

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
just aren't used to this style of game

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.830 
just aren't used to this style of game
but<00:03:31.340> if<00:03:31.459> you're<00:03:31.580> an<00:03:31.730> older<00:03:32.000> gamer<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:32.600> you

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
but if you're an older gamer that you

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.690 
but if you're an older gamer that you
know<00:03:32.959> you've<00:03:33.290> played<00:03:33.650> games<00:03:33.980> from<00:03:34.280> this<00:03:34.489> sort

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
know you've played games from this sort

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.140 
know you've played games from this sort
of<00:03:35.860> you<00:03:36.860> know<00:03:36.890> this<00:03:37.160> feels<00:03:37.400> like<00:03:37.640> it<00:03:37.910> could<00:03:37.940> be

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
of you know this feels like it could be

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.390 
of you know this feels like it could be
a<00:03:38.239> game<00:03:38.450> from<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.660> 80s<00:03:39.110> except<00:03:39.709> for<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:40.010> looks

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
a game from the 80s except for it looks

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.360 
a game from the 80s except for it looks
gorgeous

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.330 

so<00:03:45.060> yeah<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.959> guess<00:03:46.080> that's<00:03:46.470> probably<00:03:46.860> the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
so yeah I guess that's probably the

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.300 
so yeah I guess that's probably the
difference<00:03:48.500> it's<00:03:49.500> not<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.799> say<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.069> there's

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
difference it's not to say that there's

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.100 
difference it's not to say that there's
not<00:03:50.430> any<00:03:50.730> young<00:03:51.030> people<00:03:51.360> who<00:03:51.480> don't<00:03:51.659> like<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:52.019> I

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
not any young people who don't like it I

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.170 
not any young people who don't like it I
don't<00:03:52.140> mean<00:03:52.409> to<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.739> know<00:03:52.860> make<00:03:53.280> create<00:03:54.030> some
