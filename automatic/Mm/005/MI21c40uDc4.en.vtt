00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:56.119 
direction of the heart and you're

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.329 
direction of the heart and you're
alternating<00:00:56.720> each<00:00:56.900> stroke<00:00:57.260> with<00:00:58.010> your<00:00:58.159> hand

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
work over the neck area too and that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.310 
work over the neck area too and that
time<00:01:32.180> you're<00:01:32.360> working<00:01:32.480> downwards<00:01:33.140> because

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
time you're working downwards because

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.470 
time you're working downwards because
again<00:01:33.860> is<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.730> floor<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:35.390> the

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
again is to the the floor and the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.420 
again is to the the floor and the
direction<00:01:35.810> of<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.110> heart<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.860> continue<00:01:40.310> your

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
direction of the heart to continue your

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.820 
direction of the heart to continue your
body<00:01:40.640> brushing<00:01:40.970> you're<00:01:41.690> still<00:01:42.170> working<00:01:42.409> in

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
body brushing you're still working in

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.230 
body brushing you're still working in
the<00:01:42.860> venous<00:01:43.220> return<00:01:43.310> which<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.000> direction

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
the venous return which is the direction

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.330 
the venous return which is the direction
of<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.510> heart<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.080> it's<00:01:45.560> simply<00:01:45.920> brushing

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
of the heart so it's simply brushing

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.210 
of the heart so it's simply brushing
upwards<00:01:46.730> and<00:01:46.970> some<00:01:47.600> people<00:01:47.930> choose<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.290> do

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
upwards and some people choose to do

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.130 
upwards and some people choose to do
more<00:01:49.580> of<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.729> circular<00:01:50.210> motion<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:50.750> if<00:01:50.870> you<00:01:50.960> did

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
more of a circular motion so if you did

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.010 
more of a circular motion so if you did
want<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.530> you<00:01:52.100> could<00:01:52.280> work<00:01:52.460> in<00:01:52.700> circles<00:01:53.020> but

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
want to you could work in circles but

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.110 
want to you could work in circles but
the<00:01:54.320> easiest<00:01:54.680> way<00:01:54.830> is<00:01:55.190> just<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.520> brush<00:01:55.820> and

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
the easiest way is just to brush and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.190 
the easiest way is just to brush and
then<00:01:56.210> alternate<00:01:56.659> with<00:01:56.810> your<00:01:56.960> hand

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.440 

dry<00:02:03.829> skin<00:02:04.130> brushing<00:02:04.490> on<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.820> back<00:02:04.969> of<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.270> leg

dry skin brushing on the back of the leg

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.510 
dry skin brushing on the back of the leg
exactly<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.439> same<00:02:06.649> principle<00:02:06.860> you're<00:02:07.369> just

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
exactly the same principle you're just

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.359 
exactly the same principle you're just
alternating<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.450> brush<00:02:08.690> with<00:02:09.379> your<00:02:09.560> hand<00:02:09.739> and

alternating the brush with your hand and
you<00:02:10.429> can<00:02:10.670> also<00:02:10.819> spend<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.300> little<00:02:11.420> bit<00:02:11.569> of<00:02:11.690> time

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
you can also spend a little bit of time

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.960 
you can also spend a little bit of time
on<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.830> sole<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.310> foot<00:02:13.519> if<00:02:13.670> there's<00:02:13.849> any

on the sole of the foot if there's any
dry<00:02:14.209> skin<00:02:14.540> there<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:15.620> helps<00:02:15.890> to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
dry skin there and it just helps to

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.160 
dry skin there and it just helps to
really<00:02:16.310> start<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.760> remove<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.239> dryness<00:02:17.720> and

in<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.840> back<00:02:20.989> of<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.260> leg<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.560> tend<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.890> have

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
in the back of the leg you tend to have

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.610 
in the back of the leg you tend to have
any<00:02:22.580> cellulite<00:02:23.569> or<00:02:23.720> anything<00:02:23.930> pull<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.440> skin
