00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.170 
Gumby over here is going to do this and
the<00:03:38.290> goal<00:03:38.470> eventually<00:03:38.800> is<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.370> get<00:03:39.640> this<00:03:39.940> knee

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
the goal eventually is to get this knee

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.140 
the goal eventually is to get this knee
as<00:03:40.570> close<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.080> wall<00:03:41.230> as<00:03:41.320> possible<00:03:42.150> right

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
as close to the wall as possible right

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.699 
as close to the wall as possible right
and<00:03:43.390> if<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:43.720> were<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.989> do<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.290> if<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.560> were<00:03:44.680> to

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
and if I were to do that if I were to

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:45.960 
and if I were to do that if I were to
put<00:03:44.920> my<00:03:45.010> knee<00:03:45.070> back<00:03:45.310> there<00:03:45.489> I'd<00:03:45.640> have<00:03:45.820> to

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
put my knee back there I'd have to

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.000 
put my knee back there I'd have to
basically<00:03:46.180> hunch<00:03:47.020> I<00:03:47.260> think<00:03:47.470> like<00:03:47.709> I<00:03:47.739> think

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
basically hunch I think like I think

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.199 
basically hunch I think like I think
your<00:03:48.100> leg<00:03:48.250> would<00:03:48.370> break<00:03:48.550> it<00:03:48.910> would<00:03:49.060> probably

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
your leg would break it would probably

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.699 
your leg would break it would probably
break<00:03:49.510> I'm<00:03:49.750> gonna<00:03:49.930> have<00:03:50.050> to<00:03:50.140> switch<00:03:50.290> legs

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709

break I'm gonna have to switch legs
so<00:03:51.220> you<00:03:51.280> want<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.550> hold<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.880> for<00:03:52.060> about<00:03:52.239> a

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
so you want to hold it for about a

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.949 
so you want to hold it for about a
minute<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:53.860> minute<00:03:54.100> thirty<00:03:54.570> and<00:03:55.570> then<00:03:55.720> we

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
minute to a minute thirty and then we

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.810 
minute to a minute thirty and then we
can<00:03:56.080> switch<00:03:56.440> legs<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:56.980> switch<00:03:57.310> legs<00:03:57.550> with<00:03:57.730> you

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
stretch a little bit and especially if I

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.780 
stretch a little bit and especially if I
squeeze<00:04:33.260> my<00:04:33.290> gluten<00:04:33.710> really<00:04:33.890> feels<00:04:34.040> right<00:04:34.250> so

felt a lot of stretch my my hips were
not<00:05:21.230> level<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:22.100> as<00:05:22.460> I<00:05:22.640> progressed<00:05:23.060> my

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
not level and as I progressed my

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.270 
not level and as I progressed my
runnings<00:05:23.660> gotten<00:05:24.020> a<00:05:24.200> lot<00:05:24.380> smoother<00:05:24.800> my<00:05:25.070> gait

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
runnings gotten a lot smoother my gait

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.070 
runnings gotten a lot smoother my gait
is<00:05:25.520> a<00:05:25.550> lot<00:05:25.850> better<00:05:26.180> and<00:05:26.540> I<00:05:26.600> don't<00:05:26.690> break<00:05:26.870> down

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
is a lot better and I don't break down

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.570 
is a lot better and I don't break down
as<00:05:27.290> much<00:05:27.410> at<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.590> end<00:05:27.680> of<00:05:27.740> my<00:05:27.800> long<00:05:27.920> runs<00:05:28.160> all

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
as much at the end of my long runs all

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.260 
as much at the end of my long runs all
right<00:05:28.730> that's<00:05:28.970> great

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
right that's great

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.410 
right that's great
I<00:05:29.450> mean<00:05:29.600> clearly<00:05:30.140> function<00:05:30.620> does<00:05:30.830> equal<00:05:31.160> fast

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
I mean clearly function does equal fast

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.610 
I mean clearly function does equal fast
because<00:05:32.420> she's<00:05:32.630> becoming<00:05:32.990> more<00:05:33.080> functional

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
because she's becoming more functional

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.920 
because she's becoming more functional
and<00:05:33.920> faster<00:05:34.370> that's<00:05:34.670> right<00:05:34.910> yeah<00:05:35.180> and<00:05:35.660> so<00:05:35.780> can

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
and faster that's right yeah and so can

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.730 
and faster that's right yeah and so can
you<00:05:36.020> so<00:05:36.380> get<00:05:36.740> on<00:05:36.830> it

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
you so get on it

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.400 
you so get on it
