Afghan<00:00:24.050> is<00:00:24.289> made<00:00:24.920> out<00:00:25.100> of<00:00:25.280> square<00:00:25.730> motifs<00:00:26.300> that

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
Afghan is made out of square motifs that

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.560 
Afghan is made out of square motifs that
are<00:00:26.930> joined<00:00:27.740> as<00:00:27.890> you<00:00:28.010> go<00:00:28.220> to<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:29.119> adjacent

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
are joined as you go to the adjacent

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.109 
are joined as you go to the adjacent
motif<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:30.440> then<00:00:30.860> the<00:00:31.010> motif<00:00:31.400> is<00:00:31.640> actually

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
motif and then the motif is actually

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.200 
motif and then the motif is actually
flipped<00:00:32.509> in<00:00:32.719> between<00:00:33.230> each<00:00:33.559> one<00:00:34.010> so<00:00:34.879> that<00:00:35.030> the

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
flipped in between each one so that the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.119 
flipped in between each one so that the
swirl<00:00:35.480> changes<00:00:36.260> direction<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:36.890> gives<00:00:37.039> you

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
swirl changes direction and gives you

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.090 
swirl changes direction and gives you

we're going to follow today and as you
can<00:00:55.100> see<00:00:55.340> it<00:00:55.489> has<00:00:55.700> the<00:00:55.940> numbers<00:00:56.329> of<00:00:56.540> each<00:00:56.690> row

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
can see it has the numbers of each row

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.930 
can see it has the numbers of each row
on<00:00:57.200> it<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.500> it's<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.890> numbers<00:00:58.250> are<00:00:58.430> on<00:00:58.460> the

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
on it and it's the numbers are on the

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.630

and<00:01:03.800> if<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:04.250> see<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:04.549> starts<00:01:04.969> right<00:01:05.239> here<00:01:05.269> on

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
and if you see it starts right here on

and if you see it starts right here on
the<00:01:05.899> right<00:01:06.079> side<00:01:06.439> and<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:07.640> pattern<00:01:08.090> is<00:01:08.270> to

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
the right side and the pattern is to

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.930 
the right side and the pattern is to
chain<00:01:08.750> 3<00:01:09.110> at<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.289> beginning<00:01:09.590> of<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:09.979> row<00:01:10.130> two

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
chain 3 at the beginning of the row two

double<00:01:11.690> crochets<00:01:12.200> into<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.799> chain<00:01:12.830> two<00:01:13.280> space

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
double crochets into the chain two space

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.399 
double crochets into the chain two space
of<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.880> previous<00:01:14.299> row<00:01:14.510> and<00:01:14.750> then<00:01:15.080> double

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
of the previous row and then double

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.560 
of the previous row and then double
crochet<00:01:15.799> in<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.070> next<00:01:16.100> stitch<00:01:16.430> that<00:01:17.150> sounds

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
crochet in the next stitch that sounds

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.180 
crochet in the next stitch that sounds
pretty<00:01:17.780> familiar<00:01:17.960> if<00:01:18.470> you're<00:01:18.650> used<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:19.010> line

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
pretty familiar if you're used to line

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.980 
pretty familiar if you're used to line
by<00:01:19.369> line<00:01:19.400> instructions<00:01:20.210> but<00:01:20.600> it's<00:01:20.780> just

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
by line instructions but it's just

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.920 
by line instructions but it's just
really<00:01:21.200> condensed<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:22.130> in<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:23.180> chart<00:01:23.479> format

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
really condensed of in the chart format

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.570 
really condensed of in the chart format
so<00:01:24.290> let<00:01:24.439> me<00:01:24.530> show<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:24.770> how<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.040> do<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:25.400> we're

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
so let me show you how to do that we're

double crochet in the stitch of the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.420 
double crochet in the stitch of the
previous<00:01:46.009> round

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
previous round

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.030 
previous round
a<00:01:46.520> row<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:47.450> we'll<00:01:47.600> yarn<00:01:47.780> over<00:01:48.049> hook<00:01:48.080> insert

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
a row so we'll yarn over hook insert

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.880 
a row so we'll yarn over hook insert
pull<00:01:49.759> up<00:01:49.909> a<00:01:50.030> loop<00:01:50.180> pull<00:01:50.240> through<00:01:50.810> two<00:01:51.079> pull

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
pull up a loop pull through two pull

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.560 
pull up a loop pull through two pull
through<00:01:51.920> two<00:01:52.189> now<00:01:52.549> I'll<00:01:52.939> speed<00:01:53.270> along<00:01:53.509> a

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
through two now I'll speed along a

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.899 
through two now I'll speed along a
little<00:01:53.810> faster<00:01:53.930> on<00:01:54.560> this<00:01:54.770> row<00:01:55.040> just<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:55.670> we<00:01:55.790> can

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
little faster on this row just so we can

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.310 
little faster on this row just so we can
get<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.390> next<00:01:56.659> row<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:56.960> can<00:01:57.110> show<00:01:57.259> you

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
get to the next row and I can show you

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.550 
get to the next row and I can show you
the<00:01:57.500> other<00:01:57.650> part<00:01:58.009> of<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.220> pattern

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
the other part of the pattern

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.609 
the other part of the pattern
so<00:02:00.560> we'll<00:02:00.740> do<00:02:00.950> two<00:02:01.400> double<00:02:01.759> crochets<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.049> in

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
so we'll do two double crochets and a in

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.529 
so we'll do two double crochets and a in
the<00:02:03.799> chain<00:02:04.070> one<00:02:04.939> in<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.240> stitch

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.280 

and<00:02:09.649> then<00:02:10.649> two<00:02:10.950> double<00:02:11.280> crochets<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.629> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
and then two double crochets in the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.960 
and then two double crochets in the
chain<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:15.140> one<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.409> stitch<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.790> you'll

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
chain and one in the stitch and you'll

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.880 
chain and one in the stitch and you'll
just<00:02:18.120> complete<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.569> across<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.260> entire<00:02:19.290> row

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
just complete that across the entire row

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.059 
just complete that across the entire row
and<00:02:20.099> then<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.760> go<00:02:20.909> on<00:02:21.180> further<00:02:21.900> into<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.709> chart

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
and then to go on further into the chart

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.360 
and then to go on further into the chart
what<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.209> we<00:02:24.480> work<00:02:24.689> rows<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.500> double

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
what we do is we work rows of double

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.119 
what we do is we work rows of double
crochet<00:02:26.819> chain<00:02:27.239> two<00:02:27.569> skip<00:02:28.110> two<00:02:28.260> stitches<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
crochet chain two skip two stitches and

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.740 
crochet chain two skip two stitches and
then<00:02:29.280> double<00:02:29.640> crochet<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.239> can<00:02:30.420> see<00:02:30.629> on

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
then double crochet and you can see on

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.089 
then double crochet and you can see on
the<00:02:30.900> chart<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.409> alternates<00:02:31.950> between

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
the chart that it alternates between

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.059 
the chart that it alternates between
that<00:02:32.549> style<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.209> patterning<00:02:33.780> for<00:02:33.930> most<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
that style of patterning for most of the

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.759 
that style of patterning for most of the
motif<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.730> then<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.299> even<00:02:36.510> goes<00:02:36.840> on<00:02:37.049> this<00:02:37.500> has

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
motif and then it even goes on this has

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.710 
motif and then it even goes on this has
so<00:02:38.040> much<00:02:38.250> instruction<00:02:38.640> written<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.299> this<00:02:39.480> one

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
so much instruction written in this one

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.750 
so much instruction written in this one
chart<00:02:40.079> it<00:02:40.349> even<00:02:40.680> goes<00:02:40.859> on<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.159> show<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.400> how

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
chart it even goes on to show you how

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.470 
chart it even goes on to show you how
you<00:02:41.819> join<00:02:42.799> one<00:02:43.799> motif<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.549> another<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.090> by

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
you join one motif to another and by

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.629 
you join one motif to another and by
skipping<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.079> middle<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.250> following

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
skipping the middle of the following

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.369 
skipping the middle of the following
motif<00:02:48.120> that's<00:02:48.420> how<00:02:48.629> it<00:02:48.810> shows<00:02:49.079> you<00:02:49.260> that

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
motif that's how it shows you that

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.470 
motif that's how it shows you that
that's<00:02:49.560> just<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:50.129> edge<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.760> gets<00:02:51.090> joined

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
that's just the edge that gets joined

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.509 
that's just the edge that gets joined
and<00:02:51.690> then<00:02:52.079> it<00:02:52.200> even<00:02:52.349> goes<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.859> to<00:02:53.010> further<00:02:53.220> show

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
and then it even goes on to further show

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.339 
and then it even goes on to further show
you<00:02:53.579> how<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:53.879> do<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.209> edging<00:02:54.599> and<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.019> can<00:02:55.139> see

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
you how to do the edging and you can see

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.289 
you how to do the edging and you can see
this<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.709> one<00:02:55.889> of<00:02:55.920> our<00:02:56.099> finished<00:02:56.489> motifs<00:02:56.970> right

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
this is one of our finished motifs right

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.289 
this is one of our finished motifs right
here<00:02:57.659> this<00:02:58.079> has<00:02:58.349> all<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.709> those<00:02:59.069> rows<00:02:59.430> then<00:03:00.120> it

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
here this has all of those rows then it

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.690 
here this has all of those rows then it
has<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.870> edge<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.440> then<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:02.040> round<00:03:02.310> of

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
has the edge and then the round of

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.720 
has the edge and then the round of
edging<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.299> then<00:03:03.780> for<00:03:04.109> any<00:03:04.829> motif<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.639> you
