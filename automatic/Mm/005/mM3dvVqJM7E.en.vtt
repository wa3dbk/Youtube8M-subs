00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.020
 be fine and that spend a very good 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.910
 last week before school 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.429
 for the occasion I filmed you a 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.320
 getting ready special back to school i 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.000
 did not plan but it was falling off 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.349
 I wanted to see getting ready 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.759
 but I did not really know 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.410
 when the theme but hey that's it 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.880
 fell at the right time last year 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.180
 I did a little series back to 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.699
 school with a look book a video 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.900
 advice and an ounce in my back I you 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.330
 will leave the links so that can and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.760
 to find and this year I will do 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.929
 no playoffs because I'm out 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.630
 from school for a while 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.160
 now and I think my advice 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.430
 will not be repeated or the videos 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.750
 will be less relevant because I am 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.579
 more in the school system and I 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.160
 think that has changed since 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.690
 maybe or not but I hope this 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.120
 casting wedding will please you it will do 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.440
 pleasure too 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.379
 so as you can see I did not 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.600
 not a perfect complexion and it's not a 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.370
 reason a little for spreading my face 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.660
 of fontan so the only thing I 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.510
 do it short I have a few pages 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.019
 hyperpigmentation with concealer 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.080
 kiko who after my nyx corrector is 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.909
 the best then you really have to 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.900
 I wake up my eyes in the morning 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.280
 I apply the fact that neither maybelline 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.110
 which I love very much I am and for the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.200
 time before but in the meantime I tanned 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.130
 so I'm a little long time that the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.799
 corrector now they know 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.610
 also fight I finally found a 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.229
 alternative to the xe2 max studio and the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.729
 bobby brown powder I was standing over 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.439
 too much the name but I'll let you from 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.439
 fight I really love them 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.360
 you know my problem or 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.520
 rather my obsession with sources 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.540
 really I'm working them isolate the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.340
 nice shape 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.229
 as I did it all the time I 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.720
 really want definition today 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.220
 so a little highlighter for still 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.290
 better define eyebrows 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.940
 it's very rare but I use my 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.350
 favorite of sephora who in real 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.810
 temperament earth haidar mascara like 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.519
 usually in my dressing room and had to leave 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.590
 after and as I say I want to 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.640
 definition so a little cantons ring 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.180
 something that I do it very 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.400
 rarely 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.790
 so I was doing my cheeks a bit with 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.160
 specific sofa on turing is a little 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.010
 even darker for a little bit 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.850
 more shaded to another face and to 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.850
 scrutinize your head a little 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.050
 a bit of highlighter to bring a 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.170
 touch of light to certain areas of the 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.050
 face of bluff and what else than 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.400
 gregory thomas i get up but today 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.140
 there is a novelty 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.780
 I finally found that when he feels no 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.870
 add to liquorice and that of nick this 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.700
 obviously I'm not you 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.920
 let's have no info but 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.930
 sometimes be careful you have a lot of 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.880
 products that that and is the only thing 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.500
 that I do sometimes is to compress 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:11.230
 company or kissing same bouffard 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.360
 in fact it's better but hey the guy 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.190
 natural carbon with a little bit of everything 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.510
 today it was the contouring it is 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.280
 really the makeup that I prefer 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.400
 do and I hope you like it 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.400
 as well 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.090
 or maintained I leave you the choice 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.209
 with three outfits that I selected 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.130
 so the first held very 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.170
 French I think that being in 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.530
 germany makes me want to claim 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.220
 my French side of the coup I chose it 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.410
 badly a sailor with pretty jim of a 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.900
 pair of ballerinas with retailers 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.530
 hook and I found what is it 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.090
 really so French that it was 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.130
 perfect there is at the same time it's very 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.530
 young is perfect for a first 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.330
 school day with the bag I wanted 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.060
 also mark the coup so I chose 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.100
 my child and I know it's a bag 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.269
 that everyone has but it's also the 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.070
 best bag to go to school 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.590
 frankly you can put everything 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.720
 in and myself I used this 50 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.700
 for her is going on my second outfit 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.900
 is really for the league lousy 1 so 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.959
 all the girls who like to be 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.910
 profitable or in skirt in nothing his psid I 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.010
 I'm not that much, but 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.890
 I always have an outfit in this style 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.300
 so I chose this sweater with 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.640
 pink retailers that I find so much 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.310
 reassembled so beautiful and I 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.979
 associate with shorts so that's it 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.830
 continues in everything in all 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.720
 romance of those held and for 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.880
 all the girls who like to be rather 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.110
 at high heels or high perched I you 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.550
 advises against the heels anyway for 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.260
 school because at the end of the day 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.419
 we do not want to walk like 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.890
 quasimodo so what I advise this 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.680
 are really totally compensated or 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.020
 mobile platforms allow the 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.850
 time to be at the pole and to lengthen your 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.169
 legs or to be a little bigger 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.760
 but at the same time walking and 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.400
 comfortably and hold all the 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.290
 day for the coronation was inspired by a 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.849
 youtube 2 english task to green who 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.159
 had shown his cock his quest 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.949
 we had started this rally with 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:09.020
 eight goals and cribs and I found this 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.360
 bag so beautiful that I had a small 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.580
 and do it by creating the outfit I'm 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:19.309
 find I 'll just gorgeous 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:20.599
 with this news the last outfit I 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:23.029
 think you already know it's 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.439
 so much me it's really my outfit if 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:25.999
 I think that's what I would put 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:28.610
 if there was a school year 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:31.459
 so it's a joke as usual 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.429
 and I even named this outfit I 

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:35.839
 name everything sinks vosskuhle because I 

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:38.659
 did you think that you read so cool 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:41.539
 so laid back at once very 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.839
 very nice for the first day of the 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.759
 return 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:46.099
 because even though the smoke very black 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:49.849
 I finally added some details 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:53.449
 colorful with sandals and jewels 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:56.330
 for that I think it reminds a little 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:59.059
 summer but both the dark side 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.429
 to do that represents a bit of gloom 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:06.079
 to wake up again very early to 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:08.779
 go to class I chose my new 

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:09.980
 stefanel bag that I showed you in 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:12.080
 the indispensable 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.850
 2 and I know the subscriber had me 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.040
 asked that's what was suitable for 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.990
 the courses and I personally you 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.570
 advises against it because it is even if 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.610
 your notebook to four between two times 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.250
 I find this bag all the same 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.130
 small for them for school or for all 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.990
 the days the courses and maybe who 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.550
 would be fit for the puddle if you 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.520
 have less to have it removed 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.800
 but for every day for college 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.310
 to let him really advice this 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.740
 bag and that's three outfits for the 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.940
 back three different outfits the 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.100
 each other but I leave you 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.780
 choose which one you like best and 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.760
 it allows me to know a little what 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.040
 held to win this battle but 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.140
 personally I find everything and one 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.160
 beautiful even though I have a preference for 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.160
 the holding of the rhone 3 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.610
 and that's it, I'm done with my guy 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.230
 I would have said I hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.480
 and of course it's not necessarily 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.620
 a gatinois the school specials because 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.720
 that you can adapt it for all 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.790
 situations and I hope that you 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.530
 will have pleased and it stinks to help you too 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.750
 on this month I make you lots of kisses 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.790
 and I'll meet again next Wednesday and 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.240
 meanwhile spend a very good 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.910
 return 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.010
 I do not make a lot of kisses courage hold 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:28.570
 good and that's all going to be fine and I 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.570
 do lots of low kisses
