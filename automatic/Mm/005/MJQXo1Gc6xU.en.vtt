Mulligan's shot from a little far out

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.390 
Mulligan's shot from a little far out
think<00:04:08.599> it's<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.840> better<00:04:09.019> idea<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.500> penetrate<00:04:10.159> a

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
think it's a better idea to penetrate a

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.039 
think it's a better idea to penetrate a
little<00:04:10.640> deeper<00:04:10.909> before<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.299> try<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.569> take<00:04:12.019> a

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
little deeper before you try to take a

little deeper before you try to take a
shot<00:04:12.379> as<00:04:12.879> especially<00:04:13.879> I<00:04:13.909> guess<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.209> kid<00:04:14.359> like

Houston<00:04:14.870> he's<00:04:15.079> just<00:04:15.260> too<00:04:15.379> quick<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.799> shoot

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
Houston he's just too quick to shoot
