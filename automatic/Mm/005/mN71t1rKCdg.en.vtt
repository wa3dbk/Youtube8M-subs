enabled this lasts for about 30 to 50

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.539 
enabled this lasts for about 30 to 50
seconds<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.079> yeah<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.739> can<00:03:16.950> basically<00:03:17.250> climb

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
seconds and yeah you can basically climb

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.500 
seconds and yeah you can basically climb
up<00:03:17.670> anything<00:03:18.269> cuz<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:19.590> does<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:20.510> energetic

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
that you've somehow become spider-man

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.330 
that you've somehow become spider-man
because<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:23.760> know<00:03:23.850> logic<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:25.170> shiz<00:03:25.650> so

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
because you know logic and that shiz so

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.770 
because you know logic and that shiz so

they have different different powers

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.640 
they have different different powers
which<00:03:33.000> become<00:03:33.329> very<00:03:33.569> very<00:03:33.870> useful<00:03:34.019> running

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650
