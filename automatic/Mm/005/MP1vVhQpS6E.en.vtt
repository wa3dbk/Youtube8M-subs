body into the lungs you will get

the blood that's flowing to the heart

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.009 
flowing to the heart from the body
there<00:02:35.630> will<00:02:35.750> be<00:02:35.780> congestion<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.840> as<00:02:38.840> the

there will be congestion and as the

heart beats morph inefficiently you can

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.800 
heart beats morph inefficiently you can

get this fluid buildup which can cause

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.650 
get this fluid buildup which can cause
coughing<00:02:45.110> coughing<00:02:45.890> can<00:02:46.250> also<00:02:46.489> be<00:02:46.970> caused<00:02:47.360> by

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
coughing coughing can also be caused by

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.600 
coughing coughing can also be caused by
the<00:02:48.170> heart<00:02:48.590> muscle<00:02:49.040> itself<00:02:49.750> expanding<00:02:50.750> as<00:02:50.900> a

the heart muscle itself expanding as a

the heart muscle itself expanding as a
how<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.760> becomes<00:02:53.000> more<00:02:53.360> inefficient<00:02:53.989> it

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
how it becomes more inefficient it

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.199 
how it becomes more inefficient it
actually<00:02:54.380> tries<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.860> pump<00:02:55.160> harder<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.880> make<00:02:56.060> up

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
actually tries to pump harder to make up

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.350 
actually tries to pump harder to make up
for<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.980> this<00:02:57.980> can<00:02:58.580> cause<00:02:58.760> an<00:02:58.970> enlargement

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
for it and this can cause an enlargement

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.420 
for it and this can cause an enlargement
of<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.569> heart<00:02:59.840> sometimes<00:03:00.440> pushing<00:03:01.069> up<00:03:01.190> on<00:03:01.310> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
of the heart sometimes pushing up on the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.220 
of the heart sometimes pushing up on the
windpipe<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.450> causes<00:03:02.690> almost<00:03:02.989> like<00:03:03.200> a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
windpipe and it causes almost like a

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.280 
windpipe and it causes almost like a
tickling<00:03:03.560> sensation<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.430> causes<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.819> cough

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
tickling sensation that causes a cough

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.229 
tickling sensation that causes a cough
anyway<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:07.069> gives<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.459> some<00:03:07.670> idea<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:08.030> some

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
anyway that gives you some idea of some

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.630 
anyway that gives you some idea of some
basic<00:03:09.140> causes<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.680> coughing<00:03:10.070> some<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.579> the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
basic causes of coughing some of the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.550 
basic causes of coughing some of the
more<00:03:10.790> common<00:03:11.150> ones<00:03:11.299> obviously<00:03:12.170> we<00:03:12.290> have<00:03:12.380> not

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
more common ones obviously we have not

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.920 
more common ones obviously we have not
touched<00:03:12.920> on<00:03:13.130> all<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.489> them<00:03:13.670> but<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:14.690> gives<00:03:14.840> you

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
touched on all of them but it gives you

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.039 
touched on all of them but it gives you
an<00:03:15.049> idea<00:03:15.200> as<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.100> what<00:03:16.760> we're<00:03:16.940> looking<00:03:17.239> at<00:03:17.359> when

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
an idea as to what we're looking at when

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.039 
an idea as to what we're looking at when
we<00:03:18.140> woke<00:03:18.320> up<00:03:18.530> about<00:03:18.680> with<00:03:19.549> coughing<00:03:20.060> obviously

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
we woke up about with coughing obviously

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.650 
we woke up about with coughing obviously
going<00:03:21.620> back<00:03:21.859> to<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.190> original<00:03:22.250> causes<00:03:22.940> we're

going back to the original causes we're

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.870 
going back to the original causes we're
