as we'll see in a second and grab the
leader<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:09.300> now<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.660> you've<00:02:09.810> got<00:02:10.020> in

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
leader and so now that you've got in

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.600 
leader and so now that you've got in
this<00:02:10.440> case<00:02:10.680> sweet<00:02:10.920> tooth<00:02:11.130> game<00:02:11.340> dragged

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
this case sweet tooth game dragged

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.720 
this case sweet tooth game dragged
behind<00:02:11.790> your<00:02:12.090> car<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:13.740> question<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.190> what<00:02:14.640> do

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
behind your car the question is what do

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.970 
behind your car the question is what do
you<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.270> guy<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.800> look

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
you do with this guy so if you look

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.670 
you do with this guy so if you look
around<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.460> level<00:02:17.760> you'll<00:02:17.940> notice<00:02:18.240> these

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
around the level you'll notice these

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.340 
around the level you'll notice these
missile<00:02:19.680> launchers<00:02:20.040> right<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:21.350> each

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
missile launchers right here and each

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.960 
missile launchers right here and each
faction<00:02:22.710> has<00:02:22.980> their<00:02:23.130> own<00:02:23.250> missile<00:02:23.610> launcher

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
faction has their own missile launcher

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.030 
faction has their own missile launcher
and<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.630> there's<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.050> perimeter<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.860> see

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
and so there's this perimeter you see

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.710 
and so there's this perimeter you see
this<00:02:26.190> yellow<00:02:26.430> ring<00:02:26.790> if<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.090> can<00:02:27.240> bring<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
this yellow ring if you can bring the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.510 
this yellow ring if you can bring the
faction<00:02:28.170> leader<00:02:28.350> into<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.830> yellow<00:02:29.010> ring<00:02:29.310> into

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
faction leader into the yellow ring into

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.860 
faction leader into the yellow ring into
the<00:02:29.580> perimeter<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.000> keep<00:02:30.150> them<00:02:30.450> there<00:02:30.480> long

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the perimeter and keep them there long

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.010 
the perimeter and keep them there long
enough<00:02:31.370> you'll<00:02:32.370> begin<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.000> charge<00:02:33.510> up<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
enough you'll begin to charge up and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.410 
enough you'll begin to charge up and
bring<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.440> missile<00:02:34.830> launcher<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.250> life<00:02:35.460> now

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
bring the missile launcher to life now

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.300 
bring the missile launcher to life now
teamwork<00:02:36.840> again<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.260> crucial<00:02:37.710> because<00:02:37.860> if<00:02:38.160> you

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
teamwork again is crucial because if you

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.560 
teamwork again is crucial because if you
lose<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.700> faction<00:02:39.120> leader<00:02:39.330> in<00:02:39.420> that

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
lose the faction leader in that

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.630 
lose the faction leader in that
perimeter<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:40.650> capture<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.070> flag<00:02:41.160> at

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
perimeter like capture the flag at

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.340 
perimeter like capture the flag at
respawns<00:02:42.150> back<00:02:42.450> at<00:02:42.600> base<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:43.020> got<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.170> go

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
respawns back at base and you got to go

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.140 
respawns back at base and you got to go
back<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.560> get<00:02:43.770> them<00:02:43.860> again<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.850> if<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.030> can

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
back and get them again so if you can

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.580 
back and get them again so if you can
get<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.270> buddy<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.570> post<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:46.020> on<00:02:46.200> top<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.530> a

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
get a buddy to post up on top of a

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.280 
get a buddy to post up on top of a
skyscraper<00:02:46.710> with<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> sniper<00:02:47.670> rifle<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:49.140> it's

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
skyscraper with a sniper rifle and it's

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.140 
skyscraper with a sniper rifle and it's
really<00:02:49.350> effective<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.130> bringing<00:02:50.490> taking<00:02:51.030> down

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
really effective to bringing taking down

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.210 
really effective to bringing taking down
the<00:02:51.300> enemies<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:52.380> can<00:02:52.530> also<00:02:52.680> send<00:02:53.100> in

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
the enemies you can also send in

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.710 
the enemies you can also send in
vehicles<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.820> are<00:02:53.850> really<00:02:54.180> really<00:02:54.360> strong

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
vehicles that are really really strong

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.330 
vehicles that are really really strong
like<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:54.990> motorcycles<00:02:55.710> that<00:02:55.800> have<00:02:55.950> flaming

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
like the motorcycles that have flaming

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.760 
like the motorcycles that have flaming
chainsaws<00:02:56.880> they<00:02:57.570> can<00:02:57.720> take<00:02:57.870> out<00:02:58.080> bad<00:02:58.290> guys<00:02:58.530> in

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
chainsaws they can take out bad guys in

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.890 
chainsaws they can take out bad guys in
two<00:02:58.890> or<00:02:59.010> three<00:02:59.070> hits<00:02:59.460> so<00:03:00.300> in<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.510> case<00:03:00.690> we've

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
two or three hits so in this case we've

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.270 
two or three hits so in this case we've
charged<00:03:01.260> up<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.500> missile<00:03:01.770> launcher<00:03:02.070> because

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
charged up the missile launcher because

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.650 
charged up the missile launcher because
we've<00:03:02.400> kept<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.730> guy<00:03:02.850> we've<00:03:03.180> kept<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.450> leader

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
we've kept the guy we've kept the leader

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.960 
we've kept the guy we've kept the leader
in<00:03:03.810> there<00:03:03.930> long<00:03:04.140> enough<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.860> now<00:03:05.520> all<00:03:05.730> that's

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
in there long enough and now all that's

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.970 
in there long enough and now all that's
left<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.300> do<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.510> basically<00:03:06.840> sacrifice<00:03:07.740> the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
left to do is basically sacrifice the

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.890 
left to do is basically sacrifice the
leader<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.550> missile<00:03:08.850> launcher<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.420> you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
leader to the missile launcher and you

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.240 
leader to the missile launcher and you
will<00:03:10.020> earn<00:03:10.200> your<00:03:10.380> fashion<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.920> missile

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
will earn your fashion the missile

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.350 
will earn your fashion the missile
launch<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:12.180> here<00:03:12.360> he<00:03:12.420> goes<00:03:12.890> now<00:03:13.890> he's<00:03:14.130> in<00:03:14.400> and

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360
