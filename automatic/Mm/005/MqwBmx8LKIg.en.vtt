can make any quantity a lot as long as
you<00:01:55.079> cover<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.530> blade<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.310> let's<00:01:56.520> lock<00:01:56.759> out<00:01:56.969> it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
you cover the blade so let's lock out it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.730 
you cover the blade so let's lock out it
into<00:01:57.270> place<00:01:57.649> make<00:01:58.649> sure<00:02:00.350> make<00:02:01.350> sure<00:02:01.409> that's

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
into place make sure make sure that's

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.080 
into place make sure make sure that's
locked<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.189> place<00:02:02.430> otherwise<00:02:02.790> you'll

right no and what I'm gonna do I'm gonna

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.860 
right no and what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
start<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.280> on<00:02:10.459> a<00:02:10.520> slow<00:02:10.610> speed<00:02:11.150> for<00:02:11.480> you

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
start it on a slow speed for you

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.930 
start it on a slow speed for you
one<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.709> slowest<00:02:13.190> blenders<00:02:13.520> in<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.730> world

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
one of the slowest blenders in the world

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.520 
one of the slowest blenders in the world
on<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.270> slow<00:02:14.510> speed<00:02:14.840> look<00:02:15.230> at<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.380> rate

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
on that slow speed look at the rate

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.660 
on that slow speed look at the rate
striking<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.040> food<00:02:16.220> down

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
striking the food down

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.220 
striking the food down
yeah<00:02:16.790> it's<00:02:16.970> designed<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.420> suck<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.930> all<00:02:18.050> down

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
yeah it's designed to suck it all down

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.440 
yeah it's designed to suck it all down
it's<00:02:18.739> not<00:02:18.920> gonna<00:02:19.040> make<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.280> smooth<00:02:19.640> juice<00:02:19.940> so

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
it's not gonna make a smooth juice so

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.760 
it's not gonna make a smooth juice so
this<00:02:20.600> is<00:02:20.750> where<00:02:20.900> we<00:02:21.020> use<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.319> like<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> food

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
this is where we use it like a food

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.520 
this is where we use it like a food
processor<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.610> make<00:02:23.300> salsa<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.200> can<00:02:24.230> make

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
pesto up on this speed under the higher

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.260 
pesto up on this speed under the higher
speeds<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:28.010> can<00:02:28.190> make<00:02:28.340> baby<00:02:28.640> foods<00:02:29.030> and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
speeds I can make baby foods and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.830 
speeds I can make baby foods and
curettes

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
curettes

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.180 
curettes
I'm<00:02:29.900> gonna<00:02:30.050> show<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> bit<00:02:30.709> later<00:02:30.920> just

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
I'm gonna show you that a bit later just

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.430 
I'm gonna show you that a bit later just
to<00:02:31.700> demonstrate<00:02:31.970> beats<00:02:32.660> doesn't<00:02:33.110> have<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.319> on

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
to demonstrate beats doesn't have it on

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.470 
to demonstrate beats doesn't have it on
it's<00:02:33.620> got<00:02:33.709> 11<00:02:34.040> speeds<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:34.880> first<00:02:35.330> one

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
it's got 11 speeds so that first one

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.850 
it's got 11 speeds so that first one
that<00:02:35.600> pulsing<00:02:36.050> one-issue<00:02:36.350> said<00:02:36.590> could<00:02:36.739> make

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
that pulsing one-issue said could make

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.190 
that pulsing one-issue said could make
coleslaw<00:02:37.130> yeah<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.180> was<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.360> first<00:02:38.390> base<00:02:38.930> so

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
coleslaw yeah that was the first base so

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.690 
coleslaw yeah that was the first base so
low<00:02:39.410> speed<00:02:39.800> that<00:02:39.950> as<00:02:40.069> you<00:02:40.160> said<00:02:40.340> can<00:02:40.430> make<00:02:40.580> the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
low speed that as you said can make the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.300 
low speed that as you said can make the
salsa<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.510> is<00:02:41.600> just<00:02:41.750> got<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.680> lumps<00:02:43.220> of

onion yeah yeah next week for baby food

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.100 
onion yeah yeah next week for baby food
let<00:02:47.239> me<00:02:47.300> just<00:02:47.450> keep<00:02:47.540> going<00:02:47.810> up<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:47.959> scale

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
let me just keep going up the scale

yeah good shape absolutely the big
chunks<00:03:08.330> of<00:03:08.390> ice<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:08.600> there<00:03:08.900> as<00:03:09.019> well<00:03:09.170> not<00:03:09.500> a

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
chunks of ice in there as well not a

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.500 
chunks of ice in there as well not a
problem<00:03:09.620> for<00:03:09.980> vitamin<00:03:10.489> now<00:03:10.640> does<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.239> the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
problem for vitamin now does that the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.420 
problem for vitamin now does that the
the<00:03:11.810> grinder<00:03:12.200> come<00:03:12.350> with<00:03:12.500> as<00:03:12.680> pile<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:13.010> do<00:03:13.160> does

it comes with it and as long as you're
lives<00:03:15.049> in<00:03:15.170> place<00:03:15.410> you're<00:03:15.709> never<00:03:15.829> gonna<00:03:16.040> hit

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
lives in place you're never gonna hit

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.800 
lives in place you're never gonna hit
the<00:03:16.340> blood<00:03:16.549> I'm<00:03:17.120> gonna<00:03:17.269> get<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.510> up<00:03:17.600> on<00:03:17.750> the

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
the blood I'm gonna get it up on the

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.780 
the blood I'm gonna get it up on the
high<00:03:17.989> speed<00:03:18.049> I'm<00:03:18.860> gonna<00:03:19.040> let<00:03:19.220> this<00:03:19.340> run<00:03:19.579> for

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
high speed I'm gonna let this run for

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.509 
high speed I'm gonna let this run for
about<00:03:19.910> one<00:03:20.420> minute<00:03:20.930> that's<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.620> yeah<00:03:22.010> all

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
about one minute that's it yeah all

00:03:22.519 --> 00:04:33.809 
about one minute that's it yeah all
right

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.010 

my<00:04:34.819> blender<00:04:35.150> that<00:04:35.270> full<00:04:35.449> of<00:04:35.569> juice<00:04:35.720> I'd<00:04:35.870> have

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
my blender that full of juice I'd have

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.170 
my blender that full of juice I'd have
to<00:04:36.110> make<00:04:36.289> three<00:04:36.620> different<00:04:36.650> batches<00:04:37.190> yeah<00:04:37.879> I

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
to make three different batches yeah I

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.270 
to make three different batches yeah I
made<00:04:38.599> I<00:04:38.810> made<00:04:38.840> two<00:04:39.259> liters<00:04:39.500> of<00:04:39.530> juice<00:04:39.830> two

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
made I made two liters of juice two

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.430 
made I made two liters of juice two
litres<00:04:40.669> of<00:04:40.699> juice<00:04:41.000> yeah<00:04:41.300> so<00:04:41.780> it's<00:04:42.110> a<00:04:42.199> lot

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
litres of juice yeah so it's a lot
