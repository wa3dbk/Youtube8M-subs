00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
only one way to do it right and once the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.520 
only one way to do it right and once the

rider finds out what that technology is

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.010 
rider finds out what that technology is
what<00:01:29.920> that<00:01:30.100> exact<00:01:30.520> technical<00:01:31.240> point<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.630> and

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
what that exact technical point is and

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.960 
what that exact technical point is and
they<00:01:32.320> can<00:01:32.560> fold<00:01:32.860> it<00:01:33.009> into<00:01:33.190> their<00:01:33.430> own<00:01:33.520> writing

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
they can fold it into their own writing

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.280 
they can fold it into their own writing
then<00:01:34.210> you<00:01:34.479> know<00:01:34.600> they'll<00:01:34.750> look<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.140> way<00:01:35.259> they

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
then you know they'll look the way they

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.070 
then you know they'll look the way they
look<00:01:35.650> but<00:01:36.430> that's<00:01:36.759> that's<00:01:37.420> getting<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.930> thing

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
look but that's that's getting the thing

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.960 
look but that's that's getting the thing
under<00:01:38.170> control<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:41.170> it<00:01:41.350> perfect<00:01:41.820> within<00:01:42.820> one

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
under control is it perfect within one

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.660 
under control is it perfect within one
mile<00:01:43.149> now<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:44.830> need<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.040> get<00:01:45.190> more<00:01:45.280> work<00:01:45.490> on

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:53.130 

oh<00:02:09.629> yeah<00:02:10.619> I'm<00:02:10.829> going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.039> agree<00:02:11.249> with<00:02:11.489> that

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.230 

I<00:02:54.750> wasn't<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:56.260> was<00:02:56.730> well<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.880> was<00:02:57.940> funny

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
I wasn't it was well it was funny

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.230 
I wasn't it was well it was funny
actually<00:02:58.420> could<00:02:58.750> slow<00:02:58.930> at<00:02:59.140> first<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.650> thought

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
actually could slow at first I thought

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.110 
actually could slow at first I thought
this<00:03:01.240> is<00:03:01.300> quite<00:03:01.569> straightforward<00:03:01.840> this<00:03:02.350> and

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
this is quite straightforward this and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.580 
this is quite straightforward this and
manage<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.360> go<00:03:04.450> around<00:03:04.630> in<00:03:04.840> fourth<00:03:05.050> gear<00:03:05.260> no

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
manage to go around in fourth gear no

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.949 
manage to go around in fourth gear no
problem<00:03:06.180> without<00:03:07.180> touching<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.600> brakes<00:03:07.810> that

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
problem without touching the brakes that

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.500 
problem without touching the brakes that
was<00:03:08.170> fine<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:09.100> then<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.790> more<00:03:09.970> confident<00:03:10.390> i

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
was fine and then the more confident i

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.330 
was fine and then the more confident i
got<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.900> faster<00:03:11.320> god<00:03:11.530> then<00:03:11.740> my<00:03:11.890> problem

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
got the faster god then my problem

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.490 
got the faster god then my problem
started<00:03:12.790> because<00:03:13.000> i<00:03:13.030> was<00:03:13.180> going<00:03:13.510> fasted<00:03:14.110> round

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
started because i was going fasted round

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.290 
started because i was going fasted round
corners<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.370> felt<00:03:15.580> come<00:03:15.760> full<00:03:15.970> with<00:03:16.150> that

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
corners that I felt come full with that

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.080 
corners that I felt come full with that
suddenly<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:16.900> was<00:03:16.990> like<00:03:17.250> go<00:03:18.250> too<00:03:18.490> fast<00:03:18.730> nails

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
suddenly I was like go too fast nails

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.540 
suddenly I was like go too fast nails
into<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.930> sharper<00:03:20.380> corners<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:21.040> found<00:03:21.340> myself

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
into the sharper corners I found myself

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.059 
into the sharper corners I found myself
either<00:03:22.260> touching<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.350> brake<00:03:23.560> which<00:03:23.770> I<00:03:23.890> wasn't

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
either touching the brake which I wasn't

either touching the brake which I wasn't

throttle<00:03:30.910> which<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:31.360> exactly<00:03:31.690> what<00:03:32.230> I'm<00:03:32.320> being

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
throttle which is exactly what I'm being

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.830 
throttle which is exactly what I'm being
taught<00:03:32.800> not<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:34.239> then<00:03:34.480> running

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
taught not to do and and then running

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.400 
taught not to do and and then running
wide<00:03:35.110> on<00:03:35.320> my<00:03:35.440> life<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:36.489> I<00:03:36.790> think<00:03:37.450> at<00:03:37.840> less<00:03:38.110> speed

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
wide on my life so I think at less speed

wide on my life so I think at less speed
going<00:03:38.830> into<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.160> tactical<00:03:39.610> once<00:03:39.760> is

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
going into the tactical once is

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.979 
going into the tactical once is
something<00:03:40.209> I've<00:03:40.269> got<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.450> try<00:03:40.600> and<00:03:40.840> true<00:03:41.800> and

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
something I've got to try and true and

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.830 
something I've got to try and true and
