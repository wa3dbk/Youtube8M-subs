let this marinate for a couple hours you
know<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.150> figured<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.869> best<00:01:43.049> way<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.290> do<00:01:43.470> this

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
know I I figured the best way to do this

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.940 
know I I figured the best way to do this
is<00:01:43.829> start<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> before<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.869> cook<00:01:46.619> your<00:01:46.770> meal

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
is start it before you cook your meal

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.249 
is start it before you cook your meal
mm-hmm<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.149> once<00:01:48.509> everyone's<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.200> know

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
mm-hmm so then once everyone's you know

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.740 
mm-hmm so then once everyone's you know
digesting<00:01:49.979> their<00:01:50.130> dinner<00:01:50.430> throw<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.450> desert

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
on right absolutely so I have these
