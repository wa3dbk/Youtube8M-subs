 but only sometimes to celebrate the day there is a special occasion 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.090
 gives 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.099
 But I can do it the same way 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.470
 a ball only on special occasions not even the bonus when to 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.230
 Example or to celebrate the day when I just do not particularly the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.360

 There is always reason to drink beer so that can not easily escape 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.610
 my life in the consumer society we are she sees Voss on a treadmill 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.960
 This is driven by the perpetual motion and this need way and away 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.980
 Satisfaction and disappointment the special occasions are 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.090
 Lubricate this machine and substitute for a blessing and a goal without it 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.910

 that the likes of Pothier persuaded 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.629
 But now you forget everything you need to know about hotplates 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.169
 believe it and put it on one hand without reservations it may be 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.409

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.860
 Check seals now compare to the one with the jump out of the window now theirs 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.019
 Place eleven bitter it is it goes wash against Hitler's orient 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.059
 I mean good Hitler comparisons against Hitler as a rhetorical device 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:16.269
 are the jewels of the culture of dispute 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.760
 the greatest possible escalation makes things clearer around the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.590
 ubiquitous ethical and ideological gray gray at all 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.859

 I want to tell you something that's all nonsense 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.740
 different 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.690
 the thing with football was watching all nonsense nobody likes to come 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.259
 Soccer 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.659
 an interesting theory by a few hundred million counterexamples 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.309
 However, I know this good flap replacement part she the ornamentation I very quickly 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.309
 the theory of the completeness of a dentition 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.510
 Rui Miguel 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.040
 Nobody likes to buy football, why should anyone shut up? 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.290
 just a few hundred million people who believe that they like 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.360
 Watching football 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.069
 the belief in the pleasures of football, however, it is for their own 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.080
 Existence just as unprovable even in this one out of the belief 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.650
 several hundred million people shoot at a god for its existence 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.669
 I suppose that from this context I also say football 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:40.439
 is God 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:44.789
 he directs everything himself to Vista and mass hysteria and a person 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:49.759
 what gigantic extent that is nonsense I say but what you there 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:54.059
 say and have fun watching football, there is no question of faith 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:58.020
 you do not need a believer to feel God's love for you 

00:05:58.019 --> 00:05:59.669
 he chose 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.000
 Fun at football watching such a nonsense what should be fun 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.520
 Euro look at the introduction of the line against a soon rehearsed 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.210

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.659
 now he got stuck in a net because I'll put my arms in 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.639
 shouting the air roar a bit around and with the drunk added more to him 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.939
 We often hug everything ourselves to steal mass hysteria 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:29.300
 Brainwashing gigantic extent then particularly easy to believe that 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.300
