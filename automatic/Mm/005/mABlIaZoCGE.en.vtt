 What would you do when you want to get food but you get up late 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.860
 and you discover that your mitú assistants know how to cook well I know where

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.219
 there will be such that a moment will not be there for me, since it is 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.440
 so bad that attacks the certainties that brazil grows the hugs deserve evil is 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.289

 tweezers to be able to get victims to suck their blood but that 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.400
 lose if you do not mind copper in a dramatic way screaming like antoñete 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.330
 for my life when Oscar is taking too long I think that for anyone if it is 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.440
 possible already I was surprised that he is offering to do something lower that 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.469
 It was my picture of when I went sightseeing in San Andreas 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:24.130

 aa the one who does not support it, you're really good at talking to your hair 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.090
 It's the only thing that does not hurt and this one has it on the door 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.490
 because it acts as you did to discover its practical point of view 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.100
 Well I did not think I only had to profit 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.350
 I better tell all your assholes friends why I'm here good 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.650
 but before these with Paraguayan arturo the asshole of anderson thinks 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.370
 I did not notice you until I saw it myself if I knew that 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.180
 I would win 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.420
 to lucas like the pearl 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.469

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.469

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.639

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.210
 an asshole like you could not win anything carper and jungles 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.580
 and what is he doing wrong and for bad shit 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.299
 If that is true then I could not beat it 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.769
 I better go 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.759
 but I do not believe that he killed him for sure he's lost somewhere 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.559
 and that's what happened the most moving story and make believe in kindness 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:05.159
 human you speak seriously through this social network grows in quantity with which 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.109
 is supposed to be this company before the camera nothing apparently would have to 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.909
 he was general manager 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.530
 but whatever it is, I'll go see what happens then we'll go with you to help them 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:19.989
 I appreciate the help but I must go alone and that's because it's so that everything becomes 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.890
 most dramatic to take for the arctic sernam's ass and let's go once and for all 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.859
 we must already be close to the jesus employment corporation that I see 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.639
 someone who of not being looked after 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.639

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.120
 Lopez Arturo tells you that everything would get more dramatic 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.700

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.979
 finally I find you anderson and this time I will give you for ass until you get 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.510
 bastard but it will have to be for the next time I just saw the 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:57.150
 letters that he endowed of the lady intact and apart from that I thought 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.110
 find money or something worthwhile but there was nothing so I'm leaving 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.759
 future sports I have the feeling of having anticipated before but I do not know where 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:09.429
 well, that does not matter to me what I want is back it seems pokémon that is perfect 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:13.269
 study but I do not understand why he did not want to enter the 15 percent I want 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.169
 say that two things first you are very fag and second that no but it is a 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.039
 pokémon now well if you get angry and you'll see how you pass the 3 0 and also 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.669
 that's what all pokemones say as the last one that he just tried and now 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.990
 use and if you do not have any, then it fucks you that is the ugliest and fagiest thing 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.860
 that you're almost just having your first victim and now if you were 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.649
 percent you have to give it to the one who is going on here until you wake up that 

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:40.899
 pokémon but it's already late for both of us go share bands that superman were going to 

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:42.379
 assault peace be a little more 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.650
 moderator operates this expo-exhibition 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.129
 Santiago, Chile 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.999
 lusi not only killed the assholes but you did a favor to the 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.900
 humanity with the death of patricia monti I still could not solve all the 

00:04:55.899 --> 00:05:00.330
 problems but a large part at least many innocents died 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.849
 purpose I missed something 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.039
 pérez to the asshole with the fotia golazo to which embraces the two arms and the two 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:06.720
 legs 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.520
 what a good heart both of them have, that's why I like them 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.520
 well let's go home 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.180
 one day I feel better turning on the television to see that there is a queue at all 

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:21.900
 the viewers informed them that evidence has been found that big foot 

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:24.830
