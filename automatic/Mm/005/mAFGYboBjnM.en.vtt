00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.719 
the first way that you know that you're
on<00:02:00.709> a<00:02:00.740> serious<00:02:01.219> exercise<00:02:01.520> program<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:03.109> next<00:02:03.740> we

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
on a serious exercise program so next we

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.879 
on a serious exercise program so next we
want<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.060> make<00:02:05.209> sure<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:06.109> your<00:02:06.529> heart<00:02:06.770> rate

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:06.889 
want to make sure that your heart rate

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:09.910 
want to make sure that your heart rate
is<00:02:07.219> going<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.999> be<00:02:08.179> elevated<00:02:08.690> during<00:02:09.649> those

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
is going to be elevated during those

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.369 
is going to be elevated during those
workouts<00:02:10.490> so<00:02:11.209> if<00:02:11.420> you're<00:02:11.569> doing<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.959> workout

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
workouts so if you're doing a workout

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.280 
workouts so if you're doing a workout
and<00:02:12.879> you're<00:02:13.879> pausing<00:02:14.450> between<00:02:14.599> your<00:02:14.959> sets

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
and you're pausing between your sets

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.900 
and you're pausing between your sets
you're<00:02:15.950> taking

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
you're taking

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.580 
you're taking
you<00:02:16.940> know<00:02:17.060> three<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.870> five<00:02:17.900> minute<00:02:18.470> rest

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
you know three to five minute rest

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.710 
you know three to five minute rest
periods<00:02:19.040> instead<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.520> one<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.910> three<00:02:19.940> minute

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
periods instead of one to three minute

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.780 
periods instead of one to three minute
rest<00:02:20.960> periods<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.830> may<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:22.160> sound<00:02:22.400> like<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.670> big

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
rest periods it may not sound like a big

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.390 
rest periods it may not sound like a big
difference<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:24.020> during<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.860> course<00:02:25.070> of<00:02:25.280> the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
difference but during the course of the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.940 
difference but during the course of the
week<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:26.540> makes<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.960> huge<00:02:27.350> difference<00:02:27.680> in

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
week that makes a huge difference in

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.950 
week that makes a huge difference in
terms<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.490> how<00:02:29.030> many<00:02:29.240> calories<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.840> can

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
terms of how many calories you can

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.010 
terms of how many calories you can
actually<00:02:30.290> burn<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.490> what<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.570> want<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.840> start

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
actually burn so what you want to start

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.840 
actually burn so what you want to start
thinking<00:02:33.290> about<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.860> okay<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.670> first

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
thinking about is okay so the first

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.750 
thinking about is okay so the first
point<00:02:35.000> was<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.510> got<00:02:35.660> to<00:02:35.780> use<00:02:35.870> total<00:02:36.230> body

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
point was I got to use total body

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.240 
point was I got to use total body
movements<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.960> exercises<00:02:38.960> second<00:02:39.830> point<00:02:39.980> I

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
movements and exercises second point I

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.060 
movements and exercises second point I
gotta<00:02:40.820> elevate<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.420> heart<00:02:41.600> rate<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.170> start

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
gotta elevate the heart rate so start

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.240 
gotta elevate the heart rate so start
thinking<00:02:43.130> about<00:02:43.610> some<00:02:44.030> exercises<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:45.470> cause

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
thinking about some exercises that cause

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.740 
thinking about some exercises that cause
you<00:02:46.460> to<00:02:46.550> elevate<00:02:46.850> your<00:02:47.180> heart<00:02:47.240> rate<00:02:47.480> what

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
this way each and every day of that

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.630 
this way each and every day of that
seven-day<00:03:00.320> period<00:03:00.410> you're<00:03:01.160> doing<00:03:01.430> something

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
seven-day period you're doing something

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.750

have the third thing and that is that

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.790 
have the third thing and that is that
the<00:03:08.690> exercises<00:03:09.320> have<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.530> be<00:03:09.620> used

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
the exercises have to be used

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.640 
the exercises have to be used
consistently<00:03:10.130> so<00:03:11.060> if<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.900> think<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.380> you

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
consistently so if you think that you

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.740 
consistently so if you think that you
can<00:03:12.770> see<00:03:13.070> visual<00:03:13.760> results<00:03:14.150> in<00:03:14.240> a<00:03:14.330> week<00:03:14.360> and

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
can see visual results in a week and

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.840 
can see visual results in a week and
actually<00:03:15.140> like<00:03:15.560> take<00:03:15.980> one<00:03:16.190> or<00:03:16.310> two<00:03:16.340> days<00:03:16.580> off

every single day now you may not be

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.210 
every single day now you may not be
doing<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.540> same<00:03:29.620> exercises<00:03:30.620> every<00:03:30.950> single

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
doing the same exercises every single

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.460 
doing the same exercises every single
day<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:31.850> may<00:03:31.970> not<00:03:32.030> be<00:03:32.450> doing<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.930> same<00:03:32.959> length

day you may not be doing the same length

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.590 
day you may not be doing the same length
of<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.709> workout<00:03:34.160> you<00:03:34.760> know<00:03:34.880> maybe<00:03:35.060> one<00:03:35.360> day<00:03:35.540> you

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
of a workout you know maybe one day you

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.300 
of a workout you know maybe one day you
do<00:03:35.780> an<00:03:35.900> hour<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.530> next<00:03:36.650> day<00:03:36.830> you<00:03:36.860> do<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.070> half

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
do an hour the next day you do a half

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.730 
do an hour the next day you do a half
hour<00:03:37.490> but<00:03:38.240> you've<00:03:38.660> got<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:38.990> do<00:03:39.170> something<00:03:39.590> to

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
hour but you've got to do something to

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.100 
hour but you've got to do something to
spike<00:03:40.100> that<00:03:40.580> metabolism<00:03:41.120> every<00:03:41.690> single<00:03:41.990> day

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
spike that metabolism every single day

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.070 
spike that metabolism every single day
each<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.830> every<00:03:42.950> one<00:03:43.070> of<00:03:43.130> those<00:03:43.250> seven<00:03:43.490> days

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
each and every one of those seven days

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.440 
each and every one of those seven days
so<00:03:45.080> those<00:03:45.709> are<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:45.980> three<00:03:46.100> tips<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:47.239> you<00:03:47.420> can

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
so those are the three tips that you can

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.860 
so those are the three tips that you can
use<00:03:47.660> are<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:49.130> three<00:03:49.670> telltale<00:03:50.150> signs<00:03:50.510> i<00:03:50.720> like

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
use are the three telltale signs i like

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.960 
use are the three telltale signs i like
to<00:03:50.989> say<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.800> will<00:03:52.070> let<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.340> know<00:03:52.580> that

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
to say that will let you know that
