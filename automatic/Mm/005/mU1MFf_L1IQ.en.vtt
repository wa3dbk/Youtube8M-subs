you love so much this one here is one of
the<00:03:14.170> few<00:03:14.349> times<00:03:14.530> were<00:03:14.769> actually<00:03:15.160> got<00:03:15.340> loose

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
the few times were actually got loose

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.160 
the few times were actually got loose
for<00:03:15.819> the<00:03:15.849> most<00:03:16.060> part<00:03:16.209> we've<00:03:16.660> been<00:03:16.780> able<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.019> do

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
for the most part we've been able to do

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.780 
for the most part we've been able to do
a<00:03:17.200> good<00:03:17.380> job<00:03:17.440> containing<00:03:17.859> it<00:03:18.100> hits<00:03:18.579> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
a good job containing it hits the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.039 
a good job containing it hits the
outside<00:03:18.819> right<00:03:19.359> there<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.600> see<00:03:19.810> me<00:03:19.930> again

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
outside right there you see me again

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.270 
outside right there you see me again
trying<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.590> go<00:03:20.680> but<00:03:20.859> that<00:03:20.950> strip<00:03:21.190> the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
trying to go but that strip the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.099 
trying to go but that strip the
intermission<00:03:21.780> unfortunately<00:03:22.780> we<00:03:22.870> don't<00:03:22.959> get

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
intermission unfortunately we don't get

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.660 
intermission unfortunately we don't get
anything<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:23.739> he<00:03:23.950> chewed<00:03:24.160> up<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.370> entire

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
anything so he chewed up the entire

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.910 
anything so he chewed up the entire
third<00:03:25.060> quarter<00:03:25.450> which<00:03:25.900> I<00:03:26.049> guess<00:03:26.440> can't<00:03:26.769> be

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
third quarter which I guess can't be

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.039 
third quarter which I guess can't be
good<00:03:27.130> because<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.400> leaves<00:03:27.760> me<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.120> know<00:03:28.329> that

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
good because that leaves me to know that

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.530 
good because that leaves me to know that
I<00:03:29.709> could<00:03:30.100> potentially<00:03:30.639> have<00:03:30.790> last<00:03:31.030> possession

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
I could potentially have last possession

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.660 
I could potentially have last possession
of<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:32.230> fourth<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:32.829> all<00:03:32.980> i<00:03:33.010> would<00:03:33.160> need<00:03:33.310> is<00:03:33.639> a

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
of the fourth so all i would need is a

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.460 
of the fourth so all i would need is a
fill<00:03:33.970> go<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:34.569> right<00:03:34.690> here<00:03:34.720> he<00:03:34.930> runs<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.319> ball

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
fill go so right here he runs the ball

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.140 
fill go so right here he runs the ball
up<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.769> middle<00:03:35.799> we<00:03:36.130> stop<00:03:36.400> them<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:36.819> again

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
up the middle we stop them and again

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.670 
up the middle we stop them and again
more<00:03:37.359> time<00:03:37.600> as<00:03:37.750> being<00:03:37.870> chewed<00:03:38.079> over<00:03:38.170> Clark<00:03:38.530> I'm
