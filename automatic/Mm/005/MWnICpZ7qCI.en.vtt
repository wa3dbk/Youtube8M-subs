00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.080
 we will replace well what I think with 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.570
 we have no problems with our head 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.050

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.719

 the weapon opens it to the page with 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.300
 all while we are a weapon that is us one 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.280
 jump is poor having only one tank 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.109

 open and you will see three files and one 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.799
 folder here these three files can in principle 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.600
 do not open, we do not come in handy 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.460
 we will work with the main one 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.729
 main file 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.490

 we have this dialog box 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:06.490
 where we select our file the question is three 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:10.680

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:38.180
 do close the program open 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:41.769
 client go to any server 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.959
 in this case, I go to them server 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.920
 little popular which will go now 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.920
 standard registration scheme 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.080
 i.e. own loading 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.110
 so here we dive quietly 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.150
 Now 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.080
 against standard filtering process 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.080
