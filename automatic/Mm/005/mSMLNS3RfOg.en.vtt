overdrive<00:00:19.619> issue<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.250> took<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> car<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> Dodge

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
overdrive issue I took the car the Dodge

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.960 
overdrive issue I took the car the Dodge
dealer<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.640> call<00:00:23.850> an

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
dealer and this is what you call an

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.660 
dealer and this is what you call an
unclutch<00:00:24.920> apparently<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> very<00:00:26.070> common

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
unclutch apparently it's a very common

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.339 
unclutch apparently it's a very common
issue<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:28.680> summits<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.260> a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
issue with the summits and it's just a

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.690 
issue with the summits and it's just a
series<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.769> gears<00:00:37.070> bends<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.190> clutches

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
series of gears bends and clutches

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.080 
series of gears bends and clutches
written<00:00:39.210> plates<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.320> piston<00:00:41.090> all

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
written plates and a piston all

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.470 
written plates and a piston all
hydraulically<00:00:42.930> driven<00:00:44.390> apparently<00:00:45.390> these

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
hydraulically driven apparently these

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.139 
hydraulically driven apparently these
wear<00:00:45.750> out<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.379> well<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> seals<00:00:47.149> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
wear out and as well as the seals and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.139 
wear out and as well as the seals and
that<00:00:48.180> causes<00:00:48.840> overdrive<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.710> engage<00:00:50.149> so

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that causes overdrive not to engage so

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.880 
that causes overdrive not to engage so
apparently<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.719> change<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.860> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
apparently if I change this which is a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.290 
apparently if I change this which is a
hundred<00:00:53.100> dollar<00:00:53.340> kit<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:55.190> rebuild<00:00:56.300> hold

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
hundred dollar kit so I can rebuild hold

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.110 
hundred dollar kit so I can rebuild hold
on<00:00:57.480> one<00:00:57.629> second<00:00:59.480> rebuild<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.660> piece<00:01:00.960> here

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
on one second rebuild this piece here

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.189 
on one second rebuild this piece here
then<00:01:03.120> I'll<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.359> overdrive<00:01:03.809> again<00:01:04.080> this

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
then I'll have overdrive again this

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.340 
then I'll have overdrive again this
isn't<00:01:04.409> actually<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.070> overdrive<00:01:06.080> piece<00:01:07.080> or

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
isn't actually the overdrive piece or

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.530 
isn't actually the overdrive piece or
the<00:01:07.890> end<00:01:08.130> clutch<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.640> what's<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.180> name<00:01:09.360> is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the end clutch is what's the name is

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.649 
the end clutch is what's the name is
called<00:01:10.760> that<00:01:11.760> one's<00:01:11.909> actually<00:01:12.180> for<00:01:12.299> my<00:01:12.390> parts

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
called that one's actually for my parts

called that one's actually for my parts
car<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.909> I'm<00:01:14.909> gonna<00:01:15.090> move<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.390> thing<00:01:15.450> out<00:01:15.720> of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
car so I'm gonna move this thing out of

that<00:01:24.299> with<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> Mitsubishi<00:01:25.470> engines<00:01:26.299> this<00:01:27.299> is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
that with the Mitsubishi engines this is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.800 
that with the Mitsubishi engines this is
not<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.900> bad<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> dual<00:01:28.500> overhead<00:01:28.680> cam<00:01:29.810> Talon

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
not so bad as a dual overhead cam Talon

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.840 
not so bad as a dual overhead cam Talon
motors<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.560> my<00:01:31.710> other<00:01:31.890> Talon<00:01:32.280> video<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.579> have

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
motors like my other Talon video I have

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.399 
motors like my other Talon video I have
posted<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.689> my<00:01:33.810> channel<00:01:34.520> so<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:36.450> gonna<00:01:36.659> gear

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
posted on my channel so I'm gonna gear

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:46.370 
posted on my channel so I'm gonna gear
up<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.710> go<00:01:37.890> outside

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.330 

hopefully<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.530> car<00:01:47.800> will<00:01:47.920> be<00:01:47.950> sold<00:01:48.010> today

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
hopefully this car will be sold today

$2,700

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.040 
$2,700
that'd<00:01:52.510> be<00:01:52.540> nice<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.960> have<00:01:53.050> in<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.260> pocket

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
that'd be nice to have in the pocket

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.730 
that'd be nice to have in the pocket
this<00:01:56.050> thing<00:01:56.320> still<00:01:56.590> running<00:01:56.740> strong<00:02:01.740> freaking

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
this thing still running strong freaking

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.650 
this thing still running strong freaking
windy<00:02:03.070> outside<00:02:03.220> so<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:03.940> probably<00:02:04.240> can't<00:02:04.510> hear

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
windy outside so you probably can't hear

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:24.060 
windy outside so you probably can't hear
yet<00:02:21.270> there's<00:02:22.270> sixty<00:02:22.600> nine<00:02:22.750> kilometers<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.830> six

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
yet there's sixty nine kilometers in six

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:32.750 
yet there's sixty nine kilometers in six
nine<00:02:24.220> thousand<00:02:27.959> oops

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.470 

so<00:02:33.760> let's<00:02:33.910> probably<00:02:34.239> sat<00:02:34.480> for<00:02:35.820> 18<00:02:36.820> 19<00:02:37.360> hours

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
so let's probably sat for 18 19 hours

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.979 
so let's probably sat for 18 19 hours
maybe<00:02:38.880> but<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.030> really<00:02:40.270> cold<00:02:40.480> for<00:02:40.660> some

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
maybe but it's really cold for some

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.960 
maybe but it's really cold for some
reason<00:02:41.320> even<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:42.070> longer<00:02:42.459> it<00:02:42.580> sits<00:02:42.790> the

reason even the longer it sits the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.080 
reason even the longer it sits the
easier<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.510> starts<00:02:43.900> for<00:02:44.080> some<00:02:44.260> reason<00:02:45.090> don't

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
easier it starts for some reason don't

00:02:46.090 --> 00:03:13.240 
easier it starts for some reason don't
ask<00:02:46.330> me<00:02:46.480> why<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.780> anyways<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.830> started
