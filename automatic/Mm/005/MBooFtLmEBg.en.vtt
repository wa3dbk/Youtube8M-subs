metric part

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.730 
metric part
we<00:00:45.150> want<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> start<00:00:45.630> by<00:00:45.840> creating<00:00:46.110> an<00:00:46.320> offset

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
we want to start by creating an offset

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.220 
we want to start by creating an offset
plane<00:00:47.060> the<00:00:48.060> reason<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.510> create<00:00:48.690> an<00:00:48.870> offset

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
plane the reason we create an offset

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.740 
plane the reason we create an offset
plane<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:50.220> a<00:00:50.550> sketch<00:00:50.970> picture<00:00:51.570> is

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
plane is because a sketch picture is

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.270 
plane is because a sketch picture is
going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.290> able<00:00:52.560> to<00:00:52.830> have<00:00:53.010> some

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
going to be able to have some

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.340 
going to be able to have some
transparency<00:00:53.880> to<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.630> can<00:00:54.750> see<00:00:55.050> through

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
transparency to it so we can see through

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.820 
transparency to it so we can see through
the<00:00:55.380> picture<00:00:55.880> but<00:00:56.880> our<00:00:57.210> parts<00:00:57.660> such<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:57.900> solid

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
the picture but our parts such as solid

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.160 
the picture but our parts such as solid
geometry<00:00:58.950> and<00:00:59.460> surface<00:00:59.880> geometry<00:01:00.150> are<00:01:00.720> going

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
geometry and surface geometry are going

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.049 
geometry and surface geometry are going
to<00:01:01.230> obscure<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> reference<00:01:02.370> image<00:01:02.670> unless

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
to obscure the reference image unless

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.510 
to obscure the reference image unless
they<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.420> some<00:01:03.630> transparency<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.440> well<00:01:04.650> so

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
they have some transparency as well so

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.280 
they have some transparency as well so
it's<00:01:05.670> always<00:01:05.940> important<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.810> place<00:01:07.020> your

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
it's always important to and place your

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.500 
it's always important to and place your
sketch<00:01:07.560> pictures<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.220> front<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> geometry

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
sketch pictures in front of the geometry

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.900 
sketch pictures in front of the geometry
you're<00:01:09.660> creating<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.250> our<00:01:11.340> case<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.729> want

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
you're creating so in our case we want

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.910 
you're creating so in our case we want
to<00:01:12.000> select<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.450> front<00:01:12.690> plane<00:01:12.930> select

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
to select the front plane select

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
to select the front plane select
reference<00:01:14.340> geometry<00:01:14.520> from<00:01:15.030> our<00:01:15.180> feature<00:01:15.360> tab

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
reference geometry from our feature tab

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.380 
reference geometry from our feature tab
and<00:01:15.990> create<00:01:16.500> an<00:01:16.590> offset<00:01:17.009> plane<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.180> case

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and create an offset plane in the case

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.999 
and create an offset plane in the case
of<00:01:18.420> our<00:01:18.630> steering<00:01:19.020> wheel<00:01:19.170> 100<00:01:19.680> millimeter

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
of our steering wheel 100 millimeter

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.190 
of our steering wheel 100 millimeter
offset<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.759> be<00:01:20.880> more<00:01:21.150> than<00:01:21.300> enough<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.930> clear

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
offset will be more than enough to clear

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.969 
offset will be more than enough to clear
our<00:01:22.440> part<00:01:22.910> another<00:01:23.910> thing<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.750> is

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
our part another thing I like to do is

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.010 
our part another thing I like to do is

we<00:01:48.240> added<00:01:48.420> sketch<00:01:48.870> picture<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.620> our<00:01:49.740> sketch

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
we added sketch picture to our sketch

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.399 
we added sketch picture to our sketch
tab<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:51.240> before<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.690> insert<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.110> sketch

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
tab but before we insert a sketch

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.590 
tab but before we insert a sketch
picture<00:01:52.830> I<00:01:53.040> want<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.549> add<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> circle<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
picture I want to add a circle to the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.469 
picture I want to add a circle to the
center<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.020> our<00:01:55.260> part<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.790> reason<00:01:57.120> i<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
center of our part the reason i like to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.390 
center of our part the reason i like to
do<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.200> kind<00:01:58.470> of<00:01:58.530> helps<00:01:58.770> me<00:01:58.950> scale

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
do this is this kind of helps me scale

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.670 
do this is this kind of helps me scale
my<00:01:59.760> sketch<00:02:00.060> picture<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.380> we're<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.590> to

my sketch picture so we're going to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.770 
my sketch picture so we're going to
insert<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> 60<00:02:02.549> millimeter<00:02:02.940> circle<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.570> the

sketch<00:02:05.880> picture<00:02:06.680> included<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> images

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
sketch picture included in the images

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.009 
sketch picture included in the images
with<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.610> video<00:02:08.910> series<00:02:09.239> was<00:02:09.600> an<00:02:09.780> image

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
with this video series was an image

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.440 
with this video series was an image
called<00:02:10.260> Enzo<00:02:10.739> steering<00:02:11.130> wheel<00:02:11.250> front<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:12.269> is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
called Enzo steering wheel front this is

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.820 
called Enzo steering wheel front this is
going<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.660> be<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> sketch<00:02:13.140> picture<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.709> we

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
going to be the sketch picture that we

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.180 
going to be the sketch picture that we
create<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:14.880> sketch<00:02:15.739> one<00:02:16.739> thing<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:17.010> want

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
create in this sketch one thing we want

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.670 
create in this sketch one thing we want
to<00:02:17.220> do<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.640> drag<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.630> image<00:02:18.989> as<00:02:19.170> close<00:02:19.440> as

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
to do is drag this image as close as

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.759 
to do is drag this image as close as
possible<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:20.280> centering<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.330> circle<00:02:21.780> you

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
possible to centering in that circle you

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.530 
possible to centering in that circle you
can<00:02:22.950> see<00:02:23.100> here<00:02:23.310> why<00:02:23.489> we<00:02:23.670> added<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.090> circle

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
can see here why we added that circle

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.750 
can see here why we added that circle
because<00:02:24.840> there's<00:02:25.080> no<00:02:25.290> geometry<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.459> snap<00:02:26.730> to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
because there's no geometry to snap to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.460 
because there's no geometry to snap to
the<00:02:27.030> origin<00:02:27.480> when<00:02:27.630> we<00:02:27.750> insert<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.260> sketch

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
the origin when we insert a sketch

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.130 
the origin when we insert a sketch
picture<00:02:29.060> 60<00:02:30.060> millimeters<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.600> skin<00:02:30.750> then<00:02:31.019> give

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
picture 60 millimeters of skin then give

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.140 
picture 60 millimeters of skin then give
us<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.350> good<00:02:31.530> scale<00:02:31.830> reference<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.519> allow<00:02:33.000> us

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
us a good scale reference and allow us

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.940 
us a good scale reference and allow us
to<00:02:33.299> create<00:02:33.450> geometry<00:02:33.840> that's<00:02:34.590> going<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:34.860> be

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
to create geometry that's going to be

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.590 
to create geometry that's going to be
accurate<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.610> size<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.239> steering

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
accurate to the size of the steering

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.780 
accurate to the size of the steering
wheel<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.709> last<00:02:37.980> thing<00:02:38.160> we<00:02:38.280> want<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.489> do<00:02:38.610> for

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
wheel the last thing we want to do for

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.970 
wheel the last thing we want to do for
the<00:02:38.850> sketch<00:02:39.150> picture<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.780> insert<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.680> full

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
the sketch picture is insert a full

the sketch picture is insert a full
image<00:02:41.220> transparency<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.350> typically<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:43.470> to

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
image transparency I typically like to

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.220 
image transparency I typically like to
use<00:02:43.950> fifty<00:02:44.340> percent<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:45.329> can<00:02:45.510> go<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:45.810> much<00:02:46.049> or

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
use fifty percent you can go as much or

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.960 
use fifty percent you can go as much or
as<00:02:46.260> little<00:02:46.350> as<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.739> want<00:02:46.860> but<00:02:47.400> keep<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:47.940> mind

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
as little as you want but keep in mind

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.180 
as little as you want but keep in mind
that<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.480> more<00:02:48.750> image<00:02:49.140> transparency<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.010> add

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that the more image transparency you add

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.949 
that the more image transparency you add
the<00:02:50.790> harder<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.209> going<00:02:51.329> to<00:02:51.420> be<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.750> see

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
the harder it's going to be to see

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.380 
the harder it's going to be to see
reference<00:02:52.440> details<00:02:52.890> that's<00:02:53.730> why<00:02:53.910> fifty

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
reference details that's why fifty

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.900 
reference details that's why fifty
percent<00:02:54.720> works<00:02:54.989> good<00:02:55.230> for<00:02:55.260> most<00:02:55.680> images

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
percent works good for most images

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.580 
percent works good for most images
now<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.570> that's<00:02:57.750> inserted<00:02:58.170> we're<00:02:58.410> going<00:02:58.530> to
