00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:39.420 
you can see why I wet hers down a little
ways<00:02:37.110> like<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.260> said<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.680> can<00:02:38.860> do<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.220> I'm

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
ways like I said you can do this I'm

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.670 
ways like I said you can do this I'm
doing<00:02:39.700> kind<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.150> tight<00:02:40.390> version<00:02:40.680> maybe

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
doing kind of the tight version maybe

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.260 
doing kind of the tight version maybe
it's<00:02:41.890> because<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.190> have<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.490> younger<00:02:42.820> kids<00:02:43.060> and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
it's because I have the younger kids and

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.270 
it's because I have the younger kids and
they<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:44.080> know<00:02:44.200> their<00:02:44.560> hair<00:02:44.740> tends<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.130> fall

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
they you know their hair tends to fall

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.210 
they you know their hair tends to fall
out<00:02:45.459> if<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.670> don't<00:02:46.050> but<00:02:47.050> you<00:02:47.560> can<00:02:47.739> also<00:02:47.920> do<00:02:48.190> a

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
out if I don't but you can also do a

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.949 
out if I don't but you can also do a
really<00:02:48.520> loose<00:02:48.730> version<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:49.510> too<00:02:49.810> if

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
really loose version of this too if

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.440 
really loose version of this too if
you're<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.110> little<00:02:50.350> older<00:02:50.709> or<00:02:51.310> an<00:02:51.400> adult<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.330> it

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
you're a little older or an adult and it

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.540 
you're a little older or an adult and it
would<00:02:52.570> look<00:02:52.720> really<00:02:52.900> fun<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.440> cubed<00:02:54.480> okay

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550

take<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.700> just<00:03:33.730> tug<00:03:34.209> on<00:03:34.450> those<00:03:35.819> like

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
take it and you just tug on those like

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.199 
take it and you just tug on those like
the<00:03:37.000> little<00:03:37.239> bumps<00:03:37.629> part<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.349> the<00:03:38.440> braid<00:03:39.209> all

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
the little bumps part of the braid all

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.080 
the little bumps part of the braid all
the<00:03:40.540> way<00:03:40.629> up<00:03:44.160> it's<00:03:45.160> kind<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.580> cheater<00:03:45.849> way<00:03:46.030> to

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
the way up it's kind of a cheater way to

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.210 
the way up it's kind of a cheater way to
make<00:03:46.300> it<00:03:46.450> look<00:03:46.599> looser<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:49.080> then<00:03:50.190> add<00:03:51.190> a

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
make it look looser and then add a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.190 
make it look looser and then add a
little<00:03:51.519> hairspray

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.970 

wherever<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.220> need<00:03:59.459> it<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:02.280> you're<00:04:02.610> done
