00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:15.330
 posco genetics and on it goes 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.640
 are still on the way to Stuttgart 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.680
 and as I said I took my time 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.910
 I'm here to be productive but for 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.070
 rauszushauen you videos 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.359
 and another topic that I have 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.580
 wrote down what many people wrote 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.039
 I'm interested in it recently 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.800
 have mentioned a video eat a lot 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.840
 eat that you have to train then very 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.920
 many wrote how to train 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.989
 how do you learn to eat a lot and me 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.460
 are always somewhere through 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.010
 Almost a bit ridiculous though 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.079
 Of course I understand somewhere but me 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.200
 think it's a pity because I'm so 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.329
 because you get the questions yes me me 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.730
 just do not do that tomorrow anymore 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.230
 That 's it, and then when I think that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.239
 people exactly the same attitude in the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.690
 Team means I just hope so 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.690
 no more 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.530
 I tried it, it does not work that way 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.520
 So that's my eye driving window 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.650
 many people a bit 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.070
 initiative really 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.960
 Gas really gives you something to eat 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.180
 that wants to go then but gas and 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.200
 so here's not the moral apostle 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.390
 play 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.860
 most people have the problem 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.660
 have now speak bit silly because 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.070
 I would like to say how 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.230
 I did that at the time and without it 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.790
 that I somehow did that to me 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.280
 rausgeholt but from the internet but 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.960
 simply as a logical consideration though 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.510
 At that time I started with 100 grams 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.800
 hard boobs in the morning 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.170
 and that was a real one at the beginning 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.270
 definitely fight so i have to start 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.510
 but can damn brisk with 100 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.430
 Fighting lean quark a banana das 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.080
 I always shot a mixa around 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.810
 her and the shit just down 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.260
 I was running it had back then 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.330
 have to 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.310
 copied by andreas freely so that andreas 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.210
 The breakfast we have already can be cheeky 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.310
 once made funny with caries 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.020
 I wonder what I did 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.420
 actually nothing else than me im 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.420
 made job I have from week to 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.850
 week the dose slightly increases exactly how 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.270
 I imported from week to week in the wall 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.239
 to press 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.300
 wanted to become stronger in the deadlift 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.370
 Logically, you always become problems 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.720
 have with the food if he tries 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.570
 more about it the team is on one 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.459
 change constant base and then too 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.800
 Eat every morning anyway is the people 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.110
 not used to being in the morning 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.380
 we have absolutely no hunger anyway 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.330
 and logically it's hard but that you 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.640
 want to achieve something that not everyone 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.000
 so it does not matter what everyone does 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.950
 makes you understand 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.590
 so who works so easy 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.110
 not even not even the alarm clock 15 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.580
 can set in the morning earlier morning 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.390
 to get a breakfast that 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.340
 to eat 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.220
 He is just in the wrong sport 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.820
 simply the latent meaning of this 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.370
 sport not realized in my and that 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.270
 is for you was found with 100 grams 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.720
 or if you have trouble something 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.690
 Jesus is currently doing it 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.130
 Example as I did then 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.350
 several little girls that means you go 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.820
 even six or seven meals 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.350
 that it is not because you benefit but 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.230
 because it is no different because he 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.540
 not yet trained since much to eat 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.840
 I patrick for example we have the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.060
 biggest swiss citizens eaten 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.850
 who half an hour or so I in 17 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.709
 minutes so we check that will me 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.150
 I have the opposite problem I 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.320
 do not have a problem too fast 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.170
 increase because I could do it all 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.140
 day is that I've got used to it so 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:47.480
 our customs are nonstop 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:49.820
 at the start you understand as I said when 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.739
 be your now called hard adversary 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.720
 I do not say that word about it 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.209
 like to hear that said that mine 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.920
 People who have not made it yet 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.489
 have to overcome because as I said 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.930
 it is logical is not pleasant yourself 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.070
 the tolerances all the time to propose 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.620
 but I can not tell me 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.900
 is comfortable is 150 cows on the bank 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.239
 to press for 34 epson anyway 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.819
 to create the event or or or 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.250
 trained thereupon stands here 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.100
 because I told her speak ever 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.440
 say I wanted to ski well 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.930
 storms the half of the bavarian morning 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.430
 to say that means if you really that 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.050
 not everyone wants to achieve that 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.520
 then you also have to do things 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.630
 everyone is ready for me as I said 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.050
 and belonged to just take with you 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.270
 eat a lot every day 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.259
 I have so many people coming 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.110
 months and always ask me 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.430
 the same fucking again and buy yourself 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.900
 in weight gainer and then come back 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.820
 because I still have increased because 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.889
 give them the first one a week 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.270
 have taken a week and then are 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.139
 Not taken another week 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.820
 because something was on the way as 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.860
 sorry i have three - am 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.090

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.180
 I would be theoretical tomorrow at noon 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.720
 equipped in the absolute second father 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.900
 is here 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.759
 i organize i watch that i do that 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.130
 what I want to achieve is that 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.620
 not just in this sport so it is in the 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.580
 all life so with everything you have to 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.030
 arrange you 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.909
 you have your goals to work towards running 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.330
 In the job so running in the business so and yes 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:26.990
 as I said tried with small quantities 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.240
 start dividing the meals to 567 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.919
 must be named and then you try 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.020
 the meals if that still is not 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.659
 enough that you have several meal nest 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.009
 the nama time tried gradually 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.979
 make it bigger that it goes here from 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.360
 100 flakes to 120 km / h 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.150
 Of course there are those too 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.830
 possibility to play with fruits 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.090
 a bit calorie dense products too 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.550
 Take a look at the video 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.190
 you're that off you as well as me 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.900
 Uploaded about 2 3 weeks ago 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.719
 I'll go over it again 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.520
 For whom does he make such a sense 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:00.590
 bit on calorie density products too 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.180
 you have to go with a banana 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.120
 a few calories more in it 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.350
 worst in the morning 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.700
 thought 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.280
 Peanut butter pure or a few almonds 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.140
 everything gives the possibility the types the 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.940
 tell me they can can not 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.580
 take those are just not willing 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.500
 to give everything with respect to 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.950
 Eating is just so easy 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.680
 fast 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:26.580
 i know i have customers who is one 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.890
 absolute connoisseur and he has increased 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.140
 At 400,000 calories then too 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.820
 once made him click so that I can 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.860
 Not to take is just a cheap 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.860
 sorry long as its not in 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.330
 have been a doctor and 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.430
 demonstrated thyroid hyperfunction 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.530
