00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.820
 Good guys, I'm going to shoot a match here. 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.889
 a sloop the car was that 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.800
 problem that the petrol pump does not 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.520
 held the pressure on the line 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.520
 Let's have a verified 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.650
 take a while to get 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.420
 we already see the cigarette has been played 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.430
 pump and returned to defect 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.230
 the pumps are not too retention 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:54.280
 good and I'll be here a new option 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.280
 of line retention 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.509
 Good staff here with a motorboat 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.450
 of injected p1 and is not the first time 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.909
 that I go through this problem of 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.570
 difficulty of departure mainly from 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.210
 morning on the first departure or after 10 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.630
 a car stopped minutes to delay 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.250
 good pasquim is a classic problem there of 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.910
 retention of pressure in the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.909
 this car has already touched the 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.570
 the fuel pump and after a 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.460
 The week again gave trouble. 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.590
 unfortunately the fuel pumps 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.850
 That Brazil is rubbish. 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:14.230
 we buy a new complete kit and still 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.620
 come with defect and I'm here with what 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.260
 quintal of lp check valve 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.260
 I did not know, I just saw on the internet. 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.459
 this template here 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.989
 let's go there for retention 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:42.810
 Holds up to 120 ps1 changes from 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:47.310
 1 120 pstu you have an idea what 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.650
 car work around three boats and 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.900
 120 ps is here 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.060
 so you have a good time and 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.769
 safety 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.250
 good will install here 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.250
 see what it gives 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:33.150
 The pressure here remains perfect. 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.150
 the check valve works very well 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.490
 Let's now test that only the 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.430
 pressure 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:48.340
 this car it has pressure variation 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:51.160
 as the vacuum and see if everything is ok the 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:55.080
 try to regulate pressure 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.950
 this is the only way to open up the vast 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:05.240
 of want arises 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:05.240
 who gets pressure 22 and 26 to 32 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:12.080
 so there's no vacuum and convap on 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.860
 when the connected hose has to 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:25.039
 speed up 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.430
 the controller does not compensate 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.430
 pressure 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.320
 the perfect 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:48.270
 the check valve is very cheap 

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:50.159
 compared to all the labor that has 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.159
 be to take the pump out of 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:55.610
 and put the profile even 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:58.939
 than the whole cable but unfortunately 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:02.279
 these factories that you have here in Brazil 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:03.649
 even more in such a check valve 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:07.669
 will fail 

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:16.830
 thanks to him for manufacturing this new 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:19.550
 after installation of the rock valve is 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.550
 Perfect
