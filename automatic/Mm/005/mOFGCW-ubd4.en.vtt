everybody Patrick here usually have
videos<00:00:05.810> on<00:00:05.960> picking<00:00:06.290> locks<00:00:06.910> but<00:00:07.910> today<00:00:08.469> we're

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
videos on picking locks but today we're

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.979 
videos on picking locks but today we're
going<00:00:09.559> to<00:00:09.650> talk<00:00:09.799> about<00:00:10.039> this<00:00:10.159> master<00:00:10.690> 3<00:00:11.690> number

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:11.989 
going to talk about this master 3 number

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:15.459 
going to talk about this master 3 number
combo<00:00:12.440> lock<00:00:12.619> and<00:00:13.480> how<00:00:14.480> easy<00:00:14.749> it<00:00:14.900> is<00:00:14.989> to<00:00:15.169> open

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
combo lock and how easy it is to open

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.320 
combo lock and how easy it is to open
with<00:00:15.650> no<00:00:15.860> tools<00:00:16.129> and<00:00:17.080> no<00:00:18.080> skills<00:00:18.380> really<00:00:19.330> right

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
with no tools and no skills really right

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.739 
with no tools and no skills really right
now<00:00:20.359> it's<00:00:20.599> unlocked<00:00:20.869> it's<00:00:21.199> all<00:00:21.349> set<00:00:21.560> to<00:00:21.740> 0<00:00:21.980> 's

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:22.749 
now it's unlocked it's all set to 0 's

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:27.089 
now it's unlocked it's all set to 0 's
let<00:00:23.749> me<00:00:23.869> focus<00:00:24.140> here<00:00:24.499> sorry<00:00:25.449> it's<00:00:26.449> all<00:00:26.570> zeros

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
let me focus here sorry it's all zeros

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.669 
let me focus here sorry it's all zeros
so<00:00:28.099> we're<00:00:28.220> going<00:00:28.310> to<00:00:28.369> reset<00:00:28.730> it<00:00:28.880> turn<00:00:29.749> it<00:00:29.929> so<00:00:30.589> it

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
so we're going to reset it turn it so it

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.459 
so we're going to reset it turn it so it
pushes<00:00:31.480> now<00:00:32.480> I'm<00:00:32.599> not<00:00:32.750> looking<00:00:32.870> at<00:00:33.170> it<00:00:33.320> I'm

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
pushes now I'm not looking at it I'm

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.310 
pushes now I'm not looking at it I'm
just<00:00:33.559> going<00:00:33.739> to<00:00:34.719> randomly<00:00:35.719> spin<00:00:36.230> this<00:00:38.320> make

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
just going to randomly spin this make

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.080 
just going to randomly spin this make
sure<00:00:39.469> they're<00:00:39.649> all<00:00:39.969> clicked<00:00:42.520> all<00:00:43.520> right

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.380 

all<00:00:47.090> right<00:00:47.269> now<00:00:47.840> first<00:00:48.440> thing<00:00:48.620> you<00:00:48.710> do<00:00:48.859> I<00:00:49.390> set

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
all right now first thing you do I set

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:59.200 
all right now first thing you do I set
it<00:00:50.480> all<00:00:50.570> to<00:00:50.719> zeros<00:00:55.300> all<00:00:56.300> right<00:00:56.510> now<00:00:58.210> we're

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
it all to zeros all right now we're

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.310 
it all to zeros all right now we're
going<00:00:59.300> to<00:00:59.390> figure<00:00:59.600> out<00:00:59.719> what<00:00:59.870> this<00:00:59.989> number<00:01:00.170> is

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
going to figure out what this number is

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.759 
going to figure out what this number is
first<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.399> 0<00:01:02.000> we're<00:01:02.210> going<00:01:02.329> to<00:01:02.440> keep<00:01:03.440> tension

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
first so 0 we're going to keep tension

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.390 
first so 0 we're going to keep tension
on<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.160> shackle<00:01:05.740> spin<00:01:06.740> this<00:01:06.920> see<00:01:07.220> how<00:01:07.310> it

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
on the shackle spin this see how it

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:17.160 
on the shackle spin this see how it
spins<00:01:07.610> freely<00:01:09.310> let<00:01:10.310> go<00:01:11.140> one<00:01:13.240> spins<00:01:14.240> freely<00:01:15.280> now

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
spins freely let go one spins freely now

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:25.750 
spins freely let go one spins freely now
to<00:01:18.170> pull<00:01:19.720> spins<00:01:20.720> freely<00:01:21.020> no<00:01:23.380> next<00:01:24.380> one<00:01:24.760> spins

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
to pull spins freely no next one spins

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:35.140 
to pull spins freely no next one spins
freely<00:01:26.030> now<00:01:30.070> spins<00:01:31.070> freely<00:01:31.310> no<00:01:33.370> all<00:01:34.370> right<00:01:34.610> now

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
freely now spins freely no all right now

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.240 
freely now spins freely no all right now
it'll<00:01:35.750> spin<00:01:36.020> if<00:01:36.260> you<00:01:36.350> force<00:01:36.620> it<00:01:36.770> but<00:01:36.980> see<00:01:37.130> how

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
it'll spin if you force it but see how

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.230 
it'll spin if you force it but see how
it's<00:01:37.460> how<00:01:37.850> I<00:01:37.880> just<00:01:38.330> can't<00:01:38.570> spin<00:01:38.840> it<00:01:38.930> easy

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
it's how I just can't spin it easy

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.400 
it's how I just can't spin it easy
so<00:01:41.240> first<00:01:41.540> number<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:41.900> 6<00:01:42.640> this<00:01:43.640> is<00:01:44.410> decoding

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
so first number is 6 this is decoding

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.300 
so first number is 6 this is decoding
this<00:01:45.560> number<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:47.470> then<00:01:48.470> we<00:01:48.590> start<00:01:48.800> on<00:01:48.980> this<00:01:49.130> one

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
this number so then we start on this one

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.450 
this number so then we start on this one
back<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.700> 0<00:01:50.140> now<00:01:51.140> we're<00:01:51.710> going<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:51.890> decode<00:01:52.220> this

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
back to 0 now we're going to decode this

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.010 
back to 0 now we're going to decode this
one<00:01:52.930> with<00:01:53.930> this<00:01:54.080> one<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:54.710> zero<00:01:55.630> spin<00:01:56.630> spins

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
one with this one so zero spin spins

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.880 
one with this one so zero spin spins
freely<00:02:00.040> spins<00:02:01.040> freely

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.560 

spins<00:02:04.490> freely<00:02:06.910> spins<00:02:07.910> freely<00:02:10.300> spins<00:02:11.300> freely

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
spins freely spins freely spins freely

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:25.470 
spins freely spins freely spins freely
oh<00:02:12.760> maybe<00:02:13.760> not<00:02:13.970> maybe<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:14.420> was<00:02:14.570> this<00:02:14.720> one<00:02:14.960> nope

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.190 

all<00:02:26.480> right<00:02:26.660> now<00:02:27.170> it's<00:02:27.350> hard<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.430> we<00:02:28.730> have<00:02:29.200> five

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
all right now it's hard so we have five

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.950 
all right now it's hard so we have five
nine<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.340> now<00:02:31.820> since<00:02:32.060> there's<00:02:32.240> no<00:02:32.360> nothing<00:02:32.870> to

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
nine and now since there's no nothing to

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.660 
nine and now since there's no nothing to
code<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:33.560> just<00:02:33.650> pull<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.540> spin<00:02:36.670> until

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
code this you just pull and spin until

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.730 
code this you just pull and spin until
it<00:02:37.760> unlocks<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.500> combination<00:02:41.380> five<00:02:42.380> nine

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
it unlocks so a combination five nine

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.990 
it unlocks so a combination five nine
three<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:44.000> here<00:02:44.990> we<00:02:45.110> lose<00:02:45.260> your<00:02:45.380> combo<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.770> this

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
three so here we lose your combo to this

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.210 
three so here we lose your combo to this
it's<00:02:47.000> really<00:02:47.180> easy<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.540> decode<00:02:51.010> again<00:02:52.010> no

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
it's really easy to decode again no

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.080 
it's really easy to decode again no
skills<00:02:52.520> really<00:02:52.880> just<00:02:53.510> your<00:02:53.750> decoding<00:02:55.090> the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
skills really just your decoding the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.690 
skills really just your decoding the
first<00:02:56.330> number<00:02:56.600> with<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.840> second<00:02:57.170> wheel<00:02:57.700> while

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
first number with the second wheel while

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.870 
first number with the second wheel while
you're<00:02:58.850> applying<00:02:59.120> tension<00:03:00.490> each<00:03:01.490> time<00:03:01.760> you

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
you're applying tension each time you

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.540 
you're applying tension each time you
change<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.150> number<00:03:02.510> let<00:03:03.200> off<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:03.830> then<00:03:04.220> pull

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
change the number let off and then pull

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.540 
change the number let off and then pull
and<00:03:04.790> then<00:03:04.940> spin<00:03:05.300> until<00:03:05.800> it's<00:03:06.800> hard<00:03:06.980> it's

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
and then spin until it's hard it's

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.000 
and then spin until it's hard it's
always<00:03:08.120> spin<00:03:08.420> but<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.050> can<00:03:09.200> tell<00:03:09.440> it'll<00:03:09.920> be

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
always spin but you can tell it'll be

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.660 
always spin but you can tell it'll be
hard<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:10.400> hard<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.090> turn<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:11.630> then<00:03:12.590> again<00:03:12.860> when

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
hard to hard to turn and then again when

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.240 
hard to hard to turn and then again when
you<00:03:13.790> decode<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.270> number<00:03:14.680> use<00:03:15.680> this<00:03:15.890> wheel<00:03:16.070> to

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
you decode this number use this wheel to

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.620 
you decode this number use this wheel to
spin<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.670> go<00:03:16.730> through<00:03:16.910> each<00:03:17.060> number<00:03:17.450> while

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
spin and go through each number while

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.900 
spin and go through each number while
you're<00:03:17.780> pulling<00:03:18.080> on<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.260> shackle<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.910> then
