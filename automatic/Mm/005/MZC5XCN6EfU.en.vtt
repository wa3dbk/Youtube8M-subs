00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.280
 Hello all! Welcome to the last day of the Sanja Festival! 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.340
 I'm here with the Komagata Team 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.540
 and I'm going to film quite a few cool things today 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.260
 It is the last day, so the 3 big mikoshi are present 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.861
 So I am very curious to see it 

00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:20.744
 I was here yesterday too, but then I only saw small altars 

00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:22.024
 So have fun! 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.400
 Sanja Matsuri is the biggest festival in Tokyo and it is known that it can get quite noisy! 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.860
 Neighborhoods around the temple are subdivided into teams called "choukai" 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.600
 all of which have their own mikoshi 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.740
 Shinto believers believe that mikoshi are used as a means of transport from one altar to another for gods 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.440
 So everyone is fighting to be allowed to wear the mikoshi 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.460
 That is why Sanja Matsuri can get pretty intense! 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.500
 How many years have you been doing the Sanja festival? 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.880
 I did Sanja for the first time in 2007 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.060
 What was your most memorable Sanja experience? 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.520
 Probably my first year 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.620
 I was just watching quietly when suddenly a man pulled me up and took off his eyes 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.660
 Then he put it on my side and pushed me in between and from that moment on I started to love it 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.980
 Why is today considered the climax of the festival? 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.180
 Everything is on Sunday 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.900
 The day they bring out the 3 main mikoshi 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.260
 the three main mikoshi are carried along certain areas 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.580
 Everyone jumps in between and fights to be allowed to participate 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.260
 So much passion, so much fun 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.140
 And the day just ends with everyone taking a drink, it's really great fun 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.340
 Yakuza was always one of the largest parts of Sanja matsuri, and you would have often seen this before 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.580
 But because of the recent tightening of rules, you won't see many people proudly displaying their tattoos 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.720
 I had the chance to wear one of the three larger mikoshi 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.680
 Some Mikoshi weigh nearly 500 pounds 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.020
 Sanja matsuri attracts around 2 million visitors every year 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.260
 It is definitely an event that I would recommend to go someday! 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.660
 How was it? 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.100
 Awesome! Good workout 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.820
 It was cool 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.920
 Today it was the very first time that you participated with Sanja Matsuri! How did you like it? 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.460
 I really enjoyed it! I had never done anything like this, not even in my home town 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.880
 So it was a very exciting first experience for me! 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.860
 What did you like best? 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.260
 I liked wearing the mikoshi the most! 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.280
 It was scary! It wasn't even that hard yet 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.140
 you are drawn from a thousand different directions 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.100
 and you are pushed, but it was a lot of fun! 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.020
 Okay everyone, now it's time for the Sanja post meal from dojou or mud crawlers 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.440
 I think it actually sounds better in Japanese 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.440
 They are small fish! 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.990
 We grab some and place them on our plates 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.140
 and add some green onion and some sanshou or "Japanese pepper" 

00:05:01.186 --> 00:05:02.706
 Let's give it a try! 

00:05:12.788 --> 00:05:14.868
 Ooo I love gobou (burdock root) 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 The name of this store is Komagata Dozeu 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 This store has been around for over 200 years! Exactly at this location 

00:05:35.053 --> 00:05:37.133
 and i love to give it a try 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.180
 Do you like sanshou? 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.680
 I love sanshou! 

00:05:46.964 --> 00:05:49.124
 Okay, I'll give it a try 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.320
 Mmmm mud crawlers â™¡ 

00:05:57.596 --> 00:06:00.276
 They taste really good, the name sounds terrible but they are really delicious! 

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:05.306
 A very subtle taste, I expected that they would taste very fishy. But they don't taste that at all! 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.440
 The festival closes with a big song called "kiyari" 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.320
 Okay I hope you enjoyed it!
