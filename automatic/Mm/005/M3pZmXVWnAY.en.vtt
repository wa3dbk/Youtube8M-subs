00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
people's curiosity because as soon as I

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.870 
people's curiosity because as soon as I
saw<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.200> thing<00:00:07.379> in<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.680> menu<00:00:07.980> as<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.160> launcher

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
saw this thing in the menu as a launcher

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.030 
saw this thing in the menu as a launcher
I<00:00:09.059> couldn't<00:00:09.780> wait<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.929> unlock<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.590> see<00:00:10.860> how

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
I couldn't wait to unlock it and see how

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.009 
I couldn't wait to unlock it and see how
it<00:00:11.190> works<00:00:11.460> because<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.910> little<00:00:12.330> description

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
it works because that little description

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.749 
it works because that little description
is<00:00:13.170> he<00:00:13.320> next<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.769> weapon<00:00:14.040> right<00:00:14.070> now

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
is he next to the weapon right now

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.029 
is he next to the weapon right now
well<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.480> wasn't<00:00:15.809> there<00:00:16.080> before<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.650> unlock

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
well that wasn't there before you unlock

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.880 
well that wasn't there before you unlock
it<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.550> just<00:00:17.760> see<00:00:18.150> black<00:00:18.750> cell<00:00:19.170> does<00:00:19.770> it

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
it so you just see black cell does it

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.200 
it so you just see black cell does it
launch<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.220> blob<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.460> dark<00:00:20.820> matter<00:00:20.970> that

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
launch a blob of dark matter that

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.330 
launch a blob of dark matter that
destroys<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.900> entire<00:00:22.140> map<00:00:22.439> well<00:00:22.949> probably

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
destroys the entire map well probably

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.070 
destroys the entire map well probably
not<00:00:23.580> but<00:00:24.090> it's<00:00:24.210> pretty<00:00:24.359> tough<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.720> know<00:00:24.840> what

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
not but it's pretty tough to know what

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.109 
not but it's pretty tough to know what
it<00:00:25.170> does<00:00:25.350> just<00:00:25.710> by<00:00:25.830> looking<00:00:26.369> at<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.699> thing

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
it does just by looking at this thing

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.970 
it does just by looking at this thing
it's<00:00:27.510> very<00:00:27.840> unique<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.560> almost<00:00:28.710> like<00:00:28.859> an

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
it's very unique it's almost like an

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.220 
it's very unique it's almost like an
alternate<00:00:29.400> design<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.060> thunder<00:00:30.480> gun<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
alternate design of a thunder gun in the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.299 
alternate design of a thunder gun in the
front<00:00:31.470> there<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.740> almost<00:00:31.859> looks<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
front there it almost looks like a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.090 
front there it almost looks like a

well exciting but you know what this

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.850 
well exciting but you know what this
weapon<00:01:06.479> isn't<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.140> bad<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.500> all<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
weapon isn't that bad at all on the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.560 
weapon isn't that bad at all on the
contrary<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.490> very<00:01:08.820> good<00:01:09.060> at<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.479> does

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
contrary it is very good at what it does

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.570 
contrary it is very good at what it does
shooting<00:01:10.439> stuff<00:01:10.650> down<00:01:10.890> especially<00:01:11.460> when

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
shooting stuff down especially when

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.250 
shooting stuff down especially when
paired<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:11.880> engineer<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.080> help

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
paired with engineer and that can help

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.780 
paired with engineer and that can help
you<00:01:13.350> earn<00:01:13.409> some<00:01:13.680> very<00:01:13.860> easy<00:01:14.100> points<00:01:14.520> towards

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you earn some very easy points towards

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.340 
you earn some very easy points towards
your<00:01:14.820> kill<00:01:15.030> streak<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.420> keep<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.930> enemy<00:01:16.049> air

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
your kill streak and keep the enemy air

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.499 
your kill streak and keep the enemy air
power<00:01:16.560> down<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.130> thing<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.970> because<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
power down the thing is because the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.789 
power down the thing is because the
pistols<00:01:18.869> are<00:01:18.960> actually<00:01:19.229> pretty<00:01:19.409> good<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.740> this

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
pistols are actually pretty good in this

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.980 
pistols are actually pretty good in this
game<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.280> most<00:01:20.580> importantly<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
game and most importantly because of the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.140 
game and most importantly because of the
black<00:01:22.259> hat<00:01:22.590> returning<00:01:23.159> from<00:01:23.310> black<00:01:23.670> ops<00:01:23.909> 2

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
black hat returning from black ops 2

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.359 
black hat returning from black ops 2
what<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.720> can't<00:01:24.990> wait<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.259> unlock<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.770> don't

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
what you can't wait to unlock I don't

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.679 
what you can't wait to unlock I don't
think<00:01:26.580> there's<00:01:26.729> much<00:01:26.880> reason<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.240> use<00:01:27.509> this

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
think there's much reason to use this

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.940 
think there's much reason to use this
launcher<00:01:28.080> I'd<00:01:28.259> much<00:01:28.409> rather<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
launcher I'd much rather have a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.859 
launcher I'd much rather have a
