00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
of years ago I was carried in the met in

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.809 
of years ago I was carried in the met in
the<00:03:02.079> moma<00:03:02.260> like<00:03:02.890> all<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.130> gift<00:03:03.370> shops<00:03:03.579> and

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.030 
the moma like all the gift shops and
Apple<00:03:04.120> stores<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:04.450> whatnot<00:03:04.720> but<00:03:05.079> it<00:03:05.260> was<00:03:05.410> like

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
Apple stores and whatnot but it was like

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.770 
Apple stores and whatnot but it was like
the<00:03:06.430> idea<00:03:06.849> that<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.180> always<00:03:07.360> have<00:03:07.630> this

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
the idea that you always have this

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.080 
the idea that you always have this
camera<00:03:08.140> with<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.769> big<00:03:09.130> difference<00:03:09.430> than

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
camera with you is a big difference than

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.270 
camera with you is a big difference than
wanting<00:03:10.989> I<00:03:11.170> wish<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.620> had<00:03:11.739> my<00:03:11.860> camera<00:03:11.890> because

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
wanting I wish I had my camera because

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.220 
wanting I wish I had my camera because
we<00:03:12.400> were<00:03:12.579> further<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.420> know<00:03:13.510> all<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.959> time

we were further you know all the time

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.770 
we were further you know all the time

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
until like five years ago we missed most

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.720 
until like five years ago we missed most
of<00:03:16.989> those<00:03:17.109> pictures<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:18.130> that's<00:03:18.310> what<00:03:18.459> photos

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
of those pictures and that's what photos

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.250 
of those pictures and that's what photos
are<00:03:18.880> about<00:03:19.090> their<00:03:19.329> about<00:03:19.540> stories<00:03:20.079> and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
are about their about stories and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.830 
are about their about stories and
moments<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.150> if<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.239> don't<00:03:22.420> have<00:03:22.569> a<00:03:22.600> camera

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
moments and if you don't have a camera

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.300 
moments and if you don't have a camera
with<00:03:22.989> you<00:03:23.170> can't<00:03:23.440> take<00:03:23.590> those<00:03:23.739> pictures<00:03:23.980> so

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
with you can't take those pictures so

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.340 
with you can't take those pictures so
the<00:03:24.639> fact<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.150> had<00:03:25.359> this<00:03:25.540> with<00:03:25.750> me<00:03:25.959> was

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
the fact that I had this with me was

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.020 
the fact that I had this with me was
really<00:03:26.709> what<00:03:26.859> helped<00:03:27.160> transform<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.940> so

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
really what helped transform it so

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.670 
really what helped transform it so
that's<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.299> key<00:03:28.540> differentiator<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.290> feel<00:03:29.560> like

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
that's a key differentiator I feel like

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.440 
that's a key differentiator I feel like
we're<00:03:30.190> trying<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.489> see<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:30.940> know<00:03:31.000> look

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
we're trying to see that you know look

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.479 
we're trying to see that you know look

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
and you're getting these limits rated

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.920 
and you're getting these limits rated
before<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:35.920> then<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.489> mentality<00:03:37.239> difference

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
before and then the mentality difference

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.960 
before and then the mentality difference
is<00:03:38.139> that<00:03:39.120> thinking<00:03:40.120> about<00:03:40.329> this<00:03:40.510> as<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.840> camera

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
is that thinking about this as a camera

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.879 
is that thinking about this as a camera
more<00:03:42.970> than<00:03:43.389> a<00:03:43.420> phone<00:03:43.870> was<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.319> click<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.829> I

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
more than a phone was a click that I

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.740 
more than a phone was a click that I
feel<00:03:45.100> like<00:03:45.160> our<00:03:45.310> culture<00:03:45.730> that's<00:03:46.420> one<00:03:46.569> of<00:03:46.660> the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
feel like our culture that's one of the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.090 
feel like our culture that's one of the
things<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:47.049> has<00:03:47.230> noticed<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.709> want<00:03:47.950> our

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
things that has noticed I want our

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.620 
things that has noticed I want our
culture<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.549> do<00:03:48.700> is<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.060> be<00:03:49.090> able<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.420> think

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
culture to do is to be able to think

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.509 
culture to do is to be able to think
about<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:50.019> so<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.440> started<00:03:51.220> thinking<00:03:51.489> about

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
about that so I started thinking about

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.490 
about that so I started thinking about
this<00:03:51.760> as<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:51.970> camera<00:03:52.389> really<00:03:52.900> really<00:03:53.049> early<00:03:53.139> and

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
this as a camera really really early and

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.650 
this as a camera really really early and
the<00:03:54.160> key<00:03:54.340> difference<00:03:54.760> between<00:03:55.180> what<00:03:55.389> you<00:03:55.480> have

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
the key difference between what you have

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.020 
the key difference between what you have
to<00:03:55.780> do<00:03:55.900> with<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.109> pro<00:03:57.099> camera<00:03:57.549> or<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:57.790> real

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
to do with the pro camera or a real

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.569 
to do with the pro camera or a real
camera<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.720> this<00:03:59.500> camera<00:03:59.739> is<00:04:00.040> this<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.549> just

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
camera and this camera is this it just

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.039 
camera and this camera is this it just
requires<00:04:01.060> a<00:04:01.150> little<00:04:01.359> bit<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:04.540> requires<00:04:04.930> a

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
requires a little bit of it requires a

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.470 
requires a little bit of it requires a
mental<00:04:05.590> shift<00:04:05.889> to<00:04:06.130> think<00:04:06.430> about<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.269> world

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
mental shift to think about the world

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.000 
mental shift to think about the world
through<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.840> little<00:04:08.169> teeny<00:04:08.349> lines<00:04:08.620> like<00:04:08.829> this

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
through a little teeny lines like this

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.009 
through a little teeny lines like this
as<00:04:09.250> opposed<00:04:09.639> to<00:04:09.910> something<00:04:10.419> that's<00:04:10.630> big<00:04:10.989> and

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
as opposed to something that's big and

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.569 
as opposed to something that's big and
set<00:04:11.530> up<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:11.919> where<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.130> draw<00:04:12.310> a<00:04:12.340> lot<00:04:12.489> of

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
set up and where you draw a lot of

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.250 
set up and where you draw a lot of
attention<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.180> there's<00:04:13.510> a<00:04:13.569> huge<00:04:13.780> benefit<00:04:14.200> to

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
attention and there's a huge benefit to

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
services which was a big shift so it was

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.879 
services which was a big shift so it was
a<00:05:42.729> bday<00:05:43.120> year<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.539> macworld<00:05:44.409> in<00:05:44.649> the<00:05:44.710> New<00:05:44.770> York

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
a bday year and macworld in the New York

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.399 
a bday year and macworld in the New York
Times<00:05:45.009> and<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:45.879> all<00:05:46.449> that<00:05:46.509> stuff<00:05:46.839> so<00:05:47.110> it<00:05:47.259> was

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
Times and and all that stuff so it was

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.889 
Times and and all that stuff so it was
really<00:05:47.529> more<00:05:47.860> of<00:05:48.039> a<00:05:48.159> kick<00:05:48.460> off<00:05:48.669> then<00:05:49.449> um

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:49.899 
really more of a kick off then um

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:52.290 
really more of a kick off then um
anything<00:05:50.830> that<00:05:50.979> was<00:05:51.129> that's<00:05:51.550> been<00:05:51.759> sustained

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
anything that was that's been sustained

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.790 
anything that was that's been sustained
so<00:05:52.539> it<00:05:52.629> still<00:05:52.839> has<00:05:52.990> a<00:05:53.020> really<00:05:53.289> active<00:05:53.469> user

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800
