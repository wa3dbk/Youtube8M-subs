00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
will give this name of test save the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.640 
will give this name of test save the
color<00:03:24.480> just<00:03:25.350> changes<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.160> i<00:03:26.250> only<00:03:26.460> have<00:03:26.790> the

colors so this is just example of what
happens<00:03:35.370> when<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.000> use<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:37.490> same<00:03:38.490> thing

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
happens when I use the same thing

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.040 
happens when I use the same thing
happens<00:03:39.210> when<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.540> try<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.900> make<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.230> movie<00:03:41.030> so
