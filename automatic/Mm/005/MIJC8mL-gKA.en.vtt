from the rest of us right in 1992 I was

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.459 
from the rest of us right in 1992 I was
diagnosed<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:31.740> medullary<00:00:32.369> sponge<00:00:32.700> kidney

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
diagnosed with medullary sponge kidney

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.950 
diagnosed with medullary sponge kidney
disease<00:00:34.469> with<00:00:34.710> stones<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.480> what<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.660> means

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
disease with stones and what that means

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
disease with stones and what that means
is<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.290> when<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> formed<00:00:38.670> my<00:00:38.730> stones<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.360> my

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
is that when I formed my stones and my

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.660 
is that when I formed my stones and my
kidneys<00:00:39.960> they<00:00:40.590> would<00:00:40.739> form<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> opposite

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
kidneys they would form on the opposite

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.180 
kidneys they would form on the opposite
side<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.059> everyone<00:00:42.390> else<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.950> passing<00:00:43.950> him<00:00:44.070> was

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
side as everyone else so passing him was

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.380 
side as everyone else so passing him was
very<00:00:44.399> difficult<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.940> me

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
very difficult for me

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.139 
very difficult for me
so<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:46.500> stones<00:00:46.860> were<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> front<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
so your stones were on the front of the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.880 
so your stones were on the front of the
kidney<00:00:48.450> versus<00:00:48.750> everyone<00:00:49.079> else<00:00:49.230> who<00:00:49.350> produces

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
kidney versus everyone else who produces

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950 
kidney versus everyone else who produces
him<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> back<00:00:50.430> yeah<00:00:51.329> where<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.750> could

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
him on the back yeah where you could

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.380 
him on the back yeah where you could
just<00:00:51.989> put<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.739> know<00:00:52.770> they'd<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.340> big<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:54.180> most

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
just put you know they'd be big for most

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.520 
just put you know they'd be big for most
people<00:00:54.719> they'd<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.870> bigoted<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.320> they'd<00:00:55.440> be

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
people they'd be bigoted but they'd be

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.380 
people they'd be bigoted but they'd be
able<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.800> pass<00:00:55.980> through<00:00:56.280> mine<00:00:56.969> couldn't

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
able to pass through mine couldn't

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.810 
able to pass through mine couldn't
because<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.440> tissue<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.670> had

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
because there was that tissue that had

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.250 
because there was that tissue that had
had<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.059> pass<00:01:00.270> through<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.719> couldn't<00:01:01.079> they

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
had to pass through and it couldn't they

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.889 
had to pass through and it couldn't they
had<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:01.620> broken<00:01:01.829> up<00:01:02.570> by<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> laser

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
had to get broken up by a laser

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.630 
had to get broken up by a laser
treatment<00:01:04.199> or<00:01:04.680> knowledge<00:01:10.640> ultrasound

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
treatment or knowledge ultrasound

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.530 
treatment or knowledge ultrasound
ultrasound<00:01:12.210> yeah<00:01:12.540> ultrasound<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.330> if<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
ultrasound yeah ultrasound so and if you

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.910 
ultrasound yeah ultrasound so and if you
haven't<00:01:15.960> had<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.110> ultrasound<00:01:16.740> treatment

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
haven't had that ultrasound treatment

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.320 
haven't had that ultrasound treatment
eventually<00:01:17.490> your<00:01:17.610> whole<00:01:17.729> kidney<00:01:18.090> would<00:01:18.240> have

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
eventually your whole kidney would have

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.170 
eventually your whole kidney would have
turned<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.810> stone<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:19.439> yeah<00:01:19.830> yeah<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
turned to stone right yeah yeah and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
turned to stone right yeah yeah and
because<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.290> kidney<00:01:22.650> problems<00:01:22.979> you
