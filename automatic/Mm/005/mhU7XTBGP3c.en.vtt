dog tags actually with Zola tech on them
and<00:01:24.390> I'll<00:01:24.479> take<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.960> look<00:01:25.049> at<00:01:25.200> those<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and I'll take a look at those in a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.380 
and I'll take a look at those in a
moment<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.009> first<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:26.909> let<00:01:27.030> me<00:01:27.060> take<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
moment but first of all let me take the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.140 
moment but first of all let me take the
old<00:01:27.540> case<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.990> off<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.700> set<00:01:29.970> that

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
old case on off of here you set that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.440 
old case on off of here you set that
aside<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.770> I've<00:01:31.770> always<00:01:32.250> liked<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.060> co's<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
aside and I've always liked the co's of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.960 
aside and I've always liked the co's of
cases<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.070> simple<00:01:35.310> reason<00:01:35.490> is

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
cases up for one simple reason is

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.840 
cases up for one simple reason is
they're<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.259> thin<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.549> see<00:01:38.820> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
they're really thin and you can see I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
they're really thin and you can see I
don't<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.180> how<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.390> hell<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.920> that

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
don't know how the hell you can see that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.130 
don't know how the hell you can see that
you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> edge<00:01:42.420> may<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.720> right<00:01:42.930> there

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
you can see the edge may be right there

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.080 
you can see the edge may be right there
the<00:01:44.090> cases<00:01:45.090> fit<00:01:45.659> really<00:01:46.079> nice<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:46.979> snug<00:01:47.280> they

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the cases fit really nice and snug they

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.030 
the cases fit really nice and snug they
provide<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> little<00:01:48.990> bit<00:01:49.140> more<00:01:49.290> grip<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
provide a little bit more grip to the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.850 
provide a little bit more grip to the
back<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.820> iphone<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.899> they<00:01:52.500> leave<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
back of the iphone and they leave the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.630 
back of the iphone and they leave the
front<00:01:53.040> open<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.820> i<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.570> because<00:01:54.810> i

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
front open and i like that because i

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.130 
front open and i like that because i
don't<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.030> anything<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> floor<00:01:58.110> i

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
don't like the anything on the floor i

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.240 
don't like the anything on the floor i

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
screen looks and sometimes how it

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.520 
screen looks and sometimes how it

a<00:02:40.020> look<00:02:40.260> at<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> other<00:02:40.500> one<00:02:41.000> not<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> whole<00:02:42.240> lot

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
a look at the other one not a whole lot

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.240 
a look at the other one not a whole lot
since<00:02:42.660> they<00:02:42.810> are<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.960> very<00:02:43.050> simple<00:02:43.590> case<00:02:43.860> but

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
since they are a very simple case but

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.590 
since they are a very simple case but
probably<00:02:44.580> would<00:02:44.760> take<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> look<00:02:45.120> at<00:02:45.240> it<00:02:45.270> anyway

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
probably would take a look at it anyway

probably would take a look at it anyway

crossed sozo low-tech the one here is

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.220 
crossed sozo low-tech the one here is
kind<00:03:05.460> of<00:03:05.660> diagonal<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.690> kind<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:06.960> like<00:03:07.110> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
kind of diagonal I kind of like the

kind of diagonal I kind of like the
diagonal<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:08.190> turned<00:03:08.400> out<00:03:08.550> well<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.390> let's<00:03:09.510> go

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
diagonal it turned out well so let's go

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.950 
diagonal it turned out well so let's go
ahead<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.870> pop<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.170> case<00:03:10.650> off<00:03:11.750> they<00:03:12.750> pop

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
ahead and pop this case off they pop

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.080 
ahead and pop this case off they pop
right<00:03:13.110> off<00:03:13.230> pretty<00:03:13.560> easy<00:03:13.710> now<00:03:14.610> with<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:14.880> type

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
right off pretty easy now with this type

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.190 
right off pretty easy now with this type
of<00:03:15.120> case<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.480> don't<00:03:15.630> want<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.810> take<00:03:15.960> it<00:03:15.990> off

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
of case you don't want to take it off

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.650 
of case you don't want to take it off
once<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.680> while<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.160> just<00:03:18.030> take<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.450> dust

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
once in a while and just take the dust

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.300 
once in a while and just take the dust
out<00:03:18.870> from<00:03:19.110> behind<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.650> because<00:03:19.740> that<00:03:20.130> will

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
out from behind it because that will

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.970 
out from behind it because that will
scratch<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.910> over<00:03:21.150> time<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:22.530> that's<00:03:22.740> not<00:03:22.920> a

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
scratch it over time and that's not a

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.040 
scratch it over time and that's not a
fault<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.670> case<00:03:23.910> that's<00:03:24.210> just<00:03:24.480> all<00:03:24.690> cases

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
fault of the case that's just all cases

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.170 
fault of the case that's just all cases
they're<00:03:25.410> just<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:26.220> doesn't<00:03:26.400> move<00:03:26.670> within<00:03:26.970> the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
they're just it doesn't move within the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.750 
they're just it doesn't move within the
case<00:03:27.390> just<00:03:27.660> tends<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.440> be<00:03:28.530> all<00:03:28.620> cases<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.280> now

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
case just tends to be all cases and now

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.430 
case just tends to be all cases and now
after<00:03:30.120> having<00:03:30.210> the<00:03:30.480> black<00:03:30.690> on<00:03:30.930> here<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.140> have<00:03:31.320> to

that out so let's take a look at these

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.430 
that out so let's take a look at these
dog<00:04:03.060> tags<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.540> didn't<00:04:03.750> know<00:04:03.810> they<00:04:03.930> do<00:04:03.990> anything

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
dog tags I didn't know they do anything

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.780 
dog tags I didn't know they do anything
like<00:04:04.560> this<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:04.890> don't<00:04:04.920> know<00:04:05.160> if<00:04:05.220> they<00:04:05.400> they

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
like this I don't know if they they

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.910 
like this I don't know if they they
weren't<00:04:06.270> telling<00:04:06.450> you<00:04:06.600> telling<00:04:07.050> today<00:04:07.260> we're

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
weren't telling you telling today we're

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.440 
weren't telling you telling today we're
going<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.070> send<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:08.760> think<00:04:09.270> that's

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
going to send this and I think that's

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.360 
going to send this and I think that's
pretty<00:04:09.600> cool<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:10.140> first<00:04:10.890> of<00:04:10.980> all<00:04:11.010> they<00:04:11.190> come

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
pretty cool so first of all they come

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.550 
pretty cool so first of all they come
with<00:04:11.550> key<00:04:11.790> chain<00:04:12.140> rings<00:04:13.670> or<00:04:15.140> your<00:04:16.140> little

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
with key chain rings or your little

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.890 
with key chain rings or your little
normal<00:04:16.980> dog<00:04:17.190> tag<00:04:17.520> beads<00:04:18.210> I'm<00:04:18.450> just<00:04:18.630> not<00:04:18.750> going

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
normal dog tag beads I'm just not going

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.630 
normal dog tag beads I'm just not going

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640

done<00:04:20.670> is

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670
