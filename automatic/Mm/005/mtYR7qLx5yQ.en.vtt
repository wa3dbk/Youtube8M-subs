with my Tercel and to take it off
there's<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.250> horn<00:01:00.120> cover<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
there's this horn cover here that and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.650 
there's this horn cover here that and
all<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.270> pull<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.969 
all you have to do is just pull it
really<00:01:03.840> hard<00:01:04.140> there<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:04.920> four<00:01:06.650> clamps<00:01:07.650> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
really hard there are four clamps that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.250 
really hard there are four clamps that
hold<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.320> it'll<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.560> simply<00:01:11.130> remove

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
hold it on and it'll just simply remove

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.080 
hold it on and it'll just simply remove
like<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.310> see<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> horn

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
like this and you can see the horn

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.630 
like this and you can see the horn
connections<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.930> stuff<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.189> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
connections and stuff like that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.440 
connections and stuff like that
the<00:01:17.759> bolt<00:01:18.090> more<00:01:18.450> importantly<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:20.450> for

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the bolt more importantly and for

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.390 
the bolt more importantly and for
microcell<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.700> 19<00:01:23.700> millimeter<00:01:25.400> self

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
microcell it is a 19 millimeter self

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.350 
microcell it is a 19 millimeter self
tightening<00:01:26.759> bolt<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.500> let's<00:01:28.909> start<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.119> remove

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
tightening bolt so let's start to remove

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.170 
tightening bolt so let's start to remove
it<00:01:30.710> now<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> most<00:01:32.460> trickiest<00:01:32.909> thing

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it now this is the most trickiest thing

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.219 
it now this is the most trickiest thing
I<00:01:33.360> think<00:01:33.650> it's<00:01:34.650> because<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:36.479> bolt<00:01:36.720> comes<00:01:37.020> off

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
I think it's because the bolt comes off

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.380 
I think it's because the bolt comes off
very<00:01:37.259> easily<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.790> steering<00:01:39.210> wheel

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
very easily but the steering wheel

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.560 
very easily but the steering wheel
doesn't<00:01:40.350> come<00:01:41.070> off<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.490> easily<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:45.210> here's<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
doesn't come off as easily so here's the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.590 
doesn't come off as easily so here's the
nut<00:01:45.829> it<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.009> off<00:01:47.189> okay<00:01:47.490> now<00:01:48.299> here's<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
nut it is off okay now here's the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.499 
nut it is off okay now here's the
trickiest<00:01:49.170> part<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:49.860> removing<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.700> stock

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
trickiest part with removing a stock

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.530 
trickiest part with removing a stock
steering<00:01:51.899> wheel<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.409> hasn't<00:01:52.619> been<00:01:53.540> even

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
steering wheel that hasn't been even

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.340 
steering wheel that hasn't been even
touched<00:01:55.530> since<00:01:56.450> well<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> guess<00:01:57.719> when<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.140> car

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
touched since well I guess when this car

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.670 
touched since well I guess when this car
was<00:01:58.380> assembled<00:01:58.890> back<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.280> 1984<00:02:00.000> July<00:02:00.750> 1984

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
was assembled back in 1984 July 1984

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.089 
was assembled back in 1984 July 1984
something<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:05.540> I'll<00:02:06.540> try<00:02:06.750> my<00:02:06.930> best

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
something like that and I'll try my best

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.840 
something like that and I'll try my best
so<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.220> bolt<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.610> off

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
so the bolt is off

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.190 
so the bolt is off
but<00:02:10.650> the<00:02:11.650> steering<00:02:12.010> wheel<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.750> locked<00:02:13.750> tight

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
but the steering wheel is locked tight

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.800 
but the steering wheel is locked tight
moving<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.250> camera<00:02:15.460> here<00:02:15.670> but<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.540> what<00:02:16.720> I'm

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
moving the camera here but so what I'm

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.350 
moving the camera here but so what I'm
gonna<00:02:16.960> do<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.380> I'm<00:02:17.710> gonna<00:02:17.890> just<00:02:18.220> like<00:02:18.370> bang<00:02:19.180> it

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
gonna do is I'm gonna just like bang it

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.800 
gonna do is I'm gonna just like bang it
loose<00:02:19.570> like<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.580> see<00:02:21.580> if<00:02:22.060> it'll<00:02:22.360> come<00:02:22.630> off

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
loose like that see if it'll come off

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.470 
loose like that see if it'll come off
easily<00:02:23.050> hope<00:02:23.650> hopefully<00:02:24.250> I'm<00:02:24.340> not<00:02:24.490> affecting

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
easily hope hopefully I'm not affecting

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:36.120 
easily hope hopefully I'm not affecting
the<00:02:25.510> video<00:02:30.060> holy<00:02:31.060> smokes<00:02:31.720> yeah<00:02:34.710> almost<00:02:35.710> hit<00:02:36.010> my

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
the video holy smokes yeah almost hit my

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.670 
the video holy smokes yeah almost hit my
face<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.670> one<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.450> here's<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:38.380> stock

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
face on that one so here's the stock

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.960 
face on that one so here's the stock
steering<00:02:39.010> wheel<00:02:39.540> completely<00:02:40.540> removed<00:02:40.900> and

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
steering wheel completely removed and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.400 
steering wheel completely removed and
there's<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:44.400> steering<00:02:45.400> column<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.410> it's

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
there's the steering column and it's

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.640 
there's the steering column and it's
pretty<00:02:47.980> cool<00:02:48.250> because<00:02:48.460> you<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.850> see<00:02:49.090> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
pretty cool because you can see the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.920 
pretty cool because you can see the
functions<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.890> how<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.330> signals<00:02:52.330> work<00:02:52.600> and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
functions of how the signals work and

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.780 
functions of how the signals work and
everything<00:02:53.260> like<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:53.580> anyways<00:02:54.580> I'll

Italy very good quality knowing that or

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.570 
Italy very good quality knowing that or
thinking<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.440> it'll<00:03:59.770> just<00:04:00.510> simply<00:04:01.510> bolt<00:04:01.870> on

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
thinking that it'll just simply bolt on

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.460 
thinking that it'll just simply bolt on
to<00:04:03.580> the<00:04:03.790> shaft<00:04:04.270> of<00:04:04.570> the<00:04:04.810> steering<00:04:05.020> column<00:04:05.380> and

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.460 
to minority steering wheel I did not
know<00:04:08.080> that

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
know that

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.650
