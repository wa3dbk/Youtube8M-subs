00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
line at the bottom now you're ready to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.260 
line at the bottom now you're ready to
add<00:01:50.830> three<00:01:51.830> plus<00:01:52.070> two<00:01:52.100> is<00:01:52.340> five

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
add three plus two is five

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.219 
add three plus two is five
so<00:01:53.810> put<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.080> five<00:01:54.350> below<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.770> line<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.840> one<00:01:57.050> in

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
so put a five below the line the one in

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.870 
so put a five below the line the one in
the<00:01:57.320> tens<00:01:57.560> place<00:01:57.710> has<00:01:58.160> nothing<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.670> combine

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
the tens place has nothing to combine

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.969 
the tens place has nothing to combine
with<00:01:59.300> so<00:01:59.810> bring<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:00.170> one<00:02:00.320> down<00:02:00.560> below<00:02:00.830> the

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
with so bring the one down below the

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:08.830 
with so bring the one down below the
line<00:02:02.410> the<00:02:03.410> answer<00:02:03.800> or<00:02:04.070> sum<00:02:04.399> is<00:02:04.700> 15

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:17.970 

and<00:02:09.489> those<00:02:10.489> are<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.759> basics<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.270> addition
