we<00:00:52.469> live<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.800> town<00:00:53.070> full<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.550> drug<00:00:53.820> use

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
we live in this town full of drug use

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.569 
we live in this town full of drug use
and<00:00:54.360> basically<00:00:54.870> went<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> park<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.980> we

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and basically went to the park and we

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.689 
and basically went to the park and we
figured<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.260> we<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.379> four<00:00:58.649> cameras<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
figured that we have four cameras a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.930 
figured that we have four cameras a
guitar<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:01.230> bunch<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.739> bunch<00:01:02.039> of

guitar and a bunch of a bunch of
technical<00:01:03.359> stuff<00:01:03.570> bikes<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> figured<00:01:04.890> they

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
technical stuff bikes so I figured they

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.130
