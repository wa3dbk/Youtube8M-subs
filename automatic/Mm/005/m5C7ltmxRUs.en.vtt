00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
reputation for being hard to work on

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.849 
reputation for being hard to work on
this<00:00:16.949> isn't<00:00:17.600> the<00:00:18.600> easiest<00:00:18.660> started<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.590> take

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
this isn't the easiest started to take

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.400 
this isn't the easiest started to take
out<00:00:20.100> but<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.119> not<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.449> worst<00:00:21.689> either<00:00:22.050> I've

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
out but it's not the worst either I've

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.370 
out but it's not the worst either I've
done<00:00:23.449> vehicles<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.689> been<00:00:24.720> harder<00:00:25.170> to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
done vehicles that have been harder to

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.029 
done vehicles that have been harder to
get<00:00:26.369> out<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.699> starter<00:00:27.119> than<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.769> so<00:00:28.769> if<00:00:28.890> you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
get out of starter than this so if you

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.139 
get out of starter than this so if you
have<00:00:29.220> one<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.410> bad

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
have one it's not that bad

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.389

on the bottom that I'll show you in a

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.890 
on the bottom that I'll show you in a
minute<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:43.790> here<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.240> one<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.660> grommets

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
minute this here is one of the grommets

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.030 
minute this here is one of the grommets
for<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.500> air<00:02:45.620> cleaner<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:48.470> gives<00:02:48.709> you<00:02:48.830> some

for the air cleaner that gives you some

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.560 
for the air cleaner that gives you some
idea<00:02:49.430> where<00:02:49.670> we're<00:02:49.850> at<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:52.150> these<00:02:53.150> are<00:02:53.420> your

idea where we're at and these are your

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.570 
idea where we're at and these are your
two<00:02:53.780> heater<00:02:54.110> hoses<00:02:54.380> there's<00:02:54.830> one<00:02:55.040> here<00:02:55.430> and

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
two heater hoses there's one here and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.240 
two heater hoses there's one here and
one<00:02:55.730> underneath<00:02:56.410> just<00:02:57.410> move<00:02:57.650> those<00:02:57.890> heater

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
one underneath just move those heater

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.190 
one underneath just move those heater
hoses<00:02:58.550> out<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.209> way<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.630> you'll<00:02:59.930> be<00:03:00.140> able

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
hoses out of the way and you'll be able

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.670 
hoses out of the way and you'll be able
to<00:03:00.470> see<00:03:00.970> this<00:03:01.970> bolt<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:03.170> bolt<00:03:05.140> one<00:03:06.140> way<00:03:06.320> I

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
to see this bolt and this bolt one way I

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.580 
to see this bolt and this bolt one way I
got<00:03:07.190> at<00:03:07.340> this<00:03:07.550> was<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.239> lifted<00:03:08.900> up<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.380> two

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
got at this was I lifted up the two

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.250 
got at this was I lifted up the two
heater<00:03:09.860> hoses<00:03:10.370> here<00:03:10.610> each<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:10.820> them<00:03:11.230> then<00:03:12.230> I

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
heater hoses here each of them then I

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.740 
heater hoses here each of them then I
put<00:03:13.100> my<00:03:13.280> two<00:03:13.340> inch<00:03:13.670> extension<00:03:14.180> underneath

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
put my two inch extension underneath

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.920 
put my two inch extension underneath
with<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.200> ratchet<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.940> short<00:03:16.940> socket<00:03:17.540> got<00:03:17.780> on

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
with the ratchet and short socket got on

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.470 
with the ratchet and short socket got on
there<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.170> unscrewed<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.850> it's<00:03:20.030> not<00:03:20.209> that

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
there and unscrewed it so it's not that

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.550 
there and unscrewed it so it's not that
bad

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.070 

this<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.740> another<00:03:27.070> look<00:03:27.340> at<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.990> getting<00:03:28.990> the

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
this is another look at it getting the

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:37.290 
this is another look at it getting the
second<00:03:29.530> bolt<00:03:35.070> now<00:03:36.070> we'll<00:03:36.400> jock<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.700> car<00:03:37.120> in

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
second bolt now we'll jock the car in

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.930 
second bolt now we'll jock the car in
the<00:03:37.420> air<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:38.760> unhook<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.680> cable<00:03:41.760> you'll<00:03:42.760> do

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
the air and unhook the cable you'll do

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.360 
the air and unhook the cable you'll do
it<00:03:43.030> for<00:03:43.060> two<00:03:43.360> reasons<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.650> don't<00:03:44.890> send<00:03:45.190> any

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
it for two reasons so you don't send any

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.640 
it for two reasons so you don't send any
sparks<00:03:45.850> out<00:03:46.030> when<00:03:46.209> you're<00:03:46.330> underneath<00:03:46.750> but

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
sparks out when you're underneath but

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.800 
sparks out when you're underneath but
also<00:03:47.890> by<00:03:48.280> removing<00:03:48.790> this<00:03:48.940> cable<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.480> get<00:03:49.750> a

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
also by removing this cable you get a

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.410 
also by removing this cable you get a
little<00:03:50.140> bit<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.820> you<00:03:51.820> know<00:03:51.850> you'll<00:03:52.180> gain<00:03:52.360> a

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
little bit of a you know you'll gain a

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.850 
little bit of a you know you'll gain a
couple<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:52.990> inches<00:03:53.170> of<00:03:54.060> length<00:03:55.060> in<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.450> wire

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
couple of inches of length in the wire

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.560 
couple of inches of length in the wire
when<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:57.190> get<00:03:57.400> under<00:03:57.730> tough<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.150> turn<00:03:58.360> your

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
when you get under tough to turn your

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.800 
when you get under tough to turn your
starter<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.140> remove<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.650> wires<00:04:00.540> there<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.780> a

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
starter to remove the wires there is a

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.490 
starter to remove the wires there is a
pin<00:04:02.350> along<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.830> side<00:04:03.070> where<00:04:03.400> this<00:04:04.500> wire

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
pin along the side where this wire

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.160 
pin along the side where this wire
harness<00:04:05.800> plugs<00:04:06.489> into<00:04:06.760> so<00:04:07.209> search<00:04:07.600> for<00:04:07.630> that<00:04:07.959> is

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
harness plugs into so search for that is

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.360 
harness plugs into so search for that is
on<00:04:08.350> your<00:04:08.500> car<00:04:08.770> and<00:04:08.920> just<00:04:08.950> unplug<00:04:09.459> it

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.180 

underneath<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.670> car<00:04:15.880> now<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.950> third

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
underneath the car now this is the third

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.720 
underneath the car now this is the third
wire<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.720> this<00:04:20.560> was<00:04:20.769> your<00:04:20.919> starter<00:04:21.340> harness

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
wire and this was your starter harness

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.400 
wire and this was your starter harness
here<00:04:22.000> that's<00:04:22.360> going<00:04:22.630> up<00:04:22.870> that<00:04:23.050> we<00:04:23.200> just

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
here that's going up that we just

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.790 
here that's going up that we just
unhooked<00:04:23.830> at<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.160> battery<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:26.200> there's<00:04:26.560> quite

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
unhooked at the battery so there's quite

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.250 
unhooked at the battery so there's quite
a<00:04:26.830> bit<00:04:27.040> of<00:04:27.160> room<00:04:27.310> there<00:04:30.030> my<00:04:31.030> camera<00:04:31.540> wouldn't

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
a bit of room there my camera wouldn't

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.620 
a bit of room there my camera wouldn't
focus<00:04:32.530> on<00:04:32.919> this<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:33.130> guess<00:04:33.430> shot<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.910> too<00:04:34.060> fast

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
focus on this I guess shot it too fast

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.170 
focus on this I guess shot it too fast
I<00:04:34.660> don't<00:04:34.960> know<00:04:35.140> but<00:04:35.440> once<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.610> starter<00:04:37.060> is

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
I don't know but once the starter is

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.920 
I don't know but once the starter is
pulled<00:04:37.479> back<00:04:37.750> let<00:04:38.470> it<00:04:38.590> fall<00:04:38.919> on<00:04:39.160> its<00:04:39.400> side<00:04:39.930> kind

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
pulled back let it fall on its side kind

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.909 
pulled back let it fall on its side kind
of<00:04:41.080> like<00:04:41.850> it<00:04:42.850> was<00:04:43.030> pointing<00:04:43.510> up<00:04:43.720> and<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.710> just

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
of like it was pointing up and I just

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.880 
of like it was pointing up and I just
rolled<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.430> down<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:46.169> then<00:04:47.169> you<00:04:47.320> can<00:04:47.470> see<00:04:47.710> the

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
rolled it down and then you can see the

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.580 
rolled it down and then you can see the
two<00:04:48.100> nuts<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.700> have<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:49.120> unscrew<00:04:49.470> there<00:04:50.470> are

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
two nuts you have to unscrew there are

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.800 
two nuts you have to unscrew there are
three<00:04:50.950> but<00:04:51.190> just<00:04:51.400> take<00:04:51.580> two<00:04:51.850> take<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.360> big<00:04:52.570> one

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
three but just take two take the big one

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.120 
three but just take two take the big one
that's<00:04:53.140> on<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.440> bottom<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:55.240> little<00:04:55.510> one

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
that's on the bottom and the little one

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.430 
that's on the bottom and the little one
just<00:04:57.130> unscrew<00:04:57.610> those<00:04:57.850> two<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:58.419> lift<00:04:59.169> this

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
just unscrew those two and lift this

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.339 
just unscrew those two and lift this
plastic<00:05:00.100> piece<00:05:00.340> off

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.730 

once<00:05:05.979> I<00:05:06.159> spit<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.610> starter<00:05:07.059> wires<00:05:07.569> off<00:05:07.960> i<00:05:08.319> I

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
once I spit the starter wires off i I

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.309 
once I spit the starter wires off i I
just<00:05:08.889> drug<00:05:09.460> it<00:05:09.610> out<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:09.879> hole<00:05:10.089> and<00:05:10.960> now<00:05:11.080> here's
