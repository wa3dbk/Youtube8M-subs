the design but I think it's absolutely
brilliant<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.990> would<00:01:13.140> probably<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.860> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
brilliant and it would probably be a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.310 
brilliant and it would probably be a
winner<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.909> car<00:01:15.270> shows<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.930> were<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.170> do

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
look more aggressive it would probably

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.300 
look more aggressive it would probably
be<00:02:26.519> really<00:02:27.299> it<00:02:28.170> wouldn't<00:02:28.500> be<00:02:28.709> too<00:02:28.890> expensive
