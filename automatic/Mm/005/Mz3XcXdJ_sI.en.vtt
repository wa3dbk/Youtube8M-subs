00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
into my layers panel and I've renamed

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.150 
into my layers panel and I've renamed
that<00:00:29.490> layer<00:00:29.910> from<00:00:30.660> massing<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.529> blocking

alright<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.510> am<00:00:33.960> at<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> point<00:00:34.320> where<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.040> have

alright so I am at a point where I have

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.020 
alright so I am at a point where I have

workbench making them 10 inches deep
instead<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.309> 8<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.230> adds<00:00:58.469> two<00:00:59.370> inches

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
instead of 8 so that adds two inches

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.119 
instead of 8 so that adds two inches
each<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.030> four<00:01:00.239> inches<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.379> I've<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.920> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
each or four inches so I've at this

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.320 
each or four inches so I've at this
point<00:01:02.399> I've<00:01:02.579> separated<00:01:02.850> them<00:01:03.799> and<00:01:05.330> continue

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
point I've separated them and continue

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.630 
point I've separated them and continue
to<00:01:06.420> hold<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.990> them<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.350> am<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> point<00:01:08.310> where

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to hold on to them I am at a point where

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.010 
to hold on to them I am at a point where
I<00:01:08.670> am<00:01:09.150> going<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> go<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> different

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
I am going to go in a different

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.410 
I am going to go in a different
direction<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> design<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.939> again<00:01:12.210> with

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
direction with the design but again with

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.980 
direction with the design but again with
blocking<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.250> easy<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.790> continue<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
blocking this is easy to continue the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.390 
blocking this is easy to continue the
only<00:01:16.229> way<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.070> an<00:01:17.189> awesome

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
only way this is going to be an awesome

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.450 
only way this is going to be an awesome
rolling<00:01:18.000> toolbox<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:19.890> detail<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
rolling toolbox is if I really detail it

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.480 
rolling toolbox is if I really detail it
right<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.150> very<00:01:21.479> functional<00:01:22.110> now<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
right and get it very functional now it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.219 
right and get it very functional now it
may<00:01:23.790> look<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.119> I've<00:01:24.509> done<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> bunch<00:01:25.020> of

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
may look like I've done a bunch of

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.590 
may look like I've done a bunch of
detailing<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> really<00:01:27.000> haven't

instead of blocking up they they do have

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.550 
instead of blocking up they they do have
a<00:01:41.400> little<00:01:41.579> bit<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.880> detail<00:01:42.240> they<00:01:43.110> won't<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
a little bit of detail they won't be the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.870 
a little bit of detail they won't be the
final<00:01:43.890> version<00:01:43.920> I'll<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.549> doing<00:01:44.790> the

final version I'll be doing the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.969 
final version I'll be doing the
detailing<00:01:45.270> later<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> few<00:01:46.649> parts

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.970 
little more room so that's a using the
scale<00:03:50.910> tool<00:03:50.940> will<00:03:51.510> really<00:03:51.840> help<00:03:52.080> if<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.770> want

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
scale tool will really help if you want

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.580 
scale tool will really help if you want
to<00:03:53.070> just<00:03:53.340> sort<00:03:53.490> of<00:03:53.640> test<00:03:53.880> sizes<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.720> again<00:03:55.560> I

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
to just sort of test sizes and again I

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.470 
to just sort of test sizes and again I
made<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:55.950> copy<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.550> these<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:56.970> these<00:03:57.120> can<00:03:57.360> be

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
made a copy of these so these can be

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.790 
made a copy of these so these can be
deleted<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.050> I<00:03:58.140> still<00:03:58.410> have<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.709> original

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
deleted and I still have the original

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.949 
deleted and I still have the original
and<00:03:59.400> one<00:03:59.820> other<00:03:59.940> thing<00:04:00.209> we<00:04:00.330> used<00:04:00.540> last<00:04:00.750> time

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
and one other thing we used last time

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.600 
and one other thing we used last time
but<00:04:01.320> it'll<00:04:01.890> reveal<00:04:03.980> some<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.160> issues<00:04:05.490> you

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
but it'll reveal some of the issues you

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.960 
but it'll reveal some of the issues you
could<00:04:05.820> run<00:04:06.000> into<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.630> took<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.970> longer

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
could run into I took the longer

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.270 
could run into I took the longer
sawhorses<00:04:09.570> that<00:04:09.900> are<00:04:10.020> custom<00:04:10.470> made<00:04:10.650> for<00:04:11.070> the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
sawhorses that are custom made for the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.320 
sawhorses that are custom made for the
POC<00:04:11.880> workbench<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:13.050> put<00:04:13.290> them<00:04:13.440> in<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.860> end

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
POC workbench and I put them in to end

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.840 
POC workbench and I put them in to end
inside<00:04:15.330> of<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:16.350> garage<00:04:16.920> that<00:04:17.549> allowed<00:04:18.390> me<00:04:18.750> to

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
inside of the garage that allowed me to

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.760 
inside of the garage that allowed me to
put<00:04:20.000> these<00:04:20.440> taller<00:04:21.460> but<00:04:22.460> narrower<00:04:23.770> sawhorses

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
put these taller but narrower sawhorses

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.220 
put these taller but narrower sawhorses
in<00:04:24.980> a<00:04:25.070> box<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:26.060> that<00:04:26.090> I<00:04:26.240> could<00:04:26.510> make<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.900> Box<00:04:27.110> a

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
in a box so that I could make the Box a

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.490 
in a box so that I could make the Box a
little<00:04:27.290> shallower<00:04:27.860> well<00:04:28.580> as<00:04:28.790> I<00:04:28.940> got<00:04:29.150> busy<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.900> if

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
little shallower well as I got busy I if

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.030 
little shallower well as I got busy I if
I<00:04:30.710> click<00:04:31.010> on<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:32.230> x-ray<00:04:33.230> tool<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.710> can<00:04:33.830> see

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
I click on the x-ray tool you can see

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.420 
I click on the x-ray tool you can see
that<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.310> left<00:04:34.670> the<00:04:34.850> box<00:04:35.330> as<00:04:35.750> deep<00:04:36.200> as<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:37.100> needed

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
that I left the box as deep as I needed

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.180 
that I left the box as deep as I needed
it<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.790> house<00:04:38.510> those<00:04:38.900> longer<00:04:39.290> horses<00:04:39.770> so

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
it to house those longer horses so

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.920 
it to house those longer horses so
there's<00:04:40.490> a<00:04:40.550> bunch<00:04:40.790> of<00:04:40.910> space<00:04:41.210> that<00:04:41.630> I'm

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
there's a bunch of space that I'm

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.900 
there's a bunch of space that I'm
wasting<00:04:42.260> right<00:04:42.740> now<00:04:42.920> so<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.220> can<00:04:43.460> fix<00:04:43.700> that

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
wasting right now so I can fix that

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.600 
wasting right now so I can fix that
quickly<00:04:44.390> I'll<00:04:44.660> just<00:04:45.200> grab<00:04:45.500> my<00:04:45.580> tape<00:04:46.580> measure

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
quickly I'll just grab my tape measure

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.020 
quickly I'll just grab my tape measure
tool<00:04:47.180> type<00:04:48.110> in<00:04:48.320> thirty<00:04:48.680> point<00:04:49.070> seven<00:04:49.520> five<00:04:49.670> and

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
tool type in thirty point seven five and

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.870 
tool type in thirty point seven five and
now<00:04:50.750> I<00:04:50.780> can<00:04:51.200> go<00:04:51.320> into<00:04:51.500> this<00:04:51.970> select<00:04:52.970> that<00:04:53.240> face

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
now I can go into this select that face

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.790 
now I can go into this select that face
push-pull<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.690> just<00:04:57.050> snap<00:04:57.380> right<00:04:57.590> through

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
push-pull and just snap right through

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.060 
push-pull and just snap right through
that<00:04:57.890> line<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:59.170> that<00:05:00.170> quick<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:00.740> could<00:05:00.890> see

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
that line and that quick you could see

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.840 
that line and that quick you could see
how<00:05:01.220> much<00:05:01.370> space<00:05:01.820> I<00:05:02.890> was<00:05:03.890> wasting<00:05:04.370> there<00:05:04.580> and

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
how much space I was wasting there and

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.250 
how much space I was wasting there and
then<00:05:05.450> as<00:05:05.600> I<00:05:05.890> turned<00:05:06.890> back<00:05:07.130> on<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.990> x-ray<00:05:08.990> tool

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
then as I turned back on the x-ray tool

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.250 
then as I turned back on the x-ray tool
you<00:05:09.740> can<00:05:09.920> see<00:05:10.130> here<00:05:10.580> there's<00:05:11.090> a<00:05:11.210> space<00:05:11.660> in<00:05:11.690> here

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
you can see here there's a space in here

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.470 
you can see here there's a space in here
that<00:05:12.560> is<00:05:12.890> quite<00:05:13.220> large<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.880> I<00:05:13.940> might<00:05:14.180> want<00:05:14.210> to

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
that is quite large and I might want to

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.570 
that is quite large and I might want to
be<00:05:14.570> able<00:05:14.780> to<00:05:14.870> use<00:05:15.110> that<00:05:15.410> I<00:05:15.620> may<00:05:16.160> build<00:05:16.460> a

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
be able to use that I may build a

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.100 
be able to use that I may build a
cabinet<00:05:17.000> in<00:05:17.120> there<00:05:17.300> that<00:05:17.480> comes<00:05:17.660> out<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:17.870> the

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
cabinet in there that comes out to the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.190 
cabinet in there that comes out to the
face<00:05:18.290> we'll<00:05:18.710> see<00:05:18.950> that's<00:05:19.540> that's<00:05:20.540> the<00:05:20.960> point

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
face we'll see that's that's the point

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.040 
face we'll see that's that's the point
of<00:05:21.500> this<00:05:21.950> blocking<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:22.970> testing<00:05:23.600> things<00:05:23.870> out

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
of this blocking and testing things out

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.680 
of this blocking and testing things out
and<00:05:24.320> one<00:05:24.800> more<00:05:25.010> thing<00:05:25.220> if<00:05:25.460> I<00:05:25.610> I<00:05:25.640> did<00:05:26.120> model<00:05:26.570> up

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
and one more thing if I I did model up

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.170 
and one more thing if I I did model up
the<00:05:26.840> trailer<00:05:27.320> accurately<00:05:28.070> so<00:05:28.310> if<00:05:28.400> I<00:05:28.490> want<00:05:29.090> to

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
the trailer accurately so if I want to

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.580 
the trailer accurately so if I want to
see<00:05:29.330> how<00:05:29.480> things<00:05:29.720> are<00:05:29.870> working<00:05:30.050> out<00:05:30.260> I'll<00:05:30.410> turn

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
see how things are working out I'll turn

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.400 
see how things are working out I'll turn
on<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:30.830> walls<00:05:31.100> and<00:05:31.630> you<00:05:32.630> can<00:05:32.810> see<00:05:33.110> that

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
on the walls and you can see that

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.270 
on the walls and you can see that
because<00:05:34.370> I<00:05:34.400> accounted<00:05:35.180> for<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:36.320> spring<00:05:36.800> here

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
because I accounted for the spring here

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.360 
because I accounted for the spring here
that<00:05:37.790> lifts<00:05:38.690> up<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.840> ramp<00:05:39.230> door<00:05:39.530> even<00:05:40.220> though

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
that lifts up the ramp door even though

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.780 
that lifts up the ramp door even though
the<00:05:41.180> sawhorse<00:05:41.990> box<00:05:42.530> fits<00:05:42.950> inside<00:05:43.310> of<00:05:43.520> where

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
the sawhorse box fits inside of where

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.870 
the sawhorse box fits inside of where
the<00:05:43.910> opening<00:05:44.300> is<00:05:44.510> this<00:05:45.550> spring<00:05:46.550> will

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
the opening is this spring will

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.680 
the opening is this spring will
interfere<00:05:47.510> with<00:05:48.700> getting<00:05:49.700> these<00:05:50.060> horses<00:05:50.450> out

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
interfere with getting these horses out

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.780 
interfere with getting these horses out
I<00:05:50.900> have<00:05:51.020> to<00:05:51.140> consider<00:05:51.530> that<00:05:51.830> so<00:05:52.190> that's<00:05:52.580> the

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
I have to consider that so that's the

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.790 
I have to consider that so that's the
advantage<00:05:53.090> of<00:05:53.510> modeling<00:05:54.140> up<00:05:54.290> your<00:05:54.470> space

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
advantage of modeling up your space

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.270 
advantage of modeling up your space
accurately<00:05:55.640> and<00:05:56.230> continuing<00:05:57.230> to<00:05:57.500> look<00:05:58.130> at

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
accurately and continuing to look at
