Here's a problem most people have with their Slim PlayStation 2.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.260
When they close the case, the game doesn't load.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.940
But, if you notice, if you push down on the case at around right here...

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.020
...the game WILL load.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.680
And then as soon as you lift your finger off, it doesn't load anymore.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.020
So, what's wrong with it?

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.540
It's not the laser, it's not the disc, it's not any internal wiring.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.700
It's actually the case.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.340
Let me show you how to fix it.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.320
First, you're going to remove all six of these tabs with a small knife

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.540
and then remove the 6 Phillips Head Screws that are underneath.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.460
Now that we have the screws on the bottom out, we can remove the top part.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.060
Just lift up, and kind of back,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.140
Now let's zoom in so I can show you what parts are actually causing the problem.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.940
It's going to be this little black thing right here.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.540
This little black knob is a push thingy that basically the case has a stick on it when you close it (the lid) it pushes it down.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.480
And that's what makes it start.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.680
But of course, the case is so loose, that it doesn't push it down anymore.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.320
Also on the front part, is the other one.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.180
There's a spot right here that pushes down as well.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.320
But that's not the problem. It's the one on the back.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.940
As you can see, if I put my finger down on this back button, and this front button,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.940
the disc starts to spin.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.840
But then when I let go of the back one, it doesn't spin.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.260
As you can see on the back of the case, there's this little peg that comes down right there.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.380
That's not pushing the button down enough. The case is too weak.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.660
Or it's too old and it just won't click down enough.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.980
That's why whenever you push down on it, it pushes it down and makes the thing spin.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.600
So, what exactly are we going to use to fix this problem?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.760
(Ducktape Enters)

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.940
What else?

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.820
That's right! We're going to tape it down, and make it stay down so it doesn't have this problem anymore.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.400
So how much do we need?

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.400
Just about that much.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.800
You can tear it off with your fingers. But it's a lot better with scissors because you only need just a very small piece.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.340
Just enough to cover up that button.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.580
That ought to do it!

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.240
Here's the little spot right there.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.440
What you want to do is take your piece of tape...

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.780
...if it's too big you might want to trim it down. Which of course, mine is.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.140
There we go!

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.900
Just put it on there the best you can.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.560
Of course I'm not doing to well.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.440
I've got these handy pair of Tweezers.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.860
Just kind of do that so that it stays on there.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.020
And just push it down with your finger.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.920
Ta-Da?!?!

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.260
Okay, I have it plugged in and I have the tape on. Just to show you, I'm going to push down on this front button.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.640
Now let's put the case back together.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.280
Now that we have it all back together, I'm going to show you...

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.340
...that it DOES work!

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.680
All it took was just a little sliver of Duck Tape.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.840
And just to give you some more assurance...

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.460
It doesn't skip at all!

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.420
So I hope you found this helpful.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.320
Tell your friends!
