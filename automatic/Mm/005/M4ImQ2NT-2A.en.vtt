was just so cute you can wear this with
so<00:02:43.530> many<00:02:43.740> things<00:02:43.980> because<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.520> so<00:02:44.610> simple<00:02:44.940> so

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
so many things because it's so simple so

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.260 
so many things because it's so simple so
for<00:02:45.870> example<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.260> wear<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.680> with<00:02:46.920> like

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
for example I wear this with like

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.200 
for example I wear this with like
high-waisted<00:02:48.270> jeans<00:02:48.330> shorts<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.700> no<00:02:50.700> you

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
high-waisted jeans shorts and no you

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.120 
high-waisted jeans shorts and no you
could<00:02:51.360> throw<00:02:51.600> on<00:02:51.630> necklace<00:02:52.200> or<00:02:52.620> put<00:02:52.830> on<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.100> a
