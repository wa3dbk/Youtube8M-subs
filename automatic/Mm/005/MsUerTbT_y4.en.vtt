00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 and it has never happened to them that when 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.970
 they just cut the hair they do not find 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.210
 how to accommodate the good at least I have 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.210
 hair 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.070
 hi how are you I'm mateo and I know 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.840
 many of you this week are very 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.490
 excited because they are going to return to 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.040
 school at hand activating 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.420
 and it's that Colombia we did not spend 11 years 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.189
 stuck in an educational institution 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.410
 learning everything we have in the 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.150
 book unfortunately everything that is 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.130
 in books not necessarily not 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.260
 we need in the real world is more 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.360
 many of the things that are in the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.770
 real world we learn them eating 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.879
 fuck shit these are the things that 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.400
 we really want to learn is from 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.079
 college really really we 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.130
 they taught many emotions and many 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.130
 numbers and in the pound 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.130
 I would have deeply appreciated 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.960
 first reviewed was when calculating in a 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.910
 quick and simple equation for 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.950
 city ​​of bogota in a rush hour the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.140
 departure time and arrival time at 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.450
 work in an equation in the notebook 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.280
 the car had had no transportation 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.890
 semaphores I saw a lord empire of 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.750
 some the voice updating the step I'm going 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.300
 to a hole size bogota 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.940
 neither gasoline was so expensive 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.890
 we went back a few pesos and living adding and 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.930
 subtracting multiplying taking out without 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.030
 is my capital odds 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.520
 amount of asset and definitive liability 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 that we learned to have and to differentiate already 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.990
 set for your business to be fruitful 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.210
 but they never taught us how to trace the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.020
 ground and is that if the minimum wage is 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.660
 in 650 go the 70 and something 80 and something 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.100
 because from there it's not going to go up yet 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.250
 we know how to trace that salary 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.130
 really for 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.380
 they showed me the elements of the table 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.820
 periodic the arcana the aquino the a 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.360
 that we get angry and some 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.030
 continents and the things that chemistry 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.590
 that one has not remembered anything see 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.270
 play taught us elements of the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.340
 periodic table had to apply to 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.260
 a pot with rice so that our 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.060
 salty a little we were taught to do 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.740
 soap because at home because it's that 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.240
 go out and buy the native gravel the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.580
 amount of things they do not need to 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.380
 making soap is more expensive to go buy a 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.570
 soap bar of my personal idols 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.480
 that taught us how to go from 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.459
 solid to liquid and kilo to gaseous to zero 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.080
 they are solid multiplications and 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.810
 divisions of the states of matter 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.590
 there he taught us to pass it and burned 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.030
 edible edible by not getting fat 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.180
 that I would have liked to learn in 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.459
 chemistry not two years learning to a 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.920
 amount of formulation a piece of paper and the 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.390
 box for lime that the camera already says another 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.570
 amount of things that I do not remember 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.400
 thank God they taught us how not to 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.410
 have a corrientazo you know that 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.840
 we change the need for Christmas as 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.000
 unscrew a bulb that breaks from the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.709
 rosette without touching the current and without 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.269
 have arica how to accommodate the things of 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.920
 the particular way pc so much of 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.690
 blender I have to buy so that the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.070
 Centrifugal dam is not so big that 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.600
 make everything you have inside the 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.670
 blender sticks by the kitchen that 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.530
 have to wash the head that's physical 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.500
 mingo and that did not show us ost in 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.780
 the school 11 years of my life those 11 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.420
 years of my life the father taught me 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.150
 Ours is 23 art and 5 more sentences 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.160
 respected the sacraments commandments 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.780
 do many church drawings and do 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.430
 many types of saints and do many 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.590
 promises of friendship something that we do not 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.590
 taught and that really works already 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.090
 very much is that a small knife 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.010
 the prayers that one has to 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.680
 answer every time the father is the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.030
 mass a large course of 11 years and it is 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.160
 learn to understand 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.690
 That's really what you need 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.020
 region up to the neck and lose as they 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.420
 learn what I know that is pedagogy we 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.130
 they taught things like for example the step 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.390
 they eat worms and worm it 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.300
 eat the chicken and life will be eaten 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.000
 woman and woman eats it man 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.500
 also and man eat it 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.640
 taxes and taxes with 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.940
 government and the government eats them in 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.860
 peace because that would not have prevented both 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.930
 so many tears shed 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.120
 mathematical arithmetic problems 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.310
 sentimental social and psychological 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.980
 to start a bitch a bitch a 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.740
 cat one the cat and one human but in 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.480
 a chair of hardware software and not 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.430
 if you want to learn the computer and 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.110
 turn off the computer and enter excel and 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.049
 enter the power point and extract the 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.750
 As publisher and enter program 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.880
 microsoft to no longer taught us how 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.560
 do to fix the portable pinche 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.420
 when it is damaged or violated by is 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.220
 doing page and do when the 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.750
 face of the white screen when 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.220
 the battery discharges quickly when it 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.740
 overheating to the cell 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.540
 or falls to the pool itself to the bathroom to 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.370
 what are all the extra buttons 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.380
 different to turn on and off in the 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.690
 washing machine or in the microwave otherwise 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.920
 technologically one could thank the 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.920
 good purpose of shopping centers and 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.890
 needs 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.180
 I think it's technology we lost a lot 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.440
 time in equal offers us the 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.330
 dimensions of a soccer field of 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.250
 a planalto micro soccer field is 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.530
 the basketball area in intensity 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.180
 diameter of a soccer ball of a 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.070
 basketball pal another jordi 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.930
 a tennis ball was not taught to us 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.000
 things that would really serve as 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.770
 example sprints athletics more for 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.270
 get to transmilenio at the moment 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.040
 before riding at the door or 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.840
 learn to tank to reach the 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.060
 bus or can leave the bus change 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.400
 basketball porte with two martial arts 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.810
 or personal defense so we can 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.460
 really when thieves arrive if 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.830
 they can not steal our black belts 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.250
 they serve much more in this country than 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.830
 learn to throw in third band with 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.270
 topics that would have taught us in that 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.460
 of the coexistence of society the 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.020
 community to dodge people to earthquakes 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.849
 to above all things 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.860
 and they are waiting for the car you are not going to 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.900
 know how much liquor should be taken in 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.520
 a work meeting at what time is 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.500
 prudent to hold a party if it is 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.090
 boring so as not to look bad if they had 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.979
 taught too but do not have to 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.409
 send text messages at 3 o'clock 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.599
 morning in used in deranged and the ex 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:52.879
 he not only learned one at the tip of water 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.620
 reach that level account they submitted the 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.330
 fingers if we were isolated in the 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.039
 machine we also saw the first one comes 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.270
 computer I do not know also how many 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.460
 Sometimes an attempt has been made to send a message 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.229
 of text and it turns up one thing 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.110
 completely different from what it says in 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.699
 actually we use these two fingers and 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.349
 those two fingers get European to the 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.780
 spacebar in this if they are from the 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:15.440
 others at that mph 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:19.060
 hosaka lp or touch typing in the 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.060
 new generation that 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.550
 male 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.010
 You can create a new life from 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.330
 the union of the sperm and the ovum but 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.480
 nobody spoke that there is something called 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.520
 excitement chemistry and point that there is talk 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.530
 of lubricant walks and they taught the 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.210
 keep for it because life is 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.140
 complicated but only when 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.840
 we are at school we do not give ourselves 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.840
 account when we are outside there are friends 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:51.379
 we have to do something to put the 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.379
 education of this country 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.840
 so much taxes to have to eat 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.940
 shit when they do not come out does not give us is that 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.940
 they are fine does not give us
