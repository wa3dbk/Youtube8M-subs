00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.730

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.539
 another chapter more let's go to the mess 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.650
 is chapter number eight and for that 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.960
 let's use the lt or the l2 and the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.910
 right joystick in each and every one of 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.910
 these celebrations we are going there 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.740
 the heat 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.039
 good if you think for all these 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.870
 celebrations of this chapter there is no 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.659
 to use more than the right joystick 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.699
 so it's good then how is it 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.409
 same for xbox than for playstation3 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.210
 Well, look at what saves me, I'm not going to 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.920
 put the control of playstation 3 is worth 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.259
 I'll just put the xbox but good that 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.880
 you know that it is exactly the same 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.229
 Sliding sideways gets 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.330
 keeping the lte pressed or the l 2 and 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.630
 we keep the right joystick towards 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.630
 down 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.280
 fall round how big this celebration 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.210
 the good truth this one gets 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.500
 keeping lt or l2 pressed and we throw 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.259
 the joystick 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.459
 the right joystick to the left and 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.459
 we keep it in that position 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.530

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.490

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.750
 we give two touches to the right joystick the 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.050
 first down and the second one 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.050

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.079

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.470

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.470

 celebrations that I get to me by 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.240
 nature the truth is that I like a 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.980
 little the typical of raul not pointing 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.200

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.420
 get hold the delight or l2 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.160

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.140

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.140
 right and the second one to the left 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.420

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.090
 we commented in previous chapters 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.860

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.500

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.250
 agile 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.260
 let's keep the lt or l2 pressed and 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.090
 then we give two touches to the 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.090
 joystick both up 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.590
