00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.520 
Vidal Pogba Marchisio very very
dangerous<00:05:39.210> team<00:05:39.690> but<00:05:40.200> when<00:05:40.320> you're<00:05:40.410> gonna

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
dangerous team but when you're gonna

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.440 
dangerous team but when you're gonna
make<00:05:40.740> mistakes<00:05:40.890> like<00:05:41.280> that<00:05:41.370> Montoya<00:05:41.970> running

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
make mistakes like that Montoya running

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.290 
make mistakes like that Montoya running
straight<00:05:42.900> on<00:05:43.110> through<00:05:43.500> and<00:05:43.740> we<00:05:44.669> are<00:05:44.820> managed

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
straight on through and we are managed

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.030 
straight on through and we are managed
to<00:05:45.390> take<00:05:45.600> the<00:05:45.780> lead<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:46.260> i<00:05:46.470> think<00:05:46.680> it<00:05:46.830> was<00:05:46.979> i

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
to take the lead and i think it was i

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.060 
to take the lead and i think it was i
think<00:05:47.430> that<00:05:47.550> actually<00:05:47.910> was<00:05:48.150> Montoya<00:05:49.140> scoring

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
think that actually was Montoya scoring

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.330 
think that actually was Montoya scoring
on<00:05:50.310> his<00:05:50.610> debut<00:05:50.880> but<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:51.540> know<00:05:51.720> how<00:05:52.440> strong<00:05:52.979> this

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
on his debut but I know how strong this

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.070 
on his debut but I know how strong this
guy's<00:05:53.669> team<00:05:54.000> is<00:05:54.210> on<00:05:54.240> the<00:05:54.450> attack<00:05:54.570> and<00:05:54.960> when

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
guy's team is on the attack and when

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.380 
guy's team is on the attack and when
you've<00:05:55.229> got<00:05:55.350> Gomez<00:05:55.919> running<00:05:56.640> at<00:05:56.880> yet<00:05:57.120> and<00:05:57.300> the

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
you've got Gomez running at yet and the

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.210 
you've got Gomez running at yet and the

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
the far corner even though he's playing

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.719

seed CDM he does seem to get open the
attack<00:06:27.030> a<00:06:27.240> lot<00:06:27.450> but<00:06:27.840> the<00:06:27.930> game<00:06:28.140> was<00:06:28.380> not<00:06:28.590> done

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
attack a lot but the game was not done

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.210 
attack a lot but the game was not done
as<00:06:29.280> you<00:06:29.430> can<00:06:29.550> see<00:06:29.729> there<00:06:30.060> we<00:06:30.240> have<00:06:31.220> Gorman's

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
as you can see there we have Gorman's

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.400 
as you can see there we have Gorman's
running<00:06:32.460> on<00:06:32.580> through<00:06:32.790> again<00:06:33.120> very<00:06:33.690> strong

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
running on through again very strong

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.320 
running on through again very strong
pearcy<00:06:34.979> player<00:06:35.160> whips<00:06:35.460> it<00:06:35.640> straight<00:06:35.970> in<00:06:36.090> and<00:06:36.270> a

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
pearcy player whips it straight in and a

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.780 
pearcy player whips it straight in and a
bicycle<00:06:36.990> kick<00:06:37.280> does<00:06:38.280> equalize<00:06:38.880> it<00:06:38.910> up<00:06:39.210> in<00:06:39.450> the

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
bicycle kick does equalize it up in the

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.390 
bicycle kick does equalize it up in the
87th<00:06:40.540> minute<00:06:40.720> I<00:06:41.020> think<00:06:41.500> this<00:06:41.650> does<00:06:42.040> actually

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
87th minute I think this does actually

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.140 
87th minute I think this does actually
take<00:06:42.970> it<00:06:43.150> to<00:06:43.270> extra<00:06:43.600> time<00:06:43.870> as<00:06:44.140> well<00:06:45.000> so<00:06:46.000> we

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
take it to extra time as well so we

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.270 
take it to extra time as well so we
start<00:06:46.450> off<00:06:46.540> extra<00:06:46.990> time<00:06:47.230> with<00:06:47.830> a<00:06:47.860> little

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
start off extra time with a little

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.980 
start off extra time with a little
glitch<00:06:48.550> I've<00:06:48.820> been<00:06:48.940> practicing<00:06:49.600> for<00:06:49.630> this

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990 
glitch I've been practicing for this

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.010 
glitch I've been practicing for this
series<00:06:50.260> and<00:06:50.770> unfortunately<00:06:51.670> it<00:06:52.210> did<00:06:52.600> work

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
series and unfortunately it did work

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.690 
series and unfortunately it did work
this<00:06:53.320> time<00:06:53.590> we<00:06:53.770> managed<00:06:54.010> to<00:06:54.100> skin<00:06:54.490> it<00:06:54.520> up

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
this time we managed to skin it up

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.000 
this time we managed to skin it up
slight<00:06:55.360> into<00:06:55.630> the<00:06:55.720> far<00:06:55.960> corner<00:06:55.990> and<00:06:56.560> give

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010 
slight into the far corner and give

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.270 
slight into the far corner and give
ourselves<00:06:57.160> the<00:06:57.580> lead<00:06:57.820> I<00:06:58.060> was<00:06:58.270> so<00:06:58.600> happy<00:06:58.870> that
