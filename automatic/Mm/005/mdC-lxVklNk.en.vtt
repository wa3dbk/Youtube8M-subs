00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.469
 b 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.740
 How do they say 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.810
 Goalkeepers are somehow different 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.869
 Outsiders paradise birds often close to madness 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.259
 either good in the years or in the years next to it 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:18.609
 as masters of the skies 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.849
 the best friends of the round ball 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.069
 World Champion they were therefore started in the tournament 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.069
 the predicate itself earned only a few 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.670
 and above all 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.760
 Gianluigi Buffon the king of all keeper 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.760
 the perfect number one in the world champion cast 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.520
 he is not a fool 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.920
 no book Fowler as they say in Italy 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.950
 but far away in his game 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.370
 instinctively with a charismatic self-confidence 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.750
 the beamman go with the goalkeeper 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.470
 a gift for Italy 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.570
 outstanding in the six-meter room 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.340
 responsive on the line 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.520
 a goal until the final 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.800
 and that's just because his own team is probably the one and why 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.110
 the most expensive goalkeeper in the world in the end by his own teammate 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.300
 beaten 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.690
 the boot had the matching gloves and users on one 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.690
 more than worthy successors 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.810
 Jens Lehmann the German number one 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.490
 Supporter of the legend that a German goalkeeper always has to win 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.160
 he wanted to put himself in the right light 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
 and the keeper of the hearts 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.250
 Lehmann the nightmare of Argentina 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.280
 managed ten minutes what one had previously thought possible 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.010
 similarly bad 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.010
 he is Germany always stands in the semifinals 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.279
 v 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:19.009
 in Germany in the collective intoxication and Lehmann the greatest 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.559
 He has already played Jens Action 1 in the 2005 English Cup Final 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:28.189
 countless political themes are tinted as Jens KAB St on Paul Scholes im 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.400
 Shootout triumphed now 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.400
 put the crown on the whole 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.499
 he jumps into the goal by George Mitchell a waiting list of Sohn's meter 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.049
 shoot makes 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.649
 the strange ones brought over 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.389
 We're just like a goalkeeper 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.849
 but a whole nation lay at his feet for the first time in his 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:48.999
 Career 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:52.289
 the record for the so often quoted football activity made it, however 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.919
 another 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.649
 Ricardo from Portugal 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.679
 three times third in English football history 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.979
 and almost captures the Portuguese dream of the title 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:03.069
 a man against a man 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.849
 In Bolton Durán make all duels think he won 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.399
 World champion was known to others but the defeated 80 great fighters 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:16.639
 had made something in the 76-year-old wm-story something never before 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.289
 someone had finished 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:19.449
 Heidelberg 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.449
 he has exclusive 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.879
 Once before, the 30-year-old was holding the Euro 2004 in the 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.249
 Quarterfinal against Nat of course England themselves the ball of the most famous 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.799
 Football League of the World hammered into the goal 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.850
 now he had become immortal for those still looking for him 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.850
 great luck sensitive transformation 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:47.760
 also a dazzling figure of the guild 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.929
 from France Fabian was testing 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:53.139
 the keeper of the world and European champion at the zenith of his career 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.879
 seemed to have arrived 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.879
 and maybe even a little bit beyond 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:05.639
 He has to thank for his international experience, and above all the 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.269
 Assistance of his prominent advocate Sun friend Zidan that the 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.679
 France's best-known bald opponent against permanent rival Grégory Coupet 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:15.539
 claim 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:19.939
 but the soon proved increasingly as an opponent and no longer as a friend 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:24.949
 his limited 183 cm height is not ideal for team spirit 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:26.949
 which united in flatter 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.949
 became increasingly a French crisis topic 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.979
 In the end she draws world champion because he relies on his comrades 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.039
 could 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.210
 1998 had been able to influence the title win even with performance 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.490
 this time his team made for one 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.490
 in a worthy finish 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:51.629
 retired early and yet actually the best goalkeeper of this World Cup at least 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.589
 say that the numbers from Pascal Zuberbühler undoubtedly belongs to the 

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:57.710
 Model athletes of the genre goalkeeper 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.710
 and is considered a tenant prototype number one 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:04.869
 Source, he can almost pinch between his fingers and his voice 

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:07.990
 that of a barker seems at least equal to it 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.300
 18 shots on goal held 18 times 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.860
 no one else succeeded in this tournament 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.210
 this unspectacular type of Smith is heading to Beady to the top of the pack 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.759
 She had already been impressed by international football 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.850
 The fan blocks seem routine and outstanding positional play 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.370
 Rowohlt first out of the Swiss Gate cheese of days gone by 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.830
 no World Cup without the colorful jarring unusual types in the leather ones 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.309
 Work gloves 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:42.400
 the so-called flycatchers 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.289
 Goalkeepers who are embarrassing and even sorry 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.319
 and who are often laughed at at a tournament at this level 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.479
 seven goals in three matches Marburg is said to be out Robin is one 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.110
 Example of pitiful closing men who are said to have one 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.110
 WM is really beautiful 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.129
 but also in football, the Olympic idea still counts 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:05.309
 is everything 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:08.290
 the best player of the last World Cup he performed again 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.590
 spectacular only on and off the court meanwhile 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:16.179
 in the small finale, one of the greatest of all times said goodbye 

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:19.179
 impressive goodbye for Olli Kahn 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.669
 when it's wet a spectacular turn 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.039
 it was a nice time to remember
