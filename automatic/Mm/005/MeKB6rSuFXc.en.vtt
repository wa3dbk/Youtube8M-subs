talk to you about our spray painting

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.720 
talk to you about our spray painting
course<00:00:06.440> when<00:00:07.440> spraying<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.950> most<00:00:08.130> important

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
course when spraying the most important

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.749 
course when spraying the most important
thing<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.230> health<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.380> safety<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.460> with<00:00:11.639> that

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
thing is health and safety and with that

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.209 
thing is health and safety and with that
in<00:00:11.910> mind<00:00:12.090> whenever<00:00:12.660> spraying<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.380> must<00:00:13.769> wear

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
in mind whenever spraying you must wear

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.760 
in mind whenever spraying you must wear
a<00:00:14.580> mask<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:16.020> would<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:16.650> would

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
a mask this would be the one we would

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.370 
a mask this would be the one we would
recommend<00:00:17.090> this<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> carbon<00:00:18.720> filter<00:00:19.410> mask

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
recommend this is a carbon filter mask

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.109 
recommend this is a carbon filter mask
after<00:00:22.380> health<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.859> safety<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.490> move<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.910> to

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
after health and safety we move on to

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.540 
after health and safety we move on to
the<00:00:24.359> masking<00:00:24.689> procedure<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:26.189> generally

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
the masking procedure and generally

the masking procedure and generally
whenever<00:00:27.269> you're<00:00:27.420> spraying<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.109> need<00:00:28.320> to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
whenever you're spraying you do need to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.290 
whenever you're spraying you do need to
mask<00:00:28.680> up<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> surrounding<00:00:29.490> areas<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.150> protect

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
mask up the surrounding areas to protect

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.420 
mask up the surrounding areas to protect
them<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> masking<00:00:32.009> machine

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
them this is a masking machine

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.310 
them this is a masking machine
we'll<00:00:32.940> use<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.510> depth<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:34.050> basically

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
we'll use this in depth just basically

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.750 
we'll use this in depth just basically
to<00:00:34.440> show<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.680> how<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.950> works<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.399> what<00:00:35.700> it

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
to show you how it works and what it

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
to show you how it works and what it
actually<00:00:35.850> does<00:00:37.820> we<00:00:38.820> will<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.120> using<00:00:39.300> two<00:00:39.600> types

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
actually does we will be using two types

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.930 
actually does we will be using two types
of<00:00:39.989> equipment<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> course<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.670> first
