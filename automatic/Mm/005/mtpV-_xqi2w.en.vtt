00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
which I have to admit I thought actually

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.309 
which I have to admit I thought actually
worked<00:05:04.729> fairly<00:05:05.210> fairly<00:05:05.449> well<00:05:05.750> in<00:05:05.990> a<00:05:06.169> sense

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
worked fairly fairly well in a sense

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.559 
worked fairly fairly well in a sense
that<00:05:06.590> it<00:05:07.009> definitely<00:05:07.550> did<00:05:07.819> kind<00:05:08.090> of<00:05:08.180> surprise

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
that it definitely did kind of surprise

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.899 
that it definitely did kind of surprise
me<00:05:08.840> now<00:05:09.199> granted<00:05:09.590> I<00:05:09.680> didn't<00:05:10.009> think<00:05:10.129> taka<00:05:10.460> died

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
me now granted I didn't think taka died

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.149 
me now granted I didn't think taka died
when<00:05:11.300> he<00:05:11.419> went<00:05:11.659> back<00:05:11.810> into<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.169> past<00:05:12.409> but<00:05:12.949> I

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
when he went back into the past but I

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:15.309 
when he went back into the past but I
definitely<00:05:13.969> thought<00:05:14.419> maybe<00:05:14.750> something<00:05:15.229> else

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:15.319 
definitely thought maybe something else

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.439 
definitely thought maybe something else
was<00:05:15.710> up<00:05:15.740> I<00:05:15.949> didn't<00:05:16.250> really<00:05:16.580> consider<00:05:16.789> the<00:05:17.240> fact

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
was up I didn't really consider the fact

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.570 
was up I didn't really consider the fact
that<00:05:17.569> he<00:05:17.810> used<00:05:18.110> his<00:05:18.590> duplicate<00:05:19.219> technique

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
that he used his duplicate technique

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.779 
that he used his duplicate technique
that<00:05:19.759> he<00:05:19.909> learned<00:05:20.240> to<00:05:20.889> pretend<00:05:21.889> that<00:05:22.370> he<00:05:22.610> had

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
that he learned to pretend that he had

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.760 
that he learned to pretend that he had
died<00:05:23.060> in<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.449> past<00:05:23.750> and<00:05:24.139> came<00:05:24.379> back<00:05:24.409> and

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
died in the past and came back and

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.170 
died in the past and came back and
follow<00:05:24.979> the<00:05:25.159> time<00:05:25.340> monster<00:05:25.699> back<00:05:25.879> into<00:05:25.909> the

sentai I mean being part of the very
first<00:06:32.719> Super<00:06:33.050> Sentai<00:06:33.379> team<00:06:33.650> it's<00:06:34.039> kind<00:06:34.400> of

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
first Super Sentai team it's kind of

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.730 
first Super Sentai team it's kind of
cool<00:06:34.759> knowing<00:06:35.569> that<00:06:35.719> he<00:06:35.810> kind<00:06:36.050> of<00:06:36.110> watches

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
cool knowing that he kind of watches

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.490 
cool knowing that he kind of watches
over<00:06:36.949> each<00:06:37.630> incarnation<00:06:38.630> of<00:06:38.779> Super<00:06:39.139> Sentai

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
over each incarnation of Super Sentai

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.970 
over each incarnation of Super Sentai
and<00:06:39.709> each

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
and each

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.190 
and each
team<00:06:40.250> that<00:06:41.030> kind<00:06:41.210> of<00:06:41.330> really<00:06:41.600> comes<00:06:41.900> around

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.200 
team that kind of really comes around

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.450 
team that kind of really comes around
and<00:06:42.320> I<00:06:42.380> think<00:06:42.560> this<00:06:42.680> is<00:06:42.740> the<00:06:42.800> one<00:06:42.950> the<00:06:43.160> few

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
and I think this is the one the few

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.220 
and I think this is the one the few
times<00:06:43.700> that<00:06:43.850> we've<00:06:43.970> really<00:06:44.210> seen<00:06:44.450> him<00:06:44.660> kind<00:06:45.200> of

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
times that we've really seen him kind of

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.990 
times that we've really seen him kind of
makes<00:06:45.440> his<00:06:45.590> presence<00:06:46.130> felt<00:06:46.370> in<00:06:46.550> the<00:06:46.640> sense<00:06:46.850> of

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
makes his presence felt in the sense of

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.030 
makes his presence felt in the sense of
letting<00:06:47.690> us<00:06:47.810> know<00:06:47.840> that<00:06:48.080> hey<00:06:48.440> I'm<00:06:48.710> watching
