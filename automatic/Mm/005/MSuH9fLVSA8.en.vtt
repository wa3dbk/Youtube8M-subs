00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
cancel that so you inject the drivers

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.679 
cancel that so you inject the drivers
into<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.600> boot<00:01:06.840> images<00:01:08.090> add<00:01:09.090> driver<00:01:10.080> package

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
into the boot images add driver package
