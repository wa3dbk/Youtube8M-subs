up<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.920> little<00:00:41.190> bit<00:00:41.309> high<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.030> we're<00:00:42.149> going

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
up just a little bit high so we're going

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.479 
up just a little bit high so we're going
to<00:00:42.329> lower<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.809> by<00:00:43.020> using<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.010> five<00:00:44.219> millimeter

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489

bolt dropping the derailleur down just a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.380 
bolt dropping the derailleur down just a
touch<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.649> right<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:52.890> we're<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.250> about<00:00:53.390> one

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
touch so right there we're at about one

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.020 
touch so right there we're at about one
and<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.629> half<00:00:54.660> millimeters<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.860> kind<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and a half millimeters I kind of like to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.319 
and a half millimeters I kind of like to
err<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.590> close<00:00:58.590> side<00:00:59.090> tighten<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.149> down

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
err on the close side tighten it down

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.299 
err on the close side tighten it down
good<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> next<00:01:01.590> step<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.190> adjust

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
good there so the next step is to adjust

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.850 
good there so the next step is to adjust
the<00:01:02.760> angle<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.539> cage<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.439> want<00:01:04.650> this

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the angle of the cage and we want this

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.520 
the angle of the cage and we want this
outer<00:01:05.369> cage<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.150> parallel<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:07.409> this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
outer cage to be parallel with this

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.050 
outer cage to be parallel with this
chain<00:01:07.830> ring<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> way<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
chain ring the way that we do that is to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.120 
chain ring the way that we do that is to
use<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> two<00:01:09.600> millimeter<00:01:09.930> allen<00:01:10.350> there's<00:01:11.070> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
use a two millimeter allen there's a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.700 
use a two millimeter allen there's a
small<00:01:11.430> set<00:01:11.729> screw<00:01:12.030> that's<00:01:12.270> deep<00:01:12.990> within<00:01:13.229> the

small set screw that's deep within the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.249 
small set screw that's deep within the
derailleur<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:15.119> accessed<00:01:15.540> right<00:01:15.930> in

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
derailleur here it's accessed right in

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.899 
derailleur here it's accessed right in
here<00:01:17.330> kind<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.420> hard<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.950> black<00:01:21.500> now

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
here kind of hard to see it's black now

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.370 
here kind of hard to see it's black now
that<00:01:23.909> presses<00:01:24.330> up<00:01:24.450> against<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> Bray's<00:01:25.110> on

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that presses up against the Bray's on

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
that presses up against the Bray's on
and<00:01:25.710> as<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.490> turn<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:27.060> you'll<00:01:27.210> start<00:01:27.509> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and as we turn it here you'll start to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.319 
and as we turn it here you'll start to
see<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:29.130> derailleur<00:01:29.579> start<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.360> kick<00:01:31.259> out

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
see the derailleur start to kick out

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.240 
see the derailleur start to kick out
we'll<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.479> stop<00:01:33.720> once<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.650> lined<00:01:34.979> up

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
we'll just stop once we get it lined up

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.249 
we'll just stop once we get it lined up
right<00:01:36.049> there

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
right there

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.440 
right there
now<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.860> important<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.759> so

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
now it's important that you do this so

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.520 
now it's important that you do this so
that<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> derailleur<00:01:40.079> has<00:01:40.229> something<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
that the derailleur has something to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.050 
that the derailleur has something to
push<00:01:40.829> off<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> when<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.460> shifts<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.939> this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
push off of when it shifts and this

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.030 
push off of when it shifts and this
adjustment<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.600> only<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:43.079> made<00:01:43.320> when<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
adjustment can only be made when the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.770 
adjustment can only be made when the
derailleur<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> smaller<00:01:45.210> chain<00:01:45.570> ring

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
derailleur is in the smaller chain ring

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.230 
derailleur is in the smaller chain ring
next<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.710> need<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.040> adjust<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.549> inner<00:01:47.759> limit

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
next we need to adjust the inner limit

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.870 
next we need to adjust the inner limit
screw<00:01:48.600> that's<00:01:49.380> right<00:01:49.979> here<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> outside

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
screw that's right here on the outside

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609 
screw that's right here on the outside
of<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> derailleur<00:01:51.390> put<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.320> our<00:01:52.470> two

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
of the derailleur put in our two

millimeter<00:01:53.100> allen<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.700> turn<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.329> until<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
millimeter allen and turn it until the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.319 
millimeter allen and turn it until the
inner<00:01:55.170> cage<00:01:55.549> gets<00:01:56.549> right<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:56.909> next<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
inner cage gets right up next to the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
inner cage gets right up next to the
chain<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:57.960> close<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.439> possible<00:01:58.500> without

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
chain as close as possible without

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.060 
chain as close as possible without
actually<00:01:59.219> touching<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.590> last<00:02:01.590> step<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.040> to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
actually touching the last step is to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.789 
actually touching the last step is to
adjust<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.759> upper<00:02:02.790> limit<00:02:03.450> that's<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.649> this

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
adjust the upper limit that's on this

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.910 
adjust the upper limit that's on this
small<00:02:05.159> screw<00:02:05.460> marked<00:02:05.729> H<00:02:06.710> we're<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:07.860> to

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
small screw marked H we're going to

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.100 
small screw marked H we're going to
bring<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.310> outer<00:02:08.819> cage<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:09.929> as

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
bring that outer cage in so that it's as

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.020 
bring that outer cage in so that it's as
close<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> chain<00:02:11.190> as<00:02:11.370> possible<00:02:11.910> without

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
close to the chain as possible without

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.410 
close to the chain as possible without
touching

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
touching

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.059 
touching
all<00:02:13.840> right<00:02:13.959> so<00:02:14.110> now<00:02:14.290> we'll<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.500> go<00:02:14.800> through

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
all right so now we'll just go through

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.949 
all right so now we'll just go through
the<00:02:15.160> shifting<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.790> just<00:02:16.780> make<00:02:16.930> sure

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
the shifting and just make sure

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.229 
the shifting and just make sure
everything's<00:02:17.530> working<00:02:17.920> right<00:02:18.000> we'll<00:02:19.000> go<00:02:19.180> to

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
everything's working right we'll go to

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.130 
everything's working right we'll go to
both<00:02:19.690> extremes<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:21.120> both<00:02:22.120> rings<00:02:22.480> make<00:02:22.930> sure

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
both extremes and both rings make sure

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:31.680 
both extremes and both rings make sure
that<00:02:23.319> it's<00:02:23.500> still<00:02:23.830> shifting<00:02:30.480> I'm<00:02:31.480> just

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
that it's still shifting I'm just

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.210 
that it's still shifting I'm just
checking<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.350> make<00:02:32.380> sure<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.800> chain<00:02:33.010> isn't

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
checking to make sure the chain isn't

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.890 
checking to make sure the chain isn't
dropping<00:02:33.520> off<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.180> inside<00:02:34.600> or<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.810> outside

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
dropping off the inside or the outside

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.510 
dropping off the inside or the outside
and<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.709> we're<00:02:35.830> still<00:02:36.040> getting<00:02:36.130> smooth

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
and that we're still getting smooth

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.240 
and that we're still getting smooth
shifts<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:37.810> one's<00:02:38.020> good<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.290> go<00:02:38.440> so

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
shifts and this one's good to go so

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.250 
shifts and this one's good to go so
