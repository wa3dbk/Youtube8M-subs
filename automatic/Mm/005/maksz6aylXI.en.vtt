00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.610
 Talk about some of the good gamers. 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.379
 You people, so personal to us today. 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.900
 is here for another video of 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.509
 redstone tutorial and today I'll show you 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.840
 For you, how to make a galley door? 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:27.119
 yes a door using only Peter's and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.400
 you can set the password for this port 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.890
 to little square you want 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.589
 Well first I made that door that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.269
 It's up to you guys, you're just putting it on. 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:38.190
 game I have got to stick to whoever 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.269
 I'll put it in my way so it 's 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.890
 just put in your neighborhood that does not have 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.579
 How to pass that I will not catch fire 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.379
 because the right setting fire my self okay but 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.329
 now if I click here and all 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.480
 hospitals have in the first of 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.640
 see what happens, you see 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.579
 Are you going to do it there, nothing's going to happen? 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.649
 and the door will keep coming down washing more 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:08.670
 now if I put 100 it would be 3 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:11.490
 411 and 334 12 and now is to push the button 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.020
 see what will happen the door will go 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.290
 stop attacking there I'll be able to 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.939
 pass is then basically show the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.520
 How can you do this? 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.500
 if you who is not closing your door 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.500
 You click the button and then I go. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.880
 show you in the tutorial now 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.369
 how this business works 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.140
 Come on, beauty , we're the people. 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.060
 here to explain how it will be 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.040
 dynamics of our passage 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.049
 well you are seeing that there is a lot 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.090
 of items that are seated in the first 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.780
 of law is the initial when you put there 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.240
 only when the ocean all of them to the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.060
 same time when they pass the energy 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.729
 for these bitters as they are with 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.619
 different laws they will activate in 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.950
 different times, look, I'll just go 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.090
 show you and you see him call 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.210
 and turns off totally different time 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.530
 and plastically this system that all 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.350
 these stories of this effect is so 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.160
 connected on this system that sends a pulse 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.959
 Only one for the torch is how you can. 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.470
 see that if I put the torch to put the 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.780
 South piston emits a pulse here it goes 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.739
 To do this, you 're going to take a course. 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.390
 single piston 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.970
 only the funny thing is that thanks to 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.620
 1486 update does not happen 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.970
 in some directions as for example he 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.950
 has that torch 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.870
 only it does not give the single title then 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.459
 If you have trouble building this 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.870
 machine come here that I'll show 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.819
 soon does 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.260
 It's just you and alternating the torches of those 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.130
 directions here sometime you go 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.769
 to get what I had is in a single type 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.480
 of beauty but then basically that 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.370
 people would have to do to activate 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.400
 because if I have them differently 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.230
 option just goes back and forth it 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.599
 will not make everything fast from a single 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.010
 course is to make a single well is us 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.629
 it needs a unique well so that it can 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.470
 leave the block here and stop dripping 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.760
 lava 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.019
 So what do we have to do? 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.150
 We have to clean these hospitals. 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.660
 and that would be the ones inside our house 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.980
 huh 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.769
 that's why it's configurable 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.900
 For example, if you have personal 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.200
 they let them all in the last of the law 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.069
 then as the mpt and the risk of law 1 2 3 and 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.319
 4 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.049
 you would have to equal all of them to the 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:24.579
 law 4 beauty then is equal to that by 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:27.019
 example that is in the 3 for this one is 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.450
 stay at 4 we have to add it 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.370
 one more and if it is in 4 then the people 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.530
 need to add nothing in this because it 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.190
 is already in the first of ideli and is 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.870
 no 2 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.419
 so we need to add more 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.180
 two of law for him to stay at 4 and so 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:43.400
 successively guys so I'm going to do 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.019
 here very fast to show you both I 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.930
 I set everyone up here so let's see if 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.549
 It will work, right? 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.250
 As you have seen, it emits a pulse. 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.870
 unique single even it did not last 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.810
 different was what made the difference 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.430
 him and he will send that system 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.120
 I'll show you how to do it already. 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.730
 already 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.849
 so come on let's go ride the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.950
 our house with his password so I do not 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.159
 I know if the dynamics of 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.569
 how it works but basically it's me 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.519
 I hope you guys get any questions. 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.439
 if they can, they can leave us 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.720
 comments that I will try to answer from 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.280
 As clear as possible Personal beauty 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.680
 then we first place the 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.930
 our button is right here along with all 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.699
 our hits and that I'm going to put the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.199
 epithet on the other side of the wall to 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.639
 When we come from inside, we do not 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.750
 get to see ne 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.340
 if you want you make a little door 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.039
 here on the side for you to enter 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.650
 configure it here everything else and such nÃ© 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.599
 But it's beauty, this is a personal one. 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.410
 very good deal if you mess with 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:43.690
 people, it's very good for you 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.740
 learn about peter team and ethics 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.810
 because this is very important when 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.680
 You're doing a stone thing. 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.510
 Ok let's bring all these drinks here 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.520
 a place where you will be driven to our 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.300
 door to make that system mine 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:02.020
 guy you do with your A and h 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.449
 stretched is not an h is this y format 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.610
 alone this format comes out of that said 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:10.300
 also that you put two hospitals in the 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.539
 last law here two torches of this 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.349
 yes and redstone form here 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.320
 top 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:19.659
 now we put our torch and the 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.000
 our are with slime person in question 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.940
 with islaine beauty 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.900
 so let's do a test here 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.120
 It's not working because we 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.490
 com has not set anything yet then 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.680
 leave him not he will continue one here 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.900
 We can put the lava that goes 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.870
 to run and nobody to pass 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.520
 for our the door of our house, right? 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.590
 and that the sides I advise you to 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.750
 put on light clothes because there aa 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.190
 lava will not spread beauty 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.289
 that's why I had home office there 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.810
 Ok guys, so now we can 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.539
 do trading here in our house 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.610
 right now and if you want you can 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.680
 also make a reset button where 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.610
 would be more or less what our 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.020
 wall 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.919
 you can make a reset button as well 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:08.630
 here by clicking the button here linking this 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:11.930
 system is where the input is going to be 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:15.470
 We call to switch on the door, so it 's 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:19.430
 The same is true if I open the door through 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.900
 password and I said I do not want to 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.680
 So I came in here and hit the 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.599
 button 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.360
 he goes there strip there he comes she continues 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:27.710
 falling personal beauty, that's it 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.330
 I hope you have understood if 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:34.340
 you want it can be a 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:35.449
 pitas because you want it is 3247 you 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.949
 do what you want 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:40.849
 and then when you leave your house you 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:42.919
 return all the bits to 11 that there the 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:45.169
 your friend anyone who is not 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:47.539
 Will you be able to enter your home then? 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.639

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:51.830
 saw it and it did not work because back here 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.669
 to include different names in then 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.949
 I tighten 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.570
 He's just going to do it and she's going to do it. 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:07:00.110
 keep running and whoever tries to pass 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.880
 here it is going to burn but at last staff is 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.139
 That's good for anyone watching the video 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.240
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:06.320
 Today's tutorial a little bit about team 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.449
 in the pitots 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.639

 is to get 350 likes that through the 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.340
 timer 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.020
 so if you're motivating me 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.759
