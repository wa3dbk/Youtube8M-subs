00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.650
 it the fin the start in group e of the ek qualification with two away games 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.110
 next Friday there will be a fight in Moldova and Tuesday the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.759
 vice world champion 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.019
 other opponents in the group include Hungary and Sweden 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.980
 and fighting for their lives 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.260
 and but yes you have a favorite of course noses 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.970
 cycling became champion of the netherlands 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.250
 and yes thereafter ssv hungary a man finland get there fighting for the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.830
 second place two and 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.300
 a place in the play off 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.290
 how strong is the netherlands 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.560
 After the they also never find it hard to find the estimate we give 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.910
 peacock last matches is played simply with in belgium and violence and poles 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.830
 but before that there was also less competitions 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.090
 after the break 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.350
 next week 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.840
 but with the current selection to Finland hobby 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.880
 a chance against the netherlands you think 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.500
 well if we all zutphen for a netherlands less 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.410
 appoint a walk for children on Thursday, the council voted for 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.600
 marketing 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.080
 that we can play that very well and yes get good results too 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.810
 toppers 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.650
 and then malta 9 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.230
 that many of this match remember 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.540
 but now they want 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.430
 I think international first practice before the World Cup campaign and 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.300
 the whole bad match from both sides 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.300
 well we still won a 2 there and 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.410
 mark venlo has the winning goal 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.810
 with my head 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 and that is not my strongest point 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.650
 but he was a reply all the bad matches of a mosquito 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.030
 the level of the competition was not the best but still won 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.050
 so nice for the statistic 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.600
 mika väyrynen has now played more than forty international matches for Finland 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.390
 midfielder makes his debut just before the 2002 World Cup in a friendly 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.100
 game against south korea trained by guus hiddink 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.040
 yes i was only after 20 years 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.660
 so I was free to go and was nice 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.660
 yes hear a player where they still lost the match 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:16.349
 grasp yes 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.929
 the double feeling 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:22.489
 well i am this is one of the best games plan lee ever 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.359
 the very well played the in germany 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.999
 the 3 3 are finally there 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.580
 it had to win in this match 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.879
 for the markets with three goals and 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.109
 the minority anyway 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.599
 along 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.579
 but also for me personally was one 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.329
 9 the Venezuelan 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.469
 that wants it to do well 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.469
 for years there was a good cross and measuring 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.599
 the Christian Union believes that the world 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.449
 another very low with exterior 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:58.449
 their host lightly lights up 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.799
 and then a nice job 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.029
 at the time of his international debut, vaginal plays for sc heerenveen 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.069
 there he is put down in a different position by foppe than he used to 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.119
 is 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:13.349
 väyrynen is playing football behind the strikers meanwhile midfielder that too 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.889
 must defend 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.760
 i was 19 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.529
 I thought when I came here 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.529
 and quickly went away and immediately started playing 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:26.619
 Usually a surprise comes as a young player in the morning 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.660
 Marian preferred has only one chance and 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.669
 cump one 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:37.489
 cruising speeds were heading for the second second year 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.719
 it's a wash 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.769
 good times 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.689
 during the ride ended 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.219
 putting the proposal at the center psv had the biggest job in the Netherlands that seems 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.559
 I also have an idea to be allowed to play for that, of course 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:52.610
 none of that is yes 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.219
 in the most beautiful club in europe 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.450
 and 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.879
 well i have the trio day and plays 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.819
 2 say so 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.819
 better better birthday man from Alkmaar leaves himself 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.939
 at the box for me 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.419
 but then beautiful hour that I have standing there 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.829
 1st cat the home game against Poland 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.269
 as the for 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.059
 I can 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.709
 made in Austria and Switzerland 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.090
 and who has been a passport for three years does not happen that often 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.120
 also not 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.749
 with the larger countries 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:34.999
 but the da this is perhaps one of the nicest wins from outside 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.620
 matches with finland 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.210
 and 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.210
 where the entire game has played well in advance 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.719
 also one of the few matches weeks ago was suspended 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.719
 and yes maybe the best 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:54.969
 also not the nicest and 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:56.789
 and georgios 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.050
 the chance is not too big that traffic jams will ever play at a wk or wk stand 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.900
 Although the Finnish team is increasingly succeeding in dealing with the big countries 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.979
 the quality difference is just too big would be nice if there was one 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.699
 come to an end and can play football 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.449
 but am also a larger player a missed litmans and 41 years for example 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.059
 are to 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:21.059
 very strange that hunter is one of the best players 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.610
 also been also still 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.530
 and they have never experienced an end then so I hope for it too 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.439
 this may be done for this 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.709
 in mixing how can you achieve in poles
