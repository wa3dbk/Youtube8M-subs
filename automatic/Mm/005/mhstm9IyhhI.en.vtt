walking<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:25.530> side<00:01:25.770> boards<00:01:26.100> now<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
walking up the side boards now the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.580 
walking up the side boards now the
reason<00:01:27.150> why<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.750> drill<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.229> because

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
reason why I like this drill is because

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980 
reason why I like this drill is because
it<00:01:28.950> simulates<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.850> lot<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.420> returning<00:01:30.780> game

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
it simulates a lot of returning game

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.410 
it simulates a lot of returning game
situations<00:01:31.670> very<00:01:32.670> often<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.150> game<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
situations very often in that game a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.940 
situations very often in that game a
player<00:01:33.630> will<00:01:33.869> find<00:01:34.049> himself<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> corner

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
player will find himself in the corner

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.830 
player will find himself in the corner
and<00:01:35.280> you'll<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.000> choose<00:01:36.299> whether<00:01:36.600> he's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and you'll have to choose whether he's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.359 
and you'll have to choose whether he's
gonna<00:01:37.020> skate<00:01:37.290> down<00:01:37.439> behind<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.829> net<00:01:38.009> or<00:01:38.159> skate

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
gonna skate down behind the net or skate

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.969 
gonna skate down behind the net or skate
up<00:01:38.520> along<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> boards<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.619> some<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.890> our

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
up along the boards and in some of our

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.850 
up along the boards and in some of our
other<00:01:41.070> videos<00:01:41.189> we've<00:01:41.700> also<00:01:41.880> talked<00:01:42.270> about<00:01:42.860> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
other videos we've also talked about the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.590 
other videos we've also talked about the
strength<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.340> attacking<00:01:45.060> through<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> scene

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
strength of attacking through the scene

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.819 
strength of attacking through the scene
so<00:01:46.229> players<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.680> attack<00:01:46.950> through<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> seam

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
so players that attack through the seam

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.550 
so players that attack through the seam
can<00:01:49.829> often<00:01:50.310> get<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.700> good<00:01:50.820> shots<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.270> net

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
can often get really good shots on net

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.770 
can often get really good shots on net
by<00:01:52.560> using<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.950> seam<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.610> want<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.909> video

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
by using the seam if you want a video

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.499 
by using the seam if you want a video
that<00:01:55.140> talks<00:01:55.470> about<00:01:55.560> attacking<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.310> seam<00:01:56.520> just

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that talks about attacking the seam just

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.060 
that talks about attacking the seam just
look<00:01:57.719> up<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> drizzle<00:01:58.380> scales<00:01:58.590> blog<00:01:58.829> look

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
look up on the drizzle scales blog look

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.870 
look up on the drizzle scales blog look
up<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.630> snake<00:02:01.049> drill<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:02.460> think<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
up the snake drill and I think the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.550 
up the snake drill and I think the
inside<00:02:03.180> mohawk<00:02:03.659> talks<00:02:03.960> about<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.409> little

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
inside mohawk talks about it a little

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.510 
inside mohawk talks about it a little
bit<00:02:04.770> too<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.219> snake<00:02:05.520> drill<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.939> inside

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
bit too so snake drill and inside

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.940 
bit too so snake drill and inside
drill<00:02:06.990> those<00:02:07.990> we'll<00:02:08.170> both<00:02:08.379> talk<00:02:08.679> about

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
drill those we'll both talk about

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.550 
drill those we'll both talk about
attacking<00:02:09.940> through<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.330> scene<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:11.379> reason

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
attacking through the scene the reason

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.960 
attacking through the scene the reason
why<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.680> like<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.129> is<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.519> it<00:02:12.640> tucks<00:02:12.819> it

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
why I like this is that it tucks it

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.390 
why I like this is that it tucks it
works<00:02:13.720> on<00:02:13.900> attacking<00:02:14.200> through<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.590> scene<00:02:14.860> but

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
works on attacking through the scene but

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.430 
works on attacking through the scene but
doing<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.700> given<00:02:16.000> go<00:02:16.180> through<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.569> scene<00:02:16.810> which

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
doing a given go through the scene which

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.570 
doing a given go through the scene which
is<00:02:17.680> which<00:02:18.519> is<00:02:18.550> even<00:02:18.910> better<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:20.340> back<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
is which is even better so back to the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.830 
is which is even better so back to the
drill<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.120> what's<00:02:22.269> gonna<00:02:22.390> happen<00:02:22.480> he's

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
drill this is what's gonna happen he's

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.900 
drill this is what's gonna happen he's
going<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.049> start<00:02:23.260> walking<00:02:23.620> up<00:02:23.739> now<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.400> next

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
going to start walking up now the next

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.420 
going to start walking up now the next
person<00:02:25.090> in<00:02:25.390> line<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.860> fact<00:02:27.069> let<00:02:27.190> me<00:02:27.250> do<00:02:27.400> a

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
person in line in fact let me do a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.190 
person in line in fact let me do a
different<00:02:27.519> color<00:02:27.849> here<00:02:28.180> I'll<00:02:28.269> try<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.540> this

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
different color here I'll try to this

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.440 
different color here I'll try to this
looks<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.590> lot<00:02:29.769> more<00:02:29.950> confusing<00:02:30.549> diagrammed

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
looks a lot more confusing diagrammed

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.210 
looks a lot more confusing diagrammed
out<00:02:31.660> than<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.019> actually<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.890> ice<00:02:33.010> just

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
out than it actually is on the ice just

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.589 
out than it actually is on the ice just
because<00:02:33.549> you<00:02:33.730> get<00:02:33.879> a<00:02:33.910> lot<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.180> arrows<00:02:34.450> and

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
because you get a lot of arrows and

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.680 
because you get a lot of arrows and
stuff<00:02:34.780> overlap<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.590> diagram<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.129> but<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
stuff overlap in the diagram it but the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.509 
stuff overlap in the diagram it but the
next<00:02:38.019> guy<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.290> line<00:02:38.319> is<00:02:38.620> gonna<00:02:38.769> follow<00:02:39.010> him<00:02:39.370> up

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
next guy in line is gonna follow him up

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.690 
next guy in line is gonna follow him up
okay<00:02:40.299> so<00:02:40.390> he's<00:02:40.660> gonna<00:02:40.780> follow<00:02:41.140> in<00:02:41.700> offering

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
okay so he's gonna follow in offering

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.839 
okay so he's gonna follow in offering
some<00:02:43.000> backside<00:02:43.750> support<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.730> one<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.790> the

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
some backside support and one of the

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:46.800 
some backside support and one of the
things<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.090> really<00:02:46.239> want<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.480> stress<00:02:46.690> with

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
things you really want to stress with

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.229 
things you really want to stress with
your<00:02:46.959> team<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:48.099> it's<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.430> man<00:02:48.640> receiving

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
your team is that it's the man receiving

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.479 
your team is that it's the man receiving
the<00:02:49.329> pocket<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.750> calls<00:02:49.930> for<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.170> cycle<00:02:50.590> so

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
the pocket that calls for the cycle so

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.080 
the pocket that calls for the cycle so
it<00:02:52.110> reinforces<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.700> communication<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.880> so

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
it reinforces that communication is so

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.229 
it reinforces that communication is so
important<00:02:55.569> in<00:02:55.780> game<00:02:56.079> situations<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:57.430> once<00:02:57.940> the

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
important in game situations so once the

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.530 
important in game situations so once the
second<00:02:58.989> man<00:02:59.110> calls<00:02:59.500> for<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.829> cycle<00:03:00.220> then<00:03:00.940> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
second man calls for the cycle then the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.020 
second man calls for the cycle then the
first<00:03:01.840> guy<00:03:02.049> in<00:03:02.400> pump<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.519> back

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
first guy in pump it back

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.580 
first guy in pump it back
always<00:03:04.720> make<00:03:04.870> sure<00:03:04.900> your<00:03:05.140> players<00:03:05.410> are

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
always make sure your players are

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.619 
always make sure your players are
bumping<00:03:05.860> back<00:03:06.040> towards<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.579> boards<00:03:06.910> the

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
bumping back towards the boards the

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.420 
bumping back towards the boards the
whole<00:03:07.780> purpose<00:03:08.049> of<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.349> cycle<00:03:08.739> is<00:03:08.890> you're

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
whole purpose of a cycle is you're

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.039 
whole purpose of a cycle is you're
eliminating<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.120> man<00:03:10.269> you're<00:03:10.420> sucking<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.870> man

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
eliminating a man you're sucking a man

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.840 
eliminating a man you're sucking a man
in<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.470> then<00:03:11.560> eliminating<00:03:12.130> with<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.430> cycle

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
in and then eliminating with the cycle

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.960 
in and then eliminating with the cycle
so<00:03:13.299> if<00:03:13.420> you<00:03:13.510> cycle<00:03:13.750> back<00:03:14.049> towards<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.560> middle

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
so if you cycle back towards the middle

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.099 
so if you cycle back towards the middle
you're<00:03:15.970> basically<00:03:16.329> putting<00:03:16.569> it<00:03:16.780> right<00:03:16.810> into

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
you're basically putting it right into

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.210 
you're basically putting it right into
the<00:03:17.260> pressure<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.709> you're<00:03:17.799> trying<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.100> avoid

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
the pressure that you're trying to avoid

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.030 
the pressure that you're trying to avoid
so<00:03:19.120> this<00:03:19.600> guy<00:03:19.780> cycles<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.290> back<00:03:20.500> little<00:03:20.829> bump

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
so this guy cycles a back little bump

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.949 
so this guy cycles a back little bump
off<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.340> boards<00:03:21.670> again<00:03:22.540> you're<00:03:22.780> going<00:03:22.870> to

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
off the boards again you're going to

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.140 
off the boards again you're going to
want<00:03:23.109> to<00:03:23.170> make<00:03:23.319> sure<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:23.829> bump<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.459> an

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
want to make sure that that bump is an

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.000 
want to make sure that that bump is an
effective<00:03:25.630> bump<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.260> comes<00:03:26.560> off<00:03:26.799> the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
effective bump that it comes off the

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.039 
effective bump that it comes off the
boards<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.370> doesn't<00:03:27.609> just<00:03:27.790> ring<00:03:28.450> down<00:03:28.660> hugging

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
boards it doesn't just ring down hugging

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.440 
boards it doesn't just ring down hugging
the<00:03:29.290> board's<00:03:29.590> along<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:30.000> alumna<00:03:31.000> into<00:03:31.359> the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
the board's along the alumna into the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.150 
the board's along the alumna into the
corner<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:32.350> it's<00:03:32.470> got<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.709> be<00:03:32.739> able<00:03:32.889> to<00:03:33.010> be

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
corner so it's got to be able to be

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.849 
corner so it's got to be able to be
picked<00:03:33.370> up<00:03:33.579> by<00:03:33.639> that<00:03:34.030> second<00:03:34.420> man<00:03:34.560> after<00:03:35.560> you

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
picked up by that second man after you

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.949 
picked up by that second man after you
after<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.849> first<00:03:37.090> player<00:03:37.299> cycles<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:37.840> then

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
after the first player cycles it then

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.120 
after the first player cycles it then
he's<00:03:38.049> going<00:03:38.170> to<00:03:38.260> attack<00:03:38.500> through<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.889> scene

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
he's going to attack through the scene

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.940 
he's going to attack through the scene
without<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:40.060> puck<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:41.019> now<00:03:41.410> this<00:03:41.620> is<00:03:41.799> where

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
without the puck and now this is where

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.280 
without the puck and now this is where
you<00:03:42.099> can<00:03:42.280> use<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.609> Mohawk<00:03:43.030> so<00:03:43.959> as<00:03:44.079> he's

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
you can use that Mohawk so as he's

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.080 
you can use that Mohawk so as he's
attacking<00:03:44.590> through<00:03:44.889> the<00:03:44.980> scene<00:03:45.220> if<00:03:45.430> he's<00:03:45.940> on

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
attacking through the scene if he's on

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.490 
attacking through the scene if he's on
his<00:03:46.239> forehand<00:03:46.540> side<00:03:46.780> he's<00:03:46.989> gonna<00:03:47.109> pick<00:03:47.349> it<00:03:47.380> up

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
his forehand side he's gonna pick it up

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.809 
his forehand side he's gonna pick it up
on<00:03:47.680> his<00:03:47.799> forehand<00:03:48.130> if<00:03:48.310> he's<00:03:48.400> on<00:03:48.519> his<00:03:48.639> backhand

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
on his forehand if he's on his backhand

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.030 
on his forehand if he's on his backhand
side<00:03:49.269> I<00:03:49.480> teach<00:03:50.169> your<00:03:50.290> players<00:03:50.500> open<00:03:50.799> up<00:03:50.889> into

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
side I teach your players open up into

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.460 
side I teach your players open up into
the<00:03:51.130> Mohawk<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.579> work<00:03:51.700> on<00:03:51.849> that<00:03:51.940> one<00:03:52.060> timer<00:03:52.470> so

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
the Mohawk and work on that one timer so

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.770 
the Mohawk and work on that one timer so
he's<00:03:53.590> going<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.769> attack<00:03:54.040> through<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.370> seam

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
he's going to attack through the seam

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.000 
he's going to attack through the seam
taking<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.870> proper<00:03:56.200> angle<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.530> he<00:03:56.650> can<00:03:56.799> do<00:03:56.980> a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
taking the proper angle that he can do a

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.949 
taking the proper angle that he can do a
good<00:03:57.160> one<00:03:57.340> time<00:03:57.549> in<00:03:57.669> fact<00:03:57.880> I<00:03:58.090> didn't<00:03:58.480> really

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
good one time in fact I didn't really

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.339 
good one time in fact I didn't really
draw<00:03:59.169> this<00:03:59.349> all<00:03:59.829> that<00:04:00.190> well<00:04:00.819> if<00:04:01.630> you're<00:04:01.930> really

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
draw this all that well if you're really

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.140 
draw this all that well if you're really
wanting<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.650> take<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:02.889> good<00:04:03.099> angle<00:04:03.220> what<00:04:04.090> I

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
wanting to take a good angle what I

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.520 
wanting to take a good angle what I
would<00:04:04.299> recommend<00:04:04.389> assuming<00:04:05.079> if<00:04:05.200> this<00:04:05.349> is<00:04:05.500> a

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
would recommend assuming if this is a

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.409 
would recommend assuming if this is a
forehand<00:04:06.040> shot<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.609> right-handed<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.299> this

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
forehand shot so right-handed in this

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.140 
forehand shot so right-handed in this
case<00:04:07.829> come<00:04:08.829> out<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.340> little<00:04:09.519> bit<00:04:09.669> higher<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:10.060> an

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
case come out a little bit higher of an

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.240 
case come out a little bit higher of an
angle<00:04:10.450> and<00:04:10.630> then<00:04:10.780> drive

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
angle and then drive

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.370 
angle and then drive
down<00:04:11.370> towards<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:11.970> far<00:04:12.300> post<00:04:12.600> that's<00:04:13.170> gonna

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
down towards that far post that's gonna

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.810 
down towards that far post that's gonna
give<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.710> a<00:04:13.740> better<00:04:13.980> angle<00:04:14.400> on<00:04:14.490> that<00:04:14.670> one

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
give you a better angle on that one

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.150 
give you a better angle on that one
timer<00:04:15.060> shot<00:04:15.330> if<00:04:15.450> you're<00:04:15.570> in<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.690> forehand<00:04:16.160> the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
timer shot if you're in the forehand the

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.849 
timer shot if you're in the forehand the
player<00:04:17.340> that<00:04:17.489> picks<00:04:17.730> up<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.030> pass<00:04:18.739> picks<00:04:19.739> up

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
player that picks up the pass picks up

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.680 
player that picks up the pass picks up
the<00:04:19.980> cycle<00:04:20.310> sorry<00:04:20.579> is<00:04:21.590> gonna<00:04:22.590> step<00:04:23.010> out<00:04:23.690> okay

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
the cycle sorry is gonna step out okay

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.630 
the cycle sorry is gonna step out okay
and<00:04:25.170> like<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.560> said<00:04:25.770> this<00:04:25.890> is<00:04:26.070> getting<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.490> little

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
and like I said this is getting a little

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.890 
and like I said this is getting a little
confusing<00:04:27.090> with<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.270> lot<00:04:27.420> of<00:04:27.510> overlapping

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
confusing with a lot of overlapping

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.350 
confusing with a lot of overlapping
arrows<00:04:28.260> but<00:04:28.530> once<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.610> drill<00:04:29.850> is<00:04:29.970> underway

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
arrows but once the drill is underway

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.320 
arrows but once the drill is underway
it's<00:04:30.570> really<00:04:30.810> straightforward<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:32.330> he's

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
it's really straightforward and he's

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.860 
it's really straightforward and he's
gonna<00:04:33.540> fire<00:04:34.320> that<00:04:34.350> pass<00:04:34.770> across<00:04:35.780> for<00:04:36.780> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
gonna fire that pass across for the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.130 
gonna fire that pass across for the
one-time<00:04:37.170> shot<00:04:37.970> okay<00:04:38.970> so<00:04:39.600> that's<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.870> first

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
one-time shot okay so that's the first

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.230 
one-time shot okay so that's the first
phase<00:04:40.350> of<00:04:40.620> this<00:04:40.770> drill

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
phase of this drill

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.170 
phase of this drill
just<00:04:43.020> make<00:04:43.140> sure<00:04:43.170> got<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.500> right<00:04:43.620> color<00:04:43.740> here

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
just make sure got the right color here

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.690 
just make sure got the right color here
okay<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.200> fire<00:04:46.410> fire<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.160> one-time<00:04:47.490> shot

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
okay so the fire fire the one-time shot

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.720 
okay so the fire fire the one-time shot

again<00:06:22.960> depending<00:06:23.379> on<00:06:23.740> whether<00:06:23.949> he<00:06:24.039> shoots

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:24.219 
again depending on whether he shoots

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:25.920

forehand<00:06:24.610> or<00:06:24.639> backhand<00:06:24.849> that<00:06:25.270> angle<00:06:25.750> might

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
forehand or backhand that angle might

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.330 
forehand or backhand that angle might
change<00:06:26.229> a<00:06:26.379> little<00:06:26.409> bit<00:06:26.680> so<00:06:26.889> it<00:06:26.979> gives<00:06:27.129> them<00:06:27.219> a

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
change a little bit so it gives them a

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.279 
change a little bit so it gives them a
good<00:06:27.490> angle<00:06:27.699> for<00:06:27.849> one-time<00:06:28.300> shot<00:06:28.539> if<00:06:29.050> he's<00:06:29.169> on

his<00:06:29.379> forehand<00:06:29.800> he<00:06:29.919> wants<00:06:30.099> to<00:06:30.159> take<00:06:30.340> a<00:06:30.370> little

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
his forehand he wants to take a little

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.339 
his forehand he wants to take a little
bit<00:06:30.699> higher<00:06:30.909> an<00:06:31.180> angle<00:06:31.479> and<00:06:31.659> be<00:06:31.750> driving<00:06:32.169> down

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:32.349
