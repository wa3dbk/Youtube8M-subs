00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
don't really care I just I didn't like

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.120 
don't really care I just I didn't like
his<00:01:48.420> default<00:01:48.750> move<00:01:48.960> set<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.530> game<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.950> like

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
his default move set in this game I like

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.030 
his default move set in this game I like
it<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.369> smackdown<00:01:50.820> vs<00:01:51.119> raw<00:01:51.200> 2011<00:01:52.200> because

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
it and smackdown vs raw 2011 because

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.520 
it and smackdown vs raw 2011 because
it's<00:01:53.250> his<00:01:53.369> actual<00:01:53.729> moveset<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.350> he

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
it's his actual moveset you know what he

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.370 
it's his actual moveset you know what he
does<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> game<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.020> makes<00:01:58.229> complete

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
does in the game so it makes complete

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.850 
does in the game so it makes complete
sense<00:01:58.740> why<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.189> would<00:01:59.430> keep<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.820> their<00:02:00.090> arm

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
sense why I would keep that their arm

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.010 
sense why I would keep that their arm
but<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.130> game<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:03.390> didn't<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.780> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
but in this game I just didn't like it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.870 
but in this game I just didn't like it
that<00:02:04.229> moves<00:02:04.710> felt<00:02:04.950> kind<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.219> clunky<00:02:05.490> he<00:02:05.759> was

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
that moves felt kind of clunky he was

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.850 
that moves felt kind of clunky he was
