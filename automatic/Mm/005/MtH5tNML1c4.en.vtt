00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it's it's different so I really like

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.260 
it's it's different so I really like
that<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:10.229> has<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> pocket<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.119> I

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that and it has a pocket in here and I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.660 
that and it has a pocket in here and I
really<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> striped<00:01:13.369> lining<00:01:14.369> it's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
really like the striped lining it's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.420

silky<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.750> very<00:01:15.990> cute

silky it's very cute

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.700 
silky it's very cute
and<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.630> guess<00:01:18.869> let's<00:01:19.080> go<00:01:19.200> over<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> dimensions

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and I guess let's go over the dimensions

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.399 
and I guess let's go over the dimensions
of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> bag<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> small<00:01:22.140> version

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
of the bag so this is the small version

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.910 
of the bag so this is the small version
so<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:25.189> 9.5<00:01:26.189> inches<00:01:26.790> hot<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.710> height

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
so it is 9.5 inches hot is the height

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.770 
so it is 9.5 inches hot is the height
and<00:01:29.360> then<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:32.009> eleven<00:01:32.850> point<00:01:33.090> five<00:01:33.240> inches

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
and then it is eleven point five inches

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.569 
and then it is eleven point five inches
long<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.880> then<00:01:35.880> five<00:01:36.210> inches<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:37.409> way<00:01:37.710> so

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
long and then five inches this way so

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.060 
long and then five inches this way so
it's<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.820> good<00:01:38.939> size<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:40.439> then<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.890> put

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
it's a good size and then you can put

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.889 
it's a good size and then you can put
pretty<00:01:41.369> much<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.579> lot<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:42.659> everyday

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.990 

like<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.590> stuff<00:02:08.920> my<00:02:09.100> bags<00:02:09.310> with<00:02:09.520> tissue<00:02:09.759> just

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
the handles are lower um longer so you

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.940 
the handles are lower um longer so you
can<00:07:09.760> wear<00:07:09.910> it<00:07:09.970> over<00:07:10.060> your<00:07:10.150> shoulder<00:07:10.510> but<00:07:11.260> this
