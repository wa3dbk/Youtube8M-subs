right<00:03:15.450> here<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:16.170> here's<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.920> aerator<00:03:17.340> panel

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
right here and here's the aerator panel

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.940 
right here and here's the aerator panel
opposite<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.540> now<00:03:18.720> we<00:03:19.290> put<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.590> front<00:03:19.829> panel

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
opposite so now we put the front panel

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.479 
opposite so now we put the front panel
next<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.260> celery<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.200> front<00:03:25.500> okay

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
next to the celery it is the front okay

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.089 
next to the celery it is the front okay
so<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.700> works<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.090> way<00:03:27.299> so<00:03:28.139> accelerator<00:03:28.829> and

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
so it works this way so accelerator and

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.720 
so it works this way so accelerator and
then<00:03:29.340> front<00:03:29.730> looks<00:03:30.480> like<00:03:30.599> a<00:03:30.630> big<00:03:30.840> garbage<00:03:31.049> can

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
then front looks like a big garbage can

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.750 
then front looks like a big garbage can
you<00:03:32.730> get<00:03:32.989> okay<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.049> got<00:03:34.459> accelerator<00:03:35.459> and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
you get okay you got accelerator and

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.110 
you get okay you got accelerator and
back<00:03:36.750> I'll<00:03:37.109> good<00:03:37.519> okay<00:03:38.519> now<00:03:38.669> did<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.880> get<00:03:39.000> the

back I'll good okay now did you get the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.120 
back I'll good okay now did you get the
three<00:03:39.329> sides<00:03:39.569> compost<00:03:40.139> tumblers<00:03:40.560> going<00:03:40.919> on

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
three sides compost tumblers going on

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.410 
three sides compost tumblers going on
the<00:03:41.370> top

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
the top

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.170 
the top
in<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.660> screws<00:03:42.900> until<00:03:43.110> their<00:03:43.349> smell<00:03:43.590> cookies

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
in the screws until their smell cookies

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.089 
in the screws until their smell cookies
we're<00:03:45.180> on<00:03:45.300> part<00:03:45.810> two<00:03:46.050> of<00:03:47.239> step<00:03:48.239> 4<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.950> think<00:03:49.950> it's

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
we're on part two of step 4 I think it's

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.790 
we're on part two of step 4 I think it's
step<00:03:50.310> for<00:03:51.860> good<00:03:52.860> what<00:03:53.310> do<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.459> have<00:03:53.550> step<00:03:53.880> 5

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
step for good what do you have step 5

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.589 
step for good what do you have step 5
door<00:03:55.800> installation<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:56.910> drop<00:03:57.150> but<00:03:57.510> I'm

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
door installation and drop but I'm

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.510 
door installation and drop but I'm
assuming<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:58.380> that's<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.800> door<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.280> goes

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
assuming that that's the door this goes

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.360 
assuming that that's the door this goes
in<00:03:59.550> here<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.330> does<00:04:00.540> yeah<00:04:00.920> okay<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.160> there's

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
in here it does yeah okay and there's

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.860 
in here it does yeah okay and there's
got<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.550> be<00:04:02.580> some<00:04:02.790> way<00:04:02.819> that<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.209> can<00:04:03.360> attach

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
got to be some way that you can attach

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.070 
got to be some way that you can attach
it<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.319> detach<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.920> heavy<00:04:05.489> yeah<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.780> here<00:04:06.989> it

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
it and detach it heavy yeah and here it

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.800 
it and detach it heavy yeah and here it
is<00:04:07.200> pick<00:04:07.830> it<00:04:08.010> up<00:04:08.130> looks<00:04:08.940> like<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.090> suitcase<00:04:09.420> like

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
is pick it up looks like a suitcase like

a hat bet we have to do is put on the

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.729 
a hat bet we have to do is put on the
bottom<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.239> wheel<00:04:12.660> leaves<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.230> put<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.560> end

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
bottom the wheel leaves you put the end

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.789 
bottom the wheel leaves you put the end
piece<00:04:13.950> on<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.310> axle<00:04:14.700> rod<00:04:14.880> we<00:04:15.510> had<00:04:15.630> a<00:04:15.660> tap<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.650> in

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
piece on the axle rod we had a tap it in

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.940 
piece on the axle rod we had a tap it in
evenly<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.790> then<00:04:18.299> one<00:04:18.660> end<00:04:18.840> only<00:04:21.590> now<00:04:22.590> we<00:04:22.680> have

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
evenly and then one end only now we have

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.520 
evenly and then one end only now we have
the<00:04:23.100> frame<00:04:23.400> together<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:24.060> little<00:04:24.900> simple<00:04:25.290> thing

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
the frame together a little simple thing

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.510 
the frame together a little simple thing
when<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.800> put<00:04:26.010> this<00:04:26.160> rot<00:04:26.430> in<00:04:26.810> over<00:04:27.810> here<00:04:28.520> you

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
when you put this rot in over here you

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.620 
when you put this rot in over here you
can't<00:04:29.820> push<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.540> rod<00:04:30.720> into<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.080> first<00:04:31.500> end

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
can't push the rod into the first end

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.560 
can't push the rod into the first end
too<00:04:33.630> deep<00:04:33.960> because<00:04:34.380> you<00:04:34.650> don't<00:04:34.830> get<00:04:35.010> enough

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
too deep because you don't get enough

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.350 
too deep because you don't get enough
edge<00:04:36.570> on<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.320> other<00:04:37.470> one<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.880> you<00:04:38.940> can<00:04:39.150> put<00:04:39.270> the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
edge on the other one so you can put the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.510 
edge on the other one so you can put the
other<00:04:39.510> wheel<00:04:39.750> on<00:04:39.990> okay<00:04:40.530> well<00:04:41.130> at<00:04:41.190> least<00:04:41.280> we

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
other wheel on okay well at least we

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.760 
other wheel on okay well at least we
have<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:42.060> two<00:04:42.479> pieces<00:04:42.780> together<00:04:43.110> we're<00:04:43.650> in

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
have the two pieces together we're in

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.960 
have the two pieces together we're in
the<00:04:43.860> last<00:04:44.100> step<00:04:44.460> here<00:04:44.520> I<00:04:45.919> think<00:04:46.919> I<00:04:47.190> have<00:04:47.850> to

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
the last step here I think I have to

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.850 
the last step here I think I have to
look<00:04:48.060> at<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.240> directions<00:04:48.810> again<00:04:49.380> then<00:04:49.620> hold

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
look at the directions again then hold

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.990 
look at the directions again then hold
this<00:04:51.620> this<00:04:52.620> has<00:04:52.770> gotta<00:04:52.979> hold<00:04:53.250> while<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:53.640> crank

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
this this has gotta hold while you crank

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.380 
this this has gotta hold while you crank
this<00:04:54.240> side<00:04:55.070> or<00:04:56.070> whatever<00:04:56.340> side<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:56.640> okay<00:04:57.150> oh

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
this side or whatever side you okay oh

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.940 
this side or whatever side you okay oh
I'm<00:04:58.260> not<00:04:58.470> doing<00:04:58.830> this<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:59.190> know<00:04:59.430> by<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.700> way

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950
