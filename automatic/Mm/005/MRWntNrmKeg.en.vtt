00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.310
 how do the conjurers deceive i 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.020
 our senses actually very often 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:15.200
 they use pitfall errors 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.090
 in which the mind of man falls into almost 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.880
 automatically and magician 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.460
 all he has to do is somehow 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.470
 second this tendency to make mistakes 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.110
 of our brain as it does in this 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.510
 case the illusionist uses yes indeed 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.750
 special effects of rigged objects but 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.610
 above all to the ability to exploit 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.280
 certain errors of reasoning that 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.320
 we all make mistakes of 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.149
 I like reasoning 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.850
 continues to continue to be fattened 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.559
 in this video I will try to tell you 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.680
 how the illusionist manages to use 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.579
 the three particular techniques for deceiving 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.559
 our brain 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.079
 one is forcing, that is, giving 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.690
 the impression of being able to address the 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.700
 choices of one spectator another e 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.340
 the use of common places and another is the 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.239
 screening lamis direction as 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.549
 they call the English 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.859
 well if you want to know how they work 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.819
 these techniques and maybe even learn 

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:14.030
 you use them to amaze your friends 

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:15.729
 at the next end-of-year celebrations good vi 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.899
 I will give some small examples 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.959
 of course without ever explaining anything 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.700
 concerning the work of the magician 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.619
 that we are talking only about how 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.359
 our brain is tricked though 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.090
 there may be small examples 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.039
 let's call it little magic so that 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.529
 if you want them presented in the right way 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.920
 they can surprise those who look at you 

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:38.689
 nothing maximum my upset but first
