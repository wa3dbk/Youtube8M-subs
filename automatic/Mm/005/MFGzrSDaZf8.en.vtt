you have the privilege you have an

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.649 
you have the privilege you have an

so in our collection we not only try to

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.120 
so in our collection we not only try to
maintain<00:01:36.380> them<00:01:36.619> from<00:01:36.799> an<00:01:36.920> appearance
