little bit better but that's one another

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.250 
little bit better but that's one another
one<00:03:14.370> would<00:03:14.700> be<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> minor<00:03:15.360> seventh<00:03:15.840> which

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
one would be the a minor seventh which

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:25.340 
one would be the a minor seventh which
is<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:18.140> 12<00:03:19.140> on<00:03:19.320> your<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:21.050> hammer<00:03:22.050> up<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.770> 15<00:03:24.350> and
