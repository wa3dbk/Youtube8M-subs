00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.200
 This starts with a ball change (ball change: the basic action of dancing to move the center of gravity with the toe) 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.000
 Ball chain. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.050
 Pull your foot back in the second step. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.800
 one, 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.753
 Take them back, okay? 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.218
 Then he takes a forelock. 

00:00:14.218 --> 00:00:15.598
 second, 

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:16.938
 next.. 

00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:18.362
 Drop your legs 

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:19.562
 To toe 

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:23.159
 This step should always be at the end of the foot 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.012
 At least in the way I do 

00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:27.325
 Keep your heels high on both feet. 

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:29.458
 All right? so.. 

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:30.699
 going 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.393
 With a ball change, Ann 

00:00:32.393 --> 00:00:33.207
 second 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.564
 Please lower your heel height. 

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:36.533
 This time, my ass moves. 

00:00:37.053 --> 00:00:38.366
 One goes, 

00:00:39.267 --> 00:00:39.786
 one 

00:00:39.786 --> 00:00:40.327
 Ann 

00:00:40.327 --> 00:00:41.490
 second 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.229
 Ann 

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:43.894
 Therefore, 

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:44.964
 Heap, 

00:00:44.964 --> 00:00:46.373
 Heap 

00:00:47.437 --> 00:00:47.687
 one 

00:00:47.687 --> 00:00:48.370
 Ann 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.840
 second 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.620
 Ann 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.277
 Next, on the opposite foot 

00:00:51.277 --> 00:00:51.887
 Three 

00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:52.527
 Ann 

00:00:52.527 --> 00:00:53.187
 four 

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:53.820
 Ann 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.320
 five 

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.133
 six 

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:56.083
 seven 

00:00:56.413 --> 00:00:56.913
 eight 

00:00:57.213 --> 00:00:57.796
 one 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.424
 second 

00:00:58.723 --> 00:00:59.523
 Three 

00:00:59.523 --> 00:01:00.017
 four 

00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:01.107
 five 

00:01:01.107 --> 00:01:01.677
 six 

00:01:01.877 --> 00:01:02.667
 seven 

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:03.787
 eight 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.551
 good. Once more 

00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:07.464
 Ball change 

00:01:09.174 --> 00:01:10.365
 Cross the bridge 

00:01:10.824 --> 00:01:12.849
 Tilt your body when crossing. 

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:13.728
 one 

00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:14.569
 second 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.501
 Get your feet on your toes. 

00:01:23.752 --> 00:01:24.902
 To cross the bridge, 

00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:26.055
 I'm going to cross like this. 

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:28.398
 Like this, okay? 

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:30.228
 Do not do this like this. 

00:01:30.568 --> 00:01:32.332
 Cross 

00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:35.872
 This is the best action I can think of. 

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:39.414
 I can take this step forward. 

00:01:44.408 --> 00:01:48.148
 And when you do this step, you can put in a little wave. 

00:01:53.951 --> 00:02:02.862
