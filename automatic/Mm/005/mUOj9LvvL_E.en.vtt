00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.640
 for the eighth time kind guys I have 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.279
 fed up 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.580
 good then I would put you yesterday the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.699
 description for having had torrent that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.380
 mainly important the link on 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.469
 pirate bay to have the torrent and 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.950
 ask all light to be able to 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.260
 install the game 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.140
 so how do we do once the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.700
 draw ended wrong you doubleclick and that 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.239
 you open this if you do the set up 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.170
 you launch it and that you got it going 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.809
 you open a window the end with a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.760
 shortcut and skyrim you close this 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.510
 window we do not care I 'm not interested 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.070
 not after you need worlds to 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.790
 light 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.970
 so how to see it is 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:15.450
 rather simple I would say I find the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:21.869
 folder me I have to find the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:29.030

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.030
 the damn then to reopen this folder 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.100
 I will talk about funds especially 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:56.000
