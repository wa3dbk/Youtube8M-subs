00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello to all the friends here no to the bone 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.819
 is for a new little video 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.179
 today we are going to make the dough 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:13.990
 monotonous hand this dough consists of 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.940
 mix corn starch you here with 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.759
 of water and will be formed a bat like 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.880
 what on one side and who is on the other 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:26.039
 side and hard first of all we're going 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:31.720
 put corn starch in a dish 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:38.230
 here the full you put the amount that 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:39.699
 do you want it to look like paris on 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.660
 add water so it's water 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:47.699
 veto tap you must not put back 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.699
 and everything is well 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.960
 it looks like it must be lengthened 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:58.960
 before it gives a result is there 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.069
 I put too much water so you feel 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.780
 when the dough and theft 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:04.120
 that's when you sink Vaudois from 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.570
 ldp donations she exercises a slight 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:13.290
 resistance so there this control and he 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.290
 look and I will add home 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.479
 as I mix and there I feel he 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.219
 starts to be good by his guards and 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.219
 not to a slight resistance 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:41.219
 I think it 's this world 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.219
 picks up well the hen k on the side 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.680
 like a good eat and that's the pad is 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:56.229
 ready to rent no you can see that in 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.640
 liquid in my guide and then 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.040
 know not necessarily assad well 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:07.140
 solid according to take two pieces 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.140
 the epide kind can add starch 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.530
 so there you can see behind jean 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:35.440
 bull and then as I simply said 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:37.470
 that they watch and a men's ball and 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:43.810
 then when the break is the team 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:46.390
 this is corn starch with 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.420
 water you can do a lot of things 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.100
 with you doing things to one's name 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.319
 also that would be a kind of flaubert or 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.640
 slim 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.500
 so you get started come back as 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.030
 his good it's like it was a dough 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.010
 liquid that they stay together and then 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:07.120
 when you relax me well where could 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:11.700
 to transform without flour it was a 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.700
