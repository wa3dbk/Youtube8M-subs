 There are people who say they will be happy.

 When finally you get your own house. 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.789
 khel so dreamed what happens to 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.710
 these phrases is that you are vibrating in the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:11.640
 frequency of not having and life ends 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.979
 giving more of the same is not how the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.000
 things work remember to celebrate 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.009
 daily what you already have to stay 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.090
 aware of new opportunities that will 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.280
 appear 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.570
 clearly define the things that you 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.950
 want to achieve 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.080
 of course it is not simply 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.549
 be content with what you already have and be happy 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.040
 so it's the end point 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.170
 It's not that you're going to set things 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.850
 that you want to achieve yet but not 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.540
 because they have not yet arrived. 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.119
 take concrete steps towards them and 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.869
 celebrates every little achievement each 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.549
 small step every little victory 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.509
 find a reason every day for 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.240

 things you want to achieve 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.070
 Do not complain because you are not happy yet. 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.070
