00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
let's just open these packages up I know

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.510 
let's just open these packages up I know
I'm<00:00:43.500> not<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.739> packages<00:00:44.250> or<00:00:44.370> just

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
I'm not really packages or just

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.569 
I'm not really packages or just
envelopes<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.980> new<00:00:47.100> experience<00:00:47.430> for

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
envelopes but it's a new experience for

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.459 
envelopes but it's a new experience for
me<00:00:47.760> I'll<00:00:47.850> say<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> really<00:00:48.899> thought<00:00:49.350> it

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
me I'll say that I really thought it

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.840 
me I'll say that I really thought it
would<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.710> harder<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.160> order<00:00:50.399> from<00:00:50.579> there<00:00:50.730> but

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
would be harder to order from there but

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.430 
would be harder to order from there but
you<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.180> kind<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.600> your<00:00:51.750> PayPal<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
you just kind of have your PayPal and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.260 
you just kind of have your PayPal and
that's<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> mean<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.610> really<00:00:53.910> not<00:00:54.090> that

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
that's it I mean it's really not that

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.990 
that's it I mean it's really not that
hard<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:55.010> let<00:00:56.010> me<00:00:56.100> open<00:00:56.250> these<00:00:56.550> suckers<00:00:56.760> up

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
hard but let me open these suckers up

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.369

gonna<00:01:49.590> need<00:01:49.710> more<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.009> these<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> future

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
gonna need more of these in the future

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.740 
gonna need more of these in the future
but<00:01:50.640> they<00:01:50.759> had<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.000> at<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> same<00:01:51.329> store<00:01:51.570> for

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
but they had it at the same store for

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.080 
but they had it at the same store for
like<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.020> buck<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.729> was<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:53.880> why<00:01:54.060> not

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
like a buck so that was like why not

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149 
like a buck so that was like why not
that's<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.110> great<00:01:55.320> deal<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.890> don't<00:01:56.040> they

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
that's a great deal but I don't they

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.770

only<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.790> store<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.509> could

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
only have one in that store so I could

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.450 
only have one in that store so I could
really<00:01:57.990> buy<00:01:58.469> more<00:01:58.740> than<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.950> needed<00:01:59.159> to
