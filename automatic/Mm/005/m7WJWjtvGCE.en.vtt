if I were to ask you now the question

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.049 
if I were to ask you now the question
are<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.180> aware<00:00:07.639> you<00:00:08.639> may<00:00:08.670> pause<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:10.880> then<00:00:11.880> you

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
are you aware you may pause and then you

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.580 
are you aware you may pause and then you
would<00:00:12.179> answer<00:00:12.330> yes<00:00:14.450> what<00:00:15.450> happens<00:00:15.870> between

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
would answer yes what happens between

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.970 
would answer yes what happens between
the<00:00:16.890> question<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.880> aware<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.980> the

the question are you aware and the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.150 
the question are you aware and the
answer<00:00:20.340> yes

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.130 

the<00:00:25.760> only<00:00:25.940> thing<00:00:26.240> we<00:00:26.420> know<00:00:26.600> without<00:00:26.810> the

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
the only thing we know without the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.200 
the only thing we know without the
shadow<00:00:27.440> of<00:00:27.800> a<00:00:27.980> doubt<00:00:28.220> is<00:00:28.670> that<00:00:28.970> we<00:00:29.120> are

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
shadow of a doubt is that we are

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.530 
shadow of a doubt is that we are
conscious<00:00:29.830> but<00:00:30.830> at<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.100> same<00:00:31.400> time<00:00:31.790> this<00:00:32.480> is

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
conscious but at the same time this is

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.260 
conscious but at the same time this is
probably<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.470> most<00:00:33.710> mysterious<00:00:34.310> phenomenon

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
in the universe most people think that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.300 
in the universe most people think that
consciousness<00:00:38.390> is<00:00:39.020> something<00:00:39.410> that<00:00:39.800> we<00:00:39.980> have

then<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.890> great<00:03:26.160> mystery<00:03:26.610> may<00:03:26.849> say<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.239> human

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
then the great mystery may say the human

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.900 
then the great mystery may say the human
species<00:03:27.780> was<00:03:28.319> an<00:03:28.500> interesting<00:03:29.040> experiment<00:03:29.400> it

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
species was an interesting experiment it

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.830 
species was an interesting experiment it
didn't<00:03:30.299> work<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.209> is<00:03:33.360> actually<00:03:33.540> the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
didn't work so that is actually the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.440 
didn't work so that is actually the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
human opportunity and the human job is

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.949 
human opportunity and the human job is
to<00:03:36.630> come<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.959> an<00:03:37.049> understanding<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.739> self

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
to come to an understanding of the self

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.270 
to come to an understanding of the self
even<00:03:39.959> if<00:03:40.080> you<00:03:40.170> call<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.590> understanding<00:03:41.220> the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
even if you call that understanding the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.199 
even if you call that understanding the
realisation<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.060> selflessness<00:03:43.970> maybe<00:03:44.970> it's

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
realisation of selflessness maybe it's

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.089 
realisation of selflessness maybe it's
time<00:03:45.420> for<00:03:45.480> science<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.590> accept<00:03:46.980> the

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
time for science to accept the

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.080 
time for science to accept the
discoveries<00:03:47.880> of<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.090> Mystics<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.040> consider

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
discoveries of the Mystics and consider

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.870 
discoveries of the Mystics and consider
consciousness<00:03:51.090> as<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.360> fundamental<00:03:52.140> block<00:03:53.069> of

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
consciousness as a fundamental block of

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.979 
consciousness as a fundamental block of
reality<00:03:54.540> like<00:03:54.750> mass<00:03:55.140> time<00:03:55.650> space<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.280> energy

reality like mass time space and energy

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.890 
reality like mass time space and energy
so<00:03:57.989> by<00:03:58.140> including<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:59.700> very<00:04:00.000> existence<00:04:00.450> of

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
so by including the very existence of

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.410 
so by including the very existence of
consciousness<00:04:01.140> in<00:04:02.099> our<00:04:02.340> thinking<00:04:02.610> we<00:04:03.329> are

consciousness in our thinking we are
coming<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.840> much<00:04:04.110> more<00:04:04.380> complete<00:04:05.250> view<00:04:06.000> of

coming to a much more complete view of
the<00:04:07.380> cosmos

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.160 

understanding<00:04:11.920> consciousness<00:04:12.480> is<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.810> key

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
understanding consciousness is the key

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.000 
understanding consciousness is the key
to<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.160> universe<00:04:16.079> reality<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.320> ourselves

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
to the universe reality and ourselves

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.380 
to the universe reality and ourselves
and<00:04:18.959> perhaps<00:04:19.959> is<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.950> missing<00:04:21.400> link<00:04:21.430> to

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
and perhaps is the missing link to

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.890 
and perhaps is the missing link to
bridge<00:04:23.160> science<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:24.370> spirituality<00:04:27.660> if<00:04:28.660> we

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
bridge science and spirituality if we

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.450 
bridge science and spirituality if we
