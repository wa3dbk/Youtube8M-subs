about neither the educators or the
parents<00:02:00.230> do<00:02:00.410> you<00:02:00.530> think<00:02:00.800> that<00:02:01.010> part<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.430> that

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
parents do you think that part of that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.190 
parents do you think that part of that
has<00:02:01.760> to<00:02:01.820> do<00:02:02.120> with<00:02:02.300> not<00:02:02.450> being<00:02:02.690> really<00:02:02.990> sure

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
has to do with not being really sure

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.860 
has to do with not being really sure
what<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.860> do<00:02:04.160> because<00:02:04.550> bullying<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.540> think<00:02:05.750> as

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
what to do because bullying I think as

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.359 
what to do because bullying I think as
escalated<00:02:06.470> we<00:02:06.560> talked<00:02:06.710> about<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.040> a<00:02:07.160> lot<00:02:07.310> and

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
escalated we talked about this a lot and

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.639 
escalated we talked about this a lot and
social<00:02:08.000> media<00:02:08.270> got<00:02:08.479> involved<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.110> in<00:02:09.560> the

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
social media got involved and in the

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.550 
social media got involved and in the
Internet<00:02:10.010> age<00:02:10.040> bullying<00:02:10.760> has<00:02:11.080> escalated<00:02:12.080> and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
Internet age bullying has escalated and

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.980 
Internet age bullying has escalated and
I<00:02:12.620> think<00:02:12.860> aggressions<00:02:13.430> tend<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.060> churn<00:02:14.630> up<00:02:14.870> a

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
I think aggressions tend to churn up a

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.610 
I think aggressions tend to churn up a
lot<00:02:15.200> more<00:02:15.670> frequently<00:02:16.670> these<00:02:17.450> days<00:02:17.510> even<00:02:18.260> than

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
lot more frequently these days even than

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.350 
lot more frequently these days even than
when<00:02:18.770> we<00:02:18.800> were<00:02:19.040> kids<00:02:19.280> but<00:02:19.820> do<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.090> think<00:02:20.150> maybe

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
when we were kids but do you think maybe

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.760 
when we were kids but do you think maybe
there<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.910> there<00:02:22.910> sort<00:02:23.180> of<00:02:23.270> just<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.630> a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
there is a there sort of just like a

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.980 
there is a there sort of just like a
they<00:02:24.770> have<00:02:24.950> absolutely<00:02:25.430> no<00:02:25.550> way<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> approach

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
they have absolutely no way to approach

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.320 
they have absolutely no way to approach
this<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.530> mean<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.920> think<00:02:28.400> there's<00:02:29.270> a

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
this I mean I think there's a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.290 
this I mean I think there's a
deniability<00:02:30.080> both<00:02:30.590> from<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.310> teachers<00:02:32.000> and

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
deniability both from the teachers and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.670 
deniability both from the teachers and
the<00:02:32.360> parents<00:02:32.570> because<00:02:33.080> we<00:02:33.230> don't<00:02:33.440> want<00:02:33.620> to

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
the parents because we don't want to

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.740 
the parents because we don't want to
believe<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:33.920> anyone<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.820> made<00:02:35.060> sure<00:02:35.390> we

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
believe that anyone is that made sure we

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.390 
believe that anyone is that made sure we
actually<00:02:36.260> don't<00:02:36.380> believe<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.890> when<00:02:37.070> we<00:02:37.190> hear

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
actually don't believe it when we hear

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.729 
actually don't believe it when we hear
these<00:02:37.550> horrendous<00:02:37.970> stories<00:02:38.540> but<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.440> think

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
these horrendous stories but I think

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:40.840 
these horrendous stories but I think
there's<00:02:39.890> something<00:02:40.100> else<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.519> think<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:40.820> all

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
there's something else I think we all

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.199 
there's something else I think we all
need<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.180> step<00:02:41.300> up<00:02:41.630> on<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.989> plate<00:02:42.230> meaning<00:02:42.920> if

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
need to step up on the plate meaning if

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.300 
need to step up on the plate meaning if
it<00:02:44.209> was<00:02:44.390> up<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.720> me<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.870> eradicate<00:02:45.560> bullying<00:02:46.070> I

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
it was up to me to eradicate bullying I

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.430 
it was up to me to eradicate bullying I
would<00:02:46.550> create<00:02:47.209> awareness<00:02:47.300> which<00:02:47.930> for<00:02:48.140> doing

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
would create awareness which for doing

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.650 
would create awareness which for doing
which<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.130> bully<00:02:49.430> movie<00:02:49.760> is<00:02:49.880> doing<00:02:50.239> but<00:02:50.480> there's

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
which a bully movie is doing but there's

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.720 
which a bully movie is doing but there's
so<00:02:50.930> many<00:02:51.170> forms<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.709> bullying<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.519> would

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
so many forms of bullying that I would

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.970 
so many forms of bullying that I would
say<00:02:52.970> we<00:02:53.180> need<00:02:53.360> at<00:02:53.540> least<00:02:53.570> 10<00:02:54.019> more<00:02:54.170> movies<00:02:54.530> sure

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
say we need at least 10 more movies sure

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.290 
say we need at least 10 more movies sure
because<00:02:55.640> we<00:02:56.360> only<00:02:56.570> had<00:02:56.989> a<00:02:57.019> certain<00:02:57.500> set<00:02:57.890> of

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
because we only had a certain set of

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.699 
because we only had a certain set of
kids<00:02:59.300> in<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.750> movie<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:00.709> they<00:03:00.950> were<00:03:01.450> typical

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
kids in the movie and they were typical

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.740 
kids in the movie and they were typical
and<00:03:03.709> there's<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.220> typical<00:03:04.670> too<00:03:04.910> sure<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:05.540> that's

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
and there's a typical too sure so that's

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.960 
and there's a typical too sure so that's
one<00:03:06.080> but<00:03:06.410> i<00:03:06.620> think<00:03:06.980> if<00:03:07.220> we<00:03:07.280> could<00:03:07.700> get<00:03:07.910> the

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
one but i think if we could get the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.210 
one but i think if we could get the
victim<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.870> bully<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.560> bystander

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
victim the bully and the bystander

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.800 
victim the bully and the bystander
together<00:03:10.549> including<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.390> by<00:03:11.480> center

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
together including the by center

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.130 
together including the by center
includes<00:03:12.170> friends<00:03:12.650> parents<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.340> teachers

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
includes friends parents and teachers

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.690 
includes friends parents and teachers
then<00:03:15.140> we<00:03:15.350> could<00:03:15.530> really<00:03:15.680> create<00:03:15.950> something<00:03:16.400> we

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
then we could really create something we

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.170 
then we could really create something we
could<00:03:16.880> learn<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.870> let<00:03:18.380> them<00:03:18.680> help<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.850> victim

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
could learn to let them help the victim

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.150 
could learn to let them help the victim
and<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.570> bully<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.290> stand<00:03:21.500> up<00:03:21.709> for<00:03:21.739> them

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
and the bully and to stand up for them

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.400 
and the bully and to stand up for them
and<00:03:22.760> we<00:03:22.880> don't<00:03:23.060> do<00:03:23.209> that<00:03:23.420> well<00:03:23.959> there's<00:03:24.200> such<00:03:24.380> a

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
and we don't do that well there's such a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.039 
and we don't do that well there's such a
stigma<00:03:24.769> I<00:03:25.010> think<00:03:25.400> still<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:26.570> not<00:03:26.810> be<00:03:27.019> a

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
stigma I think still to not be a

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.199 
stigma I think still to not be a
tattle-tale<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.220> lot<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.400> times<00:03:28.670> kids<00:03:28.790> feel

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
tattle-tale and a lot of times kids feel

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.670 
tattle-tale and a lot of times kids feel
this<00:03:29.360> pressure<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.959> keep<00:03:30.110> things<00:03:30.380> under<00:03:30.560> wraps

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
this pressure to keep things under wraps

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.199 
this pressure to keep things under wraps
even<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.190> kids<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:31.489> are<00:03:31.610> being<00:03:31.790> bullied

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
even the kids that are being bullied

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.000 
even the kids that are being bullied
feel<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:32.959> pressure<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.440> keep<00:03:33.590> things<00:03:33.830> under

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
feel this pressure to keep things under

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.979 
feel this pressure to keep things under
wraps<00:03:34.130> because<00:03:34.489> they<00:03:34.760> don't<00:03:35.030> want<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.959> be

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
wraps because they don't want to be

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.199 
wraps because they don't want to be
labeled<00:03:36.380> that<00:03:36.769> way<00:03:36.830> but<00:03:37.340> when<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:37.700> want<00:03:37.970> to
