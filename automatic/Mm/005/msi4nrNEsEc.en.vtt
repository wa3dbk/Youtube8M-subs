00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
success and that's what we did you know

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.410 
success and that's what we did you know
we're<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.129> kind<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.370> had<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> figure

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
we're just kind of had to figure

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.939 
we're just kind of had to figure
everything<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.770> took<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
everything out and you know it took a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.560 
everything out and you know it took a
while<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:02.489> once<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.789> did<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.449> they

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
while but once we did or think they

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.299 
while but once we did or think they
could<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:03.899> stop<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.589> think<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.189> an

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
could really stop it I think it was an

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.820 
could really stop it I think it was an
eye-opener<00:01:05.820> actually<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.570> know<00:01:06.689> when<00:01:07.290> he<00:01:07.470> cut

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
eye-opener actually you know when he cut

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.080 
eye-opener actually you know when he cut
it<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.490> there<00:01:08.670> was<00:01:08.729> nobody<00:01:08.909> there

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it up you know there was nobody there

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.000 
it up you know there was nobody there
because<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.659> were<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.930> minute<00:01:10.680> defense

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
because we were in a minute defense

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.649 
because we were in a minute defense
where<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.460> didn't<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.760> any<00:01:11.939> guys<00:01:12.090> back<00:01:12.360> so
