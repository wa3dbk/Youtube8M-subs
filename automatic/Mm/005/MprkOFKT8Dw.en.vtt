that it is waterproof so that's

how to remove the SIM card it's actually

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.840 
how to remove the SIM card it's actually
it<00:02:05.840> comes<00:02:06.079> in<00:02:06.259> two<00:02:06.710> different<00:02:06.740> languages<00:02:07.399> we

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
it comes in two different languages we

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.710 
it comes in two different languages we
see<00:02:08.060> here<00:02:08.330> English<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:09.020> Spanish<00:02:10.569> here<00:02:11.569> we

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
see here English and Spanish here we

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.110 
see here English and Spanish here we
have<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.680> device<00:02:12.980> itself<00:02:13.430> which<00:02:13.819> we're<00:02:14.000> going

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
have the device itself which we're going

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.930 
have the device itself which we're going
to<00:02:14.180> get<00:02:14.330> back<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:14.690> in<00:02:14.840> just<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.200> second<00:02:15.940> on

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
to get back to that in just a second on

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.230 
to get back to that in just a second on
the<00:02:17.180> inside<00:02:17.319> you<00:02:18.319> see<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:19.010> power<00:02:19.670> adapter

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
the inside you see the power adapter

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.810 
the inside you see the power adapter
which<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:20.840> actually<00:02:21.200> very<00:02:21.230> nice<00:02:21.710> and<00:02:22.130> square

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
which is actually very nice and square

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.210 
which is actually very nice and square
and<00:02:23.230> that's<00:02:24.230> actually<00:02:24.500> something<00:02:24.710> I<00:02:24.980> like

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
and that's actually something I like

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.970 
and that's actually something I like
about<00:02:25.340> Sony

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
about Sony

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.830 
about Sony
is<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.370> they're<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.879> little<00:02:27.090> bit<00:02:27.330> different

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
is that they're a little bit different

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.479 
is that they're a little bit different
when<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.080> comes<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.440> design<00:02:28.769> they<00:02:29.129> like<00:02:29.310> their

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
when it comes to design they like their

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.940 
when it comes to design they like their
phones<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.909> be<00:02:30.030> mostly<00:02:30.390> squared<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.110> I

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
phones to be mostly squared and I

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.619 
phones to be mostly squared and I
actually<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:32.580> because<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.299> gives<00:02:33.480> you

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
actually like that because it gives you

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.990 
actually like that because it gives you
a<00:02:33.659> feeling<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.349> having<00:02:34.560> let's<00:02:35.129> say<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.459> iPhone

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
a feeling of having let's say the iPhone

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.420 
a feeling of having let's say the iPhone
5s<00:02:36.530> body<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.860> know<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.040> gives<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.280> that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
5s body you know it gives you that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.949 
5s body you know it gives you that
feeling<00:02:38.700> but<00:02:39.060> at<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.209> same<00:02:39.420> time<00:02:39.659> you<00:02:39.840> have

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
I'm quite used to the LG g2 on the side

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.069 
I'm quite used to the LG g2 on the side
that<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.980> know<00:03:32.099> it<00:03:32.310> has<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.940> edge<00:03:33.419> to<00:03:33.900> edge

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
that you know it has the edge to edge

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.020 
that you know it has the edge to edge
screen<00:03:34.530> now<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.010> know<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.370> one<00:03:35.579> doesn't<00:03:35.730> have

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
screen now I know this one doesn't have

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.670 
screen now I know this one doesn't have
it<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.359> I'm<00:03:36.510> assuming<00:03:36.959> it's<00:03:37.109> because<00:03:37.410> of

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
it and I'm assuming it's because of

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.440 
it and I'm assuming it's because of
course<00:03:37.919> it<00:03:38.099> is<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.220> waterproof<00:03:38.609> so<00:03:39.060> maybe<00:03:39.239> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
course it is a waterproof so maybe the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.750 
course it is a waterproof so maybe the
sony<00:03:39.660> was<00:03:39.870> not<00:03:40.019> able<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.440> do<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.709> like<00:03:40.859> that<00:03:41.069> but

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
sony was not able to do it like that but

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.110 
sony was not able to do it like that but
here<00:03:42.299> in<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.450> front<00:03:42.720> we<00:03:42.900> had<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.200> 5<00:03:43.470> inch

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
so I really like that because you know

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.650 
so I really like that because you know
sometimes<00:04:40.520> you<00:04:40.640> want<00:04:40.820> to<00:04:40.880> access<00:04:41.000> your<00:04:41.270> camera

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
sometimes you want to access your camera

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.450 
sometimes you want to access your camera
instead<00:04:41.960> of<00:04:42.020> you<00:04:42.650> know<00:04:42.770> searching<00:04:43.100> throughout

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
instead of you know searching throughout

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.940 
instead of you know searching throughout
the<00:04:43.640> whole<00:04:43.970> operating<00:04:44.360> system<00:04:44.870> all<00:04:45.680> you<00:04:45.740> have

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
the whole operating system all you have

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.860 
the whole operating system all you have
to<00:04:46.070> do<00:04:46.190> just<00:04:46.310> press<00:04:46.550> this<00:04:46.700> button<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.600> it'll

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
to do just press this button and it'll

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.230 
to do just press this button and it'll
take<00:04:48.080> you<00:04:48.200> directly<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.680> it<00:04:49.010> and<00:04:49.250> then<00:04:49.760> here<00:04:50.090> we

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
take you directly to it and then here we

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.660 
take you directly to it and then here we
have<00:04:50.270> I<00:04:50.840> believe<00:04:51.590> this<00:04:51.860> is<00:04:51.920> going<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.220> be<00:04:52.400> if

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
have I believe this is going to be if

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.450 
have I believe this is going to be if
you<00:04:52.850> want<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.210> cert<00:04:54.080> your<00:04:54.230> SIM<00:04:54.440> card<00:04:54.740> so<00:04:55.340> the

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
you want to cert your SIM card so the

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.630 
you want to cert your SIM card so the
memory<00:04:55.760> is<00:04:56.060> upgradable<00:04:56.890> it<00:04:57.890> does<00:04:58.070> have<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.280> seal

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
memory is upgradable it does have a seal

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.460 
memory is upgradable it does have a seal
back<00:04:58.940> so<00:04:59.330> that's<00:04:59.690> why<00:04:59.810> they<00:04:59.990> did<00:05:00.140> it<00:05:00.170> on<00:05:00.350> the

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
back so that's why they did it on the

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.700 
back so that's why they did it on the
side<00:05:00.710> but<00:05:01.130> it's<00:05:01.460> definitely<00:05:01.610> great<00:05:02.120> because

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
side but it's definitely great because

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.220 
side but it's definitely great because
unlike<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:03.890> LG<00:05:04.400> g2<00:05:04.610> you<00:05:05.390> cannot<00:05:05.660> upgrade<00:05:05.900> the

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
unlike the LG g2 you cannot upgrade the

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.320 
unlike the LG g2 you cannot upgrade the
memory<00:05:06.380> and<00:05:06.800> this<00:05:07.070> one<00:05:07.340> comes<00:05:07.610> with<00:05:07.700> a<00:05:07.820> 32

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
memory and this one comes with a 32

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.720 
memory and this one comes with a 32
gigabytes<00:05:08.930> of<00:05:09.080> internal<00:05:09.260> memory<00:05:09.860> then<00:05:10.490> here

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
gigabytes of internal memory then here

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.610 
gigabytes of internal memory then here
on<00:05:10.790> the<00:05:10.880> side<00:05:11.120> we<00:05:11.720> have<00:05:11.750> so<00:05:12.140> that<00:05:12.290> you<00:05:12.440> can

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
on the side we have so that you can

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.830 
on the side we have so that you can
charge<00:05:12.830> it<00:05:13.040> you<00:05:13.370> have<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.670> USB<00:05:14.300> connector

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
charge it you have the USB connector

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.590 
charge it you have the USB connector
this<00:05:15.530> is<00:05:15.710> also<00:05:16.070> a<00:05:16.100> data<00:05:16.370> connector<00:05:16.970> alright

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
this is also a data connector alright

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.110 
this is also a data connector alright
then<00:05:18.200> here<00:05:18.380> we<00:05:18.530> have<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.950> magnetic<00:05:19.460> charger

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
then here we have a magnetic charger

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.120 
then here we have a magnetic charger
this<00:05:20.840> in<00:05:21.020> case<00:05:21.170> you<00:05:21.290> want<00:05:21.470> to<00:05:21.500> buy<00:05:21.650> you<00:05:22.040> know

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
this in case you want to buy you know

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.800 
this in case you want to buy you know
the<00:05:22.250> charging<00:05:22.640> port<00:05:22.880> and<00:05:23.210> you<00:05:23.510> want<00:05:23.720> to

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
the charging port and you want to

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.720 
the charging port and you want to
connect<00:05:24.110> it<00:05:24.200> to<00:05:24.260> it<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:24.680> also<00:05:25.280> I<00:05:25.310> believe<00:05:25.370> this

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
connect it to it and also I believe this

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.150 
connect it to it and also I believe this
serves<00:05:25.970> for<00:05:26.540> music<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:27.290> stuff<00:05:27.530> like<00:05:27.650> that<00:05:27.860> so

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
serves for music and stuff like that so

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.590 
serves for music and stuff like that so
that's<00:05:28.340> definitely<00:05:28.550> great<00:05:29.090> I<00:05:29.120> might<00:05:29.450> be

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
that's definitely great I might be

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.480 
that's definitely great I might be
getting<00:05:29.930> it<00:05:30.050> and<00:05:30.230> then<00:05:30.800> at<00:05:30.950> the<00:05:31.040> bottom<00:05:31.160> here

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
getting it and then at the bottom here

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.300 
getting it and then at the bottom here
we<00:05:31.520> have<00:05:31.700> the<00:05:32.030> loudspeaker<00:05:32.720> now<00:05:33.290> this<00:05:33.530> here<00:05:34.100> is

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
we have the loudspeaker now this here is
