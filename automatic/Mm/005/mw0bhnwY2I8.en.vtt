00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.710
 hello everyone i hope you 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.900
 okay today I really have the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.060
 pleasure to announce that I come 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.680
 to have the garage of more expensive gta 5 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.170
 why I spent a lot of time 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.670
 make this video just have it 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.490
 because I really wanted to do it at 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.260
 background because 100% it means to see 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.119
 the cars maximum years their abilities 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.009
 so what was hard to get 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.329
 now I managed to do it so 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.910
 here is a little catalog of 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.770
 most expensive cars I have 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.760
 of the half of the collection of which 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.559
 sure what is technically possible 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.460
 so that's gone I want to open my 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.559
 sesame from home 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.579
 So here all the cars are in percent 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.219
 percent of their capacity 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.280
 I am grade without so actually 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.070
 the shields are 100% so the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.860
 engines at gear ratios the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.890
 turbo everything is 100% so after the 50 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.750
 races I won more than 350 and I 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.800
 I was also lit 1% times so 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.229
 as anything is not clear, therefore, 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.150
 I also have three bikes so a little bit 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.040
 varied so let's talk about cars whose 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.840
 cars are the most expensive of the game do not 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.540
 are not necessarily the best so 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.250
 it's not super cars there were 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.450
 even free cars that have the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.770
 same power on a little bit 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.420
 less but not necessarily needed 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.240
 to have all these beautiful cars to 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.530
 100% and the armor will not serve you 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.479
 big thing why am I saying that because 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.130
 an enemy for one always shoot you down 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.659
 easily even if you have shielding 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.890
 at 100% because I thought that from 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.750
 100 % you will make an effort at 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.890
 level be at the windows but 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.020
 bullet-proof glass 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.280
 it's not done thing what is 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.110
 pity so I show you a little bit 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.579
 my statistics or six why you 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.220
 lie so the garage cost me 20 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.140
 million euros and yeah that's one of 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.640
 more expensive of the game so after that is 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.770
 not a matter of boasting it's a 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.060
 management more to show you that that 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.590
 not necessarily much to have 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.700
 all the executioners boli all the big ones 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.090
 cars and his lands at full 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.130
 power 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.170
 knowing that it's going to cost you very, very 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.509
 expensive and it's not going to serve you big 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.950
 thing and at the same time I wanted a little 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.659
 take my time to make this video 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.670
 there why because I was grade 70 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.950
 and it would be lying to say that I saw 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.740
 I had everything thoroughly knowing that 70 is 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.989
 does not necessarily have the 100% shielding that 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.110
 there I am grade without pile pile so 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.330
 I really have 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.130
 and everything thoroughly and it is not great 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.230
 so that's it for those who have 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.270
 asked where also to be able a little bit 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.070
 show them a little bit 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.840
 cars in action it's going to happen 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.220
 in an upcoming video so that was 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.170
 just to show you my guy my 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.900
 crazy garage in fact since there it has me 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.750
 really beat and I spent eight days 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.450
 of play on gta so ginks I got 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.700
 ruined to play gta so here you are 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.560
 have a little bit more my universe so 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.610
 I hope you liked the friends so 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.420
 do not hesitate to tell me what is really 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.560
 what do you think it is 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.020
 really helpful to have all that kind of 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.730
 car for me no and after that is 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.640
 not a video to show on the contrary 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.380
 it's more to tell you to play with the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.850
 cars that you think are ok 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.260
 it's nothing like having 10 knowing that 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.860
 10 you will not necessarily play with 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.870
 all cars 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.760
 so here and there with a car 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.140
 which disappeared that of 0.07 that I 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.550
 withdrawn that serves strictly for nothing 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.810
 I also had it in chrome or friends 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.489
 wear well take care of yourself at 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.170
 soon big boxes urs portiez 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.030
 you can put the logo in front of 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.500
 on the side that there is nothing of the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.870
 everything so after a little combination 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.570
 which is not bad it's the cros the chrome 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.770
 and in fang version so that makes the 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.510
 color of course of your big mine 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.430
 and green so that's why I have the 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.650
 green color is assured after each 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.510
 his sketch color will be his own 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.920
 or it is his leader who initiated the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.480
 color in your clan have of course 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.430
 after we could not change her 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.890
 his islands and that leader who can in 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.470
 decide have the benefit of having his clan 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.250
 it is to be able to test a lot of 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.250
 things and m
