 new amplifiers new designs and new 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.279
 ear pads box also changed 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.650
 naturally changed because 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.230
 changed the design of the headphones themselves here 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.170
 we are written beats tour on the right 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.849
 side it says peppa parker im all the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.789
 music type 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.660
 Dr. Dre's slogan behind us is written 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.630
 equipment 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.309
 too dry headphones themselves and their like 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.140
 distinctive features about others 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.940
 headphone 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.510
 here we have written big sound 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.309
 but below us is natural barcodes 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.399
 the box opens as usual 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.510
 this is the image of most pure red 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.850
 box with logo bets onion b 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.930
 opens up on the enemy that's when we 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.180
 open the box we see the headphones themselves 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.719
 right and left we see the instruction and 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.380
 stickers 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:11.510
 let's see what we have envelopes 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.130
 open it here we are 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.330
 instruction manual data 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.990
 headphones and no this directory sorry this 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.630
 catalog 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.049
 their new products are astounding which 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:31.520
 completely changed the sticker 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.520
 baits warranty information and 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.119
 Well, some information on the data 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.430
 headphones further we have to beat the sash 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.500
 ejects it is obvious instruction where 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.079
 are described in controls because 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.649
 the scientific also the right their specially ear 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.750
 inserts about which I will tell later 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.610
 so now we get such 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.579
 Cardboard with headphones and below us 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.240
 It is a case that is very much the way 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.680
 comfortable zipper here in our zipper 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.119
 red color that is something square 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.479
 Type red about lines with such 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.140
 pocket and he is naturally very hard 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.489
 conveniently 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:16.390
 here we have the usual ear plugs 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:19.220
 for different sizes of terrible openings 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.550
 but they are so unusual 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.160
 liners who dress below normal 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.760
 France and now these things they do not give 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.459
 here's your ear headphones move then 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.580
 there so that you put them like 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.959
 resist being committed from the moment that 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.209
 wire can someone you sod if you 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.040
 become friends for the staff hook headphones 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.310
 from your on fire will not fly out 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.599
 it is also very convenient so let's now 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:51.730
 let's go with you headphones held in 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.730
 such practice boxes get 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.900
 here we have new beats headphones 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.660
 revisions 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.630
 they look very stylish we are better than 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.680
 beats tour leading people who 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.239
 They looked like this 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.390
 I liked the construction itself 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.880
 part she is flexible i mean i wire you not 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.190
 break off nothing they look enough 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.340
 modestly enough throw throw then 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.090
 there is everything as it is observed in the balance well 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.560
 probably the most important thing is that they 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.989
 sound much better than the previous revision 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.870
 somewhere did not think at least two times 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.019
 that is to be honest was surprised and they 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.720
 have a new remote control it looks like 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.040
 as follows zoom button 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.850
 volume down 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.569
 pause playback and answer the call 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.790
 here we have such a little thing written beats 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.950
 flat cable as usual and natural 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.670
 you a new plug that looks like this 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.530
 so very cool in my opinion really 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.760
 everything looks very strong but 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.489
 the only thing I don't like when 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.380
 insert went to the earpiece but the cable in 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.420
 phone but so here sticks out 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.780
 and here's my opinion on possible 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:10.280
 the fracture of the cable itself sound these scientific 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.950
 naturally very very good at them 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.230
 very good bass good top in 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.519
 In principle, this is probably one of the most 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.810
 the best liners you can 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.470
 see the market 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.120
 they cost about 150 euros with taxes then 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.480
 if there is no headset for taxes 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.210
 cost at 125 euros is almost well 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.460
 In short, in Russia it will be taken 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.800
 578 thousand rubles naturally 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.780
 expensive but for that you get 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.720
 stylish headphones with good quality 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.240
 sounding naturalness their branded 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.030
 bass which are not littered and not 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.160
 reduced that is music sounds very 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.460
 very cool also you get 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.620
 cool case and of course you 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.630
 get how to add to your 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.720
 the image of these headphones than very suitable 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.830
 youth that is precisely teenagers 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.440
 major buy so I advise everyone 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.360
 in buying them, they are very, very good 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.500
 sit in the ears that is what you see as they have 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.600
 such a curved shape that's basically all 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.570
