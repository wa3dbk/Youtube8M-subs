muscles<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:35.570> little<00:01:35.780> bit<00:01:37.720> so<00:01:38.720> in<00:01:38.810> your<00:01:38.870> eggs

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
muscles a little bit so in your eggs

muscles a little bit so in your eggs
double<00:01:39.320> in<00:01:39.410> volume<00:01:39.530> like<00:01:39.890> this<00:01:40.100> this<00:01:40.400> is<00:01:40.550> when

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
double in volume like this this is when

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.280 
double in volume like this this is when
you<00:01:40.760> start<00:01:41.030> adding<00:01:41.120> the<00:01:41.330> sugar<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.110> want

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
you start adding the sugar and you want

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:51.719 
you start adding the sugar and you want
to<00:01:42.350> add<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.470> little<00:01:42.890> bit<00:01:43.010> at<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.190> time

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.249 

and<00:01:52.090> you'll<00:01:52.479> feel<00:01:52.659> it<00:01:52.719> start<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.110> become

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
and you'll feel it start to become

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.170 
and you'll feel it start to become
slightly<00:01:53.710> stiffer<00:01:56.520> though<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.670> reason<00:01:57.969> I<00:01:58.030> use

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
slightly stiffer though the reason I use

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.149 
slightly stiffer though the reason I use
coconut<00:01:58.390> sugar<00:01:58.750> is<00:01:59.079> because<00:01:59.649> it's<00:01:59.950> got<00:02:00.100> a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
coconut sugar is because it's got a

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.850 
coconut sugar is because it's got a
lower<00:02:00.399> glycemic<00:02:00.640> index<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.659> normal<00:02:01.960> sugar<00:02:02.110> it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
lower glycemic index to normal sugar it

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.100 
lower glycemic index to normal sugar it
also<00:02:03.039> has<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.340> really<00:02:03.880> amazing<00:02:04.329> rich<00:02:04.600> caramel
