00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.499 
but I've learned in the last year on
these<00:00:03.899> spraybibs<00:00:04.380> it<00:00:04.950> seems<00:00:05.250> like<00:00:05.460> before<00:00:06.210> a

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
these spraybibs it seems like before a

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.480 
these spraybibs it seems like before a
tyre<00:00:07.020> was<00:00:07.170> attire<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.680> me<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:08.069> know<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.250> just

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
kind of kind of dealt with it because it

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.990 
kind of kind of dealt with it because it

the<00:00:12.690> michelin<00:00:13.080> spraybib<00:00:13.200> tires<00:00:13.559> I've<00:00:14.190> been

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
the michelin spraybib tires I've been

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.750 
the michelin spraybib tires I've been
running<00:00:14.700> for<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.000> little<00:00:15.509> over<00:00:15.809> two<00:00:16.020> years<00:00:16.049> now

running for a little over two years now
I've<00:00:17.760> been<00:00:17.820> highly<00:00:18.480> impressed<00:00:18.840> with<00:00:19.050> the

I've been highly impressed with the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.769 
I've been highly impressed with the
spraybib<00:00:19.590> tires<00:00:19.619> these<00:00:20.430> tires<00:00:21.330> right<00:00:21.570> here

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779

spraybib tires these tires right here
the<00:00:21.840> spraybibs<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:23.029> for<00:00:24.029> air<00:00:24.330> pressure

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
the spraybibs here for air pressure

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.570 
the spraybibs here for air pressure
we've<00:00:25.109> been<00:00:25.260> running<00:00:25.470> 44<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.220> front<00:00:26.490> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
we've been running 44 in the front and

we've been running 44 in the front and
34<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.180> back<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.900> got<00:00:28.050> real<00:00:28.320> got<00:00:28.830> along

34 in the back and got real got along

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.740 
34 in the back and got real got along
with<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.340> great<00:00:29.550> before<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.330> always<00:00:30.570> had<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
with it great before we always had to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.939 
with it great before we always had to
had<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.410> run<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.590> that

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
had to run like that

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.030 
had to run like that
50<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.550> 60<00:00:32.940> pounds<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.390> psi<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.590> seems<00:00:34.890> like

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
50 to 60 pounds of psi and it seems like

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.479 
50 to 60 pounds of psi and it seems like
for<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.340> weather<00:00:35.820> spraybibs<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.570> 44<00:00:37.200> 134<00:00:37.829> it

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
for that weather spraybibs a 44 134 it

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.400 
for that weather spraybibs a 44 134 it
actually<00:00:38.879> rides<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.210> lot<00:00:39.360> nicer<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.020> seems<00:00:40.260> like

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
actually rides a lot nicer it seems like

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.229 
actually rides a lot nicer it seems like
it<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.860> floats<00:00:41.250> over<00:00:41.460> any<00:00:41.760> bump<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.149> little

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
it just floats over any bump a little

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.869 
it just floats over any bump a little
bit<00:00:42.450> better<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.770> 50<00:00:44.070> or<00:00:44.100> 60<00:00:44.460> pounds

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
bit better you know that 50 or 60 pounds

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.459 
bit better you know that 50 or 60 pounds
it's<00:00:45.090> almost<00:00:45.360> feels<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:45.930> you're<00:00:46.140> riding<00:00:46.289> on

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it's almost feels like you're riding on

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.920 
it's almost feels like you're riding on
concrete<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.070> times<00:00:47.280> too<00:00:47.550> or<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.239> know<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
concrete at times too or you know just a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.540 
concrete at times too or you know just a
steel<00:00:49.230> rim<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.010> there's<00:00:50.160> no<00:00:50.370> way

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
steel rim there and there's no way

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.180 
steel rim there and there's no way
they'll<00:00:50.969> give<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> all<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.170> ride<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.829> twice<00:00:53.160> as

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
they'll give it all the ride is twice as

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.670 
they'll give it all the ride is twice as
smooth<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:54.090> any<00:00:54.270> other<00:00:54.480> time<00:00:54.750> ever<00:00:54.960> ran<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
smooth as any other time ever ran and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.000 
smooth as any other time ever ran and
like<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.460> down<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.789> road<00:00:57.000> with<00:00:57.210> these<00:00:57.360> I'm

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
like going down the road with these I'm

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.830 
like going down the road with these I'm
with<00:00:59.010> these<00:00:59.190> spraybibs<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.270> seems<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.660> they

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
with these spraybibs it seems like they

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.479 
with these spraybibs it seems like they
ride<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> lot<00:01:01.320> nicer<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.920> my<00:01:02.010> favorite<00:01:02.340> thing

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
ride a lot nicer it's my favorite thing

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.210 
ride a lot nicer it's my favorite thing
about<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.879> spraybibs<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.660> uh<00:01:03.830> you<00:01:04.830> didn't<00:01:05.129> you

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
about the spraybibs is uh you didn't you

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.520 
about the spraybibs is uh you didn't you
never<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.909> worry<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.510> having<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> flat

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
never have to worry about having a flat

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.640 
never have to worry about having a flat
tire<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> flotation<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
tire and the it's just the flotation of

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.920 
tire and the it's just the flotation of
them.the<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.939> footprint<00:01:12.420> out<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> field

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
them.the the footprint out in the field

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.410 
them.the the footprint out in the field
you're<00:01:13.710> they<00:01:13.979> carry<00:01:14.280> nicer<00:01:14.820> they<00:01:15.150> make<00:01:15.330> your

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
you're they carry nicer they make your

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.080 
you're they carry nicer they make your
machine<00:01:15.570> run<00:01:15.960> nicer<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.590> mean<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
machine run nicer I mean this the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.480 
machine run nicer I mean this the
comfort<00:01:18.659> zone<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.930> riding<00:01:19.439> as<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.710> being<00:01:20.430> an

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
comfort zone of riding as a being an

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
comfort zone of riding as a being an
operator<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.659> you're<00:01:21.810> not<00:01:21.900> seems<00:01:22.439> like

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
operator you know you're not seems like

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.170 
operator you know you're not seems like
if<00:01:22.950> you're<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.130> some<00:01:23.340> rough<00:01:23.520> terrain<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.970> seems

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
if you're on some rough terrain it seems

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330 
if you're on some rough terrain it seems
like<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.509> moves<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.080> some<00:01:25.350> I've<00:01:25.950> noticed

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
like it's moves it up some I've noticed

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.890 
like it's moves it up some I've noticed
when<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.610> fields<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:27.119> soft<00:01:27.450> because<00:01:27.750> they're

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
when the fields are soft because they're

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.600 
when the fields are soft because they're
a<00:01:27.930> little<00:01:28.020> bit<00:01:28.170> muddy<00:01:28.350> you're<00:01:28.920> less<00:01:29.130> likely<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
a little bit muddy you're less likely to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.600 
a little bit muddy you're less likely to
spin<00:01:29.970> your<00:01:30.119> tires<00:01:30.229> because<00:01:31.400> these<00:01:32.400> are<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
spin your tires because these are the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.429 
spin your tires because these are the
low<00:01:32.790> air<00:01:33.030> pressure<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.720> spraybibs

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
low air pressure on the spraybibs

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.039 
low air pressure on the spraybibs
you<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> longer<00:01:35.189> footprint<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.960> they

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you have a longer footprint so that they

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.810 
you have a longer footprint so that they
actually<00:01:37.140> grip<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.710> ground<00:01:37.950> more<00:01:38.250> instead<00:01:38.729> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
actually grip the ground more instead of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.520 
actually grip the ground more instead of
actually<00:01:39.150> spinning<00:01:39.479> I've<00:01:39.750> noticed<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
actually spinning I've noticed with the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.620 
actually spinning I've noticed with the
spirit<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> michelin<00:01:41.820> spraybib<00:01:41.939> z'<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
spirit and the michelin spraybib z' that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.260 
spirit and the michelin spraybib z' that
when<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.840> get<00:01:42.990> into<00:01:43.140> wet<00:01:43.979> field<00:01:44.670> conditions

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
when you get into wet field conditions

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.870 
when you get into wet field conditions
that<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.380> tires<00:01:46.619> actually<00:01:47.130> clean<00:01:47.369> out<00:01:47.399> very

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
that the tires actually clean out very

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.499 
that the tires actually clean out very
well

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
well

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.480 
well
and<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.409> don't<00:01:49.530> worry<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.950> mean<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> mud

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
and so you don't worry I mean the mud

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.300 
and so you don't worry I mean the mud
doesn't<00:01:50.790> pack<00:01:51.000> into<00:01:51.299> them<00:01:51.659> at<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
doesn't pack into them at all with the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.120 
doesn't pack into them at all with the
spraybib<00:01:53.880> tires<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.960> sidewall<00:01:55.530> will<00:01:55.680> flex<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
spraybib tires the sidewall will flex is

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.280 
spraybib tires the sidewall will flex is
enough<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.360> helps<00:01:57.659> keep<00:01:57.869> you

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
enough that actually helps keep you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.109 
enough that actually helps keep you
between<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.860> rows<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.700> can<00:02:00.000> actually

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
between the rows and you can actually

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.819 
between the rows and you can actually
feel<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> front<00:02:00.840> end<00:02:00.990> moving<00:02:01.320> instead<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
feel the front end moving instead of the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.620 
feel the front end moving instead of the
whole<00:02:02.130> machine<00:02:02.280> moving<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
whole machine moving like that with the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.359 
whole machine moving like that with the
titans<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.439> get<00:02:04.619> into<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.890> field<00:02:05.189> that

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
titans if you get into a field that

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.830 
titans if you get into a field that
they've<00:02:05.549> just<00:02:05.729> shut<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> pivot<00:02:06.360> off<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.689> and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
they've just shut the pivot off on and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.809 
they've just shut the pivot off on and
it's<00:02:07.049> actually<00:02:07.439> muddy<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:08.399> actually<00:02:08.729> are

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
it's actually muddy you actually are

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.639 
it's actually muddy you actually are
able<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.119> travel<00:02:09.390> through<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.869> rows<00:02:10.080> easier

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
able to travel through the rows easier

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.890 
able to travel through the rows easier
and<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> spraybibs<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.180> haven't<00:02:12.720> had<00:02:12.870> a

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and with the spraybibs I haven't had a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.880 
and with the spraybibs I haven't had a
flat<00:02:13.170> yet<00:02:13.379> or<00:02:13.500> nothing

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
flat yet or nothing

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.730 
flat yet or nothing
just<00:02:14.790> all<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.390> did<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:15.660> rotate<00:02:16.050> them<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.500> last

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
just all I did is rotate them this last

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.960 
just all I did is rotate them this last
winter<00:02:16.980> just<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.340> see<00:02:17.490> if<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:17.730> get<00:02:17.819> some

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
winter just to see if I can get some

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.790 
winter just to see if I can get some
more<00:02:18.030> life<00:02:18.270> out<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.510> them<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.840> went<00:02:19.290> down<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.740> know

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
more life out of them I went down I know

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.380 
more life out of them I went down I know
I'll<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.340> year<00:02:20.550> out<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.790> him<00:02:20.910> maybe

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
I'll get this year out of him maybe

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.449 
I'll get this year out of him maybe
possibly<00:02:22.319> another<00:02:22.709> than<00:02:22.920> other<00:02:23.069> year<00:02:23.250> after

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
possibly another than other year after

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.490 
possibly another than other year after
that<00:02:23.610> it'll<00:02:23.790> be<00:02:23.850> almost<00:02:24.750> three<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.050> four<00:02:25.290> years

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
that it'll be almost three to four years

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.440 
that it'll be almost three to four years
on<00:02:25.650> them<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.490> know<00:02:26.790> for<00:02:27.060> sure<00:02:27.090> we'll<00:02:27.360> get

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
on them but I know for sure we'll get

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.120 
on them but I know for sure we'll get
three<00:02:27.720> out<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.900> them<00:02:28.140> we<00:02:28.500> currently<00:02:28.740> have

three out of them we currently have

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.370 
three out of them we currently have
about<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.459> thousand<00:02:30.420> four<00:02:30.570> hundred<00:02:30.660> hours<00:02:31.110> on

about a thousand four hundred hours on

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
the michelin spraybib z-- I have noticed

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.010 
the michelin spraybib z-- I have noticed
that<00:02:34.860> after<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.400> bad<00:02:36.120> many<00:02:36.390> hours<00:02:36.720> put<00:02:36.900> on

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
that after the bad many hours put on

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.420 
that after the bad many hours put on
them<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.410> back<00:02:37.590> tires<00:02:37.890> almost<00:02:38.220> look

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
them that the back tires almost look

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.300 
them that the back tires almost look
almost<00:02:39.150> brand<00:02:39.420> new<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.959> edges<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.980> lugs<00:02:41.190> have
