00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
resolution of about 1700 x 960 this

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.050 
resolution of about 1700 x 960 this
means<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.700> pixel<00:01:51.180> density<00:01:51.659> will<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:53.060> 416

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
means the pixel density will be 416
