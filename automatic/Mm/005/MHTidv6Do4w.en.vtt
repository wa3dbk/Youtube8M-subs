00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.440 
I use for all my virgin hair in it and
that<00:01:23.040> helps<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> little<00:01:23.880> bit<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.210> not<00:01:24.270> that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
that helps a little bit but not that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.039 
that helps a little bit but not that
much<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:25.320> still<00:01:25.830> was<00:01:25.979> frizzy<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.299> when<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.689> curl

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
much it still was frizzy and when I curl

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.560 
much it still was frizzy and when I curl
my<00:01:28.080> hair<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.680> lawn<00:01:28.860> or<00:01:29.299> flat<00:01:30.299> iron

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
my hair with the lawn or flat iron

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.380 
my hair with the lawn or flat iron
anything<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.350> course<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.770> use<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:33.060> hebert

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
anything of course I use this my hebert

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.469 
anything of course I use this my hebert
open<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.710> when<00:01:35.340> L<00:01:35.549> sometimes<00:01:36.060> out<00:01:36.270> where<00:01:36.450> my

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
open and when L sometimes out where my

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.060 
open and when L sometimes out where my
hair<00:01:36.750> blow-dry<00:01:37.200> straight<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.829> think

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
hair blow-dry straight and I think

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.330 
hair blow-dry straight and I think
that's<00:01:38.299> why<00:01:39.299> my<00:01:40.020> head<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.500> split<00:01:40.770> isn't<00:01:41.130> had<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that's why my head so split isn't had to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.410 
that's why my head so split isn't had to
cut<00:01:41.520> my<00:01:41.640> hair

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
cut my hair

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.120 
cut my hair
that's<00:01:42.570> why<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.780> curls<00:01:43.110> coming<00:01:43.680> down<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.979> blow

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
that's why the curls coming down to blow
