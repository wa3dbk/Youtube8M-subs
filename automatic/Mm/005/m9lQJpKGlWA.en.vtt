00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.750 
post a video later on that I've actually
installing<00:01:31.479> it<00:01:31.750> but<00:01:32.500> you<00:01:32.920> take<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.159> door<00:01:33.520> off

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.929 
installing it but you take the door off
your<00:01:34.150> battery<00:01:35.220> battery<00:01:36.220> compartment<00:01:36.700> on<00:01:36.729> your

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
your battery battery compartment on your

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.179 
your battery battery compartment on your
camera<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.570> it<00:01:38.020> slides<00:01:38.350> in<00:01:38.710> here<00:01:38.950> so<00:01:39.100> you

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
camera and it slides in here so you

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.039 
camera and it slides in here so you
don't<00:01:39.220> lose<00:01:39.520> it<00:01:39.549> which<00:01:39.939> is<00:01:40.090> great<00:01:40.540> because<00:01:40.869> I

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
don't lose it which is great because I

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.830 
don't lose it which is great because I
probably<00:01:41.259> would<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.880> back<00:01:43.060> here<00:01:43.479> you've

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
probably would then the back here you've

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.630 
probably would then the back here you've
got<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:44.049> compartment<00:01:44.650> which<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:45.009> open<00:01:45.280> up<00:01:45.400> and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
got a compartment which you open up and

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.179 
got a compartment which you open up and
it<00:01:45.729> has<00:01:46.479> your<00:01:46.689> batteries<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:48.150> then<00:01:49.150> I<00:01:50.189> think

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
it has your batteries and then I think

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.149 
it has your batteries and then I think
that's<00:01:51.369> about<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.780> looks<00:01:52.780> good<00:01:53.049> ready<00:01:53.829> to<00:01:53.979> try

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
that's about it looks good ready to try

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.560 
that's about it looks good ready to try
it<00:01:54.220> on

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:05.730
