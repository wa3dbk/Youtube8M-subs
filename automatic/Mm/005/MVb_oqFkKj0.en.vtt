00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 friends my name is giancarlo today we go 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.839
 to draw the bicycle 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.760
 super sayayin phase and god the blue good 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.970
 so let's start the first thing we're going 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.059
 to do is going to be like a kind of m 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.360
 in this way that it will be like the 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.689
 division between head and face and 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.300
 the face here would come what is 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.220
 its pin or in our part like this the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.290
 hairstyle 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:35.820
 already going through here we're going to download this line 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.820
 and we are going to make the face 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.660
 in this way here he has the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.390
 ears is not obvious 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.370
 and it would not be here 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.720
 the other ear 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:57.230
 let's draw the hair let's do 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:02.390
 four hairs up 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:05.750
 in this way the third would come here 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.670
 the fourth and the largest that is like the 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.440
 from the center that is the fifth but then 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.050
 already from here we will begin to 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.210
 draw another four 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.909
 more or less like that we will leave it well 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.109
 bulging veggie hair 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.109
 would come here 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.400
 here yes we already have the four here 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.560
 another hair comes out behind the ear and 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.770
 the same here behind this one 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.390
 ear 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.650
 let's do the internal part of the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.040
 ear 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.680
 with these as feces and we are going now to 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.680
 draw the eyes good 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.190
 and the eyes 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.340
 eyebrows eyebrows are blue 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.170
 good if you want to see how how 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.610
 is this drawing painted then they 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.590
 I recommend that you go through my second 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.830
 channel or here I will be leaving the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.750
 link 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.810
 the same here we will do the back of 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.329
 our diet 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.539
 over here is a bit of a bad temper like 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.060
 forever 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.170
 over here we're going to do the nose 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.620
 a kind of j mouth smiling little 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.620
 evil 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.130
 something like that 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.710
 we will make these two lines on the forehead 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.590
 and a hair poops in the middle 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.270
 good friends we keep drawing the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.160
 neck then let's stop by out 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.050
 lines we join 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.980
 keep doing the collar of the shirt 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.430
 of vegueta 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.560
 let's make two small lines what 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.560
 same we are going to join them 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:55.640
 we will make this curved line in each part and 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.640
 We assume the same 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.780
 vision of 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.610
 and here 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.610
 let's go down pro line 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.990
 thus 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.300
 It has to be like this same way 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.680
 in this part because here I would leave 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.079
 arm 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.079
 let's do the same thing on this side 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.040
 and let's go down here this line a little bit 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.040
 in diagonal 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:32.190
 same here 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:35.140
 we join them and here would come 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.410
 this part of him 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.240
 the vegan dress 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.520
 let's go up here that we have to 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.220
 stay like this with a peak and here would have 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.040
 to go out as a good pentagon with 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:51.680
 this figure so five-pointed 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.290
 We will live in various parts 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.180
 something like that 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.180
 let's review this part 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:08.560
 let's make here the emblem of this 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:10.510
 new generation we are going to divide here 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.390
 let's mark here what would be 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.290
 like his pecs 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.290
 the neck 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.710
 here in the belt 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.360
 and then below the feet would come 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.000
 let's draw the arms then to 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.670
 that we are going from this corner and 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.860
 let's make a muscle with this 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.190
 muscle then this part of here 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.050
 up we're going to lower this way two 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:44.360
 curve lines 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.360
 and here back I would go to another 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.610
 this way, here I would have the 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:56.500
 glove that uses vegueta 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:58.560
 let's make the other muscle like that 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.340
 we will first do this how is it going 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.340
 we will go down two lines 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:14.360
 and we would do the line here we would take another 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.360
 something like that and here we will make the glove 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.050
 and ready 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.060
 let's see here in the hair too 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.020
 have 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.300
 a couple of lines we are going to do 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.160
 and good friends already know this video what 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.720
 let's see painted on my second channel 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.120
 and load 2.0 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.710
 Then do not forget to stop by the them 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.409
 I'm going to be leaving the link here 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.509

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.729
 subscribe if you are not subscribed 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:45.249

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.589
 last characters do not forget to leave your 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:49.119
