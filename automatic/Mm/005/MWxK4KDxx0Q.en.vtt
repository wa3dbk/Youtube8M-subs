discovered in Houston it's a little bit

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.910 
discovered in Houston it's a little bit
more<00:00:37.120> challenging<00:00:37.660> because<00:00:37.840> of<00:00:37.960> our<00:00:38.230> humid

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
more challenging because of our humid

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.700 
more challenging because of our humid
climate<00:00:39.850> they're<00:00:40.060> mostly<00:00:40.420> used<00:00:40.720> to<00:00:40.900> dry<00:00:41.290> heat

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710

and as you fellow Estonians now there's

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.740 
and as you fellow Estonians now there's
no<00:00:44.740> such<00:00:44.980> thing<00:00:45.280> as<00:00:45.460> dry<00:00:45.850> heat<00:00:46.180> here<00:00:46.450> in<00:00:46.480> town<00:00:46.720> I

no such thing as dry heat here in town I

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
no such thing as dry heat here in town I
mean<00:00:46.930> right<00:00:47.110> now<00:00:47.140> I<00:00:47.290> feel<00:00:47.530> like<00:00:47.560> I'm

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
mean right now I feel like I'm

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.580 
mean right now I feel like I'm
glistening<00:00:48.310> like<00:00:48.630> Edward<00:00:49.630> on<00:00:49.810> Twilight<00:00:50.350> it

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
glistening like Edward on Twilight it

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.220 
glistening like Edward on Twilight it
has<00:00:51.160> lots<00:00:51.430> of<00:00:51.550> foliage<00:00:51.790> as<00:00:52.540> you<00:00:52.660> can<00:00:52.840> see<00:00:53.050> it's

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
has lots of foliage as you can see it's

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.410 
has lots of foliage as you can see it's
very<00:00:53.500> green<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.220> I<00:00:54.310> think<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.820> is<00:00:55.239> a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
very green and I think that is a

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.900 
very green and I think that is a
testament<00:00:55.989> to<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.500> amount<00:00:57.310> of<00:00:57.460> rain<00:00:57.700> it's

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
testament to the amount of rain it's

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.160 
testament to the amount of rain it's
beginning<00:00:58.180> I<00:00:58.360> think<00:00:58.540> there<00:00:58.660> must<00:00:58.840> be<00:00:58.960> some

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
beginning I think there must be some

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.720 
beginning I think there must be some
nitrogen<00:00:59.649> in<00:00:59.739> the<00:00:59.829> rain<00:00:59.980> because<00:01:00.310> every<00:01:00.520> time

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
nitrogen in the rain because every time

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.520 
nitrogen in the rain because every time
it<00:01:01.180> rains<00:01:01.510> everything<00:01:02.050> greens<00:01:02.560> up<00:01:02.860> and<00:01:03.310> has<00:01:03.880> a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it rains everything greens up and has a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.110 
it rains everything greens up and has a
persian<00:01:05.530> of<00:01:05.650> growth<00:01:06.070> I'm<00:01:06.310> wondering<00:01:06.820> if<00:01:06.970> it's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
persian of growth I'm wondering if it's

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.719 
persian of growth I'm wondering if it's
getting<00:01:07.300> too<00:01:07.840> much<00:01:07.990> water<00:01:08.430> because<00:01:09.430> of<00:01:09.640> the

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
getting too much water because of the

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.670 
getting too much water because of the
rain<00:01:09.940> I<00:01:10.240> mean<00:01:10.420> I<00:01:10.479> haven't<00:01:10.840> had<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.080> run<00:01:11.260> my<00:01:11.409> drip

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.219 
irrigation but once in the last 2 or 3
weeks<00:01:15.280> because<00:01:15.790> we've<00:01:15.940> had<00:01:16.090> so<00:01:16.450> much<00:01:16.630> rain<00:01:16.690> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
had to hand pollinate a lot of our

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.969 
had to hand pollinate a lot of our
majority<00:01:55.570> of<00:01:55.659> our<00:01:55.780> watermelon<00:01:56.110> because<00:01:56.770> I

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
majority of our watermelon because I

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.460 
majority of our watermelon because I
don't<00:01:57.250> see<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.970> lot<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.270> pollinators<00:01:58.869> coming

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
don't see a lot of pollinators coming

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.710 
don't see a lot of pollinators coming
out<00:01:59.619> and<00:01:59.830> I've<00:01:59.920> recently<00:02:00.310> added<00:02:01.060> some

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
out and I've recently added some

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.899 
out and I've recently added some
brown-eyed<00:02:02.110> Susans<00:02:02.340> right<00:02:03.340> here<00:02:03.549> on<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.759> bed

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
brown-eyed Susans right here on the bed

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.820 
brown-eyed Susans right here on the bed
and<00:02:04.090> we're<00:02:04.180> going<00:02:04.299> to<00:02:04.360> plant<00:02:05.110> those<00:02:05.290> in<00:02:05.350> just

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
and we're going to plant those in just

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.620 
and we're going to plant those in just
haven't<00:02:06.400> had<00:02:06.490> time<00:02:06.549> with<00:02:06.880> all<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.119> rain<00:02:07.299> and

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
haven't had time with all the rain and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.769 
haven't had time with all the rain and
so<00:02:08.319> um<00:02:08.649> that<00:02:09.159> seems<00:02:09.579> to<00:02:09.759> be<00:02:09.879> encouraging<00:02:10.419> a<00:02:10.539> few

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:10.779 
so um that seems to be encouraging a few

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:13.979 
so um that seems to be encouraging a few
more<00:02:10.929> pollinators<00:02:11.349> but<00:02:12.099> I<00:02:12.189> don't<00:02:12.430> see<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:13.329> lot

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
more pollinators but I don't see a lot

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.420 
more pollinators but I don't see a lot

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.420 
of discovered if they're not pollinated
all<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.510> way<00:02:43.599> they<00:02:43.750> stopped<00:02:44.019> growing<00:02:44.500> part<00:02:45.400> of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
all the way they stopped growing part of

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.460 
all the way they stopped growing part of
the<00:02:45.489> way<00:02:45.639> and<00:02:45.760> we<00:02:45.849> have<00:02:45.969> one<00:02:46.269> on<00:02:46.299> here<00:02:46.629> that<00:02:46.900> was

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
the way and we have one on here that was

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.720 
the way and we have one on here that was
the<00:02:47.500> biggest<00:02:47.799> one<00:02:47.980> at<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.340> beginning<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.639> the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
the biggest one at the beginning of the

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.220 
the biggest one at the beginning of the
week<00:02:48.879> and<00:02:49.030> now<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.359> just<00:02:49.389> seems<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:50.019> stop

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
week and now it just seems to stop

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.300 
week and now it just seems to stop
growing<00:02:50.439> them<00:02:50.739> worried<00:02:50.919> it's<00:02:51.099> going<00:02:51.250> to

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
growing them worried it's going to

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.659 
growing them worried it's going to
shrivel<00:02:51.579> up<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:51.970> die<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.720> if<00:02:52.870> anyone<00:02:53.290> knows

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
shrivel up and die so if anyone knows

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.509 
shrivel up and die so if anyone knows
can<00:02:54.669> tell<00:02:54.879> me<00:02:55.000> why<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.299> happens<00:02:55.989> I<00:02:56.400> read<00:02:57.400> it

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
can tell me why that happens I read it

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.640 
can tell me why that happens I read it
could<00:02:57.639> be<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.819> calcium<00:02:58.389> deficiency<00:02:58.569> which<00:02:59.500> is

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
could be a calcium deficiency which is

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.220 
could be a calcium deficiency which is
possible<00:03:00.159> though<00:03:00.370> but<00:03:00.609> overall<00:03:00.879> I'm<00:03:01.540> loving

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
possible though but overall I'm loving

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.839 
possible though but overall I'm loving
having<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.799> trellis<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.340> promotes<00:03:03.639> air

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
having on the trellis it promotes air

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.809 
having on the trellis it promotes air
circulation<00:03:04.510> it's<00:03:04.989> easy<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:06.040> watch<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.700> to

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
circulation it's easy to watch and to

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.990 
circulation it's easy to watch and to
maintain<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.299> am<00:03:07.840> using<00:03:08.500> stockings<00:03:09.189> to<00:03:09.579> hold<00:03:09.819> up

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
maintain I am using stockings to hold up

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.270 
maintain I am using stockings to hold up
that<00:03:10.150> really<00:03:10.389> big<00:03:10.659> one<00:03:10.840> over<00:03:11.079> there<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.620> we

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
that really big one over there and we

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.970 
that really big one over there and we
have<00:03:12.430> two<00:03:12.700> more<00:03:12.849> behind<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.389> trellis<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.049> yeah

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
have two more behind the trellis so yeah

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.949 
have two more behind the trellis so yeah
hopefully<00:03:15.400> we'll<00:03:15.730> have<00:03:15.819> some<00:03:16.090> watermelon<00:03:16.510> in
