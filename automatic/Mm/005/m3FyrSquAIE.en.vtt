00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110 

last<00:00:00.299> time<00:00:00.510> we<00:00:00.719> cut<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.220> mylar<00:00:02.220> wing<00:00:02.790> shape

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
last time we cut the mylar wing shape

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.930 
last time we cut the mylar wing shape
out<00:00:03.330> glued<00:00:04.049> it<00:00:04.200> down<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.560> MDF<00:00:05.009> board<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.580> then

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
out glued it down to MDF board and then

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.870 
out glued it down to MDF board and then
traced<00:00:06.359> it<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:07.259> we<00:00:07.410> can<00:00:07.649> create<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.429> shape<00:00:08.670> of

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
traced it so we can create the shape of

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.370 
traced it so we can create the shape of
our<00:00:09.380> wing<00:00:10.380> molds<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.800> we'll<00:00:11.040> use<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.460> make

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
our wing molds that we'll use to make

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.820 
our wing molds that we'll use to make
wing<00:00:13.380> ribs<00:00:13.590> out<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.309> then<00:00:14.940> today<00:00:15.830> Caleb

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
wing ribs out of and then today Caleb

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.240 
wing ribs out of and then today Caleb
yeah<00:00:17.520> today<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.390> are<00:00:18.690> starting<00:00:19.470> out<00:00:19.770> by<00:00:20.039> using

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
yeah today we are starting out by using

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.740 
yeah today we are starting out by using
a<00:00:20.430> bandsaw<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.240> cut

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
a bandsaw to cut

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.070 
a bandsaw to cut
we've<00:00:22.650> got<00:00:22.859> our<00:00:23.010> lines<00:00:23.279> traced<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.029> here<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.779> we

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
we've got our lines traced on here so we

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.320 
we've got our lines traced on here so we
do<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> rough<00:00:25.590> cut<00:00:25.859> with<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.099> bandsaw<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:27.210> it

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
do a rough cut with the bandsaw get it

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.150 
do a rough cut with the bandsaw get it
to<00:00:27.510> within<00:00:27.689> maybe<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.230> quarter<00:00:28.650> inch<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
to within maybe a quarter inch of the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.189 
to within maybe a quarter inch of the
line<00:00:29.359> then<00:00:30.359> what<00:00:30.570> we're<00:00:30.720> going<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:31.080> is

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
line then what we're going to do is

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.260 
line then what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:31.439> going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.619> use<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.040> sander<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.969> sand

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
we're going to use the sander to sand

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.590 
we're going to use the sander to sand
right<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.260> line<00:00:34.850> but<00:00:35.850> what's<00:00:36.059> what

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
right up to the line but what's what

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.880 
right up to the line but what's what
we're<00:00:36.750> also<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.440> instead<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
we're also going to do is instead of

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.100 
we're also going to do is instead of
sanding<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.670> 90<00:00:39.120> degrees<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.840> surface

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
sanding at 90 degrees to the surface

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.709 
sanding at 90 degrees to the surface
it's<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> nice<00:00:42.059> straight

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it's not going to be a nice straight

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.830 
it's not going to be a nice straight
corner<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:44.100> actually<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:45.120> set

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
corner it's actually going to be set

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.260 
corner it's actually going to be set
back<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.140> little<00:00:46.440> bit<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.940> along<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> edge<00:00:48.239> here

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
back a little bit so along the edge here

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.720 
back a little bit so along the edge here
is<00:00:48.809> actually<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.620> angled<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
is actually going to be angled in and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.700 
is actually going to be angled in and
what<00:00:50.910> that's<00:00:51.090> going<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.360> let<00:00:51.510> us<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.199> we're

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
what that's going to let us do is we're

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.740 
what that's going to let us do is we're
going<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> use<00:00:52.920> these<00:00:53.340> forms<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.000> bend

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
going to use these forms to bend

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.950 
going to use these forms to bend
aluminum<00:00:55.410> around<00:00:55.739> them<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.039> make<00:00:56.190> our<00:00:56.370> ribs

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
aluminum around them to make our ribs

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.049 
aluminum around them to make our ribs
but<00:00:57.960> if<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.289> 90<00:00:58.770> degrees<00:00:59.160> aluminum

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
but if it's just 90 degrees aluminum

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.599 
but if it's just 90 degrees aluminum
metal<00:01:01.050> always<00:01:01.680> wants<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.010> spring<00:01:02.340> back<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
metal always wants to spring back a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.979 
metal always wants to spring back a
little<00:01:02.940> bit<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.359> what<00:01:03.480> we're<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> have

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
little bit so what we're going to have

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
little bit so what we're going to have
to<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.320> actually<00:01:04.500> bend<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.250> about<00:01:05.400> 95

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
to do is actually bend it to about 95

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.270 
to do is actually bend it to about 95
degrees<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.409> when<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.680> springs<00:01:07.979> back<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
degrees and then when it springs back a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.830 
degrees and then when it springs back a
little<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.850> we'll<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.210> right<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.659> nice

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
little bit we'll be right at that nice

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.859 
little bit we'll be right at that nice
clean<00:01:10.049> 90<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.890> we've<00:01:11.850> got<00:01:12.000> our<00:01:12.119> first<00:01:12.299> one<00:01:12.570> kind

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
clean 90 so we've got our first one kind

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.250 
clean 90 so we've got our first one kind
of<00:01:12.990> rough<00:01:13.140> cut

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
of rough cut

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.320 
of rough cut
a<00:01:14.320> little<00:01:14.620> bit<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:15.640> other<00:01:15.670> ones<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.240> then

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
a little bit the other ones and then

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.270 
a little bit the other ones and then
we'll<00:01:16.510> start<00:01:16.960> sanding<00:01:17.200> okay<00:01:17.920> so<00:01:17.980> we're

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
we'll start sanding okay so we're

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.270 
we'll start sanding okay so we're
getting<00:01:18.400> ready<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.880> sand<00:01:19.150> down<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.830> five

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
getting ready to sand down that five

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.120 
getting ready to sand down that five
degree<00:01:21.790> pitch<00:01:22.240> on<00:01:22.600> our<00:01:23.050> first<00:01:23.350> leading<00:01:24.010> edge

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
degree pitch on our first leading edge

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.880 
degree pitch on our first leading edge
and<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.730> problem<00:01:25.090> is<00:01:25.240> is<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:26.350> get<00:01:26.500> that<00:01:26.650> five

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
and the problem is is to get that five

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.830 
and the problem is is to get that five
degree<00:01:27.160> pitch<00:01:27.400> there<00:01:28.060> it's<00:01:28.420> you<00:01:28.600> know<00:01:28.690> it's

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
degree pitch there it's you know it's

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.290 
degree pitch there it's you know it's
really<00:01:28.900> hard<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.380> tell<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:30.640> know<00:01:30.760> what's<00:01:31.060> five

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
really hard to tell you know what's five

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.090 
really hard to tell you know what's five
or<00:01:31.480> six<00:01:31.690> degrees<00:01:32.080> so<00:01:32.890> Caleb<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:33.790> I<00:01:33.880> used

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
or six degrees so Caleb and I used

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
or six degrees so Caleb and I used
technology<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:38.530> it<00:01:38.680> is<00:01:38.800> our<00:01:39.130> two

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
technology there it is our two

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.900 
technology there it is our two
smartphones<00:01:40.810> my<00:01:41.590> iPhone<00:01:41.980> and<00:01:42.130> his<00:01:42.370> you<00:01:42.760> know

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
smartphones my iPhone and his you know

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.780 
smartphones my iPhone and his you know
something<00:01:43.420> else<00:01:44.190> but<00:01:45.190> what<00:01:45.340> we<00:01:45.490> did<00:01:45.640> is<00:01:45.760> we

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
something else but what we did is we

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.690 
something else but what we did is we
calibrated<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.600> there<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:48.040> know<00:01:48.160> just<00:01:48.490> right

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
calibrated it there you know just right

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.900 
calibrated it there you know just right
on<00:01:48.850> top<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:50.140> thought<00:01:50.920> through<00:01:51.430> again<00:01:51.640> so

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
on top I thought through again so

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.880 
on top I thought through again so
calibrate<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:52.479> there<00:01:52.690> and<00:01:52.870> then<00:01:53.500> we<00:01:53.560> pulled<00:01:53.800> it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
calibrate it there and then we pulled it

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.469 
calibrate it there and then we pulled it
down<00:01:54.010> here<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.370> see<00:01:54.580> what<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.850> pitch<00:01:55.030> is

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
down here to see what the pitch is

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.040 
down here to see what the pitch is
and<00:01:56.190> we're<00:01:57.190> both<00:01:57.370> getting<00:01:57.580> about<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.810> same

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
and we're both getting about the same

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.490 
and we're both getting about the same
I'm<00:01:59.260> actually<00:01:59.410> getting<00:01:59.680> a<00:01:59.890> little<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.350> I'm

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
I'm actually getting a little and I'm

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.690 
I'm actually getting a little and I'm
getting<00:02:02.770> three<00:02:02.979> point<00:02:03.190> four<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:03.460> you're

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
getting three point four and you're

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.610 
getting three point four and you're
getting<00:02:03.820> three<00:02:04.150> or<00:02:04.300> four<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:04.750> that's<00:02:05.410> the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
getting three or four so that's the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.900 
getting three or four so that's the
pitch<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:06.010> want<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.250> get<00:02:06.340> about<00:02:06.520> five<00:02:06.760> or

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
pitch so we want to get about five or

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.300 
pitch so we want to get about five or
six<00:02:07.090> right<00:02:07.420> right<00:02:07.900> so<00:02:08.679> let's<00:02:08.860> do<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.220> little

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
six right right so let's do it a little

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.990 
six right right so let's do it a little
more<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.700> we'll<00:02:09.820> uh<00:02:09.880> we'll<00:02:10.380> get<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.500> down<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.680> a

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
more and we'll uh we'll get it down to a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.570 
more and we'll uh we'll get it down to a
man<00:02:13.000> look<00:02:13.630> at<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.959> that's<00:02:14.680> technology<00:02:15.100> for

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
man look at that that's technology for

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.430 
man look at that that's technology for
you<00:02:15.730> that's<00:02:16.150> home<00:02:16.450> building<00:02:16.780> in<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:16.990> 21st

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
you that's home building in the 21st

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.150 
you that's home building in the 21st
century<00:02:17.830> can<00:02:18.190> they<00:02:18.370> ever<00:02:18.550> do<00:02:18.850> this<00:02:19.060> without<00:02:19.300> I

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
century can they ever do this without I

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.010 
century can they ever do this without I
seriously<00:02:21.239> thank<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.300> Steve<00:02:22.600> Jobs<00:02:22.870> for

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
seriously thank you Steve Jobs for

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.380 
seriously thank you Steve Jobs for
helping<00:02:23.380> us<00:02:23.470> build<00:02:23.709> our<00:02:23.830> airplane<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.910> Google

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
helping us build our airplane and Google

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:40.580 
helping us build our airplane and Google
and<00:02:25.600> Android<00:02:25.840> yes<00:02:26.770> them<00:02:27.130> too<00:02:27.340> yeah<00:02:27.730> yeah

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.610 

so<00:02:41.590> we<00:02:42.070> finished<00:02:42.490> sanding<00:02:43.210> out<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:44.290> know<00:02:44.410> that

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
so we finished sanding out you know that

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.880 
so we finished sanding out you know that
five<00:02:44.920> degree<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:46.300> know<00:02:46.420> angle<00:02:47.110> which<00:02:47.530> you

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
five degree you know angle which you

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.560 
five degree you know angle which you
might<00:02:48.010> be<00:02:48.160> able<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.370> see<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.640> there

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
might be able to see it there

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.690 
might be able to see it there
we<00:02:49.870> finished<00:02:50.200> standing<00:02:50.500> out<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.280> got<00:02:51.430> our

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
we finished standing out and we got our

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.590 
we finished standing out and we got our
right<00:02:52.210> weight<00:02:52.480> which<00:02:53.290> flanges<00:02:53.890> away<00:02:54.520> from<00:02:55.360> the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
right weight which flanges away from the

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.620 
right weight which flanges away from the
fuselage<00:02:56.730> however<00:02:57.730> but<00:02:57.970> we<00:02:58.090> didn't<00:02:58.330> realize

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
fuselage however but we didn't realize

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
fuselage however but we didn't realize
was<00:02:59.370> we<00:03:00.370> marked<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:01.480> same<00:03:01.720> side<00:03:02.020> for<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.440> left

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
was we marked the same side for the left

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.940 
was we marked the same side for the left
wing<00:03:02.890> which<00:03:03.100> means<00:03:03.370> if<00:03:03.550> you<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:04.780> know<00:03:04.900> sand<00:03:05.830> it

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
wing which means if you you know sand it

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.070 
wing which means if you you know sand it
the<00:03:06.070> other<00:03:06.220> way<00:03:06.430> it's<00:03:07.090> you<00:03:07.660> actually<00:03:07.930> need<00:03:08.050> a

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
the other way it's you actually need a

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.900 
the other way it's you actually need a
line<00:03:08.290> on<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.560> other<00:03:08.590> side<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.520> what<00:03:09.640> we<00:03:09.730> had<00:03:09.880> to

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
line on the other side so what we had to

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.370 
line on the other side so what we had to
do<00:03:10.150> since<00:03:10.390> we<00:03:10.510> didn't<00:03:10.720> flip<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.050> mylar<00:03:11.230> over

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
do since we didn't flip the mylar over

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.510 
do since we didn't flip the mylar over
note<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.190> self

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
note to self

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.750 
note to self
over<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.850> next<00:03:13.180> time<00:03:13.950> we<00:03:14.950> actually<00:03:15.100> traced

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
over the next time we actually traced

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.240 
over the next time we actually traced
around<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.390> one<00:03:16.630> on<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.230> backside<00:03:17.830> of

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
around this one on to the backside of

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.130 
around this one on to the backside of
our<00:03:19.030> second<00:03:19.540> point<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:19.960> now<00:03:20.650> we<00:03:20.710> had<00:03:22.050> have<00:03:23.050> it

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
our second point so now we had have it

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.140 
our second point so now we had have it
on<00:03:23.230> this<00:03:23.380> side<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.890> we<00:03:24.070> can<00:03:24.220> use<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.610> sand

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
on this side and we can use that to sand

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.260 
on this side and we can use that to sand
away<00:03:25.840> for<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.410> left<00:03:26.620> wing<00:03:26.800> but<00:03:27.370> now<00:03:27.580> since<00:03:28.120> you

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
away for the left wing but now since you

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.840 
away for the left wing but now since you
don't<00:03:28.360> want<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.870> bend<00:03:29.770> metal<00:03:30.040> over<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.520> sharp

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
don't want to bend metal over a sharp

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.570 
don't want to bend metal over a sharp
edge<00:03:31.120> because<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:31.630> will<00:03:31.720> actually<00:03:31.840> crack<00:03:32.580> we

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
edge because it will actually crack we

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.980 
edge because it will actually crack we
had<00:03:33.790> this<00:03:33.970> little<00:03:34.240> uh<00:03:35.940> twenty<00:03:36.940> fall<00:03:37.150> rotor

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
had this little uh twenty fall rotor

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.860 
had this little uh twenty fall rotor
hello<00:03:38.710> our<00:03:38.980> little<00:03:39.580> edge<00:03:39.730> get<00:03:40.390> it<00:03:40.480> down<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.630> a

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
hello our little edge get it down to a

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.550 
hello our little edge get it down to a
was<00:03:41.710> a<00:03:41.740> 1/8<00:03:42.160> radius<00:03:42.550> 16<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.690> sixteenth<00:03:44.140> radius

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
was a 1/8 radius 16 a sixteenth radius

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.970 
was a 1/8 radius 16 a sixteenth radius
which<00:03:44.770> is<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.070> same<00:03:45.280> as<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.490> 1/8<00:03:45.850> drill<00:03:46.270> bit<00:03:46.980> so

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
which is the same as a 1/8 drill bit so

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.500 
which is the same as a 1/8 drill bit so
we<00:03:48.130> just<00:03:48.310> basically<00:03:48.459> want<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:48.970> round<00:03:49.120> off<00:03:49.330> that

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
we just basically want to round off that

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.150 
we just basically want to round off that
corner<00:03:49.870> so<00:03:49.900> when<00:03:50.140> you've<00:03:50.260> been<00:03:50.470> metal<00:03:51.010> around

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
corner so when you've been metal around

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.060 
corner so when you've been metal around
it<00:03:51.640> it's<00:03:52.330> got<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.570> round<00:03:52.900> edge<00:03:53.170> not<00:03:53.830> a<00:03:53.860> real

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
it it's got a round edge not a real

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:06.490 
it it's got a round edge not a real
sharp

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.890 

so<00:04:07.500> now<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.799> has<00:04:07.829> a<00:04:08.040> rounded<00:04:09.030> edge<00:04:09.209> on<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:09.719> we

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
so now it has a rounded edge on it so we

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.770 
so now it has a rounded edge on it so we
can<00:04:09.930> bend<00:04:10.680> metal<00:04:10.829> over<00:04:11.099> it<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.780> without

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
can bend metal over it and without

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.430 
can bend metal over it and without
hopefully<00:04:13.739> cracking<00:04:14.159> the<00:04:14.510> metal<00:04:15.510> okay<00:04:15.989> well

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
hopefully cracking the metal okay well

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.650 
hopefully cracking the metal okay well
we've<00:04:16.560> put<00:04:16.590> about<00:04:16.829> three<00:04:17.579> hours<00:04:17.729> in<00:04:18.120> today<00:04:18.419> and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
we've put about three hours in today and

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.900 
we've put about three hours in today and
that<00:04:19.169> made<00:04:19.530> good<00:04:19.739> progress<00:04:19.889> we<00:04:20.430> didn't<00:04:20.669> get<00:04:20.789> as

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
that made good progress we didn't get as

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.840 
that made good progress we didn't get as
much<00:04:20.940> done<00:04:21.630> as<00:04:21.840> we<00:04:21.930> hoped<00:04:22.410> for<00:04:22.530> but<00:04:23.160> that<00:04:23.610> seems

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
much done as we hoped for but that seems

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.689 
much done as we hoped for but that seems
to<00:04:23.940> be<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.090> trend<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:24.780> we<00:04:25.620> took<00:04:26.009> our<00:04:26.190> time<00:04:26.400> we

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
to be a trend and we took our time we

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.879 
to be a trend and we took our time we
made<00:04:26.880> sure<00:04:26.910> we<00:04:27.330> did<00:04:27.479> it<00:04:27.509> right<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:28.080> we<00:04:28.710> feel

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
made sure we did it right and we feel

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.040 
made sure we did it right and we feel
good<00:04:29.039> about<00:04:29.100> what<00:04:29.400> we<00:04:29.520> did<00:04:29.580> so<00:04:30.330> we<00:04:30.600> finished

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
good about what we did so we finished

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.629 
good about what we did so we finished
the<00:04:31.289> right<00:04:31.650> wing<00:04:32.009> mold<00:04:32.509> we<00:04:33.509> cut<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:34.289> out<00:04:34.639> sanded

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
the right wing mold we cut it out sanded

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.350 
the right wing mold we cut it out sanded
it<00:04:35.729> down<00:04:35.789> even<00:04:36.720> got<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.729> road<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:39.090> little

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
it down even got the road the little

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.210 
it down even got the road the little
edge<00:04:39.530> softened<00:04:40.530> out<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:40.800> we<00:04:40.860> can<00:04:41.009> bend<00:04:41.130> metal

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
edge softened out so we can bend metal

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.189 
edge softened out so we can bend metal
so<00:04:41.430> it's<00:04:41.580> completely<00:04:41.880> done<00:04:42.270> next<00:04:42.780> time<00:04:43.020> we'll

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
so it's completely done next time we'll

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.620 
so it's completely done next time we'll

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.270
