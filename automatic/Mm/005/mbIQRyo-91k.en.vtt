00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.340
 hi friends today we are going to talk about the 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.080
 orchid 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.610
 it is a plant that are usually 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.730
 trafficked and subtropical with which 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.800
 It has a little special care 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.240
 they are explicit plants that means that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.849
 they are plants that are not on their 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.380
 actual deadlines but they are usually 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.090
 on a support that is usually another 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.770
 vegetable the substrate that normally 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.230
 others put them is pine bark 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.150
 peat have aerial roots that are the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.699
 that make him eat from 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.830
 they aerial roots let's see the 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.250
 best in this orchid the roots 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.480
 are strong as you'll see they come out 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 outside the plant and do not need to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.809
 to be inside in a substrate the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.110
 aerial roots what they do is absorb 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.210
 the humidity of the air or of the water that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.100
 let's put it over 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.329
 the care of orchids are not very 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.040
 difficult but you have to know how 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.020
 do them because they are as we have said 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.610
 they are a little particular plants 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.500
 let's see some guidelines so you can 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.500
 cultivate them and take care of them perfectly in 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.509
 your home then the first thing is the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.840
 humidity as we have said well 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.190
 Orchid feeds on water as before 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.619
 does not have a substrate feeds the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.210
 water from both air and water 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.580
 irrigation but that envelope at the time 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.310
 so it is very important that they have 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.050
 much environmental humidity so I 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.810
 normal is to put a gravel 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.030
 with water underneath so you always have 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.160
 environmental humidity let's put us 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.660
 in this orchid that does not have we are going to 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.820
 put a little gravel with water 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.170
 so you can see how it's done simply 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.939
 we fill the base 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.939
 of the pot with gravel 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.780
 and we add water to cover it 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.360
 in this way what we do is 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.170
 guarantee humidity in the environment 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.060
 we put the pot on top 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.310
 another way to keep an arm in the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.840
 environment is to pulverize the but you have to 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.759
 do it very carefully the orchid 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.159
 you can never get water in the heart 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.330
 of the rosette that is this area here of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.770
 the fork because it can rot 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.170
 then and to spray the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.399
 we simply use the sheets of 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.580
 outside 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.710
 It can be done several times a week 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.050
 and we get that also have a 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.120
 high environmental humidity 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.340
 the fertilizer use a special fertilizer to 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.780
 orchids what is also done 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.270
 in the irrigation water 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.390
 we throw our fertilizer we put our 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.850
 dose 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.850
 perfect and we add it to the irrigation water 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.819
 we remove them well 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.819
 and water the orchid 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.620
 in this way we ensure that you do not have 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.570
 lack of nutrients when paying them 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.520
 his is to pay the during the time of 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.250
 growth that is in the months of 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.200
 spring and summer is a plant that 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.940
 you need a lot of lighting you have to 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.860
 always place it near a window 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.920
 but you should never give the rays 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.060
 solar because it can burn leaves 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.650
 we can put it near the window and 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.970
 put some curtains or a and followed 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.770
 forward so you do not get the rays 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.840
 solar the optimal temperature for your 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.570
 Cultivation is between 20 and 29 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.760
 degrees centigrade and very important in 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.980
 the fall they have to spend two weeks to 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.660
 a temperature that makes a difference 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.860
 between day and night of 12 degrees 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.810
 centigrade at least two or three 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.660
 weeks because this also induces the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.190
 bloom and then as you know if we are 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.680
 watering enough or not going to 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.990
 say the roots when the roots are 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.990
 in green world station 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.000
 means that the orchid has 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.930
 enough water if the roots are put 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.970
 whitish 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.590
 that means you need water and when 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.940
 they are black is that we have 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.370
 past with the water you have to let 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.370
 dry to water again 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.550
 the flowering as we see seems in what 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.500
 we said in some arched bars and 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.510
 blooms with abundant flower that lasts 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.290
 a lot of time when with cutting these 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.630
 varas is the great dilemma is yours 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.520
 when the last flower has fallen in 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.080
 that moment we will cut the rod and what 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.430
 we have to do is here we have a 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.310
 orchid that has already completely lost the 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.930
 flowering what we have to do is 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.600
 cut the can over the third 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.180
 bud that we're going to see what would be the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:24.420
 third yolk of the wool we would cut to 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.490
 from the third yolk is to say a 2 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.470
 we would cut them over this lime 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.680
 let's remove the rod to be able 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.810
 cut 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.810
 perfect and we would cut here on top 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.970
 we would do the same with the other rod 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.970
 123 we would cut so that 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.469
 in this way we stimulate sprouting 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.289
 of a new flower or a cake and a cake 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:59.599
 and it is a plant identical to the plant 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.460
 mother who comes out like a floral bud 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.230
 would leave a leaf and leaves a plant 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.270
 identical 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.680
 I hope that with these tips the 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.040
 you get some perfect orchids in 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.040
 our homes
