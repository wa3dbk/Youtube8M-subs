little<00:02:27.580> bit<00:02:27.819> finer<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.209> time<00:02:28.390> because<00:02:28.540> I

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
little bit finer this time because I

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.880 
little bit finer this time because I
don't<00:02:28.690> want<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.870> see<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.290> want<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.620> cinder

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
grate and cook but it just takes the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.970 
grate and cook but it just takes the

whole dimension of the dish to a

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.410 
whole dimension of the dish to a
different<00:02:33.580> level<00:02:33.730> now<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.720> get<00:02:34.959> it<00:02:35.080> really<00:02:35.470> a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
different level now to get it really a
