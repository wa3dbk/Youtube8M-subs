00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.210
 greetings a hammer blow for everyone at 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.100
 titan hammer again in the world of 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.139
 minecraft to bring a very mode 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.160
 simple but much more useful than 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.500
 It seems 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.150
 it's about time stopper with which 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.340
 we will be able to stop the time during 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.840
 a few seconds to save life in 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.230
 different situations of danger 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.300
 we set so survival it's about 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.250
 this watch that comes here a long time ago 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.570
 what I wanted to bring today the mod was 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.060
 waiting to see if they update it from 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.100
 version and good as it does not update it go 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.290
 after so much time I decided 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.909
 and it also bring you and when 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.820
 update then I will modify it in the 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:42.729
 Description title and others and ready 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.250
 only item that adds this is this craft 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.680
 eo with four luminous stone powders 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.229
 and a sundial or in the center the 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.879
 Sundial is with four ingots of 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:55.119
 gold and once network is all in the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.030
 center and when we have this clock it's enough 

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:59.739
 with right clicking anywhere 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.440
 I think that up there he has launched 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.210
 super high but in these moments although 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.370
 it does not seem like time has stopped 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.820
 I had already heard how it was broken 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.460
 he threw it I move and notice how you go 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.530
 chucky there because to chuck and also 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.860
 it stops for time and when the time 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.180
 come back I have it in my head again 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.880
 I will teach different situations in 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.970
 which can save your life in the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.190
 case of having a wave of mobile very 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.070
 close you can see how all these are 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.560
 here in fact they are trying 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.110
 trying to climb to catch me and I 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.620
 having the clock I put the mode 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.300
 survival 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.080
 there you see how they all come with 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.000
 despair for me I throw the clock 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.900
 see how they stand and that gives me time 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 then to jump to run and 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.550
 leave them behind look how they have 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.310
 stayed there and I could escape without 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.060
 no problem as you could see 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.310
 just in the previous example is consumed 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.440
 is for single use each time 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.170
 we use now they have creative if the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.420
 shots do not consume fix how they stop 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.900
 also the animals here is the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.480
 resource stopped until it breaks sounds 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.400
 as it breaks and it is already moving again 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.680
 that obviously for situations of 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.560
 emergency but for example we will have 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.480
 here a creepers let's say I'm 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.960
 around here now they have creative so 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.960
 I'm going to take it off 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.170
 and there comes and when this sounds 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.840
 when rings 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.940
 the sound of the creever gives us time to 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.319
 run away and obviously not 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.719
 exploit 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.170
 now it does not work for me I'm going to put 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:48.840
 fast the creative I'm going to go back to 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.790
 teach good will have exploded but have 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.469
 creative and he has not done anything to me we will have 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.760
 here the clipper we have here again the 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:03:01.799
 watch I put on the survival mode again 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.400
 comes to me even if we're on 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.459
 back we hear it we throw it fast 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.469
 and we saved ourselves from the explosion of fact 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.769
 you already notice that it stops exploding or 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:15.840
 it stops and does not explode and let's get 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.659
 example in the case that we are seeing 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.310
 that we have in survival mode and maybe 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.689
 we started to apply and we found 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.359
 this instead of being buried at 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:30.810
 engine we do this we see just what's coming 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:33.000
 gravel here too and then no 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.370
 It would be time to take us off, you see how it is 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.040
 shaking and then when the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.189
 clock that takes approximately 78 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.980
 second break would remove yes 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:47.120
 I do not know why but in the case of lava 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.670
 I've tried it and look at the low and low 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.560
 I use the watch and I can use them 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.870
 Sometimes I want the lava to continue 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.640
 spreading I do not know why but with the 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.730
 liquids is the only thing that does not work 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.280
 but anything that suffers effects from 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.250
 gravity for example with gravel with 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.519
 the sand with the anvils stops falling and 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.409
 then with the animals creatures 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.440
 clippers so they do not explode and all that 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.700
 we go with the installation as always I 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.760
 I recommend doing a clean installation 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.780
 from scratch so we're going here to 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.690
 percentage app data percentage and the 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.330
 minecraft folder the content well 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.160
 we take it and move it to another route or 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.740
 ok to the folder itself and we change it 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.250
 the name to do the installation in 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.000
 an empty and from scratch the following will be 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.000
 run the launcher 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.279
 and we select here edit profile for 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.680
 choose the version that we are going to install 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:47.830
 right now it's for about 62 and 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.110
 the 164 when it is for the about 72 or 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.819
 later versions of editing the 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.279
 title and description to put the 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:57.249
 logs so let's select the 1 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.629
 646 profile and we give the button play 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:03.230
 to install all the files 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:05.889
 needed then the game opens 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.139
 and we close it 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:12.219
 now let's install force here 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:14.830
 we have 965 for about 64 thousand 871 for 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:17.979
 the 162 in this case we install the 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.319
 corresponding the ends here and you 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:23.050
 we give right click to open with java 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:25.330
 platform the installation path is the 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.490
 same as the default one so 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.830
 We accept and install the 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.409
 fort files we give you to accept 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.099
 again and now we can run another 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.099
 time the launcher 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.450
 we select the new forge profile 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:47.560
 and here we check that the version is 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:49.060
 about 64 29 65 or the one that corresponds 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.139
 We give to work play button to open 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.610
 the game 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:57.009
 and again we close it 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.479
 and now let's scale the mode here what 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.479
 we have for we have followed in here to 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:03.699
 about 64 the link will be in the 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.580
 description as you can see are files 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:09.189
 zip and inside they have a bunch of other 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.199
 different files so we leave it 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:13.210
 just as in case there were 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.639
 a hard point yes that would decompress 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.819
 so we take it directly as we already 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:22.360
 I said we're going to app data percentage 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:26.289
 percentage and in minecraft mods what 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.899
 we paste open the game once more 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:31.119
 and here is the mods button here are 

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:35.110
 the de force and here is time stopper 

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:36.550
 with which we will give no problem 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.590
 if you liked to give the ain 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.090
 subscribe and do not forget to share 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.090
 videos see you
