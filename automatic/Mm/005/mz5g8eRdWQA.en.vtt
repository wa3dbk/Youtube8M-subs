00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.510 
simple one is a little bit bigger but uh
yeah<00:00:44.410> let's<00:00:44.710> just<00:00:44.950> have<00:00:45.040> a<00:00:45.070> look<00:00:45.190> at<00:00:45.310> it<00:00:45.400> in

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
yeah let's just have a look at it in

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.910 
yeah let's just have a look at it in
default<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.120> we'll<00:00:46.480> get<00:00:46.630> started<00:00:47.050> okay<00:00:47.890> so

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
default and we'll get started okay so

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.710 
default and we'll get started okay so
this<00:00:48.190> is<00:00:48.280> what<00:00:48.400> it<00:00:48.460> looks<00:00:48.610> like<00:00:48.670> in<00:00:49.000> default<00:00:49.540> so

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
this is what it looks like in default so

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.910 
this is what it looks like in default so
you<00:00:49.780> can<00:00:49.900> see<00:00:50.020> that<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.260> never<00:00:50.470> brick<00:00:50.680> comes

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
you can see that the never brick comes

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.270 
you can see that the never brick comes
out<00:00:51.120> completely<00:00:52.120> different<00:00:52.890> yeah<00:00:53.890> just<00:00:54.130> use

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
out completely different yeah just use

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.920 
out completely different yeah just use
any<00:00:54.520> salt<00:00:54.760> dark<00:00:55.030> material<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.540> can<00:00:55.660> also<00:00:55.750> use

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
any salt dark material you can also use

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.900 
any salt dark material you can also use
like<00:00:56.050> sandstone<00:00:56.410> or<00:00:56.710> one<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.070> woods<00:00:57.310> you

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
like sandstone or one of the woods you

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.670 
like sandstone or one of the woods you
want<00:00:58.060> the<00:00:58.150> brownish<00:00:58.540> kind<00:00:58.750> of<00:00:58.870> colored<00:00:59.200> ones<00:00:59.440> I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
want the brownish kind of colored ones I

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.190 
want the brownish kind of colored ones I
think<00:00:59.920> I've<00:01:00.010> seen<00:01:00.160> some<00:01:00.400> somewhere<00:01:01.200> they're

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
so let's switch over to my texture pack

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.859 
so let's switch over to my texture pack
which<00:01:06.369> is<00:01:06.490> LD<00:01:06.790> model<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.509> we'll<00:01:07.630> get<00:01:07.689> started

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
which is LD model and we'll get started

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.410 
which is LD model and we'll get started
okay<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.430> items<00:01:09.729> we're<00:01:09.850> gonna<00:01:09.939> need<00:01:10.119> on<00:01:10.360> a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
guys so first thing we're gonna do is

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.330 
guys so first thing we're gonna do is
just<00:01:25.870> place<00:01:26.080> down<00:01:26.230> a<00:01:26.380> block<00:01:26.620> there's<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.950> police

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
just place down a block there's a police

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.969 
just place down a block there's a police
holder<00:01:27.790> so<00:01:28.659> place<00:01:28.870> down<00:01:29.050> one<00:01:29.170> here<00:01:29.380> just<00:01:29.409> go<00:01:29.800> up

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
holder so place down one here just go up

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.140 
holder so place down one here just go up
by<00:01:30.159> one<00:01:30.370> you<00:01:30.550> can<00:01:30.640> see<00:01:30.729> that<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:30.940> one<00:01:31.120> is

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
by one you can see that this one is

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.410 
by one you can see that this one is
actually<00:01:31.390> floating<00:01:31.570> above<00:01:31.870> the<00:01:31.930> ground<00:01:33.420> it's

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
actually floating above the ground it's

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.940 
actually floating above the ground it's
just<00:01:34.479> easy<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.900> pull<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.200> schematic<00:01:35.710> off<00:01:35.830> I

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
just easy to pull the schematic off I

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.399 
just easy to pull the schematic off I
guess<00:01:36.130> anyway<00:01:37.030> we<00:01:37.180> just<00:01:37.360> have<00:01:37.479> free<00:01:37.720> stairs

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
guess anyway we just have free stairs

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.130 
guess anyway we just have free stairs
you<00:01:38.620> got<00:01:38.680> one<00:01:38.920> two<00:01:39.460> three<00:01:40.060> since<00:01:40.600> just<00:01:40.810> facing

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
you got one two three since just facing

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.980 
you got one two three since just facing
inwards<00:01:41.580> have<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.640> block<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.510> that<00:01:43.690> for<00:01:43.810> free

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
inwards have a block and that for free

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.490 
inwards have a block and that for free
one<00:01:44.470> two<00:01:45.070> three<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:46.690> if<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:46.900> grab<00:01:47.049> your<00:01:47.170> slabs

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
one two three and if you grab your slabs

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.140 
one two three and if you grab your slabs
we're<00:01:47.740> just<00:01:47.860> gonna<00:01:47.950> go<00:01:48.100> on<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.250> top<00:01:48.400> part<00:01:48.670> one

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
we're just gonna go on the top part one

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.710 
we're just gonna go on the top part one
two<00:01:49.690> three<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.880> from<00:01:51.880> this<00:01:52.060> block<00:01:52.299> here<00:01:52.570> we're

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
two three and from this block here we're

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.080 
two three and from this block here we're
just<00:01:52.840> gonna<00:01:52.930> have<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.260> stare<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.799> then<00:01:54.000> if<00:01:55.000> we

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
just gonna have a stare and then if we

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.969 
just gonna have a stare and then if we
build<00:01:55.270> up<00:01:55.360> again<00:01:55.680> we're<00:01:56.680> gonna<00:01:56.740> have<00:01:56.830> an

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
build up again we're gonna have an

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.130 
build up again we're gonna have an
upside<00:01:57.340> down<00:01:57.400> stare<00:01:57.820> right<00:01:58.030> here<00:01:58.540> like<00:01:58.720> that

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
upside down stare right here like that

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.840 
upside down stare right here like that
I<00:01:59.170> think<00:01:59.979> continue<00:02:00.310> these<00:02:00.400> upside<00:02:00.729> down

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
I think continue these upside down

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.030 
I think continue these upside down
stairs<00:02:01.119> just<00:02:01.330> go<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.600> back<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.680> then

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
stairs just go to the back and then

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.609 
stairs just go to the back and then
leave<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.549> last<00:02:03.760> one<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.750> have<00:02:04.869> a<00:02:04.900> slab<00:02:05.200> going

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
leave the last one you have a slab going

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.890 
leave the last one you have a slab going
on<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.950> bottom<00:02:06.250> pieces<00:02:06.640> just<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:07.570> know<00:02:07.689> going

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
on the bottom pieces just you know going

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.979 
on the bottom pieces just you know going
down<00:02:08.259> by<00:02:08.530> one<00:02:08.769> slab<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:10.330> continue<00:02:10.689> this<00:02:10.810> on

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
down by one slab then continue this on

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.800 
down by one slab then continue this on
the<00:02:11.080> front<00:02:11.290> one<00:02:11.590> two<00:02:12.040> three<00:02:12.580> then<00:02:13.420> this<00:02:13.569> time

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
the front one two three then this time

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.990 
the front one two three then this time
the<00:02:13.989> slabs<00:02:14.260> are<00:02:14.379> gonna<00:02:14.470> be<00:02:14.680> going<00:02:14.980> downward<00:02:15.879> so

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
the slabs are gonna be going downward so

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.330 
the slabs are gonna be going downward so
you<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.150> see<00:02:16.239> this<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.840> kind<00:02:16.989> of<00:02:17.019> moves

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
you can see this that it kind of moves

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.320 
you can see this that it kind of moves
towards<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.430> I'm<00:02:18.519> trying<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.760> make<00:02:18.879> this<00:02:19.030> this

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
towards it I'm trying to make this this

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.720 
towards it I'm trying to make this this
point<00:02:19.599> with<00:02:19.780> these<00:02:19.900> ones<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.410> again<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.610> can

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
point with these ones so again you can

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.839 
point with these ones so again you can
have<00:02:21.880> three<00:02:22.060> blocks<00:02:22.300> like<00:02:22.660> that

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
have three blocks like that

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.890 
have three blocks like that
okay<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.000> then<00:02:25.120> we're<00:02:25.209> gonna<00:02:25.329> do<00:02:25.569> is<00:02:25.719> if<00:02:25.840> we
