and<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.399> today's<00:00:53.760> game<00:00:54.149> that's<00:00:54.480> really

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and in today's game that's really

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.439 
and in today's game that's really
important<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.520> traditional<00:00:57.030> racket

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449

rackets is basically dead and accessory

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.270 
rackets is basically dead and accessory
technology<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.960> very<00:01:04.170> important<00:01:04.799> for<00:01:04.860> our

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
technology it's very important for our

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.550 
technology it's very important for our
levels<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.510> thing<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.900> important<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.439> you

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
levels that thing is important to you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.340 
levels that thing is important to you
okay<00:01:07.830> every<00:01:08.549> single<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.030> those<00:01:09.180> guys<00:01:09.350> they

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
okay every single one of those guys they

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.260 
okay every single one of those guys they
treat<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.799> thing<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.520> your<00:01:12.060> doctor

treat that thing like it's your doctor

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.000 
treat that thing like it's your doctor
that's<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:12.840> scalpel<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.380> think<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> lot<00:01:13.920> of

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that's your scalpel I think of a lot of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.620 
that's your scalpel I think of a lot of
fear<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.549> racket<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.240> also<00:01:15.390> at<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
fear with this racket but also at the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.210 
fear with this racket but also at the
same<00:01:15.659> time<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.439> also<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> lot<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> power

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
same time you also have a lot of power

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.060 
same time you also have a lot of power
so<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.479> good<00:01:18.689> balance<00:01:19.049> between<00:01:19.140> two<00:01:19.680> they

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
so it's a good balance between two they

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.590 
so it's a good balance between two they
were<00:01:20.130> players<00:01:20.549> who<00:01:20.820> used<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> glide

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
were players who used to glide

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.950 
were players who used to glide
gracefully<00:01:22.610> around<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.909> tennis<00:01:24.270> courts<00:01:24.689> of

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the world and it's probably fair to say

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.969 
the world and it's probably fair to say
most<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.600> those<00:01:27.720> players<00:01:28.049> hit<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> ball<00:01:28.740> in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
most of those players hit the ball in

most of those players hit the ball in
