00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.400
Hello everyone! Today I'm here to review the last product from Puma

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.240
the evoSPEED 1.4, in the leather version, which, I gotta admit, is something I kinda missed

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.400
But how will they perform on the pitch?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.500
Join me and find it out!

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.520
As I said before today I'm gonna review the leather version of the evoSPEED 1.4

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.300
But, like in almost every modern football boots we find the leather from the mid-foot to the forefoot area

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.960
From the first use I find the leather really soft and flexible, although it's not that thick

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.940
From the heel to the mid-foot we find the synthetic material

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.300
That, thanks to its stiffness ensures more stability

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.080
and it won't become a slipper, even after a lot of uses

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.940
The fit is really comfortable and this boot can host both slim and wide feet

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.560
To be honest I would have preferred a more tight fit, especially on the forefoot area

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.720
Just to have the "Speed-boot feeling"

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.160
On the synthetic part we find the brand new SPEEDFRAME technology

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
Which acts as the skeleton for the boot

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
And I think it does his job perfectly

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.660
The ball touch is great

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.080
Indeed the natural leather gives a padded and elegant touch, while still being enough precise

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.060
Also, the leather is really grippy and I noticed that when striking the ball but also supported my first touch

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.820
The soleplate is the same from the evoSPEED 1.2

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.720
From the heel to the midfoot we find the SPEEDTRACK that gives more stability and support

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.640
While on the forefoot we find the DUOFLEX which, as the name suggests, makes the forefoot part really flexible

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.300
The studs are all conical and this is something not too usual for a speed boot

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.540
It does perform really well

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.080
But I would have liked to have some bladed studs, especially on the forefoot

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.600
to give me more grip when accelerating

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.020
The protection is really good thanks to the natural leather which absorbs the impacts in a good way

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.980
Durability wise, although it improved from the previous model, we cannot be happy on this point

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.320
Indeed the upper is starting to split from the soleplate after eight hours of using

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.320
Ending this review I think the evoSPEED 1.4 are really great football boots

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.800
They are really comfortable, the fit is good and the soleplate does what is supposed to

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.980
But what do you think about this boots? Do you have some doubts?
