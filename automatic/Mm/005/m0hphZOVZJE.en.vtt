tournament but flying's was going up and

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.340 
tournament but flying's was going up and
I<00:03:21.940> decided<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.390> know<00:03:22.450> what<00:03:22.570> let's<00:03:22.930> take<00:03:23.320> a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
I decided you know what let's take a

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.470 
I decided you know what let's take a
shot<00:03:23.590> see<00:03:23.920> if<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.160> do<00:03:24.970> well<00:03:25.150> in<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.390> beginning

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
shot see if I do well in the beginning

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.390 
shot see if I do well in the beginning
and<00:03:25.900> then<00:03:26.049> move<00:03:26.799> on<00:03:26.950> from<00:03:26.980> there

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
and then move on from there

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.830 
and then move on from there
so<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:29.049> was<00:03:29.290> really<00:03:30.250> no<00:03:30.840> expectations

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
so it was really no expectations

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.009 
so it was really no expectations
whatsoever<00:03:32.049> but<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:33.850> turned<00:03:34.090> out<00:03:34.239> good<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.750> big

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
whatsoever but it turned out good a big

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.259 
whatsoever but it turned out good a big
field<00:03:35.320> I<00:03:35.769> think<00:03:35.799> there<00:03:36.549> was<00:03:36.640> close<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.239> a

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
field I think there was close to a

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.220 
field I think there was close to a
hundred<00:03:37.420> players<00:03:38.220> 96<00:03:39.220> players<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:40.230> obviously

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
hundred players 96 players and obviously

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.660 
hundred players 96 players and obviously
