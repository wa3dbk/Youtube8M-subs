00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
about and how to prevent that if you are

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.450 
about and how to prevent that if you are
somebody<00:00:36.719> who<00:00:36.750> wears<00:00:36.989> braids<00:00:37.350> or<00:00:37.770> weaves<00:00:38.010> or

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
somebody who wears braids or weaves or

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.850 
somebody who wears braids or weaves or
wigs<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.149> what<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.570> look<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.050> some<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
wigs and what to look for some of the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.680 
wigs and what to look for some of the
signs<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.489> didn't<00:00:41.790> notice<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.510> is

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
signs that I didn't notice because it is

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.410 
signs that I didn't notice because it is
definitely<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.700> condition<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.879> will<00:00:45.030> sneak

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
definitely a condition that will sneak

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.940 
definitely a condition that will sneak
up<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.110> you'll<00:00:46.230> look<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.770> you

can't tell what's going on because it

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.770 
can't tell what's going on because it
comes<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.660> very<00:00:54.690> slowly<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.949> I'm<00:00:56.570> right<00:00:57.570> now

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
if you look at my hairline it's a little

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.689 
if you look at my hairline it's a little
greasy<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:01.050> put<00:01:01.230> castor<00:01:01.649> oil<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.340> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
greasy I just put castor oil on it and I

greasy I just put castor oil on it and I
rub<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.719> some<00:01:03.899> Rogaine<00:01:04.260> which<00:01:04.860> doesn't

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
rub just some Rogaine which doesn't

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.950 
rub just some Rogaine which doesn't
really<00:01:05.400> work<00:01:05.700> I'm<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.119> using<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.510> last<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
really work I'm just using the last of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.539 
really work I'm just using the last of
it<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:07.770> I've<00:01:08.040> used<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.460> before

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
it that I have but I've used it before

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.920 
it that I have but I've used it before
and<00:01:08.939> I've<00:01:09.000> never<00:01:09.030> really<00:01:09.479> seen<00:01:09.720> any

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and I've never really seen any

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.870 
and I've never really seen any
difference<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.010> castor<00:01:11.430> oil<00:01:11.460> doesn't

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
difference and the castor oil doesn't

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.609 
difference and the castor oil doesn't
necessarily<00:01:12.390> bring<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> hair<00:01:13.049> follicles

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
necessarily bring the hair follicles

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.399 
necessarily bring the hair follicles
back<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.950> life<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.610> does<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
back to life but what it does do is the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
back to life but what it does do is the
hair<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> outside

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
hair that I have on the outside

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.719 
hair that I have on the outside
perimeter<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.590> makes<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.950> stronger<00:01:20.640> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
perimeter it just makes that stronger it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.039 
perimeter it just makes that stronger it
makes<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.000> healthier<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.420> makes<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.750> piece

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
makes it healthier it makes that piece

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.520 
makes it healthier it makes that piece
grow<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.810> in<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.080> piece<00:01:25.350> like

you can see right here this is fairly

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.660 
you can see right here this is fairly
bald<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.710> thin<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.400> then

bald and then it's really thin and then

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.789 
bald and then it's really thin and then
on<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.299> -<00:01:30.360> there's<00:01:31.049> pieces<00:01:31.320> where<00:01:31.680> it's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
think of on the market I have yet to go

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.719 
think of on the market I have yet to go
to<00:01:40.320> my<00:01:40.560> dermatologist<00:01:40.710> which<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.549> my<00:01:41.670> next

to my dermatologist which is my next

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.580 
to my dermatologist which is my next
step<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.490> maybe<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.090> do

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
step to see what maybe they can do

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.630 
step to see what maybe they can do
because<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.710> know<00:01:46.770> there's<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.130> cortisone

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
because I know there's like cortisone

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
because I know there's like cortisone
shots<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.210> stuff<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.649> my

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
shots and stuff like that so that's my

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.530 
shots and stuff like that so that's my
next<00:01:50.100> step<00:01:50.369> if<00:01:50.579> not<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:51.030> it'll<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.329> hair

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
next step if not then it'll be hair

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.969 
next step if not then it'll be hair
replacement<00:01:51.810> surgery<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.530> I'll<00:01:52.710> keep<00:01:52.860> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
replacement surgery and I'll keep you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.770

and<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.360> what<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.599> do<00:02:12.720> for<00:02:13.049> my<00:02:13.110> lace<00:02:13.409> front<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:13.890> I

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
and so what I do for my lace front is I

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.490 
and so what I do for my lace front is I
tend<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.459> want<00:02:14.939> to<00:02:15.090> lay<00:02:15.329> my<00:02:15.599> lace<00:02:15.870> fronts

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
tend not to want to lay my lace fronts

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.100 
tend not to want to lay my lace fronts
on<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:17.640> part<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.090> my<00:02:18.239> hair<00:02:18.480> just<00:02:18.720> simply

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
on this part of my hair just simply

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.350 
on this part of my hair just simply
because<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.769> is<00:02:19.799> already<00:02:20.129> fragile<00:02:20.549> so<00:02:20.879> I<00:02:20.970> push

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
because it is already fragile so I push

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.479 
because it is already fragile so I push
that<00:02:21.599> piece<00:02:21.840> back<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.409> then<00:02:22.530> lay<00:02:22.680> my<00:02:22.890> lace

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
that piece back and then lay my lace

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.240 
that piece back and then lay my lace
front<00:02:23.819> in<00:02:24.030> where<00:02:24.299> it's<00:02:24.510> really<00:02:24.840> thin<00:02:25.189> so<00:02:26.189> I'm

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
front in where it's really thin so I'm

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.399 
front in where it's really thin so I'm
going<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.430> go<00:02:26.489> ahead<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.879> show<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.140> how<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.170> put

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
going to go ahead and show you how I put

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.929 
going to go ahead and show you how I put
it<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.890> again<00:02:29.069> like<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.310> said<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.519> don't<00:02:29.790> use

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
it on and again like I said I don't use

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.119 
it on and again like I said I don't use
any<00:02:30.120> glue<00:02:30.530> specifically<00:02:31.530> because<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.829> where

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
any glue specifically because of where

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:38.960 
any glue specifically because of where
I'm<00:02:32.280> laying<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.390> hair<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> go<00:02:38.579> ahead<00:02:38.700> and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
I'm laying the hair so I go ahead and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.940 
I'm laying the hair so I go ahead and
put<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.209> on<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.629> then<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.810> put<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.230> backcomb<00:02:40.739> in

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
put it on and then I put the backcomb in

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.649 
put it on and then I put the backcomb in
because<00:02:41.280> there<00:02:41.459> are<00:02:41.579> three<00:02:41.879> columns<00:02:42.329> in<00:02:42.510> there

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
because there are three columns in there

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.119 
because there are three columns in there
there's<00:02:42.870> one<00:02:43.049> in<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> back<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.709> then<00:02:43.799> two<00:02:43.980> on

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
there's one in the back and then two on

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.910 
there's one in the back and then two on
the<00:02:44.250> sides<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:47.810> then<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.900> find<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.409> comb<00:02:49.709> on

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
the sides and then I find this comb on

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.479 
the sides and then I find this comb on
this<00:02:50.099> side<00:02:51.109> and<00:02:53.030> stick<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.150> into<00:02:54.480> my<00:02:54.629> cap<00:02:55.489> there

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
this side and stick it into my cap there

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.990 
this side and stick it into my cap there
in<00:02:56.970> there

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.060 

now<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.900> main<00:03:02.170> reason<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.650> don't<00:03:02.710> have<00:03:03.040> a

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
now the main reason I don't have a

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.950 
now the main reason I don't have a
flesh-colored<00:03:03.400> cap<00:03:04.060> on<00:03:04.360> with<00:03:04.780> this

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
flesh-colored cap on with this

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.550 
flesh-colored cap on with this
particular<00:03:05.260> wig<00:03:05.710> is<00:03:05.980> simply<00:03:06.610> because<00:03:06.760> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
particular wig is simply because the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.200 
particular wig is simply because the
hair<00:03:08.560> part<00:03:08.860> is<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.280> small<00:03:09.550> so<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:09.970> doesn't

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
hair part is so small so it doesn't

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.730 
hair part is so small so it doesn't
really<00:03:10.270> matter<00:03:10.570> whether<00:03:11.230> or<00:03:11.320> not<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.500> have<00:03:11.710> a

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
really matter whether or not I have a

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.510 
really matter whether or not I have a
flesh-colored

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.780 
or a hot pink polka dot wick other neat
there<00:03:17.620> what<00:03:17.830> it<00:03:17.920> matter<00:03:18.100> you<00:03:18.220> couldn't<00:03:18.520> see<00:03:18.670> it

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
there what it matter you couldn't see it

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.330 
there what it matter you couldn't see it
anyway<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:19.990> I<00:03:20.350> chose<00:03:20.740> to<00:03:20.950> use<00:03:20.980> my<00:03:21.540> black<00:03:22.540> do-rag

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
piece actually makes it look a little

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.350 
piece actually makes it look a little
more<00:04:28.620> realistic<00:04:29.040> and<00:04:29.550> one<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.180> main

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
more realistic and one of the main

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.210 
more realistic and one of the main
reasons<00:04:30.840> I<00:04:30.990> choose<00:04:31.350> to<00:04:31.590> wear<00:04:31.770> my<00:04:31.950> hair<00:04:32.160> like

reasons I choose to wear my hair like

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.300 
reasons I choose to wear my hair like
this<00:04:32.430> as<00:04:32.790> well<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.270> because<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.990> lace<00:04:34.350> never

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
this as well is because the lace never

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.560 
this as well is because the lace never
the<00:04:36.120> lace<00:04:36.360> on<00:04:36.630> most<00:04:37.020> lace<00:04:37.380> fronts<00:04:37.919> um

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
the lace on most lace fronts um

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.420 
the lace on most lace fronts um
storefront<00:04:39.570> store-bought<00:04:40.560> lace<00:04:41.010> fronts

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
storefront store-bought lace fronts

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.080 
storefront store-bought lace fronts
usually<00:04:42.270> goes<00:04:42.479> in<00:04:42.780> where<00:04:43.139> my<00:04:43.260> hair<00:04:43.500> comes<00:04:43.740> out

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
usually goes in where my hair comes out

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.060 
usually goes in where my hair comes out
so<00:04:45.090> regardless<00:04:45.990> even<00:04:46.139> if<00:04:46.290> I<00:04:46.410> had<00:04:46.590> hair<00:04:46.830> there<00:04:47.040> I

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
so regardless even if I had hair there I

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.680 
so regardless even if I had hair there I
probably<00:04:47.430> have<00:04:47.729> to<00:04:47.850> do<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.060> same<00:04:48.270> thing<00:04:48.540> just

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
probably have to do the same thing just

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.420 
probably have to do the same thing just
simply<00:04:49.050> because<00:04:49.350> of<00:04:49.380> where<00:04:49.710> this<00:04:49.919> comes<00:04:50.220> out

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
simply because of where this comes out

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.520 
simply because of where this comes out
the<00:04:51.030> top<00:04:51.060> of<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.510> hair<00:04:51.690> is<00:04:51.810> fine<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.350> usually

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
the top of the hair is fine so I usually

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.310 
the top of the hair is fine so I usually
just<00:04:52.710> leave<00:04:53.040> that<00:04:53.250> fine<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:53.820> then<00:04:54.479> also<00:04:54.900> again

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
just leave that fine and then also again

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.830 
just leave that fine and then also again
here<00:04:56.070> where<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.700> sideburns<00:04:57.270> are<00:04:57.479> they're

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
here where the sideburns are they're

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.510 
here where the sideburns are they're
further<00:04:58.050> back<00:04:58.200> than<00:04:58.530> where<00:04:58.680> my<00:04:58.860> own<00:04:59.010> sideburns

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
further back than where my own sideburns

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.070 
further back than where my own sideburns
are<00:04:59.700> so<00:04:59.850> even<00:05:00.090> if<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.240> had<00:05:00.419> a<00:05:00.450> full<00:05:00.750> natural

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
are so even if I had a full natural

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.340 
are so even if I had a full natural
hairline<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.919> will<00:05:02.190> probably<00:05:02.400> still<00:05:03.030> wear<00:05:03.750> the

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
hairline I will probably still wear the

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.230 
hairline I will probably still wear the
most<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.100> store-bought<00:05:05.610> lace<00:05:05.850> fronts
