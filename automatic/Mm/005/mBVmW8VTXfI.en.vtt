00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.150
 it was dear students, we arrived in class 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.700
 number 7 plus an issue of fcc 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.670
 junior administrative assistant 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.730
 in the year 2012 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.210
 the statement is as follows ana has 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:51.960
 exactly seven coins of one 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:56.489
 real 48 coin 50 cents 53 pounds 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.440
 of 25 cent coins and 29 coin of 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.140
 10 cents 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.090
 If ana is to total the amount of 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.100
 50 reais and to add any 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.740
 types of coins 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.720
 I think you already have the amount 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:21.470
 minimum amount of coins you should use is 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:25.050
 the sanction solution'm sun 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.770
 first let's see how much Ana has in 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.930
 real 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.880
 Come on in reais she has seven coins 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.210
 one real 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.000
 that means she has seven coins 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.750
 of a real seven times the defendant 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.820
 she has seven reais 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.820
 she already has seven reais 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:59.549
 continuing it has 48 coins of 50 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:04.380
 48 cents 48 cents 48 more 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:08.250
 50 Cent would be 48 times 50 going 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.800
 then give 2,400 cents which twenty 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.460
 real four and forty-eight currencies 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:19.400
 50 cents so she's twenty-four 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.400
 reais and twenty- four reais 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.860
 she also has 53 coins of 25 cents 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:35.489
 53 Currency 25 cents 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:39.000
 Let's do it 53 times 25 53 times 25 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:48.450
 making this account 53 25 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:51.830
 bill 325 thousand 325 therefore thousand 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:59.010
 three hundred and twenty-five cents 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:03:01.280
 represents three reais and twenty five 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.280
 cents 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.930
 continuing 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:13.739
 she has 29 10 cent coin 29 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:18.239
 pennies would give 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:21.239
 two hundred and ninety cents, which is two 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.810
 reais and ninety cents 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.520
 So let's add how much Ana already has with 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:36.530
 the value she has 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:49.049
 you have 0 0 0 5 2 plus nine 11 and there's 11 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:55.310
 788 from 4 to 12 twelve 12 and three from 15 18 12 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:55.310
 12 tries of 15 15 2 to 17 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:10.350
 then 17 goes the 3314 windows what the 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.060
 ana owns would be forty-seven reais and 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.440
 fifteen cents 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:28.850
 soon as she prays for missing missing 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:31.320
 then R $ 50 - forty-seven reais and 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.450
 fifteen cents 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:39.780
 as soon as it was missing it would be 2 reais and 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.640
 eighty-five cents and that is what 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.990
 Are you missing her? 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.650
 two reais and eighty-five cents 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:52.860
 so we have here we have to put together 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:56.370
 two reais and eighty-five cents 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.939
 to complete 50 and she leaves the 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.599
 add any coins since 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:06.650
 I think I already have the 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:10.199
 amount of coins you should use is 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.389
 her that the minimum minimum amount 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.849
 then to add two reais and eighty 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.909
 five cents minimum amount she 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.729
 You have to initially use maas coins 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.569
 higher value as you have to mount two 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.400
 real 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:33.419
 she will need two coins 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:34.919
 two currencies of a real each of a 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.039
 real 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.439
 there will be missing 85 cents since 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:46.580
 missing in 35 cents 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:06:02.639
 she will then get a coin a coin 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:06:05.729
 a 50 cents coin and already has two 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:16.250
 50 turns 35 cents 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:25.560
 so she gets a quarter of a cent 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:31.349
 already has two and 75 takes one more coin 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:36.089
 10 cents of 10 cents 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:39.779
 here you have two reais plus 50's 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:42.360
 reais and 50 cents plus 25 reais and 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:45.120
 seventy-five cents to 10 cents 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.029
 two reais and eighty-five cents 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.330
 she will need two neighborhoods 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:55.680
 one more one more 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:07:00.060
 laws put the minimum amount of coins 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.789
 What will she have to put together is five 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.399
 coins 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:06.600
 the minimum quantity of coins 

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:10.530
 so it's the same 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:14.040
 5 this five amount alternative 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:18.330
 is not found in letter b of 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.350
 ball won the point that scored the letter b 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.310
 ball 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:27.140
 in question number 7 letter B of ball 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:30.090
 are 7 liter ball 5 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:33.480
 Let's have some good luck around here. 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:36.620
 Do you and the next question? 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.620
