00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
piece of pipe and with an angle and what

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.540 
piece of pipe and with an angle and what
about<00:00:10.790> that<00:00:11.030> on<00:00:11.150> the<00:00:11.240> bottom<00:00:11.570> was<00:00:11.719> head<00:00:11.990> and<00:00:12.550> if

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550 
about that on the bottom was head and if

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.459 
about that on the bottom was head and if
my<00:00:13.790> calculations<00:00:14.090> are<00:00:14.809> right<00:00:14.990> that<00:00:15.230> should

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
my calculations are right that should

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.730 
my calculations are right that should
tilt<00:00:15.769> his<00:00:16.070> head<00:00:16.930> like<00:00:17.930> it<00:00:18.080> disturb<00:00:18.500> just

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
tilt his head like it disturb just

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.250 
tilt his head like it disturb just
exactly<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:19.369> right<00:00:19.490> way<00:00:19.699> it<00:00:19.940> should<00:00:20.180> tilt<00:00:20.420> his

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
exactly the right way it should tilt his

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.320 
exactly the right way it should tilt his
head<00:00:21.380> down<00:00:21.890> and<00:00:22.279> a<00:00:22.310> little<00:00:22.430> to<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:22.789> right<00:00:22.970> and

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
head down and a little to the right and

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.679 
head down and a little to the right and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
the video that was the suggestion that

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.080 
the video that was the suggestion that

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.869 

reality<00:02:50.010> what<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:53.280> need<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.430> look<00:02:54.549> down<00:02:54.819> a

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
reality what you need to look down a

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.570 
reality what you need to look down a
little<00:02:55.030> bit<00:02:55.299> more<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:56.040> well<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.190> thought<00:02:57.400> I'd

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
little bit more so well I thought I'd

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.680 
little bit more so well I thought I'd
put<00:02:57.819> too<00:02:58.030> much<00:02:58.180> angle<00:02:58.569> on<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:58.870> but<00:03:00.540> I'm<00:03:01.540> gonna

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
put too much angle on that but I'm gonna

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.949 
put too much angle on that but I'm gonna
angle<00:03:01.930> us<00:03:02.110> more<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:03.390> that's<00:03:04.390> why<00:03:04.629> we<00:03:04.810> could

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
angle us more so that's why we could

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:20.000 
angle us more so that's why we could
drive

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:28.740 

go<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.160> way<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.610> thing<00:03:27.270> let's<00:03:28.270> take<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.570> look

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
go that way that thing let's take a look
