00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.080
 Hi, I'm Carlos MartÃ­nez, collaborator of 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.330
 the gps house and I'll show you the 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.020
 aesthetic grip monge 3 for 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.910
 cameras vo pro 03 03 plus the first thing 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.360
 let's do is light the hilt 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.770
 pressing the button on the back 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.899
 in this part of here will light a 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.719
 red and blue light that will indicate that the 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.760
 system is starting this process 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.559
 It lasts about 15 seconds 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.199
 you will wonder how the 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.180
 grip the handle incorporates a 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.070
 electronic jimbal that controls the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.860
 position of the camera at all times 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.509
 this allows you to get images 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.330
 stabilized and leveled observe how 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.490
 although I move the handle 45 degrees 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.069
 up or down or even 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.790
 make rotation movement the camera 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.350
 it continues to point 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.680
 towards the same place and without leaning 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.400
 if you notice when raising or lowering the camera 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.400
 it was even when rotating it the camera follows 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.040
 looking at the horizon at all times 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.470
 by pressing these buttons we can modify 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.970
 the tilt of the camera up to 45 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.640
 degrees above the line of the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.990
 horizon or put it totally 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.909
 perpendicular to the ground 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.009
 when we want to work with the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.079
 grip in a different position than 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.330
 the horizontal as for example vertical 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.020
 we will have to change the position of the magnet 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.049
 to do this we loose this moth 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.270
 we push the rear engine to put it 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.210
 in vertical position perpendicular to 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.740
 floor if we turn the rear engine a 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.899
 little more 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.899
 we can record ourselves 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.829
 get stable and powerful images 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.290
 with the g3 grip from facebook that 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.290
 you'll find in the dotcom gps house
