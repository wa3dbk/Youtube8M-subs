00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.820
 first intervention of the young goalkeeper 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.820
 from the asm 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.600
 as often this season the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.180
 Monegasques they will react quickly 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.010

 small net of the icca 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.100

 score just before the half-time valer 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.990

 by ferreira carrasco the counter-foot 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.329
 perfect from everywhere it will be the sport at the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.360
 half-time but also at the end of the 90's 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.360
 minutes 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.720
 place to extensions and that's 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.030
 one of the summer recruits who will do 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.410
 the difference on an air center of 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.780
 towers and compost makes 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.400
 the perfect sequence a small control 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.980
 hook and knocks rolled into the 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.930
 skylight first goal of the Argentine under

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.549
 come 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.549
 future idol city emptied 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.930
 the Monegasques even aggravate the 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.150
 mark at the very end of the meeting on 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.670
 agreements quickly launches on ferreira 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.590
 carrasco that goes all the terrain and 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.380
 offers on a platter the doubled to 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.850
 ibrahima turned 12th goals all 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.550
 competitions for the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.880
 Senegalese this season 4 to 2 score 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.880
 final 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.510
 and that gives it was a good test against 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.520
 a superior opponent 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.470
 we suffered the first twenty 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.360
 minutes they are better back in the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.610
 match and put us in trouble 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.400
 we were surprised even though we knew 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.200
 that he would play this way there after 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.360
 the two goals conceded we started to 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.340
 to play to be dangerous it was 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.970
 important to pass this round we wanted 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.280
 to qualify 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.750
 and now it will be complicated but 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.060
 all matches are complicated a 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.530
 total appertisation accomplished because if one 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.990
 take the last two games in brest 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.180
 we did not know how to make the break and we 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.190
 did not know how to kill the match and today 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.680
 we put the opponent back on track 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.810
 while we have the game in hand we lead 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.960
 2 0 and we make gross mistakes 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:02.120
 the first on a corner where we are 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:04.040
 not to mark the opponent's attacker at 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.220
 to make gross mistakes like that 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.160
 in the surface 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.170
 lucidity in mastery gives too much 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.910
 easily to the opponent opposes to 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.820
 neurons we had come with ambition 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.500
 to qualify despite everything and there has been 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.310
 good things we had opportunities 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.430
 also the score at 1 in data would have 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.570
 could be paid but eventually monaco 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.000
 was more realistic 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.300
 in the next round the asm will receive another 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.120
 training of the elite 3 current lantern 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.870
 league red 1 game on 30 or 31 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.870
