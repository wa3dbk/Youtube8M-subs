 merengues tecos because they suspect students 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.250
 but today we are going to teach a recipe 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.250
 faster to the microwave 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.090

 Chantilly fresh fruits more for 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.170
 chocolate 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.170
 if they want to get 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.440
 then what we are going to do is add 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.280
 light egg white clear egg 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.840
 and about 350 flower sugar that 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.840
 this is about a cup and a half 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.220
 yes but he knows a lot 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:14.040
 this is magical the cornfield a zone of 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.590
 corn in a teaspoon of cornstarch yes and 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.800
 let's mix to generate mix 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.870
 mix and this is going to form a paste 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.160
 compact like this here I have a little 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.720
 look at a mass and a compact mass effect 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.900
 I'm not going to put my hands home but to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.270
 let it go after it is mixed if it 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.800
 you love I start to knead it already and you 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.860
 look they notice that you start to get 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.420
 this way pumps looks like that while 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.070
 He works there and I'll start to 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:50.070
 make them in the microwave to see what 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:52.190
 fast that is with children because no no 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.190
 do not 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.490
 it's like a box inside the demanding 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.899
 butter paper we're going to need and what 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.950
 we are going to place in the microwave 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.950
 maximum power 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:12.580
 and I learned only one little ball of power and 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.890
 then the time that time we are going to 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.980
 place 30 seconds until power 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.460
 maximum that is the maximum is 800 day the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.890
 most 850 30 seconds and we're going to 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.330
 scream then I will call you 30 seconds more 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.210
 and we reopen it and it should 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.990
 stay dry and dry dry 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.990
 how's it going 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.700
 again incorporates all the cornstarch and 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.410
 the whole super globe like that with this 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.950
 you can get out about size 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.750
 big can go out as 40 friends today 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.750
 it's a side question you can change 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.550
 sugar flower but in this case not in 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.230
 this kind of recipe not because sugar 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.030
 that we take care of you here is not going to have the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.070
 same behavior look look take 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.810
 growing work I house it no 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.310
 kitchen with ring and I do not know what but here 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.310
 We are fishing time of 30 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:11.720
 and you have to do it 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:39.329
 as parts off him and 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:41.470
 make the accommodation to see if it is already 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:46.420
 dry with sinks 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.820
 ten seconds more money but never 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.040
 many three paintings 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:56.340
 of this amount we can draw then 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.780
 as 20 or per children's area 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.430
 wake up early city we do well 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.690
 huevitos chiquititos hours ball follow 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.040
 in good sleep you never again to your 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.140
 names were fixed that the one we did 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.270
 it was about this size and it came out 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.920
 where you were this size and going to 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.120
 get out there comes the final result that 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.770
 it has to be perfect it was a myth of 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.610
 that children with sugar are 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.610
 they woke up serious 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.800
 another way 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.800
 for him 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:41.939
 the problem is no problem is 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:43.379
 important not to make it too big 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.969
 because the grandmother who 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:48.599
 we made ourselves the size that was left and 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:54.659
 it grows a lot then look here I already 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:57.889
 I have more redondita lists can be 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:05:03.349
 as irregular grow different 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:06.599
 purposes of cream chantilly cream 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:10.680
 chantilly and we started making little balls 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:16.759
 what is the recipe for chantilly cream 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.759
 I wanted expensive cold creams only 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:35.240
 do not freeze quite well and decorate 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.240
 with fruit the one you want 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:41.249
 and look at another suggestion to decorate and 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.770
 there you can put nose nose and it's 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:46.999
 of course we can make some more little ones 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.999
 and we cover more of granny with more 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.999
 perfect 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:58.110
 the idea and if not already to accompany a 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.939
 ice cream this look flower of grana and what 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.270
 we place on a type ice cream 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:06.719
 vegetable and cited wonderful base the 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:11.209
 simple good nice cheap to do it 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.209
 with the guys at home so excellent 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:15.139
 culinary we have
