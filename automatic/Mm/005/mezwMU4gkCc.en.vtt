00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
Golden Temple hopefully this takes us to

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.650 
Golden Temple hopefully this takes us to
world<00:00:05.100> 9<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.790> new<00:00:05.970> world<00:00:06.240> I'm<00:00:07.200> unsure<00:00:07.649> though

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
world 9 the new world I'm unsure though

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.959 
world 9 the new world I'm unsure though
so<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.960> believe<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.679> Golden<00:00:10.980> Temple<00:00:11.160> was<00:00:11.610> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
so I believe the Golden Temple was the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.310 
so I believe the Golden Temple was the
secret<00:00:12.420> level<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:14.070> original<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.360> don't

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
secret level in the original so I don't

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.279 
secret level in the original so I don't
know<00:00:16.379> how<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.740> works<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.789> game<00:00:21.289> we'll

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
soon find out

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.880 
soon find out
take<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.010> orbs<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.580> power<00:00:30.500> then<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.619> find<00:00:31.830> out

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
take the orbs of power then we find out

00:00:31.890 --> 00:01:12.260 
take the orbs of power then we find out
there's<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.160> secret<00:00:32.460> nightfall

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.620 

ah<00:01:15.740> there<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.799> go

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
ah there we go

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.600 
ah there we go
so<00:01:18.630> does<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.780> cutscene<00:01:19.320> new<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> guess<00:01:20.340> not<00:01:20.580> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
so does that cutscene new I guess not I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.710 
so does that cutscene new I guess not I
guess<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:20.970> took<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> other

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
guess it just took you to the other

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.380 
guess it just took you to the other
world<00:01:21.930> before<00:01:22.460> no<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.700> other<00:01:23.880> level<00:01:24.180> should<00:01:24.299> I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
world before no the other level should I

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.139

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
case now believe these are based off the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.889 
case now believe these are based off the
words<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> game<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.880> there's<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.299> level<00:01:39.539> /

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
words of the game so there's a level /

right time yeah I can nice oh did the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.490 
right time yeah I can nice oh did the
checkpoint<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:02.580> mean<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.820> I<00:03:04.360> don't<00:03:05.110> know<00:03:05.320> how

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
checkpoint I mean I I don't know how

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.650 
checkpoint I mean I I don't know how
difficult<00:03:06.190> these<00:03:06.310> levels<00:03:06.700> are<00:03:06.790> going<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.120> be<00:03:07.360> I

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
difficult these levels are going to be I

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.470 
difficult these levels are going to be I
I<00:03:08.650> don't<00:03:08.770> know<00:03:09.040> if<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.459> tailored<00:03:10.180> to

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
I don't know if this is tailored to

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.740 
I don't know if this is tailored to
world<00:03:11.320> ones<00:03:11.680> difficulty<00:03:12.459> or<00:03:12.640> not<00:03:12.820> or<00:03:13.209> if<00:03:13.570> it's

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
world ones difficulty or not or if it's

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.410 
world ones difficulty or not or if it's
just<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.550> harder<00:03:15.550> phone<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.000> doesn't<00:03:16.270> seem

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
just a harder phone so it doesn't seem

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
just a harder phone so it doesn't seem
too<00:03:16.780> difficult

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
too difficult

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.199 
too difficult
yeah<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:17.590> mean<00:03:17.860> obviously<00:03:18.700> it's<00:03:18.850> harder<00:03:19.180> than

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
yeah I mean obviously it's harder than

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.610 
yeah I mean obviously it's harder than
world<00:03:19.540> one<00:03:19.780> itself<00:03:20.320> but<00:03:20.970> he<00:03:21.970> doesn't<00:03:22.300> seem

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
world one itself but he doesn't seem

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.390 
world one itself but he doesn't seem
difficult<00:03:23.700> as<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:25.000> yet<00:03:25.360> anyway

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
difficult as of yet anyway

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.110 
difficult as of yet anyway
