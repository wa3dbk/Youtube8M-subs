some no that's just a highlight that

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.179 
some no that's just a highlight that
they<00:04:37.030> put<00:04:37.210> in<00:04:37.330> her<00:04:37.419> on<00:04:37.569> okay<00:04:38.199> for<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:38.860> second

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
around is that okay that looks like it

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.439 
around is that okay that looks like it
was<00:04:57.009> just<00:04:57.069> for<00:04:57.310> cosmetic<00:04:57.759> reasons<00:04:57.819> that<00:04:58.300> they

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
was just for cosmetic reasons that they
