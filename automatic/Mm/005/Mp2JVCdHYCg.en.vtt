associated with it now what I did was is
taking<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> factory<00:00:39.210> built<00:00:39.540> cabinet<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.290> added<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
taking a factory built cabinet I added a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.240 
taking a factory built cabinet I added a
plywood<00:00:41.460> gusset<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.480> side<00:00:43.100> making<00:00:44.100> sure

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
points that I possibly could to make

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.600 
points that I possibly could to make
this<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.300> strong<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.780> possible<00:00:49.280> then<00:00:50.280> above

back wheels didn't come up off of the
track<00:01:07.470> one<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> major<00:01:08.549> issues<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.240> had<00:01:09.530> was

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
track one of the major issues we had was

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.160 
track one of the major issues we had was
this<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> concrete<00:01:11.430> basement<00:01:11.640> floor<00:01:12.170> it's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
this is a concrete basement floor it's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.260 
this is a concrete basement floor it's
not<00:01:13.320> perfectly<00:01:13.950> leveled<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.880> matter<00:01:15.240> of

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
not perfectly leveled as a matter of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.510 
not perfectly leveled as a matter of
fact<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.810> actually<00:01:16.170> runs<00:01:16.350> uphill<00:01:16.710> from<00:01:17.369> where

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
fact it actually runs uphill from where

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.969 
fact it actually runs uphill from where
the<00:01:17.670> carpet<00:01:18.090> covers<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.720> bottom<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.799> runs

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the carpet covers the bottom and it runs

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.859 
the carpet covers the bottom and it runs
uphill<00:01:20.310> toward<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> outside<00:01:21.119> walls<00:01:21.659> from

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
uphill toward the outside walls from

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.890 
uphill toward the outside walls from
both<00:01:22.080> directions<00:01:22.610> now<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> did<00:01:24.330> was<00:01:24.600> is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
both directions now what I did was is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140 
both directions now what I did was is
when<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.110> put<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> tracks<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.520> actually

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
when I put the tracks in I actually

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.660 
when I put the tracks in I actually
built<00:01:27.659> my<00:01:27.720> frame<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.860> went<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.369> about

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
built my frame so that it went up about

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.940 
built my frame so that it went up about
an<00:01:29.850> eighth<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.210> an<00:01:30.329> inch<00:01:30.450> per<00:01:30.750> foot<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.710> allow

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
an eighth of an inch per foot to allow

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.830 
an eighth of an inch per foot to allow
the<00:01:32.009> base<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.729> cabinet<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.540> enough

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the base of this cabinet to have enough

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.140 
the base of this cabinet to have enough
clearance<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.560> get<00:01:34.710> back<00:01:34.979> without<00:01:35.850> being

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
clearance to get back without being

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.330 
clearance to get back without being
obstructed<00:01:36.750> by<00:01:36.869> hitting<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.290> floor<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.799> used<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
obstructed by hitting the floor I used a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.460 
obstructed by hitting the floor I used a
few<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.850> simple<00:01:39.270> bullet<00:01:39.720> type<00:01:39.930> catches

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
few of the simple bullet type catches

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.410 
few of the simple bullet type catches
where<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> wheels<00:01:41.310> roll<00:01:41.670> over<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> outside

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
where the wheels roll over the outside

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.960 
where the wheels roll over the outside
and<00:01:42.659> snap<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.740> temporarily<00:01:44.310> hold<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
and snap it to temporarily hold the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.120 
and snap it to temporarily hold the
thing<00:01:45.630> closed<00:01:45.960> until<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> permanent

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
engineered to hold 150 pounds each so

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.420 
engineered to hold 150 pounds each so
we're<00:03:09.150> up<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.450> about<00:03:09.540> 300<00:03:10.290> pounds<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:10.770> capacity

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
we're up to about 300 pounds of capacity

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.910 
we're up to about 300 pounds of capacity
with<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.910> cabinet<00:03:12.330> included<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.440> cabinet's

may be between 80 and a hundred pounds

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.039 
may be between 80 and a hundred pounds
so<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:17.010> could<00:03:17.549> overload<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.390> cabinet<00:03:18.900> I

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
so you could overload this cabinet I

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.449 
so you could overload this cabinet I
