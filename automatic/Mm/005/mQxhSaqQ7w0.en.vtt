a project I've been working on for a

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.920 
a project I've been working on for a
while<00:00:23.660> I<00:00:25.279> wanted<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.490> design<00:00:26.880> an<00:00:27.119> explosion

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
out when you first start playing it you

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.730 
out when you first start playing it you
see<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> little<00:01:50.610> birds<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.540> they're<00:01:52.409> looking

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
see the little birds and they're looking

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.440 
see the little birds and they're looking
at<00:01:52.860> an<00:01:52.979> empty<00:01:53.280> nest<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.850> they<00:01:53.939> got<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> little

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
at an empty nest and they got the little

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.350 
at an empty nest and they got the little
question<00:01:54.930> marks<00:01:55.259> above<00:01:55.530> their<00:01:55.710> heads<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:57.329> I
