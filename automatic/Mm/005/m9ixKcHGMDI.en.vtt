00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
different shifts and we so we trained

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.420 
different shifts and we so we trained
three<00:01:39.060> times<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.570> month<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.080> that<00:01:40.200> does<00:01:40.470> two

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
three times a month and that does two

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.100 
three times a month and that does two
things<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.880> may<00:01:42.030> ensures<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.930> fire

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
things that may ensures that the fire

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
month training in addition to that by

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.820 
month training in addition to that by
using<00:01:47.730> those<00:01:48.090> three<00:01:48.450> shifts<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:49.110> ensures<00:01:49.710> that

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
using those three shifts it ensures that

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.430 
using those three shifts it ensures that
each<00:01:50.190> of<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.490> pilots<00:01:50.760> gets<00:01:51.510> through<00:01:52.290> the
