00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
I'll go do some research and see if I

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.299 
I'll go do some research and see if I
really<00:00:59.550> need<00:01:00.000> one<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:01.230> what<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.440> did<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.710> got<00:01:01.890> home

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
really need one so what I did I got home

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.420 
really need one so what I did I got home
went<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> computer<00:01:02.879> check<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> forums

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
went on the computer check the forums

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
went on the computer check the forums

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
everybody on there said man you don't

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.770 
everybody on there said man you don't
need<00:01:06.660> a<00:01:07.009> PC<00:01:08.009> for<00:01:08.369> you

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
need a PC for you

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.969 
need a PC for you
slip-on<00:01:09.780> exhaust<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.410> said<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:10.920> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
slip-on exhaust you said if you have a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.280 
slip-on exhaust you said if you have a
full<00:01:11.280> exhaust<00:01:11.670> yeah<00:01:12.119> but<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.960> don't<00:01:13.049> need<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
full exhaust yeah but you don't need a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.160 
full exhaust yeah but you don't need a
for<00:01:13.560> slip-on

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
for slip-on

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.880 
for slip-on
so<00:01:16.090> just<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.180> make<00:01:17.330> sure<00:01:17.360> I<00:01:17.540> contacted<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.440> honda

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
so just to make sure I contacted a honda

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.920 
so just to make sure I contacted a honda
technician<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.810> he<00:01:21.260> said<00:01:22.510> he<00:01:23.510> said<00:01:23.720> no<00:01:23.869> you

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.730 
technician and he said he said no you
don't<00:01:24.229> need<00:01:24.409> it

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
don't need it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.859 
don't need it
he<00:01:24.890> said<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:25.280> he<00:01:25.729> said<00:01:26.030> that<00:01:26.240> actually<00:01:26.420> you'll

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
he said you he said that actually you'll

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.750 
he said you he said that actually you'll
lose<00:01:27.200> fuel<00:01:27.590> efficiency<00:01:28.190> you<00:01:28.400> won't<00:01:28.610> really

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
lose fuel efficiency you won't really

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.050 
lose fuel efficiency you won't really
gain<00:01:29.060> much<00:01:29.330> performance<00:01:30.280> he<00:01:31.280> said<00:01:31.580> you<00:01:31.970> know

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
gain much performance he said you know

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.700 
gain much performance he said you know
we're<00:01:32.240> just<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.660> slip<00:01:32.900> on<00:01:33.080> alone<00:01:33.440> you

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
we're just to slip on alone you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.980 
we're just to slip on alone you
generally<00:01:34.130> lose<00:01:34.340> about<00:01:34.670> he<00:01:34.940> said<00:01:35.119> about<00:01:35.300> one

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
generally lose about he said about one

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.749 
generally lose about he said about one
miles<00:01:36.259> per<00:01:36.500> gallon<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.920> fuel<00:01:37.130> efficiency<00:01:37.670> he

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
miles per gallon the fuel efficiency he

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.810 
miles per gallon the fuel efficiency he
said<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.360> with<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.140> power<00:01:39.920> commander<00:01:40.520> said

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
said and with a power commander said

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.359 
said and with a power commander said
you'll<00:01:41.000> lose<00:01:41.210> you'll<00:01:41.810> lose<00:01:42.020> more<00:01:42.350> in<00:01:43.040> fuel

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
you'll lose you'll lose more in fuel

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.820 
you'll lose you'll lose more in fuel
efficiency<00:01:44.020> so<00:01:45.020> I'm<00:01:45.080> like<00:01:45.350> okay<00:01:45.710> I'm<00:01:45.800> not

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
efficiency so I'm like okay I'm not

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.889 
efficiency so I'm like okay I'm not
going<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.220> get<00:01:46.369> probably<00:01:47.330> any<00:01:47.630> better

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
going to get probably any better

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.260 
going to get probably any better
performance<00:01:48.560> I'm<00:01:49.520> going<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.789> lose<00:01:50.000> fuel

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
performance I'm going to lose fuel

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.200 
performance I'm going to lose fuel
efficiency<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:51.860> cost<00:01:52.130> $500<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:52.910> put<00:01:53.090> on

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
efficiency and it cost $500 to put on

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.320 
efficiency and it cost $500 to put on
this<00:01:53.630> box<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:55.039> take<00:01:55.220> up<00:01:55.430> more<00:01:55.610> space<00:01:56.000> in<00:01:56.240> my

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
this box to take up more space in my

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.540 
this box to take up more space in my
trunk<00:01:56.630> I<00:01:57.009> said<00:01:58.009> fucking<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.670> didn't<00:01:59.600> get<00:01:59.750> it
