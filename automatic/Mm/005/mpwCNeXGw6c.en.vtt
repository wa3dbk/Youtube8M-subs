00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
doing it all in one so first up you're

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.779 
doing it all in one so first up you're
going<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.780> grease<00:00:46.260> your<00:00:46.469> cake<00:00:46.920> tin<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.520> i'm

going to grease your cake tin and i'm

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.430 
going to grease your cake tin and i'm
using<00:00:48.120> fry<00:00:48.329> light<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.140> also<00:00:49.260> use

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
using fry light but you can also use

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.250 
using fry light but you can also use
butter<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.210> then<00:00:51.210> you're<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> put<00:00:52.110> in

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
butter and then you're going to put in

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
butter and then you're going to put in
your<00:00:52.289> grease<00:00:52.710> proof<00:00:52.980> paper<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:53.940> isn't<00:00:54.300> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
your grease proof paper this one isn't a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.770 
your grease proof paper this one isn't a
circular<00:00:54.989> cake<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.680> guess<00:00:56.010> style<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.270> any<00:00:57.539> is

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
circular cake I guess style but any is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.069 
circular cake I guess style but any is
good<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.430> that<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.550> more<00:00:59.910> like<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.690> like

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
good for you that is more like it I like

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.880 
good for you that is more like it I like
say<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.640> find<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> be

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
say if you find that this is going to be

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.870 
say if you find that this is going to be
a<00:01:05.250> bit<00:01:06.119> too<00:01:06.450> short<00:01:06.869> just<00:01:07.140> add<00:01:07.880> greaseproof

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
a bit too short just add greaseproof

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.090 
a bit too short just add greaseproof
paper<00:01:08.939> around<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.810> edges<00:01:09.960> together<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
paper around the edges together so it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.440 
paper around the edges together so it
doesn't<00:01:11.430> come<00:01:11.520> apart<00:01:11.549> when<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.119> pour<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
doesn't come apart when you pour the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.350 
doesn't come apart when you pour the
mixture<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.520> part<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:15.119> getting

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
mixture so for this part we are getting

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.560 
mixture so for this part we are getting
out<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.960> main<00:01:16.290> mix<00:01:16.850> empty<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> cake<00:01:18.210> mixture

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
out the main mix empty the cake mixture

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.920 
out the main mix empty the cake mixture
into<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.229> bowl

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.179 

for<00:01:25.930> this<00:01:26.049> next<00:01:26.259> step<00:01:26.530> you<00:01:26.710> are<00:01:26.830> going<00:01:27.009> to<00:01:27.100> need

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
for this next step you are going to need

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.070 
for this next step you are going to need
to<00:01:27.430> medium<00:01:27.880> eggs<00:01:28.119> and<00:01:28.420> you<00:01:28.540> will<00:01:28.750> need<00:01:28.840> to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
to medium eggs and you will need to

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.950 
to medium eggs and you will need to
crack<00:01:29.320> them<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:29.799> empty<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.640> contents<00:01:30.970> into

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
crack them and empty the contents into

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.730 
crack them and empty the contents into
the<00:01:32.619> mix<00:01:32.890> discarding<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.850> shelves

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the mix discarding the shelves

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.780 
the mix discarding the shelves
unfortunately<00:01:35.740> usually<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.130> very<00:01:36.190> unlucky

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
unfortunately usually a very unlucky

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.639 
unfortunately usually a very unlucky
when<00:01:37.060> I'm<00:01:37.210> doing<00:01:37.360> this<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:37.899> somehow<00:01:38.350> this

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
when I'm doing this and somehow this

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.510 
when I'm doing this and somehow this
actually<00:01:39.009> turned<00:01:39.220> out<00:01:39.340> all<00:01:39.549> right<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.659> go<00:01:41.170> me

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
actually turned out all right so go me

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.980 
actually turned out all right so go me
instead<00:01:42.520> of<00:01:42.580> using<00:01:42.789> milk<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.240> suggested<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:43.960> use

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
instead of using milk I suggested I use

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.690 
instead of using milk I suggested I use
the<00:01:44.409> gingerbread<00:01:44.830> latte<00:01:45.250> since<00:01:45.580> it's

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
the gingerbread latte since it's

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.670 
the gingerbread latte since it's
primarily<00:01:46.090> milk<00:01:46.509> anyway<00:01:46.960> since<00:01:47.200> it's<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.470> latte

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
primarily milk anyway since it's a latte

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.880 
primarily milk anyway since it's a latte
and<00:01:48.159> you<00:01:49.030> know<00:01:49.180> I<00:01:49.450> used<00:01:49.690> eight<00:01:50.440> tablespoons

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
and you know I used eight tablespoons

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.520 
and you know I used eight tablespoons
but<00:01:51.399> slightly<00:01:51.759> more<00:01:52.090> generous<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:52.750> maybe

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
but slightly more generous and maybe

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.889 
but slightly more generous and maybe
added<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:54.009> bit<00:01:54.190> too<00:01:54.460> much<00:01:54.490> extra<00:01:55.450> but<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:55.810> know

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
added a bit too much extra but you know

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.260 
added a bit too much extra but you know
it's<00:01:56.020> fine<00:01:56.229> eight<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.619> ten<00:01:56.830> is<00:01:57.069> a<00:01:57.280> good<00:01:57.610> even

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
it's fine eight to ten is a good even

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.359 
it's fine eight to ten is a good even
amount<00:01:58.569> okay<00:01:59.229> so<00:01:59.289> now<00:01:59.560> you<00:01:59.619> gotta<00:01:59.830> mix<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.250> all

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
amount okay so now you gotta mix it all

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.910 
amount okay so now you gotta mix it all
together

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.550 

this<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:06.060> probably<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.659> best<00:02:06.840> part<00:02:07.140> is

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
this is like probably the best part is

stylized<00:04:57.070> me<00:04:57.310> and<00:04:58.090> I<00:04:58.270> think<00:04:58.480> it'd<00:04:58.570> be<00:04:58.600> really

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
stylized me and I think it'd be really

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.450 
stylized me and I think it'd be really
nice<00:04:59.050> so<00:04:59.650> yeah<00:05:00.420> we<00:05:01.420> just<00:05:01.510> gotta<00:05:02.250> kind<00:05:03.250> of<00:05:03.340> wait

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
nice so yeah we just gotta kind of wait

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.240 
nice so yeah we just gotta kind of wait
a<00:05:03.490> little<00:05:03.670> bit

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.710 

using<00:05:09.250> a<00:05:09.340> knife<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:10.210> should<00:05:12.240> pierce<00:05:13.240> it<00:05:13.479> to

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
using a knife you should pierce it to

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.360 
using a knife you should pierce it to
make<00:05:13.870> sure<00:05:13.900> it's<00:05:14.229> solid<00:05:14.410> all<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.830> way<00:05:14.979> through

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
make sure it's solid all the way through

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.700 
make sure it's solid all the way through
so<00:05:16.210> this<00:05:16.539> is<00:05:16.690> what<00:05:16.870> it<00:05:16.960> looks<00:05:17.169> like<00:05:17.259> after<00:05:17.530> it's

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
so this is what it looks like after it's

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.360 
so this is what it looks like after it's
come<00:05:18.160> out<00:05:18.370> of<00:05:18.610> its<00:05:19.530> confinement<00:05:20.530> in<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.979> oven

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
come out of its confinement in the oven

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:31.020 
come out of its confinement in the oven
so<00:05:28.830> what<00:05:29.830> you<00:05:29.919> want<00:05:30.100> to<00:05:30.190> do<00:05:30.370> is<00:05:30.580> you<00:05:30.729> need<00:05:30.759> this

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
so what you want to do is you need this

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.370 
so what you want to do is you need this
spatula<00:05:31.419> looking<00:05:32.199> thing<00:05:32.560> to<00:05:33.280> spread<00:05:33.729> even

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
spatula looking thing to spread even

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.770 
spatula looking thing to spread even
that<00:05:35.380> sounds<00:05:35.680> real<00:05:35.919> nice<00:05:36.419> so<00:05:37.419> it<00:05:37.539> looks<00:05:37.720> like

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
that sounds real nice so it looks like

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.029 
that sounds real nice so it looks like
that<00:05:38.050> you<00:05:38.470> gotta<00:05:38.729> scrape<00:05:39.729> at<00:05:40.000> it<00:05:40.860> so<00:05:41.860> while

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
that you gotta scrape at it so while

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.590 
that you gotta scrape at it so while
it's<00:05:42.190> like<00:05:42.340> half<00:05:42.610> cool<00:05:42.970> and<00:05:43.270> it's<00:05:43.389> still

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
it's like half cool and it's still

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.719 
it's like half cool and it's still
slightly<00:05:43.900> warm<00:05:44.289> I<00:05:44.440> like<00:05:44.620> to<00:05:44.770> put<00:05:44.979> on<00:05:45.010> the<00:05:45.310> icing

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
slightly warm I like to put on the icing

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.100 
slightly warm I like to put on the icing
then<00:05:45.880> because<00:05:46.210> I<00:05:46.300> find<00:05:46.570> it's<00:05:46.690> the<00:05:46.900> most

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
then because I find it's the most

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.379 
then because I find it's the most
easiest<00:05:47.620> to<00:05:47.979> spread<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:48.669> it's<00:05:48.880> kind<00:05:49.150> of<00:05:49.210> more

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
easiest to spread and it's kind of more

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.350 
easiest to spread and it's kind of more
pliable<00:05:49.810> so<00:05:50.500> this<00:05:50.710> is<00:05:50.860> just<00:05:51.070> my<00:05:51.220> method<00:05:51.639> I<00:05:52.060> know
