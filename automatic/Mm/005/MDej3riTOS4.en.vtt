on<00:02:50.040> insanity<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:51.030> only<00:02:51.269> reason<00:02:51.450> we<00:02:51.569> don't

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
on insanity the only reason we don't

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.229 
on insanity the only reason we don't
recognize<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.830> as<00:02:53.010> an<00:02:53.160> insane<00:02:53.580> delusion<00:02:54.120> is

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
recognize it as an insane delusion is

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.729

from it

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.059 
from it
and<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:57.330> seen<00:02:57.510> as<00:02:57.720> normal<00:02:58.260> well<00:02:58.769> first

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.040 
and so it's seen as normal well first
problem<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.640> this<00:02:59.760> insane<00:03:00.120> delusion<00:03:00.599> causes
