00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
because that's going to lead to more

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
about it one of the things you could

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
about it one of the things you could
inject<00:00:54.659> it<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:54.899> some<00:00:55.320> cantaloupe<00:00:55.769> or

inject it with some cantaloupe or
steroid<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.940> make<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.749> information<00:00:58.050> go<00:00:58.499> down

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
steroid and make the information go down

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
steroid and make the information go down
other<00:00:59.969> things<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.569> could<00:01:00.719> do<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
other things that we could do if the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.070 
other things that we could do if the
acting<00:01:02.399> because<00:01:02.609> we're<00:01:02.819> a<00:01:02.850> big<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.300> cystic<00:01:03.870> we

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
acting because we're a big or cystic we

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.010 
acting because we're a big or cystic we
could<00:01:04.230> actually<00:01:04.470> drain<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
could actually drain it and we do and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.370 
could actually drain it and we do and
basically<00:01:07.880> drain<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.060> pus<00:01:09.300> and<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
basically drain the pus and so the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.730 
basically drain the pus and so the
inflammation<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:12.450> reason<00:01:12.870> why<00:01:13.020> patients<00:01:13.290> get

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
inflammation the reason why patients get

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.560 
inflammation the reason why patients get
acne<00:01:14.250> scarring<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.120> because<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
acne scarring is because the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.810 
acne scarring is because the
inflammation<00:01:16.230> causes<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.860> gradation<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.580> lot

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
inflammation causes the gradation a lot

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.150 
inflammation causes the gradation a lot
of<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.090> surrounding<00:01:18.540> tissue<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.470> starting

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
of the surrounding tissue the starting

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.010 
of the surrounding tissue the starting
to<00:01:20.280> show<00:01:20.430> ads<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.970> caused<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.420> vivid<00:01:21.840> or

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to show ads or that caused it vivid or

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.350 
to show ads or that caused it vivid or
depression<00:01:22.620> so<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> less<00:01:23.610> inflammation<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
depression so the less inflammation you

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.600 
depression so the less inflammation you
have<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.080> less<00:01:25.440> likely<00:01:25.770> there<00:01:26.190> is<00:01:26.340> that

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
have there the less likely there is that

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.460 
have there the less likely there is that
there's<00:01:26.760> going<00:01:26.910> to<00:01:26.970> cause<00:01:27.210> them<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.510> divot<00:01:28.230> or

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
there's going to cause them a divot or

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.340 
there's going to cause them a divot or
