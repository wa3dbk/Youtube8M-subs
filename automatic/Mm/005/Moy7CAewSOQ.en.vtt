it<00:04:39.159> tells<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.840> built-in<00:04:40.840> mode<00:04:41.110> safe<00:04:41.680> mode

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
it tells you built-in mode safe mode

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.369 
it tells you built-in mode safe mode
normal<00:04:42.759> mode<00:04:42.939> and<00:04:43.270> super<00:04:43.599> mode<00:04:43.780> i<00:04:44.020> recommend

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.379 
normal mode and super mode i recommend

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.790 
normal mode and super mode i recommend
super<00:04:44.860> mode<00:04:45.039> because<00:04:45.280> this<00:04:45.550> complete<00:04:46.270> scans

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
super mode because this complete scans

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.770 
super mode because this complete scans
everything<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:48.189> deletes<00:04:48.669> the<00:04:48.939> the<00:04:49.240> software

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
everything it deletes the the software

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.700 
everything it deletes the the software
like<00:04:49.990> normal<00:04:50.439> but<00:04:51.250> it<00:04:51.460> did<00:04:51.699> it<00:04:52.599> deep<00:04:52.960> scans<00:04:53.439> all

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
like normal but it did it deep scans all

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.369 
like normal but it did it deep scans all
your<00:04:53.860> registry<00:04:54.400> files<00:04:54.669> all<00:04:54.969> your<00:04:55.120> backup<00:04:55.719> left

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:56.379 
your registry files all your backup left

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.860 
your registry files all your backup left
behind<00:04:56.710> files<00:04:57.210> basically<00:04:58.210> everything<00:04:58.509> that's

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
behind files basically everything that's

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.619 
behind files basically everything that's
named<00:04:59.229> through<00:04:59.650> this<00:04:59.800> file<00:05:00.159> it'll<00:05:00.580> delete<00:05:01.330> and

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
named through this file it'll delete and

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.770 
named through this file it'll delete and
that's<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.830> best<00:05:03.099> thing<00:05:03.340> to<00:05:03.400> do<00:05:03.669> it'll<00:05:04.060> delete

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
that's the best thing to do it'll delete

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.430 
that's the best thing to do it'll delete
it<00:05:04.930> normally<00:05:05.349> like<00:05:05.530> a<00:05:05.560> normal<00:05:06.009> um<00:05:06.219> software

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
it normally like a normal um software

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.540 
it normally like a normal um software
and<00:05:09.330> then<00:05:10.330> it'll<00:05:10.569> basically<00:05:11.349> goes<00:05:12.219> through

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
and then it'll basically goes through

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.330 
and then it'll basically goes through
all<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.729> traces<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.509> finds<00:05:13.900> it<00:05:14.080> and<00:05:14.159> kills<00:05:15.159> it

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
all the traces and finds it and kills it

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.459 
all the traces and finds it and kills it
but<00:05:15.759> it<00:05:15.849> does<00:05:16.060> have<00:05:16.300> a<00:05:16.330> restore<00:05:16.750> point<00:05:16.780> so<00:05:17.289> in

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:17.469 
but it does have a restore point so in

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:19.170 
but it does have a restore point so in
case<00:05:17.680> you<00:05:17.740> screw<00:05:18.039> up<00:05:18.219> or<00:05:18.669> something<00:05:19.029> you

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
case you screw up or something you

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:26.809 
case you screw up or something you
didn't<00:05:19.389> want<00:05:19.419> to<00:05:19.629> you<00:05:19.810> can<00:05:19.960> restore<00:05:20.289> it<00:05:20.349> back

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.200 

now<00:05:27.819> while<00:05:28.120> that's<00:05:28.300> going<00:05:28.509> on<00:05:28.960> um<00:05:29.849> let<00:05:30.849> me<00:05:30.969> fix

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
now while that's going on um let me fix

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.300 
now while that's going on um let me fix
this<00:05:31.419> here<00:05:31.659> now<00:05:31.900> go<00:05:32.080> there<00:05:32.319> like<00:05:32.770> that<00:05:32.889> that

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
this here now go there like that that

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.029 
this here now go there like that that
quick<00:05:33.810> see<00:05:34.810> is<00:05:34.960> it<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.319> goes<00:05:35.650> through<00:05:35.860> all<00:05:35.949> the

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
quick see is it it goes through all the

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.649 
quick see is it it goes through all the
local<00:05:36.370> machine<00:05:36.759> software<00:05:37.029> stuff<00:05:37.659> um<00:05:39.659> doesn't

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
local machine software stuff um doesn't

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.329 
local machine software stuff um doesn't
matter<00:05:40.779> if<00:05:40.930> you<00:05:40.990> have<00:05:41.020> 64-bit<00:05:41.710> or<00:05:41.979> you<00:05:42.219> have

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:42.339 
matter if you have 64-bit or you have

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:51.590 
matter if you have 64-bit or you have
32-bit<00:05:42.789> it<00:05:43.180> does<00:05:43.389> the<00:05:43.659> same<00:05:43.930> job

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.600 

so<00:05:52.600> I<00:05:52.630> mean<00:05:53.050> this<00:05:53.380> is<00:05:53.440> good<00:05:53.830> to<00:05:54.070> look<00:05:54.340> it<00:05:54.580> up

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
so I mean this is good to look it up

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.610 
so I mean this is good to look it up
I'll<00:05:55.090> go<00:05:55.360> to<00:05:55.450> the<00:05:55.570> tool<00:05:55.780> box<00:05:56.020> on<00:05:56.290> the<00:05:56.410> advanced

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
I'll go to the tool box on the advanced

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.800 
I'll go to the tool box on the advanced
systemcare<00:05:57.070> and<00:05:57.520> if<00:05:57.760> safe<00:05:58.090> in<00:05:58.390> case<00:05:58.570> you

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
systemcare and if safe in case you

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.950 
systemcare and if safe in case you
delete<00:05:59.170> something<00:06:00.240> like<00:06:01.240> maybe<00:06:01.510> you<00:06:01.690> still

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
delete something like maybe you still

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.440 
delete something like maybe you still
wanted<00:06:02.410> you<00:06:02.560> just<00:06:02.800> deleted<00:06:03.250> it<00:06:03.460> you<00:06:03.640> can<00:06:03.850> use

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
wanted you just deleted it you can use

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.610 
wanted you just deleted it you can use
this<00:06:04.720> it's<00:06:05.200> undelete<00:06:06.150> instead<00:06:07.150> of

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
this it's undelete instead of

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.170 
this it's undelete instead of
downloading<00:06:08.620> separate<00:06:09.460> softwares<00:06:09.940> this

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
downloading separate softwares this

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.870 
downloading separate softwares this
pretty<00:06:10.480> much<00:06:10.660> has<00:06:10.870> it<00:06:10.900> all<00:06:11.580> registry<00:06:12.580> cleaner

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
pretty much has it all registry cleaner

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.810 
pretty much has it all registry cleaner
and<00:06:13.470> a<00:06:14.470> registry<00:06:14.920> frag<00:06:17.310> so<00:06:18.310> in<00:06:18.580> case<00:06:18.790> you

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
and a registry frag so in case you

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.570 
and a registry frag so in case you
deleted<00:06:19.150> an<00:06:19.900> application<00:06:20.770> before<00:06:20.950> actually

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
deleted an application before actually

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.340

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
having this application arm you can use

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.230 
having this application arm you can use
this<00:06:26.560> one<00:06:26.770> to<00:06:26.800> register<00:06:27.400> clean<00:06:27.670> all<00:06:27.880> the<00:06:28.030> ones
