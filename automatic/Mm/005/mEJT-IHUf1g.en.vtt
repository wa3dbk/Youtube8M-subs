00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
a lot more colorful that's what I said

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.270 
a lot more colorful that's what I said
from<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> beginning<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> new<00:01:01.620> map<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
from the beginning of the new map it

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.860 
from the beginning of the new map it
needs<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.640> little<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.390> little<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.840> more

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
needs a little but a little bit more

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.140 
needs a little but a little bit more
color<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.860> less<00:01:05.129> brightness<00:01:05.640> more

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
color and a less brightness more

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.760 
color and a less brightness more
contrast<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.900> looks<00:01:07.049> more<00:01:07.170> alive<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.470> with

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
contrast so it looks more alive and with

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.740 
contrast so it looks more alive and with
it<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.670> adds<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.330> bit<00:01:09.450> more

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
it so it is adds a little bit more

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.080 
it so it is adds a little bit more
contrast<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.130> adds<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.520> everything<00:01:11.909> so

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
contrast but it adds to everything so

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.820 
contrast but it adds to everything so
not<00:01:12.240> only<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.540> game<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
not only the game as you can see it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.130 
not only the game as you can see it
that's<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.280> scoreboard<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.630> spells<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
that's the scoreboard to the spells to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.260 
that's the scoreboard to the spells to
everything<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.460> think<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.939> looks<00:01:17.970> pretty

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
everything but I think it looks pretty

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.179 
everything but I think it looks pretty
damn<00:01:18.540> awesome<00:01:18.689> even<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.530> modifies<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
damn awesome even if it modifies the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.890 
damn awesome even if it modifies the
rest<00:01:20.369> little<00:01:20.670> bit<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.939> looks<00:01:21.090> better<00:01:21.479> because

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
rest little bit it looks better because

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.109 
rest little bit it looks better because
it's<00:01:22.049> more<00:01:22.229> colorful<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:23.040> more<00:01:23.189> alive<00:01:23.430> feels

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it's more colorful it's more alive feels

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.460 
it's more colorful it's more alive feels
a<00:01:24.240> little<00:01:24.360> bit<00:01:24.600> more<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.229> classic

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a little bit more like the classic

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.080 
a little bit more like the classic
summoners<00:01:25.979> rift<00:01:26.189> because<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.790> lot<00:01:26.909> more

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
summoners rift because it's a lot more

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.780

and it's good to use and I think it
makes<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.830> map<00:02:15.040> nicer<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.150> exactly<00:02:16.720> how<00:02:16.840> I

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
makes the map nicer and exactly how I

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.800 
makes the map nicer and exactly how I
wanted<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.680> be<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.330> only<00:02:19.510> thing<00:02:19.660> I

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
wanted it to be is the only thing I

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.699 
wanted it to be is the only thing I
wanted<00:02:20.200> from<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.410> new<00:02:20.560> map<00:02:20.680> more<00:02:21.250> color<00:02:22.709> look

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
wanted from the new map more color look

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.539 
wanted from the new map more color look
at<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.040> let's<00:02:24.879> do<00:02:25.590> another<00:02:26.590> comparison<00:02:27.220> for

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
at this let's do another comparison for

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.100 
at this let's do another comparison for
the<00:02:27.640> water<00:02:27.790> alright<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:28.330> this<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.629> not<00:02:28.780> normal

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
the water alright so this is not normal

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.390 
the water alright so this is not normal
look<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.560> this<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:31.049> effect<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.370> can

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
look and this is the effect and you can

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.369 
look and this is the effect and you can
modify<00:02:33.879> it<00:02:34.030> even<00:02:34.360> further<00:02:34.599> if<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:34.959> want<00:02:35.140> more

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
modify it even further if you want more

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.650 
modify it even further if you want more
contrast<00:02:35.890> or<00:02:36.190> less<00:02:36.700> contrast<00:02:37.150> or<00:02:37.420> more

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
contrast or less contrast or more

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.350 
contrast or less contrast or more
vibrance<00:02:38.140> less<00:02:38.410> vibrance<00:02:39.099> or<00:02:39.340> brightness<00:02:40.180> or

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
vibrance less vibrance or brightness or

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.300 
vibrance less vibrance or brightness or
everything<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.810> want<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.140> can<00:02:41.319> modify<00:02:41.980> in

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
everything you want you can modify in

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.280 
everything you want you can modify in
that<00:02:42.430> file<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.209> make<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.540> exactly<00:02:43.750> as<00:02:44.260> you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
that file and make it exactly as you

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.350 
that file and make it exactly as you
wish<00:02:44.530> but<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:45.790> just<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.090> raise<00:02:46.209> attention

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
wish but this is just to raise attention

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.839 
wish but this is just to raise attention
because<00:02:47.170> everyone<00:02:47.590> tells<00:02:47.829> right<00:02:48.069> I<00:02:48.370> mean<00:02:48.700> lot

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
because everyone tells right I mean lot

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.089 
because everyone tells right I mean lot
of<00:02:48.970> people<00:02:49.239> tell<00:02:49.359> right<00:02:49.599> at<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.410> map<00:02:50.590> feels<00:02:50.890> a

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
of people tell right at the map feels a

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.900 
of people tell right at the map feels a
little<00:02:51.280> comical<00:02:52.269> it<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:52.930> slightly<00:02:53.379> bad<00:02:53.859> and<00:02:54.099> it

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
little comical it is slightly bad and it

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.780 
little comical it is slightly bad and it
could<00:02:55.180> use<00:02:55.329> more<00:02:55.629> color<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.470> be<00:02:57.340> more<00:02:57.489> alive

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
could use more color to be more alive

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.970 
could use more color to be more alive
like<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.209> and<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:59.319> really<00:02:59.560> agree<00:02:59.620> with<00:02:59.799> this

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
like this and I really agree with this

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.770 
like this and I really agree with this
that's<00:03:00.370> what<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.639> said<00:03:00.849> from<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.090> beginning<00:03:01.450> if

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
that's what I said from the beginning if

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.150 
that's what I said from the beginning if
you<00:03:01.930> wanna<00:03:02.079> make<00:03:02.200> those<00:03:02.410> pictures<00:03:02.980> before

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
you wanna make those pictures before

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.390 
you wanna make those pictures before
comparing<00:03:03.700> how<00:03:04.209> it<00:03:04.329> would<00:03:04.480> look<00:03:04.510> with<00:03:04.690> a

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
comparing how it would look with a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.910 
comparing how it would look with a
slightly<00:03:06.400> more<00:03:06.549> color<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.620> yeah<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.829> really

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
slightly more color and yeah I really

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.129 
slightly more color and yeah I really
like<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.430> this<00:03:09.489> way<00:03:09.750> let's<00:03:10.750> take<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.930> look<00:03:11.049> at

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
like it this way let's take a look at

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.080 
like it this way let's take a look at
the<00:03:11.230> base<00:03:11.410> here<00:03:11.859> too<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:12.549> this<00:03:12.669> is<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:12.970> normal

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
the base here too so this is the normal

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.900 
the base here too so this is the normal
mode<00:03:13.299> this<00:03:14.019> is<00:03:14.169> the<00:03:14.290> division<00:03:14.760> normal<00:03:15.760> mode

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
mode this is the division normal mode

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.900 
mode this is the division normal mode
vision<00:03:16.660> up<00:03:16.989> here<00:03:17.560> vision<00:03:17.950> normal<00:03:18.310> mode<00:03:18.459> vision

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
vision up here vision normal mode vision

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.720 
vision up here vision normal mode vision
it<00:03:19.299> looks<00:03:19.450> like<00:03:19.569> it<00:03:19.690> has<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:20.280> white<00:03:21.280> thingy

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
it looks like it has a white thingy

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.520 
it looks like it has a white thingy
around<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.329> and<00:03:22.540> when<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.840> activated<00:03:23.319> it

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
around it and when you activated it

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.229 
around it and when you activated it
removes<00:03:23.919> it<00:03:24.099> and<00:03:24.250> makes<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.639> lot<00:03:24.760> cleaner

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
removes it and makes it a lot cleaner

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.190 
removes it and makes it a lot cleaner
and<00:03:25.569> more<00:03:26.410> colorful<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.010> nice<00:03:27.910> it's<00:03:28.900> like<00:03:28.959> it

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
and more colorful and nice it's like it

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.280 
and more colorful and nice it's like it
has<00:03:29.410> something<00:03:29.769> a<00:03:30.599> bag<00:03:31.599> and<00:03:31.840> then<00:03:32.260> you

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
has something a bag and then you

I'll see you soon my friends let's take
a<00:03:48.370> look<00:03:48.489> at<00:03:48.609> these<00:03:48.760> two<00:03:49.030> before<00:03:49.359> I<00:03:49.389> end<00:03:49.660> the

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
a look at these two before I end the

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.280 
a look at these two before I end the
video

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
video

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.949 
video
so<00:03:51.250> without<00:03:51.609> interface<00:03:52.359> so<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.780> won't

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
so without interface so it won't

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.080 
so without interface so it won't
interfere<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:54.160> interface<00:03:54.579> won't<00:03:54.819> interfere

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
interfere the interface won't interfere

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.039 
interfere the interface won't interfere
so<00:03:55.840> this<00:03:56.019> is<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.349> a<00:03:56.669> predate<00:03:57.669> mod<00:03:57.849> this<00:03:58.720> is<00:03:58.780> the

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
so this is the a predate mod this is the

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.710 
so this is the a predate mod this is the
normal<00:03:59.379> one<00:03:59.470> it<00:04:00.340> doesn't<00:04:00.579> do<00:04:00.819> very<00:04:00.849> much<00:04:01.299> but

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
normal one it doesn't do very much but

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.110 
normal one it doesn't do very much but
it<00:04:02.200> does<00:04:02.290> exactly<00:04:02.950> what<00:04:03.129> it<00:04:03.489> needs<00:04:03.669> to<00:04:03.760> make<00:04:04.000> it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
it does exactly what it needs to make it

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.160 
it does exactly what it needs to make it
perfect<00:04:04.539> in<00:04:04.690> my<00:04:04.810> opinion

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
perfect in my opinion

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.050 
perfect in my opinion
I<00:04:05.260> really<00:04:05.860> like<00:04:06.069> how<00:04:06.849> they<00:04:07.030> do<00:04:07.090> it<00:04:07.300> but<00:04:07.890> yeah<00:04:09.060> if

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
I really like how they do it but yeah if

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.640 
I really like how they do it but yeah if

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.520 
to see that post and maybe we'll change
them<00:04:19.150> they<00:04:19.510> said<00:04:19.780> they<00:04:19.900> are<00:04:19.959> looking<00:04:20.109> for<00:04:20.410> ways

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
them they said they are looking for ways

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.129 
them they said they are looking for ways
to<00:04:20.590> improve<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.220> life<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.030> color<00:04:22.270> they

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
to improve the life and the color they

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.110 
to improve the life and the color they
say<00:04:23.290> they<00:04:23.440> reflect<00:04:23.740> with<00:04:23.919> clarity<00:04:24.760> but<00:04:24.910> this

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
say they reflect with clarity but this

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.060 
say they reflect with clarity but this
mode<00:04:25.330> also<00:04:25.360> affects<00:04:26.020> champions<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:26.710> minions

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
mode also affects champions and minions

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.129 
mode also affects champions and minions
so<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.850> changes<00:04:28.180> everything<00:04:28.419> not<00:04:28.750> only<00:04:28.780> the

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
so it changes everything not only the

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.020 
so it changes everything not only the
map<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:29.919> might<00:04:30.130> be<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.280> problem<00:04:30.460> but<00:04:30.639> I<00:04:30.790> like

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
map that might be a problem but I like

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.710 
map that might be a problem but I like
it<00:04:31.150> like<00:04:31.240> this

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
it like this

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.280 
it like this
so<00:04:32.230> clarity<00:04:32.919> is<00:04:33.100> perfect<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:34.210> little<00:04:34.960> more

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
so clarity is perfect a little more

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.950 
so clarity is perfect a little more
color<00:04:35.560> won't<00:04:35.889> affect<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.940> clarity<00:04:37.900> in

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
color won't affect the clarity in

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.750 
color won't affect the clarity in
teamfights<00:04:38.200> you<00:04:38.530> won't<00:04:38.740> miss<00:04:39.010> yourself<00:04:39.460> in<00:04:39.639> a

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
teamfights you won't miss yourself in a

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.010 
teamfights you won't miss yourself in a
teamfight<00:04:39.940> because<00:04:40.389> you<00:04:40.479> can<00:04:40.780> see<00:04:40.930> your

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
teamfight because you can see your

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.420 
teamfight because you can see your
character<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:41.560> can<00:04:41.800> see<00:04:41.950> your<00:04:42.100> character

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
character you can see your character

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.350 
character you can see your character
