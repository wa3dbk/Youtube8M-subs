00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
I'm gonna for this purpose of the demo

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.850 
I'm gonna for this purpose of the demo
I'm<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.870> put<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.199> on<00:00:46.379> two<00:00:46.710> nights

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.570 

just<00:00:54.460> turn<00:00:54.700> that<00:00:54.880> knob<00:00:55.120> all<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.390> way<00:00:55.510> around

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.220 

okay<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.450> that's<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> night<00:01:01.140> setting<00:01:01.560> and

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
okay so that's on a night setting and

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.850 
okay so that's on a night setting and
over<00:01:04.230> here<00:01:04.589> you've<00:01:05.220> got<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.790> option<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
over here you've got the option to

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.740 
over here you've got the option to
change<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.130> between<00:01:08.370> ten<00:01:08.880> seconds<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.540> five

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
change it between ten seconds and five

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.930 
change it between ten seconds and five
minutes<00:01:10.050> I'll<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.190> leave<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.550> on<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.730> ten

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
minutes I'll just leave it on the ten

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.850 
minutes I'll just leave it on the ten
seconds<00:01:12.480> as<00:01:13.410> it<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:14.030> this<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.420> course<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
seconds as it is this one of course is a

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.690 
seconds as it is this one of course is a
bayonet<00:01:16.860> fitting<00:01:17.660> and<00:01:18.660> I<00:01:18.810> test<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:20.340> in

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
bayonet fitting and I test it in this in

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.260 
bayonet fitting and I test it in this in
just<00:01:20.910> a<00:01:21.000> moment<00:01:21.950> when<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.070> first<00:01:23.310> put<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.150> on

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
just a moment when you first put it on

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:38.630 
just a moment when you first put it on
shall<00:01:24.930> put<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.350> first<00:01:25.530> up

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.610 

might<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> moment<00:01:39.630> I'll<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:39.930> got<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.500> use

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
might be a moment I'll just got to use

00:01:40.620 --> 00:02:02.760 
might be a moment I'll just got to use
both<00:01:40.830> hands

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.010 

okay<00:02:03.610> when<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.060> pair<00:02:04.329> it<00:02:04.450> on<00:02:04.600> for<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.840> first

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
okay when you pair it on for the first

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.330 
okay when you pair it on for the first
time<00:02:06.810> it'll<00:02:07.810> light<00:02:08.619> up<00:02:09.630> see<00:02:10.630> its<00:02:11.020> glow<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:12.099> just

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
time it'll light up see its glow it just

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.360 
time it'll light up see its glow it just
comes<00:02:12.550> off<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.860> whatever<00:02:15.190> setting<00:02:15.550> it's<00:02:15.670> on

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
comes off so whatever setting it's on

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.770 
comes off so whatever setting it's on
whatever<00:02:18.370> light<00:02:18.610> setting<00:02:18.970> it's<00:02:19.090> on<00:02:19.209> will<00:02:19.750> just

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
whatever light setting it's on will just

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.500 
whatever light setting it's on will just
light<00:02:20.140> up<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:24.519> motion<00:02:24.819> sensor<00:02:25.150> does<00:02:25.330> work

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
light up and the motion sensor does work

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.490 
light up and the motion sensor does work
I<00:02:25.660> tested<00:02:25.959> it<00:02:26.019> just<00:02:26.230> before<00:02:28.050> but<00:02:29.050> for<00:02:29.410> this

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
I tested it just before but for this

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.080 
I tested it just before but for this
demo<00:02:30.430> we're<00:02:30.670> going<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.849> do<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.489> situation

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
demo we're going to do it in a situation

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.710 
demo we're going to do it in a situation
where<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:35.350> light<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.370> going<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.880> be<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.540> out

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
where the light is going to be and out

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.680 
where the light is going to be and out
there<00:02:37.870> we<00:02:37.959> go<00:02:38.110> it's<00:02:38.319> how<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.530> turns<00:02:38.739> off<00:02:39.690> well

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
there we go it's how it turns off well

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.309 
there we go it's how it turns off well
so<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.380> demo<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.739> going<00:02:41.799> to<00:02:41.950> be<00:02:42.040> for<00:02:43.319> case

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
so the demo is going to be for case

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.580 
so the demo is going to be for case
where<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:46.410> nighttime<00:02:47.410> comes<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:49.590> it'll

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
where the nighttime comes on and it'll

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.910 
where the nighttime comes on and it'll
detect<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.980> nighttime<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.530> it'll<00:02:53.530> turn<00:02:53.709> on

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
detect the nighttime and it'll turn on

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.729 
detect the nighttime and it'll turn on
and<00:02:54.220> then<00:02:54.970> it'll<00:02:55.540> turn<00:02:55.810> off<00:02:55.870> ten<00:02:56.319> seconds

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
and then it'll turn off ten seconds

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:57.650 
and then it'll turn off ten seconds
later

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
later

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.699 
later
okay<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:58.720> we're<00:02:58.930> really<00:02:59.019> seen<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.410> it's

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
okay so we're really seen that it's

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.920 
okay so we're really seen that it's
turned<00:03:00.100> off<00:03:00.250> ten<00:03:00.880> seconds<00:03:01.330> after<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.720> turned

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
turned off ten seconds after it turned

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.840 
turned off ten seconds after it turned
it<00:03:02.019> on<00:03:03.060> let's<00:03:04.440> do<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.470> test<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:06.540> night<00:03:07.540> test<00:03:08.850> which

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
it on let's do a test a night test which

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.930 
it on let's do a test a night test which
has<00:03:10.060> I'm<00:03:10.239> putting<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> box<00:03:10.780> over<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.230> top

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.780 

should<00:03:15.570> light<00:03:15.750> up<00:03:15.780> with<00:03:16.080> there<00:03:16.200> we<00:03:16.350> go<00:03:16.790> let's

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
should light up with there we go let's

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.960 
should light up with there we go let's
just<00:03:17.970> lit<00:03:18.180> up

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.460 

so<00:03:22.600> it's<00:03:22.840> quite<00:03:23.080> useful<00:03:23.140> as<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.590> security<00:03:24.070> lamp

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
so it's quite useful as a security lamp

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.420 
so it's quite useful as a security lamp
when<00:03:26.470> you're<00:03:26.590> going<00:03:26.740> outside<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.950> saves<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.400> a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
when you're going outside it saves you a

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.410
