00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
if you haven't already done so you need

to do

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.500 
to do
as<00:02:12.120> well<00:02:12.480> also<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.680> would<00:02:14.550> say<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.300> get

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.870 
as well also I would say that if you get
any<00:02:15.780> error<00:02:16.380> messages<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.250> your<00:02:17.550> lock<00:02:17.850> screen

so for example if you got a message to
say<00:02:20.130> no<00:02:20.430> data<00:02:20.700> available<00:02:20.910> or<00:02:21.630> something<00:02:21.990> like
