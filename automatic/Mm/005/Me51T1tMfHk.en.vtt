a<00:00:13.349> look<00:00:13.590> let<00:00:14.070> me<00:00:14.099> show<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.370> how<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.580> bring<00:00:14.880> out

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
a look let me show you how to bring out

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.880 
a look let me show you how to bring out
some<00:00:15.299> life<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.900> drawing<00:00:16.230> that's<00:00:16.560> rather

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
some life to this drawing that's rather

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.950 
some life to this drawing that's rather
flat<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.400> two-dimensional<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.630> I'm<00:00:18.720> really

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
flat in two-dimensional so I'm really

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.170 
flat in two-dimensional so I'm really
pushing<00:00:19.410> down<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.980> now<00:00:20.220> I'm<00:00:20.699> also<00:00:20.939> going<00:00:21.119> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
pushing down on it now I'm also going to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.849 
pushing down on it now I'm also going to
take<00:00:21.359> my<00:00:21.570> finger<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.080> blend<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.590> little<00:00:22.710> bit

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
take my finger and blend a little bit

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.009 
take my finger and blend a little bit
soften<00:00:23.550> things<00:00:23.699> up<00:00:23.970> move<00:00:24.390> some<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.840> this

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
soften things up move some of this

line there I'm finding the shadows
shadows<00:00:39.660> are<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.050> well<00:00:40.469> click<00:00:40.739> review<00:00:41.129> they

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
shadows are what well click review they

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.260 
shadows are what well click review they
are<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.239> occurs<00:00:42.770> where<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.800> light<00:00:44.160> hits<00:00:45.059> on

are what occurs where the light hits on
an<00:00:45.390> object<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.309> where<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.430> light<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.879> then

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
an object and where the light is then

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.540 
an object and where the light is then
not<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.289> making<00:00:49.950> its<00:00:50.070> way<00:00:50.219> all<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.430> way

we're<00:00:55.260> gonna<00:00:55.350> concentrate<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:55.920> our<00:00:56.039> lines

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
we're gonna concentrate on our lines

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.000 
we're gonna concentrate on our lines
here<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.030> darkness<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.840> lightness<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.770> them

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.069 
here the darkness and lightness of them
we're<00:00:59.399> also<00:00:59.520> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> blend<00:01:00.149> them<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.780> we

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
we're also going to blend them and we

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.709 
we're also going to blend them and we
can<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:01.859> our<00:01:02.039> fingertips<00:01:02.719> or

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
can do that with just our fingertips or

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.179 
can do that with just our fingertips or
we<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.049> inadvertently<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.070> our

we can inadvertently do it with our

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
light areas you're gonna want to go in

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.700

with<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.790> proper<00:01:18.210> eraser<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.500> even

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
with the proper eraser and really even

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.800 
with the proper eraser and really even
just<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> racer<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.909> will<00:01:21.119> work<00:01:21.330> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
just a racer like this will work it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.200 
just a racer like this will work it
actually<00:01:21.930> gives<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.500> an<00:01:22.650> fine<00:01:22.979> enough<00:01:23.280> tip<00:01:23.729> to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
actually gives you an fine enough tip to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.910 
actually gives you an fine enough tip to
get<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:24.990> detail<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> race

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
get in there and like detail a race

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.190 
get in there and like detail a race
racing<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> very<00:01:27.479> important<00:01:27.930> part<00:01:28.110> of

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
racing can be a very important part of

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.120 
racing can be a very important part of
drawing<00:01:28.579> right<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> good<00:01:30.030> example

little<00:01:53.799> bit<00:01:53.979> more

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.990 

and<00:02:07.369> little<00:02:08.369> shading<00:02:08.880> on<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.810> actually

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
and little shading on what is actually

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
and little shading on what is actually
beat<00:02:12.000> looking<00:02:12.480> part<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.900> his<00:02:13.050> head<00:02:14.660> as<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.870> can

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
beat looking part of his head as you can

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.860 
beat looking part of his head as you can
see<00:02:16.230> with<00:02:16.500> just<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.740> few<00:02:17.130> areas<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.360> decided

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
see with just a few areas that I decided

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.360 
see with just a few areas that I decided
to<00:02:18.990> pick<00:02:19.200> out<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.680> they<00:02:19.950> weren't<00:02:20.100> random

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
to pick out and they weren't random

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.120 
to pick out and they weren't random
these<00:02:21.090> are<00:02:21.300> what<00:02:21.660> my<00:02:21.780> eye<00:02:21.810> sees<00:02:22.350> based<00:02:22.830> on<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
these are what my eye sees based on the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.410 
these are what my eye sees based on the
light<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.520> hits<00:02:23.700> my<00:02:23.940> objects

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.110 

and<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.950> how<00:02:33.129> we<00:02:33.160> accomplished<00:02:33.700> shading

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
and that is how we accomplished shading

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.810 
and that is how we accomplished shading
with<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.390> still<00:02:34.629> life
