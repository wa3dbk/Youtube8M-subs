go there all the time and I got at five

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.420 
go there all the time and I got at five
locations<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:13.319> chipotle<00:03:13.769> they<00:03:13.890> can<00:03:14.069> all<00:03:14.190> know

me<00:03:14.610> by<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> first-name<00:03:15.269> basis<00:03:15.720> which<00:03:15.930> i<00:03:16.110> think

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
me by a first-name basis which i think

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.690 
me by a first-name basis which i think
is<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.590> bit<00:03:16.860> sad<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:18.239> my<00:03:18.420> for<00:03:19.380> me<00:03:19.500> yeah<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.670> I

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
is a bit sad for my for me yeah and I

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.960 
is a bit sad for my for me yeah and I
think<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.030> because<00:03:22.609> like<00:03:23.609> I<00:03:23.730> work<00:03:23.910> in

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
think it is because like I work in

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.250 
think it is because like I work in
different<00:03:24.090> locations<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.810> then<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:24.989> my<00:03:25.079> days

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
different locations and then I my days

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.020 
different locations and then I my days
off<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.709> closer<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.040> another<00:03:26.160> chipotle<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:26.910> I

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
off and closer to another chipotle so I

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.340 
off and closer to another chipotle so I
go<00:03:27.150> there<00:03:27.299> for<00:03:27.389> like<00:03:27.510> lunch<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.049> sometimes

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.250 
cars I love working on my car which
didn't<00:05:34.410> actually<00:05:34.620> happen<00:05:34.980> until<00:05:35.310> like<00:05:35.760> I

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
didn't actually happen until like I

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.090 
didn't actually happen until like I
don't<00:05:37.260> know<00:05:37.410> ty<00:05:37.680> turned<00:05:38.750> 9<00:05:39.750> 19<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:40.620> a<00:05:40.650> half<00:05:40.680> I

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
don't know ty turned 9 19 and a half I

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.070 
don't know ty turned 9 19 and a half I
guess<00:05:41.400> is<00:05:41.550> what<00:05:41.580> I<00:05:41.730> got<00:05:41.910> like<00:05:42.060> an<00:05:42.420> actual<00:05:42.750> car

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
guess is what I got like an actual car

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.280 
guess is what I got like an actual car
that<00:05:43.320> I<00:05:43.350> can<00:05:43.620> enjoy<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.760> work<00:05:45.600> on<00:05:45.840> and

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
that I can enjoy and work on and

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.140 
that I can enjoy and work on and
everyone<00:05:46.890> and<00:05:47.160> get<00:05:47.280> look<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:47.610> I<00:05:47.730> guess<00:05:47.910> I<00:05:48.030> could

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
everyone and get look so I guess I could

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.430 
everyone and get look so I guess I could
say<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.360> how<00:05:48.480> the<00:05:48.540> car<00:05:48.780> that<00:05:48.870> looks<00:05:49.020> good<00:05:49.230> and

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
say it how the car that looks good and

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.320 
say it how the car that looks good and
no<00:05:49.620> one<00:05:49.800> knows<00:05:50.040> what<00:05:50.310> my<00:05:50.460> car<00:05:50.730> is<00:05:50.910> so<00:05:51.090> I<00:05:51.120> had
