00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
think I consulted more than one person

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.550 
think I consulted more than one person
over<00:01:24.000> each<00:01:24.210> tweet<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.840> make<00:01:24.990> sure<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> got

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
over each tweet to make sure that I got

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.640 
over each tweet to make sure that I got
it<00:01:25.680> right<00:01:25.860> also<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.900> what<00:01:27.900> at<00:01:28.020> first<00:01:28.049> seemed

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
it right also the what at first seemed

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.560 
it right also the what at first seemed
to<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> little<00:01:29.130> complex<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.850> now<00:01:30.240> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
to be a little complex and now I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.240 
to be a little complex and now I
realized<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.170> course<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.770> very<00:01:31.890> simple

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
realized of course is really very simple

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.010 
realized of course is really very simple
and<00:01:32.549> straightforward<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.329> was<00:01:33.420> important<00:01:33.900> to

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and straightforward it was important to

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.960 
and straightforward it was important to
me<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.350> remember<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.189> thrill<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.460> had<00:01:35.759> when<00:01:35.939> I
