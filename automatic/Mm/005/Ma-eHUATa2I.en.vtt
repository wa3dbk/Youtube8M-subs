00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.990
 high heels marcel for 1 &amp; 1 and we have 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.200
 yes you already in a hands and video 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.090
 the 1 &amp; 1 mobile wireless router presented 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.009
 in this video we want to now in 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.809
 do a small practical test and go 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.670
 Join us on a little tour here 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.990
 the car as you can and want to see 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.609
 let's know how fast the router 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.470
 actually be on the road and whether 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.060
 that works well then that in the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.710
 vehicle now here on the back seat with 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.140
 connect the tablet with the router 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.449
 so be curious so we are now 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.850
 here in the car and have us on the way 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.309
 Of course we want that now 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.570
 Internet try the router 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.090
 try and test how faster 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.110
 we're gonna turn them on now 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.809
 you have to spend more time then the power 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.379
 hold down button and then comes 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.379
 welcome here 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:59.629
 and then you see the 1 &amp; 1 logo so now 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.379
 Can we use the tablet with the router 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.379
 then connect 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.270
 but we singly 1 1 1 and 1 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.630
 red out the password we have earlier 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.800
 already entered and now like that 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.550
 Of course, in your cellphone then 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.500
 is known 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.120
 Do you have a pin lock with that 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.710
 SIM card can be unlocked 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.150
 that is now synonymous here with the router 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.650
 case of the pin will of course be with the 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.030
 sim card included must be here then 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.910
 be entered once 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.680
 So you see this is the tablet with with 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.110
 connected to the router via wifi and now 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:45.100
 I have to unlock the whole thing like that 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.150
 I have now given the pin 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.850
 and then it already can 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.110
 Let's go see how fast the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.520
 We really want connection 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.420
 then we do a speed test 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.210
 have a corresponding apps 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.410
 downloaded downloads the whole time so 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.700
 he is still looking for a server and 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.700
 then we'll start on test 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.720
 so as you can see we are 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.060
 also good on the way so the car moves 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.769
 yourself and the values ​​look like that 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.140
 very promising from he indicates 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:29.170
 a download speed of almost 6 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.170
 mbit / s is just the upload determined 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.769
 the is 3.6 mbit so that's all 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.540
 decent values ​​in order also in the 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.340
 Internet youtube videos surf 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.190
 looking at it for example or 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.959
 even if you are in the train now 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.069
 on the way is then information 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.810
 retrieve 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.519
 Watch me victims first internet sites 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.030
 can call now for example 1 &amp; 1 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.030
 de 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.360
 so 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.220
 and you also see the side becomes very much 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.130
 set up quickly so it works 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.560
 pretty good we saw is the 1 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.180
 1 1 mobile wlan router an ideal 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.250
 companion on the go just when you 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.420
 tablet has no integrated no 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.340
 modem 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.140
 we have this in the car now 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.540
 We are tested to Cologne to Bonn 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.310
 drove and could consistently good 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.170
 reach data rates 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.880
 of course you have to see that too 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.400
 even a 3g network are available 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.900
 There is also a card if 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.070
 For example, you 're on a highway 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.730
 as a signal can ever 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.130
 abort, stop 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.330
 but otherwise it was a good companion 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.540
 and had a lot of fun with it too 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.540
 work
