the<00:03:14.640> different<00:03:15.240> components<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.990> set<00:03:16.290> I'm

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
the different components of the set I'm

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.550 
the different components of the set I'm
going<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.920> start<00:03:17.340> off<00:03:17.519> with<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.560> watering

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
going to start off with this watering

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.420 
going to start off with this watering
station<00:03:20.220> which<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:22.010> really<00:03:23.010> cool<00:03:23.280> little

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
station which is really cool little

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.660 
station which is really cool little
build<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.709> we<00:03:25.709> get<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.220> bucket<00:03:26.840> here<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:29.070> you

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
build so we get a bucket here that you

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.479 
build so we get a bucket here that you
put<00:03:29.970> here<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.560> then<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.800> would<00:03:31.950> just<00:03:31.980> move

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
put here and then you would just move

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.940 
put here and then you would just move
this<00:03:32.730> lever<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.330> then<00:03:34.170> water<00:03:34.440> would<00:03:34.680> come<00:03:34.800> out

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
this lever and then water would come out

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.520 
this lever and then water would come out
of<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.100> spigot<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.840> that's<00:03:36.989> kind<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.380> neat

of a spigot so that's kind of a neat
little<00:03:37.680> thing<00:03:37.850> then<00:03:38.900> Olivia<00:03:39.900> will<00:03:40.260> take<00:03:40.500> this

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
little thing then Olivia will take this

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.640 
little thing then Olivia will take this
bucket<00:03:41.450> take<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.600> water<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.489> pour<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.519> into

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.160 

this<00:03:49.700> component<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.910> set<00:03:51.150> now<00:03:51.870> this<00:03:52.110> is

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
this component of the set now this is

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.550 
this component of the set now this is
where<00:03:53.000> one<00:03:54.000> look<00:03:54.239> this<00:03:54.420> up<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.660> little<00:03:54.720> bit<00:03:54.989> but

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
where one look this up a little bit but

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
accessories you actually get this really

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.510 
accessories you actually get this really
nice<00:05:09.979> kit<00:05:11.600> it<00:05:12.600> just<00:05:12.870> has<00:05:13.190> you<00:05:14.190> know<00:05:14.280> I<00:05:14.310> would

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
nice kit it just has you know I would

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.719 
nice kit it just has you know I would
say<00:05:14.669> 10<00:05:14.970> or<00:05:15.030> 12<00:05:15.389> different<00:05:15.600> accessories<00:05:16.199> here
