00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
size on tracing paper before I scan it

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.090

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
take a look at the image size i'll show

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.860 
take a look at the image size i'll show
you<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> size<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:50.510> it's<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> little

going to print out on an eight and a
half<00:01:05.100> by<00:01:05.189> 11<00:01:05.760> piece<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.510> paper<00:01:06.689> fine<00:01:07.670> what<00:01:08.670> i

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
half by 11 piece of paper fine what i

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.660 
half by 11 piece of paper fine what i
want<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> clean<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.080> some<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> these

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
want to do is clean up some of these

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.109 
want to do is clean up some of these
sketch<00:01:11.670> Lucy<00:01:12.510> lines<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.650> put<00:01:14.640> down<00:01:14.670> when<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
sketch Lucy lines that I put down when I

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
sketch Lucy lines that I put down when I
was<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.659> getting<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> gesture<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
was just getting the gesture of the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.310 
was just getting the gesture of the
drawing<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.390> way<00:01:18.540> I'm<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.110> that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
drawing and the way I'm going to do that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.870 
drawing and the way I'm going to do that
is<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:20.810> first<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.960> all<00:01:22.049> go<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.439> image

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
is to first of all go up to image

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.330 
is to first of all go up to image
adjustments<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.689> I'm<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.830> desaturate

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
adjustments and I'm going to desaturate

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.800 
adjustments and I'm going to desaturate
the<00:01:27.740> drawing<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.210> basically<00:01:30.210> what<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.479> does

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the drawing and basically what that does

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.020 
the drawing and basically what that does
it<00:01:30.990> gets<00:01:31.140> rid<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> blue<00:01:31.770> kind<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.670> turns<00:01:32.850> it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
it gets rid of the blue kind of turns it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.289 
it gets rid of the blue kind of turns it
into<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.360> grayscale<00:01:34.520> okay<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.060> we've

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
into a grayscale okay so now that we've

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.149 
into a grayscale okay so now that we've
got<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.659> gray<00:01:36.960> scale<00:01:39.680> basically<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> don't

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
got this gray scale basically I don't

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.010 
got this gray scale basically I don't
want<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.579> trace<00:01:41.790> over<00:01:42.090> black<00:01:42.329> because<00:01:42.720> I'm<00:01:42.869> not

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
want to trace over black because I'm not

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.649 
want to trace over black because I'm not
going<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.619> where<00:01:44.399> my<00:01:44.670> pencil<00:01:45.119> lines<00:01:45.329> going

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
going to see where my pencil lines going

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.749 
going to see where my pencil lines going
so<00:01:46.380> first<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.950> all<00:01:46.979> I'm<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.340> clean<00:01:47.579> up

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
so first of all I'm going to clean up

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.510 
so first of all I'm going to clean up
some<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.890> sketch<00:01:49.890> lines<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.369> aren't

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
some of the sketch lines that aren't

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.270 
some of the sketch lines that aren't
necessary<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.329> i<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.229> use<00:01:52.259> curves<00:01:52.680> so

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
necessary and i like to use curves so

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.100 
necessary and i like to use curves so
the<00:01:53.850> control<00:01:55.040> control<00:01:56.040> m<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.399> keyboard

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
the control control m is the keyboard

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.980 
the control control m is the keyboard
shortcut<00:01:58.110> for<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.759> pc<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.030> I'm<00:02:00.750> just

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
shortcut for that on a pc and I'm just

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.050 
shortcut for that on a pc and I'm just
basically<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.040> bring<00:02:02.219> my<00:02:02.430> white<00:02:02.670> point

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
basically going to bring my white point

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.990 
basically going to bring my white point
up<00:02:03.320> until<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.350> start<00:02:04.890> seeing<00:02:05.189> all<00:02:05.430> those<00:02:05.579> gray

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
up until I start seeing all those gray

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.960 
up until I start seeing all those gray
lines<00:02:08.929> getting<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.410> know<00:02:10.560> disappearing

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
lines getting you know disappearing

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.450 
lines getting you know disappearing
and<00:02:12.320> what<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:13.500> does<00:02:13.680> though<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.190> also

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
and what that does though is it also

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.420 
and what that does though is it also
makes<00:02:14.700> my<00:02:14.970> black<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> little<00:02:15.780> less<00:02:15.930> dense<00:02:16.430> no

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
makes my black a little less dense no

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.580 
makes my black a little less dense no
big<00:02:17.610> deal<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.960> want<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.290> can<00:02:19.530> go

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
big deal but if you want you can go

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.020 
big deal but if you want you can go
ahead<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.210> bring<00:02:21.210> your<00:02:21.420> black<00:02:21.660> point<00:02:21.990> down

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
ahead and bring your black point down

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.330 
ahead and bring your black point down
basically<00:02:24.030> we're<00:02:24.180> making<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.740> NS<00:02:25.740> curve<00:02:26.070> and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
basically we're making a NS curve and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.230 
basically we're making a NS curve and
let's<00:02:27.240> go<00:02:27.360> ahead<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.600> hit<00:02:27.780> OK<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.530> and

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
let's go ahead and hit OK on that and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.660 
let's go ahead and hit OK on that and
fit<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.360> screen<00:02:31.010> blow<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> little<00:02:32.580> bit

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
fit the screen blow up on a little bit

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.570 
fit the screen blow up on a little bit
and<00:02:32.790> as<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.060> can<00:02:33.210> see<00:02:33.240> now<00:02:33.570> we've<00:02:33.780> got<00:02:34.020> a

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
and as you can see now we've got a

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.490 
and as you can see now we've got a
pretty<00:02:35.580> clean<00:02:36.020> still<00:02:37.020> got<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.170> little<00:02:37.290> bit<00:02:37.410> of

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
pretty clean still got a little bit of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.430 
pretty clean still got a little bit of
gray<00:02:37.710> but<00:02:37.920> not<00:02:38.370> not<00:02:38.670> enough<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.210> really<00:02:39.440> worry

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
gray but not not enough to really worry

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.050 
gray but not not enough to really worry
about<00:02:41.420> pretty<00:02:42.420> clean<00:02:42.720> drawing<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:44.640> work<00:02:44.820> from

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
about pretty clean drawing to work from

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.100 
about pretty clean drawing to work from
but<00:02:45.900> as<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.350> said<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.860> actual<00:02:47.690> problem<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.870> I

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
but as I said the actual problem is I

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.860 
but as I said the actual problem is I
can't<00:02:49.200> see<00:02:50.030> what<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:51.120> tracing<00:02:51.450> when<00:02:51.780> i'm

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.520 
reason to to give a really high DPI and
and<00:04:26.300> you<00:04:27.300> know<00:04:27.419> have<00:04:27.629> your<00:04:27.810> ink<00:04:27.990> spraying<00:04:28.409> out

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
and you know have your ink spraying out

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.020 
and you know have your ink spraying out
a<00:04:28.560> lot<00:04:28.830> of<00:04:28.979> ink<00:04:29.819> that<00:04:29.999> you<00:04:30.150> don't<00:04:30.389> need<00:04:30.629> and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
a lot of ink that you don't need and

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.749 
a lot of ink that you don't need and
just<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.479> know<00:04:33.599> taking<00:04:34.110> longer<00:04:34.469> to<00:04:34.620> print<00:04:35.009> so

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
just you know taking longer to print so

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.140 
just you know taking longer to print so
basically<00:04:36.629> that's<00:04:37.430> that<00:04:38.430> was<00:04:38.550> my<00:04:38.699> next<00:04:38.759> step

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
basically that's that was my next step

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.679 
basically that's that was my next step
was<00:04:39.389> to<00:04:39.419> get<00:04:39.749> to<00:04:39.900> this<00:04:40.050> point<00:04:41.360> okay<00:04:42.360> so<00:04:42.419> let's

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:42.689 
was to get to this point okay so let's

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.489 
was to get to this point okay so let's
go<00:04:42.840> ahead<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.020> close<00:04:43.349> his<00:04:43.560> file<00:04:43.830> out<00:04:44.069> and

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:45.499 
go ahead and close his file out and

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:52.189 
go ahead and close his file out and
let's<00:04:46.499> open<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.949> one<00:04:47.129> that<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.340> traced<00:04:51.199> okay

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
let's open the one that I traced okay

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.529 
let's open the one that I traced okay
this<00:04:52.409> is<00:04:52.529> my<00:04:52.710> tracing<00:04:53.099> of<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.669> blue<00:04:53.909> line<00:04:56.539> let

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
this is my tracing of the blue line let

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.450 
this is my tracing of the blue line let
me<00:04:57.629> zoom<00:04:57.810> in<00:04:58.020> on<00:04:58.139> his<00:04:58.289> face<00:04:58.529> here<00:04:58.830> for<00:04:59.099> you<00:04:59.250> and

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
me zoom in on his face here for you and

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.920 
me zoom in on his face here for you and
as<00:05:00.300> you<00:05:00.419> can<00:05:00.569> see<00:05:00.599> I<00:05:02.060> wasn't<00:05:03.060> happy<00:05:03.509> with<00:05:03.659> what

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
as you can see I wasn't happy with what

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.709 
as you can see I wasn't happy with what
I<00:05:03.960> did<00:05:04.340> in<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.460> eyes<00:05:05.580> i<00:05:05.969> was<00:05:06.120> working<00:05:06.509> very

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:06.719 
I did in the eyes i was working very

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:11.360 
I did in the eyes i was working very
small<00:05:07.289> so<00:05:08.189> it<00:05:08.279> was<00:05:08.400> very<00:05:08.460> tough<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.560> I<00:05:10.560> didn't

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
small so it was very tough and I didn't

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.670 
small so it was very tough and I didn't
like<00:05:11.460> it<00:05:11.669> so<00:05:12.060> all<00:05:12.240> I<00:05:12.270> did<00:05:12.419> was<00:05:12.599> come<00:05:13.259> over<00:05:13.289> here

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680

foreground color to white and just

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.649 
foreground color to white and just
scrubbed<00:05:19.500> out<00:05:19.650> what<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.490> had<00:05:20.789> there<00:05:21.029> and<00:05:21.240> it

board and rework it a bit it's going to

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.760 
board and rework it a bit it's going to
be<00:05:28.919> printed<00:05:29.310> in<00:05:29.759> that<00:05:30.300> same<00:05:31.789> blue<00:05:32.789> preset<00:05:33.770> very

be printed in that same blue preset very
light<00:05:35.099> just<00:05:35.610> enough<00:05:35.969> so<00:05:36.150> that<00:05:36.180> I<00:05:36.389> can<00:05:36.449> see

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
light just enough so that I can see

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.350 
light just enough so that I can see
what's<00:05:37.830> going<00:05:37.919> on<00:05:38.339> while<00:05:38.610> I'm<00:05:38.759> inking<00:05:39.120> and

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
what's going on while I'm inking and

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
that's where i'm going to do most of the

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.550 
that's where i'm going to do most of the
work<00:05:40.770> is<00:05:41.099> in<00:05:41.279> the<00:05:41.310> ink<00:05:41.610> stage<00:05:41.939> as<00:05:42.240> you<00:05:42.990> can<00:05:43.229> see

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
work is in the ink stage as you can see

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.550 
work is in the ink stage as you can see
hopefully<00:05:44.099> on<00:05:44.550> your<00:05:44.699> monitor<00:05:45.240> as<00:05:46.020> a<00:05:46.199> very

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
hopefully on your monitor as a very

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.139 
hopefully on your monitor as a very
light<00:05:46.830> file<00:05:47.219> and<00:05:49.399> you<00:05:50.399> know<00:05:50.490> I<00:05:50.520> even<00:05:50.849> went<00:05:51.000> in

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:51.149 
light file and you know I even went in

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:53.809 
light file and you know I even went in
here<00:05:51.419> and<00:05:51.599> raced<00:05:52.080> out<00:05:52.430> some<00:05:53.430> of<00:05:53.550> the<00:05:53.610> lines

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:53.819 
here and raced out some of the lines

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.019 
here and raced out some of the lines
that<00:05:54.000> I<00:05:54.149> don't<00:05:54.360> want<00:05:54.569> to<00:05:54.659> print<00:05:55.189> these<00:05:56.189> kirby

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:57.029 
that I don't want to print these kirby

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:58.399 
that I don't want to print these kirby
krackle<00:05:57.210> things<00:05:57.629> are<00:05:57.779> going<00:05:57.899> to<00:05:57.960> be<00:05:58.139> black

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
krackle things are going to be black

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.240 
krackle things are going to be black
it's<00:05:58.649> okay<00:05:58.979> if<00:05:59.129> if<00:05:59.370> lines<00:06:00.120> cross<00:06:00.509> over<00:06:00.899> there

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
it's okay if if lines cross over there

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.800 
it's okay if if lines cross over there
so<00:06:02.250> you<00:06:02.310> kind<00:06:02.580> of<00:06:02.639> gotta<00:06:02.789> you<00:06:03.180> know<00:06:03.210> I'm<00:06:03.539> kind

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.320 
so you kind of gotta you know I'm kind
of<00:06:03.899> mapping<00:06:04.110> out<00:06:04.379> what<00:06:04.919> I'm<00:06:05.039> going<00:06:05.219> to<00:06:05.279> do<00:06:05.520> a

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
of mapping out what I'm going to do a

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.209 
of mapping out what I'm going to do a
little<00:06:06.750> bit<00:06:07.500> ahead<00:06:07.620> but<00:06:08.069> I'm<00:06:08.159> also<00:06:08.370> leaving

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:10.219 
little bit ahead but I'm also leaving

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.939 
little bit ahead but I'm also leaving
certain<00:06:11.219> aspects<00:06:11.669> of<00:06:11.879> this<00:06:12.089> up<00:06:12.870> to<00:06:13.500> the<00:06:13.620> actual

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
certain aspects of this up to the actual

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.499 
certain aspects of this up to the actual
ink<00:06:14.219> stage<00:06:15.439> so<00:06:16.439> is<00:06:16.849> the<00:06:17.849> background<00:06:18.300> layer<00:06:18.479> and

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
ink stage so is the background layer and

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:22.550 
ink stage so is the background layer and
I've<00:06:19.020> actually<00:06:19.289> already<00:06:20.189> sized<00:06:21.060> this<00:06:21.569> one<00:06:21.810> to

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
I've actually already sized this one to

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.719 
I've actually already sized this one to
10<00:06:22.770> by<00:06:22.949> 15<00:06:23.120> with<00:06:24.120> a<00:06:24.149> 300<00:06:24.930> resolution<00:06:25.560> so<00:06:26.250> 10<00:06:26.610> by

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
10 by 15 with a 300 resolution so 10 by

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.760 
10 by 15 with a 300 resolution so 10 by
15<00:06:26.789> on<00:06:27.449> 11<00:06:27.839> x<00:06:27.990> 17<00:06:28.020> board<00:06:28.919> is<00:06:29.099> fairly<00:06:29.550> standard

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
15 on 11 x 17 board is fairly standard

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.019 
15 on 11 x 17 board is fairly standard
bordering<00:06:32.120> so<00:06:33.120> let's<00:06:33.300> just-okay<00:06:33.629> that<00:06:35.029> I'm

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:36.029 
bordering so let's just-okay that I'm

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:37.879 
bordering so let's just-okay that I'm
working<00:06:36.269> on<00:06:36.539> two<00:06:36.839> monitors<00:06:37.229> so<00:06:37.529> I'm<00:06:37.649> going<00:06:37.860> to

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
working on two monitors so I'm going to

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.090 
working on two monitors so I'm going to
go<00:06:38.069> over<00:06:38.099> to<00:06:38.370> my

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.100 
go over to my

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.270 
go over to my
layers<00:06:40.100> monitor<00:06:40.690> right<00:06:41.690> now<00:06:41.900> this<00:06:42.710> pencil<00:06:43.160> is

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
layers monitor right now this pencil is

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
which you can't see but you know if

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.680 
which you can't see but you know if
you're<00:06:52.970> familiar<00:06:53.120> with<00:06:53.419> Photoshop<00:06:54.110> at<00:06:54.289> all

you're familiar with Photoshop at all

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.140 
you're familiar with Photoshop at all
it's<00:06:56.690> there<00:06:56.990> and<00:06:57.550> really<00:06:58.550> the<00:06:58.639> reason<00:06:58.819> I<00:06:59.090> need

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
it's there and really the reason I need

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.200 
it's there and really the reason I need
to<00:06:59.300> do<00:06:59.630> that<00:06:59.660> is<00:07:00.110> so<00:07:00.919> that<00:07:01.069> I<00:07:01.250> can<00:07:03.460> put<00:07:04.460> a<00:07:04.520> black

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
to do that is so that I can put a black

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.670 
to do that is so that I can put a black
border<00:07:05.599> around<00:07:06.220> the<00:07:08.139> drawing<00:07:09.139> so<00:07:09.380> that<00:07:09.530> when<00:07:09.650> I

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
border around the drawing so that when I

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.070 
border around the drawing so that when I
print<00:07:09.979> it<00:07:10.039> out<00:07:10.190> I<00:07:10.490> have<00:07:11.030> a<00:07:11.060> blue<00:07:11.360> drawing<00:07:11.810> of
