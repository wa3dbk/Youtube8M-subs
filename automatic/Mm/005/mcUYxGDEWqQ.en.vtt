the<00:00:29.810> single<00:00:30.140> biggest<00:00:30.320> challenge<00:00:30.710> is<00:00:31.189> really

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
the single biggest challenge is really

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.600 
the single biggest challenge is really
the<00:00:32.000> unknown<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:32.750> in<00:00:33.200> trying<00:00:33.860> to<00:00:34.100> put<00:00:34.250> a<00:00:34.280> test

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
the unknown and in trying to put a test

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.380 
the unknown and in trying to put a test
plan<00:00:34.970> together<00:00:35.290> that<00:00:36.290> accounts<00:00:36.830> for

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
plan together that accounts for

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.220 
plan together that accounts for
everything<00:00:38.390> that<00:00:38.540> you'll<00:00:38.660> see<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:38.989> a<00:00:39.050> race<00:00:39.199> car

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
everything that you'll see in a race car

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.350 
everything that you'll see in a race car
in<00:00:39.559> 24<00:00:39.980> hours<00:00:40.309> and<00:00:40.550> then<00:00:40.640> it's<00:00:40.970> virtually

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
in 24 hours and then it's virtually

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:54.720 
in 24 hours and then it's virtually
impossible<00:00:41.449> to<00:00:41.989> do

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.550 

you<00:00:55.540> know<00:00:55.630> when<00:00:55.720> you<00:00:55.810> look<00:00:55.930> at<00:00:56.050> bringing<00:00:56.320> a<00:00:56.350> new

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
you know when you look at bringing a new

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.230 
you know when you look at bringing a new
powertrain<00:00:57.250> like<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.580> 3<00:00:57.730> 5<00:00:57.910> litre<00:00:58.180> EcoBoost

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
powertrain like the 3 5 litre EcoBoost

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.740 
powertrain like the 3 5 litre EcoBoost

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
new powertrain you don't get a warm up

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.040 
new powertrain you don't get a warm up
you<00:01:09.940> know<00:01:10.060> we<00:01:10.150> don't<00:01:10.240> have<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.510> two-hour<00:01:10.840> event

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
you know we don't have a two-hour event

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.840 
you know we don't have a two-hour event
that<00:01:11.320> we<00:01:11.410> go<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.620> before<00:01:11.890> this<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.490> we<00:01:12.580> learn

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
that we go to before this and we learn

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.180 
that we go to before this and we learn
from<00:01:13.090> that<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.570> so<00:01:13.840> on<00:01:13.990> I<00:01:14.020> mean<00:01:14.140> you<00:01:14.770> have<00:01:15.010> to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
from that and so on I mean you have to

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
from that and so on I mean you have to
get<00:01:15.370> it<00:01:15.490> right<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.600> first<00:01:16.870> time<00:01:17.020> out

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.210 

we<00:01:26.210> haven't<00:01:26.420> run<00:01:26.600> a<00:01:26.630> 24-hour<00:01:26.840> track<00:01:27.650> test<00:01:27.980> with

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
we haven't run a 24-hour track test with

00:01:28.220 --> 00:02:19.809 
we haven't run a 24-hour track test with
these<00:01:28.310> engines<00:01:28.760> yet<00:01:28.910> this<00:01:29.180> is<00:01:29.390> it

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.160 

we<00:02:20.819> just<00:02:21.030> went<00:02:21.209> in<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.360> race<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.750> race<00:02:21.959> we

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
we just went in the race and race we

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.729 
we just went in the race and race we
raced<00:02:22.409> 24<00:02:22.920> hours<00:02:23.220> hard<00:02:23.909> and<00:02:24.269> fast<00:02:24.900> as<00:02:25.290> fast<00:02:25.530> as

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
raced 24 hours hard and fast as fast as

00:02:25.739 --> 00:03:00.470 
raced 24 hours hard and fast as fast as
we<00:02:25.860> could

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.559 

next<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:01.690> we<00:03:01.989> go<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.319> shop<00:03:02.890> we<00:03:03.520> debrief<00:03:04.120> and

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
next is we go to the shop we debrief and

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.229 
next is we go to the shop we debrief and
we<00:03:05.230> set<00:03:05.560> new<00:03:05.770> targets<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.580> new<00:03:06.670> goals<00:03:06.910> and

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
we set new targets and new goals and

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.970 
we set new targets and new goals and
move<00:03:07.450> forward<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.959> Sebring<00:03:08.349> Sebring<00:03:08.860> is

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
move forward to Sebring Sebring is

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.070 
move forward to Sebring Sebring is
coming<00:03:09.280> up<00:03:09.370> quick<00:03:09.610> we<00:03:09.819> test<00:03:10.209> in<00:03:10.450> less<00:03:10.569> than<00:03:10.750> 20

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
coming up quick we test in less than 20

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.500 
coming up quick we test in less than 20
days<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.739> we<00:03:11.920> race<00:03:12.130> in<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.910> month<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.480> half

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
days and we race in a month and a half

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.710 
days and we race in a month and a half
at<00:03:13.840> Seabury
