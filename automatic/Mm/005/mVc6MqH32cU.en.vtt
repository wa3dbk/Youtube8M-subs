00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
this is one of the things that when

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.770 
this is one of the things that when
you're<00:02:04.590> trying<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.009> do<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> blow<00:02:05.759> dry<00:02:06.030> or<00:02:06.420> just

you're trying to do a blow dry or just

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.990 
you're trying to do a blow dry or just
using<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.590> mannequin<00:02:08.009> head<00:02:08.160> your<00:02:08.340> stands<00:02:08.670> kind

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
using a mannequin head your stands kind

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.430 
using a mannequin head your stands kind
of<00:02:09.060> moving<00:02:09.239> around<00:02:09.420> they<00:02:10.020> would<00:02:10.140> always<00:02:10.259> have

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
of moving around they would always have

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.869 
of moving around they would always have
that<00:02:10.560> foot<00:02:10.860> placement<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.580> put<00:02:11.790> your

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
that foot placement that you put your

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.130 
that foot placement that you put your
foot<00:02:12.090> down<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.870> wouldn't

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
foot down on it so it wouldn't

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.260 
foot down on it so it wouldn't
move<00:02:13.350> this<00:02:14.010> sticks<00:02:14.400> straight<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.970> floor

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
move this sticks straight to the floor

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.360 
move this sticks straight to the floor
and<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.960> other<00:02:15.990> thing<00:02:16.380> about<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:16.830> even

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
and the other thing about this is even

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.340 
and the other thing about this is even
sad<00:02:17.670> can<00:02:17.970> barely<00:02:18.240> do<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.390> curl<00:02:18.750> with<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.110> thing

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
sad can barely do a curl with this thing

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.160 
sad can barely do a curl with this thing
it's<00:02:19.590> super<00:02:20.040> heavy<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:21.690> know<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.050> it

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
it's super heavy and you know so it

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.250 
it's super heavy and you know so it
works<00:02:22.410> really<00:02:22.530> well<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.819> heaviness<00:02:24.260> combined

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
works really well the heaviness combined

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.110 
works really well the heaviness combined
with<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.590> rubber<00:02:25.800> feet<00:02:26.130> allow<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.090> just

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
with the rubber feet allow it to just

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.090 
with the rubber feet allow it to just
stay<00:02:27.569> where<00:02:27.810> it's<00:02:27.930> at<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.500> floor<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:28.980> when

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
stay where it's at on the floor so when

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.900 
stay where it's at on the floor so when
you're<00:02:29.220> cutting<00:02:29.400> here<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.670> don't<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:29.820> to

here is the the key feature there we go

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.300 
here is the the key feature there we go
it's<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:42.989> for<00:02:43.110> doing<00:02:43.319> its<00:02:43.440> thing<00:02:43.620> let's

what makes it so different
I<00:02:52.500> mean<00:02:52.769> loosen<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.400> up<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:53.880> put<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
I mean loosen this up you put the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.810 
I mean loosen this up you put the
mannequin<00:02:54.570> here<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:55.410> pull<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.830> down<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.400> it

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
mannequin here you pull this down and it

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.970 
mannequin here you pull this down and it
rotates<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.570> entire<00:02:57.930> head<00:02:58.200> until<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.620> lock

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
rotates the entire head until you lock

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.220 
rotates the entire head until you lock
it<00:02:59.160> back<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.580> and<00:02:59.790> then<00:03:00.209> this<00:03:00.360> head<00:03:00.630> stays<00:03:00.959> so

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
it back in and then this head stays so

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
stand around in classes or even at your

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
try to get to the other side of the head

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.650 
try to get to the other side of the head
well<00:03:17.160> now<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.850> just<00:03:18.000> pull<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.269> lever<00:03:18.450> down

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
well now you just pull this lever down

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.720 
well now you just pull this lever down
and<00:03:18.959> shift<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.220> you're<00:03:20.310> good<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.489> go

and shift it and you're good to go
I<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.840> lever<00:03:22.079> here<00:03:22.560> because<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.610> lot<00:03:24.000> of

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
I like the lever here because a lot of

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.050 
I like the lever here because a lot of
times<00:03:24.299> this<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.660> just<00:03:24.690> us<00:03:25.019> kind<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:26.060> small

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
times this is just us kind of a small

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.910 
times this is just us kind of a small
and<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.660> doesn't<00:03:27.900> really<00:03:28.019> work<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.290> well

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
and it doesn't really work that well
