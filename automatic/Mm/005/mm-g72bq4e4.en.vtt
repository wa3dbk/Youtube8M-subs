00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.639 
one of my favorite goals
I<00:01:26.240> always<00:01:26.390> remember<00:01:26.899> as<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:27.020> kid<00:01:27.049> that<00:01:27.350> David

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
I always remember as a kid that David

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.190 
I always remember as a kid that David
Platt<00:01:27.829> Kyle<00:01:28.039> when<00:01:28.249> he<00:01:28.310> spun<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:28.729> bullied<00:01:28.939> it

Platt Kyle when he spun and bullied it
against<00:01:30.200> Belgium<00:01:30.619> I<00:01:30.679> think<00:01:30.920> because<00:01:31.189> just

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
against Belgium I think because just

the<00:01:33.649> government<00:01:34.159> that<00:01:34.310> was<00:01:34.429> the<00:01:34.549> moment<00:01:34.909> I

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
the government that was the moment I

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.550

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.219 
realized what well capture all about and
as<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.460> said<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.119> kids<00:01:38.420> in<00:01:38.569> their<00:01:38.719> Gaza<00:01:38.990> was

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
as I said to the kids in their Gaza was

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.129 
as I said to the kids in their Gaza was
doing<00:01:39.560> my<00:01:39.829> Ida<00:01:40.009> was<00:01:40.249> a<00:01:40.280> as<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.729> as<00:01:41.689> a<00:01:41.810> kid<00:01:42.020> and

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:42.139 
doing my Ida was a as a as a kid and

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:43.840 
doing my Ida was a as a as a kid and
that<00:01:42.289> was<00:01:42.439> him<00:01:42.649> arriving<00:01:42.950> on<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.219> same<00:01:43.520> side

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
that was him arriving on the same side

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.639 
that was him arriving on the same side
that<00:01:44.030> well<00:01:44.179> cap<00:01:44.420> was<00:01:44.600> firmly<00:01:44.929> in<00:01:45.139> my<00:01:45.259> mind<00:01:45.499> is

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
that well cap was firmly in my mind is

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.649 
that well cap was firmly in my mind is
the<00:01:45.859> my<00:01:46.310> first<00:01:46.520> real<00:01:46.850> idea<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.270> what<00:01:47.359> World

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
the my first real idea of what World

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.690 
the my first real idea of what World
Cups<00:01:47.840> all<00:01:47.990> about<00:01:48.259> how<00:01:49.039> fitting<00:01:49.280> would<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.579> be

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
Cups all about how fitting would it be

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.300 
Cups all about how fitting would it be
in<00:01:50.119> 2010<00:01:50.689> for<00:01:50.899> England<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.770> go<00:01:51.889> one<00:01:52.100> better

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
in 2010 for England to go one better

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.099 
in 2010 for England to go one better
than<00:01:52.549> even<00:01:52.789> Sir<00:01:53.119> Bobby<00:01:53.299> was<00:01:53.509> able<00:01:53.749> to<00:01:53.840> manage

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
than even Sir Bobby was able to manage

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.080 
than even Sir Bobby was able to manage
and<00:01:54.259> perhaps<00:01:54.499> in<00:01:54.799> his<00:01:54.920> memory<00:01:55.280> go<00:01:55.729> then<00:01:55.909> win

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
and perhaps in his memory go then win

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.419 
and perhaps in his memory go then win
the<00:01:56.179> World<00:01:56.329> Cup<00:01:56.389> for<00:01:56.659> him<00:01:56.749> of<00:01:57.350> course<00:01:57.590> it'll<00:01:58.310> be

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
the World Cup for him of course it'll be

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.819 
the World Cup for him of course it'll be
fantastic<00:01:58.639> to<00:01:58.999> do<00:01:59.149> that<00:01:59.329> obviously<00:01:59.709> first<00:02:00.709> we

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
fantastic to do that obviously first we

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.800 
fantastic to do that obviously first we
need<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.039> get<00:02:01.189> down<00:02:01.340> get<00:02:01.579> a<00:02:01.609> point<00:02:01.850> then<00:02:02.689> we

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
need to get down get a point then we

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.239 
need to get down get a point then we
need<00:02:02.959> to<00:02:03.079> go<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:03.289> perform<00:02:03.649> there<00:02:03.829> and<00:02:03.950> try<00:02:04.130> and

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
manager he wasn't the man he was for

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.030 
manager he wasn't the man he was for
England<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.180> if<00:02:11.240> we<00:02:11.360> can<00:02:11.510> go<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.860> go<00:02:12.860> one

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
England and if we can go and go one

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.600 
will
quite<00:02:18.140> achievement<00:02:18.620> for<00:02:19.310> all<00:02:19.340> involved

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
quite achievement for all involved

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.040 
quite achievement for all involved
especially<00:02:19.970> when<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.450> look<00:02:20.569> at<00:02:20.659> this<00:02:20.750> England

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
especially when you look at this England

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.780 
especially when you look at this England
side<00:02:21.200> at<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.379> moment<00:02:21.739> how<00:02:22.129> confident<00:02:22.580> are<00:02:22.730> you

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
side at the moment how confident are you

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.670 
side at the moment how confident are you
that<00:02:22.909> it<00:02:23.720> could<00:02:23.870> be<00:02:23.959> good<00:02:24.110> enough<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.349> go<00:02:24.560> and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
that it could be good enough to go and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.740 
that it could be good enough to go and
do<00:02:24.769> that<00:02:24.920> I'm<00:02:25.459> confident<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.209> think<00:02:26.480> this<00:02:26.599> be

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
do that I'm confident I think this be

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.990 
do that I'm confident I think this be
careful<00:02:27.470> fall<00:02:27.650> into<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.040> trap<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.909> know

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
careful fall into the trap of you know

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.250 
careful fall into the trap of you know
we're<00:02:29.150> done<00:02:29.239> before<00:02:29.540> we<00:02:29.659> people<00:02:29.959> ask<00:02:30.049> if<00:02:30.170> you

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
we're done before we people ask if you

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.649 
we're done before we people ask if you
can<00:02:30.379> win<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:30.799> say<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.010> can<00:02:31.129> and

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
can win it and you say you can and

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.940 
can win it and you say you can and
expectations<00:02:32.659> rise<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:33.019> think<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.620> course<00:02:33.769> we

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
expectations rise I think of course we

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.699 
expectations rise I think of course we
can<00:02:34.129> win<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.430> we're<00:02:35.420> playing<00:02:35.690> as<00:02:36.319> well<00:02:36.500> as<00:02:36.620> we

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
can win it we're playing as well as we

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:37.960 
can win it we're playing as well as we
have<00:02:36.830> for<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.010> long<00:02:37.160> time<00:02:37.400> there's<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.849> real

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
have for a long time there's a real

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.369 
have for a long time there's a real
confidence<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.599> it's<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.780> governess<00:02:39.140> about

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
confidence and it's a governess about

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.250 
confidence and it's a governess about
the<00:02:39.500> group<00:02:40.390> but<00:02:41.390> there's<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.930> lot<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.140> good

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
the group but there's a lot of good

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.569 
the group but there's a lot of good
teams<00:02:42.410> out<00:02:42.650> there<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.010> it's<00:02:43.129> very<00:02:43.160> important

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
teams out there so it's very important

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.490 
teams out there so it's very important
we<00:02:43.670> get<00:02:44.120> ourselves<00:02:44.239> ready<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:45.079> year<00:02:45.140> we'd

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
we get ourselves ready this year we'd

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500 
we get ourselves ready this year we'd
qualify<00:02:45.980> we<00:02:46.220> train<00:02:46.459> hard<00:02:46.670> we<00:02:46.909> try<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:47.390> keep

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
qualify we train hard we try and keep

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.539 
qualify we train hard we try and keep
improving<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.110> improving<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:49.159> when<00:02:49.310> we<00:02:49.400> go

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
improving and improving and when we go

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.860 
improving and improving and when we go
there<00:02:49.760> give<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.030> our<00:02:50.120> best<00:02:50.150> shot<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.599> I<00:02:50.660> think

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
there give it our best shot and I think

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.930 
there give it our best shot and I think
we've<00:02:50.959> got<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.170> very<00:02:51.590> good<00:02:51.620> chance<00:02:51.950> then<00:02:52.250> as<00:02:52.760> I

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
we've got a very good chance then as I

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.640 
we've got a very good chance then as I
said<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:53.360> need<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.870> little<00:02:53.989> bit<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.230> luck<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.470> a

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
said we need a little bit of luck and a

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.990 
said we need a little bit of luck and a
little<00:02:54.769> bit<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.069> circumstances<00:02:55.670> along<00:02:55.879> the

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
little bit of circumstances along the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.180 
little bit of circumstances along the
way<00:02:56.120> but<00:02:56.180> it's<00:02:56.959> certainly<00:02:57.200> possible<00:02:57.260> we<00:02:58.040> can

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
way but it's certainly possible we can

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.460 
way but it's certainly possible we can
do<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:59.000> good<00:02:59.329> thing<00:02:59.510> about<00:02:59.569> us<00:02:59.780> now<00:03:00.079> is<00:03:00.260> I

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
do it the good thing about us now is I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.660 
do it the good thing about us now is I
think<00:03:00.799> England<00:03:01.190> always<00:03:01.280> had<00:03:01.519> great

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
think England always had great

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.710 
think England always had great
individuals<00:03:02.150> whether<00:03:02.299> they're<00:03:02.510> world-class

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
individuals whether they're world-class

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.300 
individuals whether they're world-class
or<00:03:03.079> not<00:03:03.260> but<00:03:03.709> it<00:03:03.769> didn't<00:03:04.040> always<00:03:04.099> work

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
or not but it didn't always work

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.280 
or not but it didn't always work
together<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:05.120> think<00:03:05.450> now<00:03:05.720> what<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:05.959> see<00:03:06.140> where

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
together I think now what you see where

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.349 
together I think now what you see where
this<00:03:06.379> is<00:03:06.440> not<00:03:06.920> necessarily<00:03:07.370> what<00:03:07.700> individual

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
this is not necessarily what individual

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.759 
this is not necessarily what individual
it<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.540> it's<00:03:08.959> more<00:03:09.109> about<00:03:09.319> how<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.470> team's

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
it is it's more about how the team's

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.860 
it is it's more about how the team's
playing<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.340> if<00:03:11.030> we<00:03:11.209> can<00:03:11.359> go<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.750> play

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
playing and if we can go and play

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.509 
playing and if we can go and play
together<00:03:12.170> as<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.560> team<00:03:12.739> with<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:12.980> quality<00:03:13.400> we

that everybody determine people
so<00:04:28.100> I<00:04:28.160> think<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.580> is<00:04:28.670> probably<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.970> major

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
so I think that is probably the major

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.330 
so I think that is probably the major
similar<00:04:29.690> I've<00:04:29.900> seen<00:04:30.080> so<00:04:30.290> far<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:31.070> that's

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
similar I've seen so far and that's

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.590 
similar I've seen so far and that's
probably<00:04:31.670> the<00:04:31.820> reason<00:04:31.880> why<00:04:32.150> they've<00:04:32.450> been<00:04:32.540> so

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
probably the reason why they've been so

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.660 
probably the reason why they've been so
successful<00:04:32.750> a<00:04:33.380> huge<00:04:33.680> club<00:04:33.950> lot<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.460> pair<00:04:34.640> of
