00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.890
 they are light protected 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.989
 environment and cost less than cis 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.880
 however often doing extreme 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.739

 want to relax in nature need a fire 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.360
 good company and music and we 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.670
 editorial parcel decided that the music 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.190
 must be played too protected 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.350
 devices and after a brief search we 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.649
 found a suitable option is bluetooth 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.129
 column ex gera carax protection ipx7 from 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.559
 moisture 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.449
 we chose an orange column but 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.100
 the manufacturer offers and still in black 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.190
 and red and so are some characteristics 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.379
 Horrox stereo speakers with a capacity of 6 watts 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.859
 separate bass top speaker 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.089
 column protection peak 7 from moisture 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.100
 rubberized top buttons 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.510
 columns connectivity by 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.120
 bluetooth any smartphones and 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.430
 tablets or laptops powerful batteries 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.100
 1700 milliampere hour with the ability 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.020
 playing music was 10 hours she 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.250
 very compact to have its weight only 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.590
 300 12 grams 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.570
 so let's see , karaks 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.760
 the manufacturer positions the column as 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.340
 durable and waterproof degree 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.630
 security apex quince is an index 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.120
 protection what translate means 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.130
 degree of security 2 x 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.210
 indicates that the column is protected from 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.460
 water penetration 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.560
 symbol 7 means that the column can 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.409
 be immersed to a depth of 1 meter and 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.710
 stay there for a period of thirty 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.270
 well here is security we will be back a little 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.429
 later i 'm glad that interests us 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.649
 music speakers is of course the sound 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.750
 and he's good enough at maximum 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.909
 volume for cows creates 120 bella 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.159
 speaker volume even bounces 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.170
 good on rubber is nothing to fear 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.869
 when connecting test moto g we 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.849
 used in the app power nps 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.890
 speakers could be managed as tracks 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:06.509
 so calls 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.099
 there are no complaints in this regard 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.920
 microphone speakers are sensitive and 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.930
 yelling at carax doesn't have to say 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.910
 security we have long argued whether 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.640
 column play music dive into 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.069
 water and it was decided to drown it in the sink 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.400
 we filled the sink with water plunged 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.599
 there is a column and she continued to play 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.519
 making sure that some time column 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.200
 play music water we decided 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.950
 drown her breakthrough 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:36.709
 we have this lovely ski stick u 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.709
 we have a column 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.800
 she plays 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.019
 I think the fish are very happy that 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.700
 are now at the bottom 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.319
 so you know the float well the sound is still 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.069
 would like to draw attention to 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.069
 the temperature 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.880
 the sound goes means the producer 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.390
 really not cheating and column 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.500
 this rock whistle runs in the water 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.569
 amazing but the column continued to play 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.739
 on the street 20 degrees with a minus sign 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.620
 water temperature 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.300
 one-tenth of a degree in general 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.459
 Convenience to the column us really 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.200
 enjoyed it and we immediately came up with the mass 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.850
 options for using it someone 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.220
 wanted to attach to a different bike 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.440
 someone sent on the river and someone just 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.560
 stick in the bathroom well that mount 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.930
 allows you to do all this by the way 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.390
 ecorock once dropped from the table with 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.459
 height 2 meters a couple of times the column even 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.630
 rolling on the concrete floor imitating 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.940
 fall from a bicycle 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.069
 Well test sustained only 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.080
 decorative grille slightly wrinkled it 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.450
 she was straightened by ordinary 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.569
 pliers cost and to rocks on 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.250
