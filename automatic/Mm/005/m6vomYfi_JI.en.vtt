came out on top some people said that's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.630 
came out on top some people said that's
not<00:00:45.480> very<00:00:45.660> accurate<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.800> at<00:00:46.950> an<00:00:47.489> actual

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
not very accurate to get it at an actual

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.510 
not very accurate to get it at an actual
galaxy<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> test<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.680> did<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.370> I'm

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
galaxy to do the test so I did so I'm

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.160 
galaxy to do the test so I did so I'm
here<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.789> settle<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.210> debate<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.690> which<00:00:51.899> phone

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
here to settle the debate of which phone

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.770 
here to settle the debate of which phone
possesses<00:00:52.890> more<00:00:53.039> power<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.600> like<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.719> said

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
possesses more power and like I said

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.260 
possesses more power and like I said
they're<00:00:55.110> both<00:00:55.230> going<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.879> using<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
they're both going to be using the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.959 
they're both going to be using the
lame-o<00:00:57.600> version<00:00:58.109> 1.0<00:00:58.890> point<00:00:59.190> 6<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.699> do<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
lame-o version 1.0 point 6 to do the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.750 
lame-o version 1.0 point 6 to do the
test<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.829> Here<00:01:01.829> We<00:01:01.859> Go<00:01:01.980> I'm<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> start

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
test and Here We Go I'm going to start

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:20.860 
test and Here We Go I'm going to start
them<00:01:03.000> both<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.660> now

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.680 

the<00:01:21.440> Nexus<00:01:21.860> looks<00:01:22.490> like<00:01:22.700> it's<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:23.000> head<00:01:23.180> right

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
the Nexus looks like it's a head right

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:36.330 
the Nexus looks like it's a head right
from<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.020> get-go

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:49.570 

the<00:01:37.210> razor<00:01:37.450> is<00:01:37.719> quickly<00:01:37.990> pulling<00:01:38.859> up

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.710 

keep<00:01:50.210> in<00:01:50.360> mind<00:01:50.390> this<00:01:50.660> test<00:01:51.080> isn't<00:01:51.850> about<00:01:52.850> speed

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
keep in mind this test isn't about speed

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.760 
keep in mind this test isn't about speed
you<00:01:54.710> know<00:01:54.800> doesn't<00:01:55.160> us<00:01:56.170> specifically<00:01:57.170> focus

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
you know doesn't us specifically focus

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.250 
you know doesn't us specifically focus
on<00:01:57.920> speed<00:01:58.280> speed<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.240> definitely<00:01:59.780> considered

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
on speed speed is definitely considered

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.410 
on speed speed is definitely considered
it<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.590> know<00:02:00.680> in<00:02:00.830> one<00:02:00.980> of<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.130> factors<00:02:01.580> but<00:02:01.790> it

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
it you know in one of the factors but it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.020 
it you know in one of the factors but it
goes<00:02:02.660> off<00:02:02.900> of<00:02:03.110> overall<00:02:03.530> performance<00:02:04.030> speed

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
goes off of overall performance speed

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.200 
goes off of overall performance speed

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
to compile all these these aspects

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.820 
to compile all these these aspects
together<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.360> then<00:02:14.900> at<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.200> end<00:02:15.350> it's<00:02:15.680> going

and there is the score right there on
the<00:05:39.020> Nexus<00:05:40.060> 1167<00:05:44.440> so<00:05:45.440> this<00:05:46.130> should<00:05:46.430> settle<00:05:46.760> the

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
the Nexus 1167 so this should settle the

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.440 
the Nexus 1167 so this should settle the
debate<00:05:47.150> of<00:05:47.539> which<00:05:47.780> phone<00:05:48.080> you<00:05:48.520> know<00:05:49.520> is<00:05:49.850> better

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
debate of which phone you know is better

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.490 
debate of which phone you know is better
in<00:05:50.830> my<00:05:51.830> opinion<00:05:51.860> they're<00:05:52.460> both<00:05:52.639> great<00:05:52.910> phones

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
in my opinion they're both great phones

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.710 
in my opinion they're both great phones
but<00:05:54.500> if<00:05:54.770> I<00:05:55.130> had<00:05:55.370> to<00:05:55.400> choose<00:05:55.580> one<00:05:55.970> I<00:05:56.210> would

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
but if I had to choose one I would

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.320 
but if I had to choose one I would
obviously<00:05:57.169> choose<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:57.979> razr<00:05:58.220> maxx<00:05:58.520> one<00:05:59.000> is

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
obviously choose the razr maxx one is

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.719 
obviously choose the razr maxx one is
because<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:00.350> battery<00:06:00.620> life<00:06:00.830> is<00:06:00.860> just<00:06:01.250> insane

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
because the battery life is just insane

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.930 
because the battery life is just insane
on<00:06:01.940> it<00:06:02.090> I<00:06:02.240> can<00:06:02.990> go<00:06:03.169> all<00:06:03.470> day<00:06:03.500> and<00:06:04.039> I<00:06:04.490> mean<00:06:04.729> all
