00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
been tweaked and modified now we do have

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.129 
been tweaked and modified now we do have
the<00:00:11.030> we<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.330> overclocked<00:00:12.840> but<00:00:13.049> i'll

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
the we have it overclocked but i'll

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.709 
the we have it overclocked but i'll
knock<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.130> back<00:00:14.309> down<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.790> stock<00:00:15.150> at<00:00:15.389> one<00:00:15.570> point

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
knock it back down to stock at one point

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.170 
knock it back down to stock at one point
two<00:00:15.870> gigahertz<00:00:16.190> will<00:00:17.190> apply<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:17.850> then

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
two gigahertz will apply that and then

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.460 
two gigahertz will apply that and then
we'll<00:00:18.270> run<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> quadrant<00:00:19.020> score<00:00:21.170> we'll<00:00:22.170> see<00:00:22.320> how

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
we'll run a quadrant score we'll see how

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.560 
we'll run a quadrant score we'll see how
it<00:00:22.500> runs<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:23.189> stock<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.850> then<00:00:24.180> we'll<00:00:24.330> see<00:00:24.480> if

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
it runs at stock and then we'll see if

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.650 
it runs at stock and then we'll see if
it<00:00:24.689> performs<00:00:24.960> any<00:00:25.260> better<00:00:25.590> overclocked<00:00:26.660> let's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
it performs any better overclocked let's

00:00:27.660 --> 00:01:59.400 
it performs any better overclocked let's
do<00:00:27.840> it

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.240 

so<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.500> squares<00:02:01.750> 2158<00:02:02.750> now<00:02:03.710> let's<00:02:03.890> see<00:02:04.070> how<00:02:04.220> it

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
so the squares 2158 now let's see how it

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.120 
so the squares 2158 now let's see how it
does<00:02:05.770> overclocked<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:08.260> overclock<00:02:09.260> it<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.470> 1.6
