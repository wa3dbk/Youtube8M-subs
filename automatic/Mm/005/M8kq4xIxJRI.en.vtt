00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.960
 luxe as much for support as for 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.120
 means as you know looks and as recently 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.179
 I did a guide on looks in his why 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.440
 I love him he wore in his for is a 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.240
 character that is very good that is like 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.460
 annie because it does a lot of damage and so 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.320
 we can help a lot in the face of 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.779
 of carry ally to do a lot of damage to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.820
 enemy and also has a lot much 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.810
 you can move you can stop you can do 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.340
 a bus 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.390
 this aerial alcohol for a shield or 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.460
 be that to me the truth that I like 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.769
 a lot so I 'm not going to apply one more 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.540
 or less masters for medium and for 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.079
 its because sometimes we have them here 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.180
 what its by lux min and the runes that 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.550
 we have here so we start with medium 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.020
 let's put the whole line of the average 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.969
 he called her what he's going to do with 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.680
 witchcraft fundamental expression a 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.300
 arcane march and an interest in archi magician 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.739
 with double edged sword to do more 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.600
 damage since the lux when we have the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.949
 that we are going to stop it and if one is 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.090
 double-edged we will do more damage 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.740
 he has yet to create him 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.480
 hit this to activate your passive 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.920
 teaches you executor and one at stake 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.500
 dangerous to do more damage with less 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.600
 of 50% of life and to recover life and 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.820
 an arcane blade to hurt with 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.650
 the ape devastating blows and ravages 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.180
 to do battle simply for the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.310
 issue of utility we have three in 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.500
 meditation about a thousand feet three in 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.720
 insight the invoker and an alchemist 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.980
 all this is an alchemist there is a line 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.200
 rooney here all this to get the 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.490
 unique affinity since the lux 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.110
 unfortunately he sucks mana with a 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.420
 unknown 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.700
 the theme of the runes we have reds 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.620
 magic penetration yellow armor 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.150
 magic resistance blue and 5a 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.400
 Skill power essences are 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.690
 a pretty basic ruins of apemit 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.200
 those that carry all the Apennines 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.450
 normally and the ones we're going to see in the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.860
 90 percent of those of the games by 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.910
 the southern theme because I already have it here 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.910
 prepared and 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.630
 for the issue of luxor are already changed 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.250
 of yes that look here faith looks but the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.479
 theme of supposedly quite different what 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.490
 that yes we 're going to put this is very 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.530
 important as we said I'll explain 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.000
 but because of the utility issue it's going to be what 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.250
 next three of meditation for the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.319
 Mana regeneration about a thousand feet 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.349
 always explains the invoker ziad and here 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.910
 to have the cookie to be able to throw 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.709
 the cookie and not have a bad time in the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.530
 line the issue of gold to give us 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.130
 more gold greed scavenger wealth and 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.239
 bandit and we will not lose inspiration 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.280
 to have more experience with 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.280
 stay behind intelligence for the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.980
 cooling reduction 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.830
 globetrotter to run more little more 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.690
 fast for the attack theme we put 9 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.360
 brÃ¼cher and 4 witchcraft there are 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.730
 an arcane teacher and one go lightning in 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.090
 attack to the weak point attack weak point 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.920
 It is very important because when they appear 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.270
 for example we have the current enemy the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.730
 A lane is going to hit and it will do 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.170
 much more damage a 1% more damage and you 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.750
 we do all the combo then all the damage 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.520
 what will we do for extra will be super good 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.030
 for a factory rip bursts the enemy 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.220
 but the theme of the runes we have 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.590
 a red magic yellow penetration 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.000
 of blue armor of magic resistance 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.530
 and 15 gold essences are more or less 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.800
 same as the others but although we have 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.320
 changed those of those of 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.150
 the damage of attack the damage of 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.860
 ability to forgive for fifth section of 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.780
 gold the little bit more people these are the 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.640
 masters and deluxe runes for as much as 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.080
 for half and nothing I hope that I have 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.080
 liked the video and until next time
