awful<00:02:57.040> left<00:02:57.280> join<00:02:57.549> us<00:02:57.670> right<00:02:58.000> back<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.269> the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
awful left join us right back to the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.300 
awful left join us right back to the
rail<00:02:59.400> yeah<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:01.389> actually<00:03:01.750> create<00:03:02.350> an<00:03:02.739> angle<00:03:03.160> to

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
rail yeah so actually create an angle to

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.030 
rail yeah so actually create an angle to
get<00:03:03.819> down<00:03:04.090> for<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:04.420> five<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:05.620> it'll<00:03:05.889> two

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
get down for the five and it'll two

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.150 
get down for the five and it'll two
rails<00:03:06.310> here<00:03:06.549> is<00:03:06.730> both<00:03:07.120> Wow<00:03:07.870> no<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.650> don't<00:03:09.069> think

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
rails here is both Wow no I don't think

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.220 
rails here is both Wow no I don't think
so<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.519> feel<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.150> think<00:03:10.420> he'll<00:03:10.569> come<00:03:10.750> straight

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
so I feel I think he'll come straight

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.740 
so I feel I think he'll come straight
down<00:03:11.430> because<00:03:12.430> if<00:03:12.579> he<00:03:12.670> goes<00:03:12.850> two<00:03:13.180> rails<00:03:13.510> you

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
down because if he goes two rails you

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.870 
down because if he goes two rails you
may<00:03:13.930> have<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.200> too<00:03:14.650> steep<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.130> an<00:03:15.310> angle<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.670> get

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
may have a too steep of an angle to get

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.809 
may have a too steep of an angle to get
on<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.209> five<00:03:16.799> he<00:03:17.799> wants<00:03:17.829> to<00:03:18.250> have<00:03:18.400> he's<00:03:18.639> going

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
on the five he wants to have he's going

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.599 
on the five he wants to have he's going
to<00:03:18.880> go<00:03:19.060> straight<00:03:19.450> down<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:20.019> table<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.709> believe

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
to go straight down the table I believe

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.879 
to go straight down the table I believe
it's<00:03:21.790> just<00:03:21.880> one<00:03:22.299> rail<00:03:22.569> for<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.900> body<00:03:23.200> float

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
it's just one rail for the body float

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.520 
it's just one rail for the body float
right<00:03:24.130> down<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.549> perfectly<00:03:25.090> what<00:03:25.410> makes<00:03:26.410> it

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
right down it perfectly what makes it

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.900 
right down it perfectly what makes it
look<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:26.739> easy<00:03:27.900> perfect
