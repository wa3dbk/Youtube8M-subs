00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 let's change the subject and we want to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.069
 Mr. Chepo, we can be a couple of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.069
 questions sir chepo 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.140
 there are comments 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.630
 you know me they have not pushed me by removing 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.940
 he is the fugitive from the race 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.690
 [Music] 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.690
 Thank you 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.190
 [Music] 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.200
 I imagine that that night was annoying for 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.050
 yesterday's match should not save the 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.390
 video 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.390
 the video to analyze did it 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.420
 there are moments of attention to the press 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.720
 but also if you ask two questions there 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.510
 quick regulate the powers of 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.420
 way guys you know I can not anymore 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.549
 the moment and in its moment we will speak 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.729
 but I defend it but it's not what 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.729
 He says 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.920
 to illustrate well and he illustrated us a lot 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.080
 with your answer but also in 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.430
 nothing happens a while ago had ended 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.810
 annoyed with the party too many 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.480
 we end up annoyed or asleep with the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.270
 party ready 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:35.460
 Yes, definitely 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:37.080
 the time the problem gets angry 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.060
 annoying must be without doubt and there what 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.340
 we saw not without reason after practicing 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.040
 a lot of hearts I think what 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.230
 we do if we pay attention to him in his 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.610
 thoughtful analysis of what it faces 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.650
 Denmark because they are equal to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.420
 Jamaicans then you have to worry 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:02:04.670
 because if Jamaica got off to play 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:04.670
 just like the earth
