00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:14.629
 to observe all the people there is xenon and 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:15.980
 today we find ourselves on black ops 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.350
 for a new gameplay so this 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.900
 once we are on the same pedal n 94 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.330
 fast charge and kroos to try 1,200 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.100
 kg so I had lodestar adav and swarm 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.570
 so here we are trying to do the 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.010
 maximum score possible that at the time 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.840
 where I was trying to do the 200 geeks in 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.430
 die to two then there is my friend tease 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.010
 and that he has obviously succeeded two 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.270
 times more with 1,292 heroes that I 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.950
 invite you to go see on his channel 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.010
 it is posted a few days ago 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.720
 so if I make you this little video 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.250
 today it is to speak to you a 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.630
 little bit of call of duty ghost yes 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.040
 again except that this time I have some 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.200
 new information so before I 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.520
 I'll finish fast with this gameplay 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.870
 there is one little thing to know is who is 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.070
 a guy with us who was stung 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.680
 of the part of the shot there is a random 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.360
 four youngsters the guy ap telephony he 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.710
 also prevented me from having world and without 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.260
 that he passes that in the end he would send a 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.760
 aircraft using microstation and 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.500
 so I could not send my last 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.089
 to my last daf who would have me 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.630
 obviously given the 200 kg anyway 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.100
 I think so 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.650
 I also made some mistakes like 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.180
 to make me fuck myself an adav and a 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.770
 lot of stars I think because I have not 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.210
 I did not want to send my strict scores 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.440
 earlier and here I think that savored 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.710
 cost only 2 cents but it's not 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.570
 serious 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.820
 so if you want to talk again about 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.619
 ghost that's because I saw I could 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.650
 will hang buarque video of the multi 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.060
 today videos from youtube hours 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.920
 who were invited to the arrival the who 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.119
 could play a little bit at the game there is 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.380
 some really really 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.080
 interesting that we surely you 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.580
 interest then already the first point 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.320
 on which many people have 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.930
 deceived it is the famous nuclear in 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.250
 the package so some recalled 15th 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.850
 strike in English I do not know what 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.470
 that means 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.299
 Anyway, it's an emblem of the head of 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.380
 dead and that makes a huge explosion 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.700
 besides the explosion I find it 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.259
 beautifully honestly much more beautiful 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.470
 than the duclair where the fashion of the time 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.520
 after 5 seconds and it would be a cyst 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.740
 assault rick since apparently we 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.720
 can have that in a strategic package 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.920
 but just do not misunderstand it 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.229
 are a lot of people saying that these 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.030
 menus that these two months with the state for 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.040
 the moment it seems to be a 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.810
 industry that kills the entire opposing team 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.189
 even if we are not necessarily sure about it 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.909
 it turns out it's justin blast doing the 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.649
 half of the map 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.590
 as at that moment half of 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.710
 the opposing team was at this point that 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.540
 just exploded and kill the whole team 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.800
 in any case what we know is that the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.090
 damsel is well and truly present but 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.350
 it is not in this form that this 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.970
 will also be another district 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.800
 because there I do not know if you 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.990
 have seen but just the trailer 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.700
 multiplayer so the official trailer 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.650
 of activity we see when this 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.330
 famous little strict klm is sent that 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.130
 there is an emblem of moab but who sent 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.540
 apparently by another player with that 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.310
 could have the property of killstreak very 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.510
 devastating so the case of m who would 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.860
 a little explosion that we could see in 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.630
 some videos and that could be 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.520
 got in a package so that I'm going there 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.050
 return 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.790
 obviously the moab so to go back on 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.210
 this famous package that would give a bomb 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.400
 nuclear 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.690
 I honestly thought it was a 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.310
 good big sleeve to believe 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.230
 to the nook who will be able to have bombs 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.850
 nuclear in and package in my opinion 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.930
 it was done on purpose precisely so that 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.880
 the players who are there down 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.140
 knowing that it is for the majority of 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.430
 very good players so that never he 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.720
 could have made a mobilizer on the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.190
 others it's almost impossible 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.600
 so what I thought they had 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.240
 greatly increased the chances of having 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.890
 which strictly in a package just for 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.420
 the fair for good times and 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.190
 videos that were showing guys watching 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.020
 there I'm back and so on and so on 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.030
 while in my opinion in real life 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.650
 will be either a tiny chance or she 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.850
 will not be available in the packages and it's 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.010
 in any case what seems to me the most 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.680
 probable then second thing and who is going 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.760
 delight lovers of similar helmet on 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.840
 the videos that I could see I 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.730
 the impression that the helmet is going to be 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.110
 much more useful than on bo2 that we go 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.130
 come back a little bit a system like 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.990
 toulouse mw3 game fork a little bit of 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.850
 language we will come back a little bit a system 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.290
 like mw too you will be able to hear very 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.510
 well the footsteps of other players 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.830
 then another new information 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.110
 who just came to be and their multi that 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.310
 I finally saw multi gameplay from 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.970
 those who were able to access the game 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.560
 currently 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.150
 so for the snipe it's something 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.710
 that I think I'm great I do not know 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.930
 the twitter tricks that made 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.890
 companies will find that as well but 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.750
 I personally think that the new 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.410
 way of aiming so in fact snec this 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.030
 will be a scope 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.320
 but around you could have black 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.640
 usual we had on all call 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.690
 of duty you 'll have something a little bit 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.150
 more realistic in fact it will be 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.590
 the environment but do a whole 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.420
 way you see that when you in the 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.130
 reality when you look at a point that 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.570
 is in front of you right in front of you or 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.100
 well you see what the background 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.600
 blurred and conversely if you look at 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.070
 the background all that will be at 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.420
 foreground will be blurred ben it's like 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.520
 it 's going to happen we'll have the 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.170
 disgusting black from the blow bah just 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.580
 can watch the radar at the same time 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.960
 that scop so it could be very 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.090
 effective in snacks elsewhere 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.169
 the snape that easily puts one 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.889
 shot anyway from what we saw 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.169
 of the 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.849
 from multi to besides that it's a trick 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.629
 which annoys me a little bit a garment the 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.949
 life I have the impression that she is 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.599
 really very very low maybe even 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.569
 lower than on the w3 I saw some 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.229
 guys touching tea with vector 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.550
 frankly maybe it's because 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.779
 it's in lan i can not wait to see what it's like 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.999
 will give in laye but I hope that the 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:44.080
 life will not be that do not do it because that 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.610
 can be a big drag on 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.840
 stalemate gameplay that any us 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.919
 to kill us by putting ourselves in the ball 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.259
 in the feet already that currently 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.430
 seems because of them it was not great 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.889
 top so here I hope it will not be 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.029
 like this finally to finish I apologize if 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.169
 on this gameplay there was no sound 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:57.909
 I hope it will not be too much 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.169
 disturbed it's simply because 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:00.729
 that at the time I film them and I 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.099
 dp green paigc and a little bit of it 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.509
 did not record lesson so here is 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.800
 I hope it will not have bothered you too much 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.080
 in any case we find the sound as soon as 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.460
 tomorrow I'm sorry again that assures 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.840
 I hope this gameplay will have you more 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.129
 that this commentary you will have found 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.719
 interesting I invite you to leave a 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:14.919
 small lake if you liked the video 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:16.840
 subscribers to the channel if it's not yet 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:22.289
 done and me on this I tell you to tomorrow 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.289
 do you wear a lot more proud
