00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.780
 Hello, welcome to a new video 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.270
 teacher well remember that our 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.459
 website we have hundreds and hundreds and 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.840
 hundreds of exercises solved for 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.430
 try to get very good grades in 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.610
 physics and chemistry mathematics could 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.170
 install this reproduction of this course 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.840
 to learn formulation from this 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.870
 traces engineers 3 vice vice 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.030
 12 or 13 in so whoever has not 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.850
 hook now start with the first 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.170
 which will be more expensive then recommend you 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.820
 He has said several times that you follow the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.649
 course from the blogs blog 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.929
 test subject teacher because you 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.339
 you will ask good question because I 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:42.409
 I have some chips in one time 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.719
 we finish the topic because you have chips with 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:47.449
 exercises for you to do and 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.190
 then he also has the solutions of 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.780
 the chips to correct and if 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.969
 you have any doubt you have no problem 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.670
 Well, leave me a comment 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.429
 hey sergio that he does not know what I do not get 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.589
 we talked so then let's go 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.920
 we are working now the oxides 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.960
 Metallic traditional nomenclature 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.420
 traditional nothing that there is a rat 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.700
 also that leaves behind 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.439
 and then it 's the most complicated me 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.090
 I always insist that it is also difficult to 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.070
 traditional that is the oldest by 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.770
 true but yes the most complicated good 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.000
 We work hard and curious about 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.240
 We are going to make a small 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.070
 review we said that if the metal has 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.690
 two valences for example the iron that 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.789
 has two and three when he acts with the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.289
 small consent will have the termination and 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.740
 I do not know when he acts with the valence 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.780
 big will have unique ending ie 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.700
 that is acting with valence 2 will be 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.179
 ferrous and it is acting with valence 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.649
 3 will be fer when and this for all 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.200
 I do not want to give you a lot of metal 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.330
 with this come then the following and 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.149
 if it only has a single valence per 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.880
 example the calcium can be put 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.259
 calcium or termination in practical icod not 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.360
 it seems that I like to put more 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.000
 calcium because there are some elements by 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.740
 some metals that are very rare with 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.440
 termination in icod but well this what 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.569
 You can do as you like best and 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.520
 now we are working with partners 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.690
 you do not give much the veneer on all the 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.340
 last video 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.380
 the one that has not seen previous that sees it 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.450
 what is there 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.000
 I'm lucid, it's not the sheet with the 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.910
 simplifications is very important one 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.730
 before an oxide see if it is or is not 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.800
 simplified as we did looking 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.410
 what it was that put the oxygen to the other 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.450
 to the other element because in those of 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.550
 atomic atomic ones not at 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.190
 fingers is worth when oxygen always 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.950
 puts a two to the other in the compounds 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.840
 binaries and if you do not get it for example 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.120
 this case which means that if you're 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.099
 ok then let's wrinkle vale 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.620
 I want you to think about what is and what is not 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.379
 is simplified then this here 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.599
 is here is not simplified there is a 2 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.120
 come this other that this one is 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.190
 simplify this here is yes 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.650
 simplified there is not a 2 here this of 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.230
 here is not simplified good to be 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.180
 here some simplified and even here 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.489
 If it 's simplifying, it's very 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.340
 important is the biggest mistake that is 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.010
 commits time to formulate is this and not see 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.000
 the simplification or then now we're going 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.800
 to name them 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.610
 then we started with the criminal 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.950
 come rust 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.390
 as potassium only has valence 1 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.390
 we put potassium 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.560
 if it comes, let's follow the next one 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.830
 calcium only has valence 1 if we put 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.620
 calcium oxide that we can put 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.590
 calcium is also valid for me you know 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.990
 that tastes of calcium does not always happen 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.670
 I speak the same and write what I am 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:50.690
 house skin 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.150
 well this here the nitrogen the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.250
 nitrogen forgive me my worth the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.910
 nickel has two valences has 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.650
 valencia plus 23 is worth then if it is 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.480
 acting for the small handle with the 2 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.090
 will be and what eau and if is acting 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.500
 for the valence 3 for big will be 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.480
 nickel and ccoo with which they will be 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.010
 acting here I can not see it because 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.040
 it is simplified then that there is here 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.930
 a 2 since a 2 that we have crossed out later 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.820
 although valencia is acting with the 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.290
 Smaller appearance with the 2 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.090
 then it will be rust or that the pairs in 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.820
 this other case we see also 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.790
 Miguel and now he is acting with the 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.040
 valencia 3 because it is seen by eye because no 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.420
 is simplified then how is the 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.370
 greater will be miqueri here 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.080
 well now we have in Spanish two 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.510
 examples of tin when tin 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.060
 act with small violence will be this 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.130
 night and when he acts with the venencia 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.110
 big will be tight here we have to 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.540
 realize that he is acting with the 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.060
 valencia 2 because we have said to 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.659
 principle that if it was simplified what 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.169
 it's going to be rust 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:59.379
 frightening 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.150
 yes because the 2 is the are not the 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.249
 small to write it 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.129
 from here it's also simplified though 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:08.650
 sometimes this gives problems worth it if you're 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:10.659
 implied because here there would be a 4 then 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.289
 is acting with the big valence is 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.289
 oxide 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.010
 being here 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.440
 well you have understood and sure the 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.780
 simplification is the safe ico bear 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.810
 Well then, let's continue and 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.750
 let's do the exercises that I 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.870
 I say that I have there in the blog of 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.430
 power math teacher course for 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.670
 learn formulation in any 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:42.030
 the search engine and there I appear is already valid and 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.790
 come on, I always do an example 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.580
 and then the big bull 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.050
 that will have 14 environment removed because that 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.570
 for you will go then I am the 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.150
 solution is worth it and the same thing I will do two 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.360
 examples of problems a simpler one 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:01.790
 to heat and another more complicated to 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.790
 reinforce the planting come see you
