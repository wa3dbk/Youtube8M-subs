TV<00:04:42.230> cameras<00:04:42.680> ill<00:04:42.980> man<00:04:43.190> one<00:04:44.060> thing<00:04:44.210> is<00:04:44.240> kind<00:04:44.570> of

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
TV cameras ill man one thing is kind of

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.140 
TV cameras ill man one thing is kind of
fun<00:04:44.810> as<00:04:44.960> we<00:04:45.080> can<00:04:45.260> then<00:04:45.680> hold<00:04:46.100> this<00:04:46.370> object<00:04:46.880> into

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
fun as we can then hold this object into

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.840 
fun as we can then hold this object into
my<00:04:47.660> hand<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:48.260> so<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.890> object<00:04:49.280> now<00:04:49.370> has<00:04:49.580> almost

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
my hand and so the object now has almost

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.150 
my hand and so the object now has almost
like<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.090> physical<00:04:50.600> representation<00:04:51.590> of<00:04:52.070> this

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
like a physical representation of this

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.610 
like a physical representation of this
red<00:04:52.400> ball<00:04:52.640> and<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.360> red<00:04:53.510> ball<00:04:53.720> behaves<00:04:54.230> like<00:04:54.470> a

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
red ball and the red ball behaves like a

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.770 
red ball and the red ball behaves like a
red<00:04:54.830> ball<00:04:54.950> or<00:04:55.190> so<00:04:55.340> once<00:04:55.820> too<00:04:56.060> so<00:04:56.300> I'm<00:04:56.540> trying

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
red ball or so once too so I'm trying

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.300 
red ball or so once too so I'm trying
yang<00:04:57.050> I<00:04:57.260> can<00:04:57.440> pass<00:04:57.620> it<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:58.070> and<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.280> can

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
yang I can pass it to you and you can

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.980 
yang I can pass it to you and you can
pass<00:04:58.550> them<00:04:58.700> a<00:04:58.820> great<00:04:59.000> about<00:04:59.240> it<00:04:59.450> there<00:04:59.780> you<00:04:59.870> go

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
pass them a great about it there you go

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.040 
pass them a great about it there you go
and<00:05:00.710> then<00:05:00.890> I<00:05:01.070> can<00:05:01.280> then<00:05:01.760> touch<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.090> wall<00:05:02.450> and

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
and then I can then touch the wall and

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.380 
and then I can then touch the wall and
then<00:05:03.230> a<00:05:03.260> trance<00:05:03.620> trance<00:05:04.010> forward<00:05:04.430> up<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.300> the

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
then a trance trance forward up to the

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.880 
then a trance trance forward up to the
law<00:05:05.540> you<00:05:05.780> have<00:05:05.840> a<00:05:05.930> new<00:05:06.050> idea<00:05:06.110> what<00:05:06.560> this<00:05:06.680> might

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
law you have a new idea what this might

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.530 
law you have a new idea what this might
actually<00:05:07.040> one<00:05:07.370> day<00:05:07.550> be<00:05:07.700> useful<00:05:08.180> what<00:05:08.420> does

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
actually one day be useful what does

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.150 
actually one day be useful what does
that<00:05:08.630> not<00:05:08.720> matter<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:09.500> doesn't<00:05:09.740> really<00:05:09.920> matter

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
that not matter it doesn't really matter

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.470 
that not matter it doesn't really matter
right<00:05:10.310> now<00:05:10.490> what<00:05:10.820> we're<00:05:10.940> really<00:05:11.090> doing<00:05:11.300> is

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
right now what we're really doing is

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.800 
right now what we're really doing is
exploring<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.110> concept<00:05:12.290> and<00:05:13.060> of<00:05:14.060> a<00:05:14.300> future

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
exploring the concept and of a future

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.530 
exploring the concept and of a future
device<00:05:15.290> maybe<00:05:15.620> like<00:05:16.250> a<00:05:16.280> chandelier<00:05:16.580> like<00:05:17.330> this

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
device maybe like a chandelier like this

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.600 
device maybe like a chandelier like this
device<00:05:17.870> and<00:05:18.230> something<00:05:18.800> will<00:05:18.890> dressed<00:05:19.340> up<00:05:19.520> a

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
device and something will dressed up a

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.400 
device and something will dressed up a
little<00:05:19.640> bit<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.360> would<00:05:20.480> transform<00:05:21.050> the<00:05:21.290> entire

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
little bit it would transform the entire

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.110 
little bit it would transform the entire
room<00:05:21.890> and<00:05:22.190> center<00:05:22.400> into<00:05:22.760> an<00:05:22.880> interactive

850 people doing blue skies research
coming<00:05:29.420> up<00:05:29.630> with<00:05:29.780> ideas<00:05:29.900> which<00:05:30.470> could<00:05:30.800> be<00:05:30.980> the

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
coming up with ideas which could be the

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.000 
coming up with ideas which could be the
next<00:05:31.340> big<00:05:31.640> thing<00:05:31.670> ten<00:05:32.540> years<00:05:32.570> from<00:05:32.930> now<00:05:33.050> but

next big thing ten years from now but

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.070 
next big thing ten years from now but
the<00:05:34.100> guys<00:05:34.340> in<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:34.640> lab<00:05:34.910> aren't<00:05:35.420> always<00:05:35.750> good

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
the guys in the lab aren't always good

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.080 
the guys in the lab aren't always good
at<00:05:36.200> setting<00:05:36.470> the<00:05:36.740> ideas<00:05:37.130> to<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:37.520> people<00:05:37.940> who

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
at setting the ideas to the people who

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.710 
at setting the ideas to the people who
make<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.510> product<00:05:39.460> those<00:05:40.460> two<00:05:40.880> groups<00:05:41.480> of

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
make the product those two groups of

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.860 
make the product those two groups of
organizations<00:05:42.620> have<00:05:43.280> not<00:05:43.520> communicated

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
often see Microsoft enter on market too

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.860 
often see Microsoft enter on market too
early<00:05:51.830> or<00:05:51.860> with<00:05:52.400> something<00:05:53.360> that<00:05:53.540> doesn't

the<00:05:56.720> way<00:05:56.900> that<00:05:57.080> Apple<00:05:58.069> is<00:05:58.160> later<00:05:58.460> able<00:05:58.819> to<00:05:58.970> do

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
the way that Apple is later able to do

the way that Apple is later able to do
here's<00:06:00.710> an<00:06:00.860> idea<00:06:00.979> that<00:06:01.430> squarely<00:06:01.849> aimed<00:06:02.000> at

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
here's an idea that squarely aimed at

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.809 
here's an idea that squarely aimed at
Apple<00:06:02.720> territory<00:06:03.289> a<00:06:03.500> screen<00:06:04.190> that<00:06:04.220> can<00:06:04.520> sense

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:04.819 
Apple territory a screen that can sense

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.749 
Apple territory a screen that can sense

it would see them all at the same time
you<00:06:17.990> might<00:06:18.169> soon<00:06:18.440> see<00:06:18.680> a<00:06:18.710> test<00:06:18.979> bank<00:06:19.340> or<00:06:19.580> maybe

we can and now within the can if you

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.529 
we can and now within the can if you
will<00:06:33.199> ascend<00:06:33.650> yeah<00:06:33.889> as<00:06:34.400> it<00:06:34.580> looks<00:06:34.789> is<00:06:35.030> there's

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:35.539 
will ascend yeah as it looks is there's

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:38.890

actually<00:06:35.979> data<00:06:36.979> within<00:06:37.280> it<00:06:37.520> we<00:06:38.360> kind<00:06:38.870> of

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
actually data within it we kind of

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.899 
actually data within it we kind of
invest<00:06:39.319> in<00:06:39.590> a<00:06:39.680> number<00:06:40.220> of<00:06:40.250> areas<00:06:40.460> that<00:06:40.669> we

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909 
invest in a number of areas that we

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:42.189 
invest in a number of areas that we
think<00:06:41.150> are<00:06:41.240> going<00:06:41.360> to<00:06:41.449> be<00:06:41.569> important<00:06:41.990> to<00:06:42.110> the

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 
think are going to be important to the

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:43.990 
think are going to be important to the
future<00:06:42.380> one<00:06:42.979> would<00:06:43.159> be<00:06:43.280> the<00:06:43.400> emergence<00:06:43.909> of

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
future one would be the emergence of

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.879 
future one would be the emergence of
this<00:06:44.150> trend<00:06:44.449> of<00:06:44.630> natural<00:06:44.990> user<00:06:45.169> interface<00:06:45.680> is

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889 
this trend of natural user interface is

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:48.159 
this trend of natural user interface is
the<00:06:46.009> idea<00:06:46.340> of<00:06:46.520> starting<00:06:47.180> to<00:06:47.389> make<00:06:47.569> technology

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
the idea of starting to make technology

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.559 
the idea of starting to make technology
and<00:06:48.289> visible<00:06:48.680> we<00:06:49.460> see<00:06:49.669> that<00:06:49.819> today<00:06:50.000> and<00:06:50.389> things

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:50.569 
and visible we see that today and things

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.110 
and visible we see that today and things
like<00:06:50.750> touch<00:06:51.440> and<00:06:51.800> gesture<00:06:52.310> and<00:06:52.430> speech<00:06:52.789> and

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
like touch and gesture and speech and

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.210 
like touch and gesture and speech and
that's<00:06:53.419> going<00:06:53.509> to<00:06:53.569> go<00:06:53.690> much<00:06:53.870> further

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
that's going to go much further

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.860 
that's going to go much further
technology<00:06:55.220> is<00:06:55.280> really<00:06:55.460> going<00:06:55.699> to<00:06:55.789> become<00:06:55.909> you
