00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.330
 Cycle football 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.550
 Bold number of days behind technology day in Turkey 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.550
 Let's introduce the basic technique this time 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.990
 We appeared in cycle soccer special part 1 for cooperation 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.759
 Cause Japan has the best technology in Japan 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.759
 It Tokyo two of you the future 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.740
 Active in the world as a representative of Japan 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:41.060
 Future Tokyo team 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:43.210
 Shining a park at the 2008 World Championships has redefined the history of Japan's West 9 football world 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:48.690
 Such revolutionary children's response 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.690
 It is likely that Naoki Kinoshita and the keeper waited forward 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:00.620
 Mysterious shape like an object 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.100
 Here is a bicycle used for cycle football Let's ask about this bicycle 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.760
 Yes 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:11.360
 And first of all, the difference is that the difference is the same as in an ordinary bicycle, and it keeps turning this all the time 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.290
 Also it has become okay 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.550
 What time is that 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:22.210
 I do not hit the ball a bit when I hit the shoot with 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.210
 In such Fu 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:30.560
 This way 180 degrees 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:32.300
 It is shaped like the horn of a deer like this so that it is easy to turn that much 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.360
 I will 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:42.170
 Although it seems to be really behind 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.610
 Because I basically do this competition standing row, I use a saddle in the sense that it is used and crawling 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.620
 Is not something 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:52.290
 Why does it go behind me when I hit that shot? 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.960
 Another body weight poly sheet r so as to be able to firmly 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.230
 Because we can only do this well 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.610
 Because a lot of weight shift comes back 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.230
 Although it is a tire, it is decided that it is 26 inches by a rule at 26 inches 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.270
 It is a tubular 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:16.090
 It is different from the bicycle race and so on 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:21.610
 This lock anything in the fact that the stops to stop the foot so does not have the back of the brake 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.680
 It is very early to lose much by saying that we usually practice 2 months or 3 months 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.780
 I do not have much 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:34.060
 It feels like that. It is a dash or a stop in a very narrow coat . 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.510
 It feels like the gear ratio is very light because you have to 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.360
 I will 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.380
 so 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:47.250
 With the bicycle of the bicycle race in the state which is directly connected that the brake is not attached 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.250
 When you stop dashing, you will stop your foot and it will be in the form of a hitmal . 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.069
 And in this bicycle, the player thinks Iraq 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:00.190
 What is unique to cycle football 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:04.630
 For example, unlike mountain bikes that are road, that 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:10.210
 A glamor for asking the racket charge to make a good racket pass to hit the shoot 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:16.000
 I feel like that if it is a bat I already get used to it 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:19.240
 Boundaries of one's body gradually become like this and now it is already 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.660
 It seems like all of you are conscious 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:26.640
 Go Utteyuu also stretched come caught cold the ball softening take in this hand also been package 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.640
 That's what I expect from a trick 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:36.160
 There are not many places where you can practice cycle football in Japan 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:43.300
 Competition population has also been said that only about 200 people in the whole country 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:47.500
 However, the technology possessed by players continues to improve year after year , with Tokyo's lead going forward 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:53.170
 A game that is shaped from passes and dribbling as well as football 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.380
 However, this one recently that one player is appraised for the first time when the bicycle and the player come together 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.340
 sutter 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.340
 Let's look at the details of the technique for maneuvering the bicycle 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:09.740
 First of all, it looks like it's easy to pass , but it floats the whole silver 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:15.250
 After receiving the ball in the air &amp; ひ 跳 ね ひ 跳 ね 跳 ね 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.250
 This movement is the basic action to manipulate the ball 100 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.789
 Here is the departure while pulling the ball 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.810
 It is an indispensable technique in the game of giving a pass to friends while blocking the block 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.620
 Difficult handle of judgment of dribbling the force acceleration 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:43.500
 Speed ​​and timing are exquisitely intertwined and called zel 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:46.160
 It is more difficult than holding the ball in Zenrin finely by repeating the motion of the pass many times 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.160
 Thing 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.420
 Hmm 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:58.690
 You also need to shoot and destroy defenses 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:05:01.270
 And contrary to the ball control dribble, the basic operation of the path is greatly enlarged 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.510
 Tell the ball straight 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:09.440
 Have a ball does Ciro ride from 0.5 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:13.650
 The speedy fall-winter technology is also considerable 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:19.169
 It takes five years just to ride a bike 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:21.409
 The attraction of the competition to the two teams of the Tokyo team from now on leading the cycle football history of Japan 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:27.289
 I asked about 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:29.820
 The feeling of what is a ball game is not so much in fact , I like the bicycle again and again cycle 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:34.560
 It is a game called soccer 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:38.490
 I started this competition if there is a place called that now also leading to the now 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:43.320
 I only want to win each other, especially that 14 minutes 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:49.470
 In the short time of only 14 minutes of seven narrow in the second half before 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:56.010
 How finally the mutual trick Well either will lead to a win to put their flavor is 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:57.270
 While I 'm going to grab their points, such a place is quite so fun 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.390
 Can be attractive 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.870
 I think it is something 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:08.820
 As we started cycle football from 18 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:11.770
 At that time, it was already about a year since there were already strong players overseas. 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.310
 Listen to various places and that 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.590
 As a German player comes 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.830
 Than I wonder there is this kind of world 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:23.860
 When I do it for the first time, I tend the ball 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.310
 I can not even dribble 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.310
 that 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.870
 You are able to do one by one 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:39.770
 Toka when flew Toka shoot 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:46.910
 It's a feeling I've never tasted in my life so far This is not 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:48.240
 So I think that there is no very much everyone you Zonchi because name recognition is not high sport in Japan 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.750
 but 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.960
 By all means 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:58.190
 Now a variety of search engines are developed straight 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:01.240
 I'm trying to find cycle football at home once a little 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:06.840
 I think I want 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:12.960
 We want to let many people know this sport from now on 2 in Tokyo 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:14.420
 In fact, it is decided that the third round of the World Cup of Cycle Soccer will be held in Japan in August 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:21.070
 ing 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:21.070
 If you are interested, why not come and see a game
