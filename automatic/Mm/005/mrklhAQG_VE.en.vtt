00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that's pretty much the end of the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.270 
that's pretty much the end of the
episode<00:02:03.180> honestly<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.140> even<00:02:04.860> though<00:02:05.070> this

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
episode honestly like even though this

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.789 
episode honestly like even though this
isn't<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.759> good<00:02:06.090> anime<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:07.049> nowhere

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
isn't a good anime it's nowhere

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.800 
isn't a good anime it's nowhere
considered<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.459> good<00:02:08.670> anime<00:02:09.149> it's<00:02:09.450> still

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
considered a good anime it's still

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.540 
considered a good anime it's still
something<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.560> could<00:02:10.830> actually<00:02:11.009> sit

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
something that I could actually sit

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.320 
something that I could actually sit
through<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.000> watch<00:02:12.209> without<00:02:12.540> getting

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
through and watch without getting

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.570 
through and watch without getting
bored<00:02:13.480> out<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.720> my<00:02:14.050> mind<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.830> watching<00:02:15.490> an

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
bored out of my mind and watching an

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.490 
bored out of my mind and watching an
edgy<00:02:15.760> here<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.240> there<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.660> actually<00:02:17.080> alright

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
edgy here in there is actually alright

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.530
