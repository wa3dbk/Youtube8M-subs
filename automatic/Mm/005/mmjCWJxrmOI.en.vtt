00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.130
 once to my channel, sorry for having them 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.840
 abandoned quite a while but the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.040
 university consumes me too much and in 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.100
 vacation I had to travel to many 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.050
 sides and do not comply with much edit and 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.050
 record and separate as it already changes 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.420
 computer presents club and this one 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.280
 I had to back addicts and show and 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.750
 How can end cover is brand new 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.020
 improve the videos that you already have dictated 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.790
 and the whole issue that was put together but I'm 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.370
 back and today taking advantage 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.780
 that started the year and you say I'm going 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.220
 to make a book tag that the channel is coming 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.050
 of bad varying words of my 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.010
 little friends yusleiby i dialed them left their 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.430
 channel somewhere around here and it's called 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.410
 new year's purposes of reading I think that 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.720
 he did omar and it consists of seven questions 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.040
 that have to do with year purposes 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.490
 new to read 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.800
 so then let's start the first 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.070
 question or first the word the one 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.480
 I have to answer with little things is 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.190
 finish the studies what books you 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.250
 we need to finish that you left started in 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.890
 the 2003 good in 2013 I left started 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.740
 one is that he sent me the favor that is a 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.470
 dark feeling that he and he's just a 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.560
 rumor of the micro nor this almost finished it 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.840
 but it gave me laziness because then I 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.580
 dan flow screams and this one because in the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.890
 University consumed me and I did not finish it 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.509
 I left it there thrown by the bookseller 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.119
 then do not finish it but this year 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.509
 promises to finish them too I said 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.970
 started good I said half in 1984 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.110
 from haruki murakami but it was not because 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.240
 I was bored in fact I was very 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.270
 good but I started with the university and 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.670

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.680
 second word sentence guidance 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.630
 question in which I have to answer 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.370
 is to exercise a book that owes you 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.049

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.239

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.269
 then I start it and then I start 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.120

 they cost 230 and all three of the number of 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.930
 city ​​were 250 it seems to me when one
