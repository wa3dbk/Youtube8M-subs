will<00:04:41.230> be<00:04:41.880> range<00:04:42.880> with<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.510> hunter's<00:04:44.410> class<00:04:44.680> it's

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
will be range with a hunter's class it's

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.820 
will be range with a hunter's class it's
not<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.640> greatest<00:04:45.910> okay<00:04:49.230> so<00:04:50.230> we<00:04:50.470> can<00:04:50.650> use<00:04:50.800> that

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
not the greatest okay so we can use that

00:04:50.830 --> 00:05:00.800 
not the greatest okay so we can use that
to<00:04:51.070> go<00:04:51.310> away

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.930
