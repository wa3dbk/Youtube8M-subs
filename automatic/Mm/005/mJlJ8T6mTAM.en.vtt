the mouth of the sheath we're very safe
when<00:03:49.239> we're<00:03:49.450> addressing<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:50.140> knife<00:03:50.640> again

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
when we're addressing the knife again

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.420

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
because of that sharpened heel there at

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.340 
because of that sharpened heel there at
the<00:03:54.610> blade<00:03:54.820> what<00:03:55.090> we<00:03:55.209> want<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.570> do<00:03:55.720> is<00:03:55.989> like

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
the blade what we want to do is like

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.930 
the blade what we want to do is like
with<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.620> original<00:03:57.070> calibra<00:03:57.489> so<00:03:57.549> we<00:03:57.670> want<00:03:57.880> to

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
with the original calibra so we want to

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.880 
with the original calibra so we want to
index<00:03:58.269> this<00:03:58.570> memory<00:03:58.959> bump<00:03:59.260> here<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.680> goes

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
index this memory bump here that goes

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.220 
index this memory bump here that goes
between<00:04:00.100> our<00:04:00.670> middle<00:04:01.090> finger<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.600> our<00:04:02.049> ring

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
between our middle finger and our ring

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.470 
between our middle finger and our ring
finger<00:04:02.260> like<00:04:03.010> this<00:04:03.310> is<00:04:03.880> when<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.299> knife

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
finger like this is when the knife

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.630 
finger like this is when the knife
breaks<00:04:04.780> out<00:04:05.049> of<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.290> sheath<00:04:05.500> like<00:04:05.860> that<00:04:06.130> again

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
breaks out of the sheath like that again

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.490 
breaks out of the sheath like that again
nowhere<00:04:07.180> near<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.450> mouth<00:04:07.720> of<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:07.989> sheath<00:04:08.230> so

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
nowhere near the mouth of the sheath so

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.680 
nowhere near the mouth of the sheath so
we're<00:04:08.650> safe<00:04:08.890> with<00:04:09.100> this<00:04:09.280> hand<00:04:09.579> you'll<00:04:10.329> notice

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
we're safe with this hand you'll notice

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.759 
we're safe with this hand you'll notice
that<00:04:10.900> this<00:04:11.200> index<00:04:11.739> is<00:04:12.090> well<00:04:13.090> clear<00:04:13.540> of<00:04:13.810> this

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
that this index is well clear of this

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.770 
that this index is well clear of this
tooth<00:04:15.070> here<00:04:15.340> so<00:04:15.700> we're<00:04:15.880> totally<00:04:16.090> safe<00:04:16.510> right

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
tooth here so we're totally safe right

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.990 
tooth here so we're totally safe right
there<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.169> that<00:04:17.470> also<00:04:17.709> gets<00:04:18.100> us<00:04:18.280> very<00:04:18.639> close

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
there and that also gets us very close

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.750 
there and that also gets us very close
to<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.389> neutral

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
to the neutral

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.600 
to the neutral
balance<00:04:20.210> point<00:04:20.540> of<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.810> knife<00:04:21.250> that's<00:04:22.250> pretty

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
balance point of the knife that's pretty

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.300 
balance point of the knife that's pretty
bad<00:04:22.960> there<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.080> go<00:04:24.230> you<00:04:24.680> can<00:04:24.830> see<00:04:24.860> right<00:04:25.250> there

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
bad there you go you can see right there

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.060 
bad there you go you can see right there
we're<00:04:26.210> very<00:04:26.540> close<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.170> neutrally<00:04:27.650> balanced

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
we're very close to neutrally balanced

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.800 
we're very close to neutrally balanced
even<00:04:28.310> though<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.640> this<00:04:28.790> is<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.000> big<00:04:29.240> blade<00:04:29.450> so

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
even though that this is a big blade so

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.600 
even though that this is a big blade so
that's<00:04:30.500> how<00:04:30.620> we<00:04:30.770> want<00:04:30.890> a<00:04:31.010> sheet<00:04:31.280> than<00:04:31.460> done

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
that's how we want a sheet than done

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.240 
that's how we want a sheet than done
sheet<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:32.030> knife<00:04:32.210> for<00:04:32.450> safety<00:04:32.920> and<00:04:33.920> now<00:04:34.100> we're

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
sheet the knife for safety and now we're

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.860 
sheet the knife for safety and now we're
gonna<00:04:34.370> go<00:04:34.610> ahead<00:04:34.730> and<00:04:34.880> move<00:04:35.090> on<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.480> our<00:04:35.510> carry

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
gonna go ahead and move on to our carry

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.550 
gonna go ahead and move on to our carry
option<00:04:36.380> we<00:04:37.340> take<00:04:37.520> this<00:04:37.700> cord<00:04:38.030> here<00:04:38.440> and<00:04:39.440> we're

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
option we take this cord here and we're

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.590 
option we take this cord here and we're
gonna<00:04:39.650> pass<00:04:40.010> this<00:04:40.990> behind<00:04:41.990> our<00:04:42.230> belt<00:04:43.420> so<00:04:44.420> we

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
gonna pass this behind our belt so we

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.690 
gonna pass this behind our belt so we
have<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.780> loop<00:04:45.020> sticking<00:04:45.440> out<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:46.010> we're<00:04:46.610> gonna

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
have a loop sticking out and we're gonna

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.820 
have a loop sticking out and we're gonna
pass<00:04:47.000> it<00:04:47.210> on<00:04:47.330> this<00:04:47.630> side<00:04:47.930> of<00:04:47.960> our<00:04:48.350> belt<00:04:48.620> loop

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
pass it on this side of our belt loop

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.590 
pass it on this side of our belt loop
what's<00:04:49.130> gonna<00:04:49.310> happen<00:04:49.760> is<00:04:49.880> when<00:04:50.060> we<00:04:50.090> tug<00:04:50.450> on

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
what's gonna happen is when we tug on

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.840 
what's gonna happen is when we tug on
that<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:51.110> belt<00:04:51.410> loop<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:51.920> the<00:04:52.100> belt<00:04:52.310> that

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
that that belt loop and the belt that

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.910 
that that belt loop and the belt that
cord<00:04:53.180> snugged<00:04:53.540> up<00:04:53.720> is<00:04:53.900> gonna<00:04:54.050> provide<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.500> break

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
cord snugged up is gonna provide a break

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.800 
cord snugged up is gonna provide a break
that's<00:04:55.250> gonna<00:04:55.430> arrest<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.270> forward<00:04:56.630> momentum

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
that's gonna arrest the forward momentum

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.320 
that's gonna arrest the forward momentum
of<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.350> sheath<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.250> knifes<00:04:58.490> gonna<00:04:58.790> break

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
of the sheath and the knifes gonna break

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.850 
of the sheath and the knifes gonna break
out<00:04:59.510> of<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.750> sheath<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.230> it'll<00:05:00.410> be<00:05:00.500> deployed

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
out of the sheath and it'll be deployed

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.530 
out of the sheath and it'll be deployed
and<00:05:01.100> ready<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.340> go<00:05:01.550> so<00:05:01.760> we<00:05:01.970> got<00:05:02.120> this<00:05:02.300> loop

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
and ready to go so we got this loop

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.050 
and ready to go so we got this loop
right<00:05:02.780> here<00:05:02.830> and<00:05:03.830> go<00:05:03.950> ahead<00:05:04.070> and<00:05:04.370> pass<00:05:04.820> our
