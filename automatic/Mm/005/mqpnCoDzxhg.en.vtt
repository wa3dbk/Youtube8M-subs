hey guys welcome to another video of Ark
survival<00:00:11.130> evolved<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.330> today<00:00:12.480> there<00:00:12.809> was<00:00:12.900> a

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
survival evolved just today there was a

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.500 
survival evolved just today there was a
new<00:00:13.139> dinosaur<00:00:13.680> released<00:00:14.100> I<00:00:14.430> don't<00:00:15.360> know<00:00:15.420> if

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510 
new dinosaur released I don't know if

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.000 
new dinosaur released I don't know if
I'd<00:00:15.600> call<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.900> dinosaur<00:00:16.380> more<00:00:16.590> like<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.770> giant

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
I'd call it a dinosaur more like a giant

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.570 
I'd call it a dinosaur more like a giant
pest<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.730> called<00:00:17.939> the<00:00:18.090> Titan<00:00:18.840> o'meara

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
pest it's called the Titan o'meara

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.740 
pest it's called the Titan o'meara
titanum<00:00:20.580> Irma<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.000> really<00:00:21.330> don't<00:00:21.510> know<00:00:21.540> how<00:00:21.660> to

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
titanum Irma I really don't know how to

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.170 
titanum Irma I really don't know how to
say<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.110> it's<00:00:22.740> got<00:00:22.860> a<00:00:22.890> why<00:00:23.099> a<00:00:23.130> couple<00:00:23.640> m's<00:00:23.820> I

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
say that it's got a why a couple m's I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.710 
say that it's got a why a couple m's I
it's<00:00:24.900> very<00:00:25.320> confusing<00:00:25.610> so<00:00:26.610> the<00:00:26.730> Titan<00:00:27.060> no<00:00:27.180> Mira

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
it's very confusing so the Titan no Mira

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.480 
it's very confusing so the Titan no Mira
it's<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.230> giant<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.830> they'll<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.100> found<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
it's a giant and they'll be found a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.340 
it's a giant and they'll be found a
future<00:00:29.760> update<00:00:29.940> of<00:00:30.240> Ark<00:00:30.420> survival<00:00:30.750> evolved

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
future update of Ark survival evolved

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.200 
future update of Ark survival evolved
and<00:00:31.830> besides<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.460> Game<00:00:32.669> behavior<00:00:33.180> I

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and besides it's in Game behavior I

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.820 
and besides it's in Game behavior I
really<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.720> find<00:00:33.930> shit<00:00:34.199> on<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> only

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
really can find shit on this the only

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.229 
really can find shit on this the only
thing<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.040> found<00:00:35.190> while<00:00:35.370> researching<00:00:35.400> it<00:00:36.030> was

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
thing I found while researching it was

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.030 
thing I found while researching it was
that<00:00:36.540> they<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.900> a<00:00:36.930> fucking<00:00:37.350> wiki<00:00:37.650> just<00:00:37.920> for

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that they have a fucking wiki just for

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.710 
that they have a fucking wiki just for
ants<00:00:38.400> called<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> a.m<00:00:39.000> wiki<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.449> might<00:00:39.570> want

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
ants called the a.m wiki you might want

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.660 
ants called the a.m wiki you might want
to<00:00:39.780> check<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.080> out<00:00:40.140> yeah<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.100> no<00:00:41.220> history<00:00:41.580> on

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
to check that out yeah so no history on

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.130 
to check that out yeah so no history on
this<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.150> jump<00:00:42.330> straight<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.750> 10-game

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
this we will jump straight to a 10-game

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.479 
this we will jump straight to a 10-game
behavior<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> game<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.339> be<00:00:44.400> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
behavior and the game is going to be the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.430 
behavior and the game is going to be the
size<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.970> dog<00:00:45.300> which<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.809> huge<00:00:46.170> stretch

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
size of a dog which is a huge stretch

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.719 
size of a dog which is a huge stretch
considering<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.129> website<00:00:47.400> a<00:00:47.430> fountain

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:47.729 
considering the website a fountain

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:48.890 
considering the website a fountain
claimed<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.239> only<00:00:48.420> about<00:00:48.600> six

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
claimed it was only about six

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.539 
claimed it was only about six
centimeters<00:00:49.409> long<00:00:49.650> at<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.949> largest<00:00:50.400> and

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:50.549 
centimeters long at the largest and

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.250 
centimeters long at the largest and
that's<00:00:50.729> a<00:00:50.850> pretty<00:00:50.970> small<00:00:51.269> ass<00:00:51.449> dog<00:00:51.690> if<00:00:51.960> it's

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
that's a pretty small ass dog if it's

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
that's a pretty small ass dog if it's
six<00:00:52.409> centimeters<00:00:52.949> long<00:00:53.129> saying<00:00:53.729> I<00:00:53.879> guess<00:00:54.089> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
six centimeters long saying I guess it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.180 
six centimeters long saying I guess it
would<00:00:54.360> kind<00:00:55.080> of<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.260> stupid<00:00:55.739> if<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.129> were

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
would kind of be stupid if they were

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.369 
would kind of be stupid if they were
realistic<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.000> size<00:00:57.239> because<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:57.989> you'd<00:00:58.170> go

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
realistic in size because then you'd go

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.479 
realistic in size because then you'd go
from<00:00:58.559> fighting<00:00:58.769> a<00:00:58.949> building<00:00:59.280> size

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
from fighting a building size

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.820 
from fighting a building size
brontosaurus<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.540> a<00:01:00.570> puny<00:01:00.869> little<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.290> then

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
brontosaurus to a puny little and then

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.229 
brontosaurus to a puny little and then
again<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.250> can't<00:01:02.489> really<00:01:02.640> underestimate

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
again you can't really underestimate

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.060 
again you can't really underestimate
these<00:01:03.360> things<00:01:03.690> because<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.500> attack<00:01:04.769> one

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
these things because if you attack one

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.289 
these things because if you attack one
they're<00:01:05.339> gonna<00:01:05.430> alert<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.970> their<00:01:06.150> buddies

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
they're gonna alert all their buddies

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.240 
they're gonna alert all their buddies
and<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:07.080> you're<00:01:07.530> gonna<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:07.860> fucked<00:01:08.159> by

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and then you're gonna get fucked by

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.149 
and then you're gonna get fucked by
about<00:01:08.520> 60<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:10.140> once<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> mess<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.890> there

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
about 60 so not once the mess one there

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.219 
about 60 so not once the mess one there
are<00:01:11.220> herbivores<00:01:11.729> though<00:01:12.000> don't<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.479> scared<00:01:12.840> so

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
are herbivores though don't be scared so

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.899 
are herbivores though don't be scared so
they<00:01:13.320> won't<00:01:13.409> attack<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.950> unless<00:01:14.219> you<00:01:14.579> attack

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
they won't attack you unless you attack

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.399 
they won't attack you unless you attack

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
will be two or three types there will

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.639 
will be two or three types there will
definitely<00:01:23.789> be<00:01:24.149> these<00:01:24.450> small<00:01:24.869> fast<00:01:25.200> drone

definitely be these small fast drone

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.770 
definitely be these small fast drone
versions<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:26.460> these<00:01:26.789> slower<00:01:27.149> flying

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
versions and then these slower flying

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.069 
versions and then these slower flying
soldiers<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:29.219> third<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.850> though<00:01:30.149> it<00:01:30.509> may<00:01:31.020> be

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
soldiers the third one though it may be

soldiers the third one though it may be
a<00:01:31.259> queen<00:01:31.619> may<00:01:31.859> not<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> Dozier<00:01:32.729> otter<00:01:33.060> has

a queen may not be the Dozier otter has

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.859 
a queen may not be the Dozier otter has
yet<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.320> encounter<00:01:34.500> such<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> variant<00:01:36.060> so
