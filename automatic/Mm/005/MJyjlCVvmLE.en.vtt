00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.359
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.609
 new video 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.250
 Today we are already at the season 2 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.620
 and today I would touch you 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.460
 imagine the sensor and what to do with it 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.230
 can do everything by African is one 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.909
 I have touch sensor here 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.199
 front already brought in why the 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:45.170
 Of course I will give you smartphones 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.449
 still the same but show on this touch 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.699
 window so out front here 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.370
 a cruiser fashion is that and in the 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.170
 In the middle of a platform the new rod 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.190
 touch because it is really easy 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.859
 Press it pressed in to express 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.100
 really really pure then have 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.130
 We have a page twice here 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.410
 gray parts of knowledge stand behind 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.539
 the connection for the cable is show 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.240
 me again and below, of course 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:18.770
 twice for such black things here 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.610
 and a rod shot well we have 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.800
 Now , once the bags are solier and 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.110
 once the katz countries become the two 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.300
 I now then at this robotic 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.599
 and then I will show you what you are 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:37.069
 to do everything with it 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:39.530
 I 'm doing this at the side so that 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.599
 twice a touch sensor and then 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.429
 Let's go the software and then 

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:45.429
 shows if you can do it 

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:53.179
 well we in the software I already have 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.069
 times two examples taken once the 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.160
 Wait block and once a switch 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.140
 blog because I was right at the yellow 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.950
 area we have here again 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.459
 a blog in this blog 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.009
 I do in the hotel here we have two 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.140
 measure and compare at each 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.660
 only measure the condition so once 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.160
 no condition measure so in the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.780
 there are conditions once 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.420
 omitted pressed and pushed and 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.430
 when comparing you can stop the lasso 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:38.930
 come out and then it will be 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:44.870
 compare that was once the block for 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.730
 block here we have a blog there 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.230
 I am not really so 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.230
 actually make video 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.889
 in the fomc for each block and then you can 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.579
 Here we choose to compare or compare 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:04.519
 make the end too strong that we are here now 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.349
 For example, a typical example of countries going 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.689
 that he should wait so long that one 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.349
 that touch are there we will 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:18.079
 use it as well and once 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:19.579
 Compare then only then so man 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.650
 should not be pressed for the same minor 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.889
 will then make young men now 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.780
 is then pressed to the switches 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.659
 which also something bigger 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.940
 long video make beat for the whole 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.769
 wait for operations probably to 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.129
 every single blog also has a video 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.349
 do 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.449
 But now catch your hands 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:42.949
 ever selected a wait blog on 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:46.459
 the port 1 2 port 1 touch 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:48.019
 show compare to stand to stand 12 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.099
 we wish that we move to and that 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.099
 he does that 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:14.770
 the relatively simple program of course 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:18.770
 can you put on the now much is 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:29.140
 have also a motorblock occupation 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:32.060
 or so very slowly in five 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.330
 I'll do you a really good landing 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:42.160
 probably already with a turn around 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:47.150
 can do both systems to program 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:50.510
 once on our stone and then say 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.980
 we'll see you again exactly how 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.710
 I already have on our program 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:59.840
 I have chosen two here 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.820
 touch sensors once the one I 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.850
 I would now be allowed to place one 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.700
 namely this connected and then 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:13.190
 Let's start the program 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:15.980
 project and now we can see that 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.890
 you work on the display and on 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.900
 the green leds in the stone 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.850
 the program is running but we have 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.710
 said he should wait until we 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:35.300
 press these touch countries 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:38.270
 I 'll do that once and the once 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.930
 do and then it's already done yes 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.850
 That was the first to touch sensor now 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:48.740
 We want to do that because we are one 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:51.949
 obstacles have that the returns on the other hand 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.789
 and immediately there so the state is not 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.120
 program player 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:06:00.470
 then goes on and on and it hurts! 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.349
 living here with the touch sensor 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.440
 and more is printed and that then the 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.580
 tv three stops that is relatively easy 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.530
 But I am how to do that 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:14.060
 Programming programs exactly does one 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.270
 that's just what we do 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.970
 which tells me the end on the way exactly 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.720
 we'll do it half a time 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:27.800
 turn of the 5th 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:30.229
 we do not need it 110 either 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.139
 hence ten do in the cynical 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:34.520
 more quickly 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:38.030
 good, so solidified 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.470
 then he goes and he just drives the 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.930
 I've just done wrong learns so 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.729
 long until he recognizes an obstacle 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.090
 we can do it a bit faster 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:51.500
 do 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:55.449
 50 and when he experiences and drives 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:58.759
 and then he waits until we get to that 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:02.780
 touch sensors with the others on 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:12.560
 port 2 not good 12 the front is 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:18.319
 to push an obstacle and then just 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:21.590
 how long that will be fine then we have here 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:24.009
 who he can turn our project out again 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:28.490
 you now see battle then programmatically 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:30.500
 We see again the one developed 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:34.569
 I'll press this button and 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.569
 then he drives so far abuts it 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:40.560
 and schwupps jo of course stopped 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.380
 After stopping him, stop him again 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:47.840
 let go so - 50 I want two 

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:50.670
 turn around I guess that would be that 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:54.480
 that's actually relatively simple 

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:57.300
 where later you can use it then 

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.370
 think about you if now think that 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.890
 the only thing was about the touch or 

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:04.080
 not so we have now so far 

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:06.390
 first the engine block and now the 

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.310
 tact sensor blog or the 

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.080
 data block to the waiting blog will also 

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.730
 another great video comment you already 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.080
 told 

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:16.490
 of course it will be with the whole 

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.490
 states with in the car
