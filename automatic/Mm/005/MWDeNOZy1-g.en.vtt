haircut and then going through her
layers<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:28.060> trim<00:02:28.269> those<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.630> well<00:02:29.370> now<00:02:30.370> we<00:02:30.430> move

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
layers to trim those as well now we move

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.270 
layers to trim those as well now we move
on<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.269> blow-dry<00:02:31.480> we<00:02:32.260> begin<00:02:32.620> by<00:02:32.829> using<00:02:33.010> a

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
on to the blow-dry we begin by using a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.130

we then start to power dry the hair and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.789 
we then start to power dry the hair and
using<00:02:39.880> our<00:02:40.000> fingers<00:02:40.390> working<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.109> roots<00:02:41.319> we

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
using our fingers working the roots we

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.370 
using our fingers working the roots we
want<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.069> get<00:02:42.160> as<00:02:42.280> much<00:02:42.489> volume<00:02:42.790> as<00:02:43.060> possible

want to get as much volume as possible

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.780 
want to get as much volume as possible
then<00:02:44.380> we'll<00:02:44.709> go<00:02:44.859> through<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.280> section<00:02:45.730> by

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
then we'll go through it section by

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.330 
then we'll go through it section by
section<00:02:46.090> using<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.930> round<00:02:47.140> brush<00:02:47.230> again<00:02:48.130> our

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
section using a round brush again our

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.340 
section using a round brush again our
focus<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.970> roots<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.450> get<00:02:49.600> as<00:02:49.690> much<00:02:49.959> volume

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
focus is the roots to get as much volume

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.770 
focus is the roots to get as much volume
as<00:02:50.680> possible<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:51.970> when<00:02:52.209> we<00:02:52.389> add<00:02:52.569> the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
as possible so that when we add the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.360 
as possible so that when we add the
extensions<00:02:53.380> they<00:02:53.620> won't<00:02:53.799> look<00:02:53.980> long

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
extensions they won't look long

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.490 
extensions they won't look long
in<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.390> case<00:02:56.690> we<00:02:56.959> decided<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.379> go<00:02:57.470> with

root area focusing most of the teasing

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.500 
root area focusing most of the teasing
in<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.959> middle<00:03:51.940> then<00:03:52.940> you're<00:03:53.239> going<00:03:53.329> to<00:03:53.420> take

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
in the middle then you're going to take

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.990 
in the middle then you're going to take
each<00:03:53.750> extension<00:03:54.200> apply<00:03:55.129> the<00:03:55.190> center<00:03:55.730> clip

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
each extension apply the center clip

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.910 
each extension apply the center clip
first<00:03:56.269> in<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.690> middle<00:03:56.989> then<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.530> outside

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
first in the middle then the outside

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.420 
first in the middle then the outside
ones<00:03:59.200> repeat<00:04:00.200> this<00:04:00.319> process<00:04:00.590> until<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.310> get

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
ones repeat this process until you get
