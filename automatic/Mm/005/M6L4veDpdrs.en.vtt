00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730 

let's<00:00:00.299> take<00:00:00.539> a<00:00:00.570> minute<00:00:00.780> and<00:00:00.989> talk<00:00:01.079> about<00:00:01.530> my

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
let's take a minute and talk about my

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.590 
let's take a minute and talk about my
overall<00:00:02.250> thoughts<00:00:02.490> on<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.909> baby<00:00:03.090> bullet<00:00:03.449> I

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
overall thoughts on the baby bullet I

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.050 
overall thoughts on the baby bullet I
like<00:00:04.140> that<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.589> base<00:00:04.830> here<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.339> smaller<00:00:05.790> than

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
like that the base here is smaller than

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.089 
like that the base here is smaller than
the<00:00:06.210> average<00:00:06.600> blender<00:00:07.080> base<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.649> it's<00:00:07.770> easier

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
the average blender base so it's easier

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.370 
the average blender base so it's easier
to<00:00:08.250> store<00:00:08.490> in<00:00:08.610> our<00:00:08.730> cabinets<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:10.050> like<00:00:10.260> that

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
to store in our cabinets and I like that

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.080 
to store in our cabinets and I like that
they're<00:00:10.559> interchangeable<00:00:10.889> top<00:00:11.519> so<00:00:11.730> i<00:00:11.790> can<00:00:11.940> use

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
they're interchangeable top so i can use

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.480 
they're interchangeable top so i can use
the<00:00:12.240> smaller<00:00:12.540> cups<00:00:12.870> if<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.230> want<00:00:13.440> something<00:00:13.679> for

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the smaller cups if I want something for

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.620 
the smaller cups if I want something for
on-the-go<00:00:14.730> or<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> little<00:00:15.360> bit<00:00:15.480> smaller

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
on-the-go or a little bit smaller

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.180 
on-the-go or a little bit smaller
quantity<00:00:16.170> or<00:00:16.289> can<00:00:16.440> use<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.710> larger<00:00:17.039> batch

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
quantity or can use the larger batch

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.580 
quantity or can use the larger batch
bowl<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.699> make<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:18.060> larger<00:00:18.630> quantity<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.140> food<00:00:19.320> I

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
bowl to make a larger quantity of food I

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.740 
bowl to make a larger quantity of food I
really<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.730> silicone<00:00:21.240> container

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
really like the silicone container

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.800 
really like the silicone container
because<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:23.310> makes<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.180> much<00:00:24.240> easier<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.779> my

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
because it makes it so much easier in my

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.189 
because it makes it so much easier in my
opinion<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:26.029> freeze<00:00:27.029> your<00:00:27.060> food<00:00:27.390> pop<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.080> out

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
opinion to freeze your food pop it out

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.070 
opinion to freeze your food pop it out
put<00:00:28.740> those<00:00:28.949> frozen<00:00:29.310> sections<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.449> food<00:00:30.689> into<00:00:31.050> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
put those frozen sections of food into a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.979 
put those frozen sections of food into a
freezer<00:00:31.679> bag<00:00:31.910> then<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.239> reuse<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
freezer bag then you can reuse that and

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.540 
freezer bag then you can reuse that and
make<00:00:34.079> more<00:00:34.230> food<00:00:34.469> stock<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.520> that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
make more food stock up on it so that

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.630 
make more food stock up on it so that
you're<00:00:35.730> prepared<00:00:36.059> for<00:00:36.469> weeks<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.800> food<00:00:38.280> for

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640

you're prepared for weeks of food for
your<00:00:38.760> child<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.440> these<00:00:40.620> little

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
containers with the dial dates are

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.440 
containers with the dial dates are
innovative<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.559> would<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.820> handy<00:00:45.239> for

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.390

instead<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.420> having<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.710> tray<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
instead of having to do one tray and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.179 
instead of having to do one tray and
then<00:01:05.729> another<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:07.110> purchase<00:01:07.470> extra

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
their site so that's something that I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
baby bullet I think that it's something
you<00:01:36.270> could<00:01:36.420> use<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.900> make<00:01:37.049> baby<00:01:37.650> food<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.159> your

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you could use to make baby food for your

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.819 
you could use to make baby food for your
infant<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.090> then<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> stage<00:01:40.380> we're<00:01:40.650> at

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
infant and then like the stage we're at

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.740 
infant and then like the stage we're at
with<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> toddler<00:01:41.520> &amp;<00:01:41.729> preschooler<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.570> can

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
with the toddler &amp; preschooler I can

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.389 
with the toddler &amp; preschooler I can
make<00:01:42.930> smoothies<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:44.430> make<00:01:44.670> em<00:01:45.149> frozen<00:01:46.140> pots

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
make smoothies I can make em frozen pots

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.560 
make smoothies I can make em frozen pots
you<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.579> try<00:01:47.880> all<00:01:48.060> sorts<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.420> different

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you can try all sorts of different

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.230 
you can try all sorts of different
things<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> pancakes<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.180> think

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
things like the pancakes and so I think

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.819 
things like the pancakes and so I think
it's<00:01:51.509> something<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:52.020> could<00:01:52.200> grow<00:01:52.439> with<00:01:52.649> your

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
it's something that could grow with your

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.310 
it's something that could grow with your
family

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
family

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.190 
family
and<00:01:53.560> be<00:01:53.740> useful<00:01:54.159> for<00:01:54.190> more<00:01:54.640> than<00:01:54.790> just<00:01:55.200> baby

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
and be useful for more than just baby

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.590 
and be useful for more than just baby
food<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:56.890> overall<00:01:57.190> I<00:01:57.460> think<00:01:57.550> that<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.390> baby

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
food so overall I think that the baby

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.500 
food so overall I think that the baby
bullet<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.290> good<00:01:59.800> value<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.610> would<00:02:01.390> be

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
bullet is a good value and would be

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.790 
bullet is a good value and would be
something<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:01.870> you<00:02:02.050> could<00:02:02.170> use<00:02:02.410> for<00:02:02.680> your

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
something that you could use for your

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.700 
something that you could use for your
family<00:02:03.100> for<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.310> long<00:02:03.430> time
