00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.430
 island and very large skin 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.159

 Microsoft is here because they're better 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.930

 They were gay gays but it's worth 2 cars 2 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.330

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.099

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.440

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.080

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.920
