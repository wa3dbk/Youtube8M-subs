evening<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:10.260> last<00:00:10.550> 164<00:00:11.550> programs<00:00:12.000> I've

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
evening in the last 164 programs I've

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.459 
evening in the last 164 programs I've
been<00:00:12.360> trying<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.660> tell<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.110> little<00:00:13.320> about

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
been trying to tell you a little about

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.279 
been trying to tell you a little about
that<00:00:13.860> thread<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.700> life<00:00:14.759> which<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.630> scientists

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
that thread of life which we scientists

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.630 
that thread of life which we scientists
call<00:00:16.680> DNA<00:00:17.400> or<00:00:18.119> deoxyribose<00:00:19.160> nucleic<00:00:20.160> acid

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
call DNA or deoxyribose nucleic acid

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.950 
call DNA or deoxyribose nucleic acid
altogether<00:00:22.310> deoxyribose<00:00:23.310> nucleic<00:00:23.939> acid<00:00:24.570> good

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
altogether deoxyribose nucleic acid good

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.609 
altogether deoxyribose nucleic acid good
now<00:00:25.590> DNA<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.550> genetic<00:00:26.789> unit<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
now DNA is the genetic unit that is a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.859 
now DNA is the genetic unit that is a
kind<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.010> code<00:00:29.340> which<00:00:29.760> controls<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.480> way<00:00:30.630> in

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
kind of code which controls the way in

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.170 
kind of code which controls the way in
which<00:00:31.019> each<00:00:31.260> individual<00:00:32.070> cell<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.610> formed

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
which each individual cell is formed

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.910 
which each individual cell is formed
it's<00:00:33.660> rather<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.020> having<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.500> lot<00:00:34.800> of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
it's rather like having a lot of

it's rather like having a lot of
building<00:00:35.430> sites<00:00:35.730> linked<00:00:36.270> together<00:00:36.450> by<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.840> vast

which we scientists call PC Harris we
have<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.570> found<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.870> way<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.260> altering<00:00:46.469> this

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
have now found a way of altering this

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.420 
have now found a way of altering this
DNA<00:00:47.550> molecule<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.329> real<00:00:48.780> life<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
DNA molecule in real life we can as it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.479 
DNA molecule in real life we can as it
were<00:00:50.610> take<00:00:51.090> DNA<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.930> turn<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.440> upside<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:52.920> or

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
were take DNA and turn it upside down or

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.150 
were take DNA and turn it upside down or
to<00:00:54.000> put<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.180> another<00:00:54.329> way<00:00:54.600> upside<00:00:55.350> down<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.890> can

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
to put it another way upside down it can

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.110 
to put it another way upside down it can
we<00:00:56.399> turn<00:00:56.640> take<00:00:57.000> DNA<00:00:58.070> this<00:00:59.070> means<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.789> we

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
we turn take DNA this means that we

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.660 
we turn take DNA this means that we
scientists<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.140> change<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.829> genetic

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
scientists can now change this genetic

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.320 
scientists can now change this genetic
template<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.539> life<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.189> alter<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.299> shape

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
template of life and so alter the shape

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.090 
template of life and so alter the shape
of<00:01:06.840> life<00:01:07.470> itself<00:01:11.900> thank<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.020> obviously<00:01:13.799> this

of life itself thank you obviously this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.800 
of life itself thank you obviously this
is<00:01:14.369> important<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> field<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.479> germ

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
is important in the field of germ

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.020 
is important in the field of germ
warfare<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:17.430> produce<00:01:17.640> an
