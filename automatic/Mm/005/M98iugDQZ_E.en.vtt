00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.250 

one<00:00:00.210> of<00:00:00.269> the<00:00:00.359> things<00:00:00.539> that<00:00:00.810> theaters<00:00:01.140> have

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.260 
one of the things that theaters have

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.039 
one of the things that theaters have
been<00:00:01.350> doing<00:00:01.560> for<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.740> long<00:00:01.800> time<00:00:02.190> is<00:00:03.049> promoting

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
been doing for a long time is promoting

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.670 
been doing for a long time is promoting
a<00:00:04.080> new<00:00:04.140> aspect<00:00:04.470> ratio<00:00:05.250> so<00:00:06.120> all<00:00:06.720> TV's<00:00:07.170> they<00:00:07.529> are

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
a new aspect ratio so all TV's they are

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.680 
a new aspect ratio so all TV's they are
primarily<00:00:08.099> sixteen<00:00:08.610> by<00:00:08.760> nine<00:00:08.790> for<00:00:09.389> LCD

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
primarily sixteen by nine for LCD

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.070 
primarily sixteen by nine for LCD
technology<00:00:09.960> like<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.860> like<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:12.080> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
technology like that like this and the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.289 
technology like that like this and the
problem<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.650> get<00:00:13.740> black<00:00:14.009> bars<00:00:14.280> here<00:00:14.790> and

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
problem is you get black bars here and

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.420 
problem is you get black bars here and
here<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:16.379> don't<00:00:16.500> get<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.859> see<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.130> entire

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
here so you don't get to see the entire

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.820 
here so you don't get to see the entire
movie<00:00:17.880> when<00:00:18.720> it's<00:00:18.869> shown<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.619> see<00:00:19.740> it

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
movie when it's shown we get to see it

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.040 
movie when it's shown we get to see it
in<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> clown<00:00:20.220> formula<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.600> instead<00:00:21.990> of

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
in the clown formula so instead of

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.130 
in the clown formula so instead of
sixteen<00:00:22.920> by<00:00:23.070> nine<00:00:23.100> there's<00:00:23.609> another<00:00:24.140> standard

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
sixteen by nine there's another standard

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.390 
sixteen by nine there's another standard
that<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.410> theaters<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.890> already<00:00:26.130> adopted

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
that the theaters have already adopted

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.580 
that the theaters have already adopted
which<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.539> 21<00:00:27.869> by<00:00:28.170> now

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
which is 21 by now

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.279 
which is 21 by now
which<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> wider<00:00:29.609> format<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.840> benefit<00:00:31.260> of

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
which is a wider format the benefit of

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.020 
which is a wider format the benefit of
this<00:00:31.470> wider<00:00:31.679> format<00:00:32.219> though<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
this wider format though is you get to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.720 
this wider format though is you get to
see<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.480> entire<00:00:33.570> movie<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.489> see

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
see the entire movie and you get to see

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.479 
see the entire movie and you get to see
it<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.000> its<00:00:36.120> full<00:00:36.270> format<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.100> when<00:00:38.399> you

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it in its full format and so when you

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.190 
it in its full format and so when you
see<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.850> its<00:00:38.910> full<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.210> format<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.989> cool

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
see it in its full of format the cool

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.510 
see it in its full of format the cool
thing<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.920> actually<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.399> high

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
thing is it's actually in high

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.080 
thing is it's actually in high
resolution<00:00:41.879> as<00:00:42.300> well<00:00:42.379> so<00:00:43.379> instead<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.969> 1920<00:00:44.969> by

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
resolution as well so instead of 1920 by

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.500 
resolution as well so instead of 1920 by
1080<00:00:45.539> at<00:00:45.870> 2560<00:00:46.770> by<00:00:46.920> 7<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.239> better

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
1080 at 2560 by 7 so it's a better

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.040 
1080 at 2560 by 7 so it's a better
picture

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
picture

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.840 
picture
you<00:00:49.200> get<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.469> see<00:00:49.680> more<00:00:50.010> image<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.489> get<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.700> see

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
you get to see more image you get to see

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.540 
you get to see more image you get to see
the<00:00:50.969> cleaner<00:00:51.390> crisper<00:00:51.570> picture<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.829> it's

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the cleaner crisper picture and it's

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.100 
the cleaner crisper picture and it's
also<00:00:53.789> easier<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.570> eyes<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:54.960> your

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
also easier on your eyes because your

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.840 
also easier on your eyes because your
eyes<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.320> wider<00:00:55.829> than<00:00:55.980> they<00:00:56.160> are<00:00:56.190> tall<00:00:56.309> so

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
eyes are wider than they are tall so

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.209 
eyes are wider than they are tall so
they<00:00:56.969> want<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.300> see<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> wider<00:00:57.780> screen<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:59.010> if

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
they want to see a wider screen so if

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.119 
they want to see a wider screen so if
you<00:00:59.309> look<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.120> almost<00:01:00.449> 30<00:01:01.140> 40<00:01:01.500> %<00:01:01.829> wider

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
you look at this is almost 30 40 % wider

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.130 
you look at this is almost 30 40 % wider
than<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> 16<00:01:02.910> by<00:01:03.149> 9<00:01:03.650> TV<00:01:04.650> set<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.900> we're<00:01:06.900> able<00:01:06.990> to

same times of watching TV so if we do

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.070 
same times of watching TV so if we do
that<00:02:32.950> one<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.970> cool<00:02:34.150> things<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.750> we<00:02:34.930> can

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
that one of the cool things is we can

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.070 
that one of the cool things is we can
bring<00:02:35.290> up<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.590> side<00:02:35.830> application<00:02:36.790> here<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.300> we

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
bring up a side application here and we

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.990 
bring up a side application here and we
could<00:02:38.260> run<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.830> internet<00:02:39.220> experience<00:02:39.580> in<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
could run the internet experience in the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.060 
could run the internet experience in the
side<00:02:40.180> application<00:02:40.900> while<00:02:41.620> someone's

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
side application while someone's

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.009 
side application while someone's
watching<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.610> standard<00:02:42.850> maybe<00:02:43.390> sixteen<00:02:43.840> by

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
watching a standard maybe sixteen by

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:51.570 
watching a standard maybe sixteen by
nine<00:02:44.050> projects<00:02:48.480> over<00:02:49.480> time<00:02:49.720> we<00:02:49.900> were<00:02:50.580> right

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
nine projects over time we were right

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.610 
nine projects over time we were right
now<00:02:51.700> we<00:02:51.760> still<00:02:52.120> have<00:02:52.300> our<00:02:52.510> via<00:02:52.840> experience

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
now we still have our via experience

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.009 
now we still have our via experience
which<00:02:53.769> is<00:02:53.920> still<00:02:54.160> not<00:02:54.459> using<00:02:54.970> with<00:02:55.090> us<00:02:55.360> which

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
which is still not using with us which

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.210 
which is still not using with us which
is<00:02:56.140> what<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.470> have<00:02:56.680> over<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.130> hundred

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
is what you have over a hundred

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.280 
is what you have over a hundred
applications<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:58.750> we<00:02:58.900> could<00:02:59.079> run

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
applications that we could run

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.870 
applications that we could run
simultaneously<00:02:59.680> to<00:03:00.310> sixteen<00:03:00.700> by<00:03:00.850> nine

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
simultaneously to sixteen by nine

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.289 
simultaneously to sixteen by nine
broadcast<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.459> benefit<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.820> that<00:03:03.910> again

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
broadcast so the benefit of that again

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.690 
broadcast so the benefit of that again
is<00:03:04.480> we're<00:03:04.720> using<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.079> entire<00:03:05.380> real<00:03:05.709> estate<00:03:06.100> to

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
is we're using the entire real estate to

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.960 
is we're using the entire real estate to
do<00:03:06.850> both<00:03:07.060> television<00:03:08.019> watching<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.970> giving

calling<00:04:20.440> retina<00:04:20.889> displays<00:04:21.280> today<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.510> so<00:04:22.840> we

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
calling retina displays today and so we

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.719 
calling retina displays today and so we
could<00:04:23.229> do<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.440> in<00:04:23.560> larger<00:04:23.860> size<00:04:24.070> or<00:04:24.340> smaller

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
could do that in larger size or smaller

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.450 
could do that in larger size or smaller
sizes<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.570> really<00:04:25.870> get<00:04:26.080> for<00:04:27.010> small<00:04:27.190> sizes

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
sizes to really get for small sizes

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.790 
sizes to really get for small sizes
great<00:04:27.820> for<00:04:28.000> reading<00:04:28.150> text<00:04:28.630> of<00:04:28.780> course<00:04:29.020> but<00:04:29.650> for

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
great for reading text of course but for

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.890 
great for reading text of course but for
larger<00:04:30.100> sizes<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.580> get<00:04:30.700> into<00:04:30.850> 71<00:04:31.389> hidden<00:04:31.750> real

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
larger sizes you get into 71 hidden real

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.740 
larger sizes you get into 71 hidden real
large<00:04:32.110> displays<00:04:32.610> you<00:04:33.610> want<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:33.910> see<00:04:34.090> that

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750
