the idea is to quantify what it is you

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
what we do is based in our very

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.500 
what we do is based in our very
upbringing<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.560> genes<00:00:28.890> which<00:00:29.699> play<00:00:30.119> into

deep-seated and very difficult to change

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.380 
deep-seated and very difficult to change
by<00:00:38.390> analyzing<00:00:39.390> what<00:00:39.930> we're<00:00:40.140> doing<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
by analyzing what we're doing and

by analyzing what we're doing and
helping<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:43.020> change<00:00:44.420> disruptive<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.660> and

negative behaviors potentially we can

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.450 
negative behaviors potentially we can
change<00:00:49.079> how<00:00:49.559> people<00:00:50.520> perform<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:52.280> make<00:00:53.280> them

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
change how people perform and make them

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700

feel better live longer and have

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.330 
feel better live longer and have

healthier lives awareness of the threat

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.599 
healthier lives awareness of the threat
is<00:01:00.170> tantamount<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> avoiding<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.430> you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
is tantamount to avoiding it if you

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.160 
is tantamount to avoiding it if you
don't<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> train<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.629> coming<00:01:03.690> down<00:01:04.019> the

tracks you can't get out of the way and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.590 
tracks you can't get out of the way and
go<00:01:06.930> key<00:01:07.140> amounts<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.670> awareness<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.299> you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
go key amounts to the awareness that you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.440 
go key amounts to the awareness that you
need<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.080> order<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.380> improve<00:01:10.680> your<00:01:10.740> life

need in order to improve your life
oftentimes<00:01:12.450> as<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.869> physician<00:01:13.409> you're<00:01:13.979> there

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
oftentimes as a physician you're there

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.170 
oftentimes as a physician you're there
after<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> problems<00:01:15.659> already<00:01:15.930> occurring<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
after the problems already occurring and

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.030 
after the problems already occurring and
particularly<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.450> what<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> did<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.799> very

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
particularly for what I did it was very

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.130 
particularly for what I did it was very
dissing<00:01:20.430> heartening<00:01:20.790> when<00:01:21.030> someone<00:01:21.600> came<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
dissing heartening when someone came and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.530 
dissing heartening when someone came and
needed<00:01:22.500> an<00:01:22.590> operation<00:01:22.950> after<00:01:23.909> spending<00:01:24.150> 20

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
needed an operation after spending 20

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.870 
needed an operation after spending 20
years<00:01:24.619> misbehaving<00:01:25.619> smoking<00:01:26.159> drinking<00:01:26.369> doing

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
years misbehaving smoking drinking doing

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.170 
years misbehaving smoking drinking doing
whatever<00:01:27.740> what<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.890> believe<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:29.970> we

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
whatever what I believe is that if we

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.300 
whatever what I believe is that if we
can<00:01:30.390> work<00:01:30.930> together<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.009> potentially

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
can work together we can potentially

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.300 
can work together we can potentially
change<00:01:33.020> disruptive<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.259> negative<00:01:34.799> behaviors

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
change disruptive and negative behaviors

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.810 
change disruptive and negative behaviors
and<00:01:36.049> hopefully<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.500> people<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:38.100> follow<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and hopefully get people to follow the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.969 
and hopefully get people to follow the
right<00:01:39.030> path<00:01:39.270> getting<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> data<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.650> not

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
right path getting the data is not

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.580 
right path getting the data is not
really<00:01:41.340> an<00:01:41.430> issue<00:01:41.689> what<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.409> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
really an issue what to do with it is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.010 
really an issue what to do with it is
really<00:01:44.250> nation

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
really nation

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.740 
really nation
and<00:01:45.430> what<00:01:46.430> goki<00:01:47.060> has<00:01:47.090> attempted<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.110> do<00:01:48.259> is<00:01:48.560> to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
and what goki has attempted to do is to

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.300 
and what goki has attempted to do is to
use<00:01:51.040> set<00:01:52.040> principles<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:52.939> use<00:01:54.310> interactions

use set principles and use interactions

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.810

and<00:01:55.610> behavioral<00:01:56.420> modification<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.920> hopefully

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
and behavioral modification to hopefully

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.490 
and behavioral modification to hopefully
take<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.360> data<00:01:59.539> and<00:02:01.149> intervene<00:02:02.149> with<00:02:03.080> it<00:02:03.289> and

take the data and intervene with it and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.789 
take the data and intervene with it and
help<00:02:04.220> people<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.670> help<00:02:05.360> themselves<00:02:05.619> more<00:02:06.619> than

a<00:02:12.140> critical<00:02:12.530> part<00:02:12.739> of<00:02:12.800> that<00:02:12.980> it's<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.739> idea

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
a critical part of that it's the idea

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.800 
a critical part of that it's the idea
that<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.220> can<00:02:17.200> change<00:02:18.200> how<00:02:18.950> someone<00:02:19.400> behaves

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
that you can change how someone behaves

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.970 
that you can change how someone behaves
by<00:02:20.950> intervening<00:02:21.950> on<00:02:22.280> different<00:02:22.640> levels<00:02:22.970> and

by intervening on different levels and

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.130 
by intervening on different levels and
also<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.430> idea<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.819> if<00:02:26.209> they're<00:02:26.420> aware<00:02:26.780> of

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
also the idea that if they're aware of

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.840 
also the idea that if they're aware of
what<00:02:27.410> they're<00:02:27.560> doing<00:02:27.890> they're<00:02:28.220> not<00:02:28.400> likely<00:02:28.640> to
