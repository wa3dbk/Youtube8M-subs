 Already at the IAA in Frankfurt, Audi has the title of living one 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.680
 electric sports car study unveiled in Detroit was also presented 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.170
 an electric sports car reveals how the name e-tron carries up but 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.690
 in the name he has nothing to do with the vet showcar is with a 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.800
 Length of just under four meters, it is much shorter and always prompt 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.510
 Harburg has also become 200 and 50 kilograms lighter on the PORTICA TV 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.690
 great value first choice 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.740
 Str our report 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.370
 the electrification of the future to give an emotional face 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.620
 what about the audit of the Frankfurt 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.840
 and that we have since I'm firmly convinced even with the showcar he's in 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.630
 Detroit made it 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.070
 and so we just always save ten Alek Wek in the business 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.190
 even if there is still a long way to go 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.140
 We are aware that superstition technology also needs a nice one 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.120
 Upholstery old 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.080
 also the driving performance of the study impressive two electric motors 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.190
 bring it together to 204 hp from the stand is in five municipalities seconds the 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.840
 100 kmh mark achieved despite 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.490
 The Swedes usually Torgau Technik have the developers 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.040
 such an athlete created 1000 and 350 kilograms though the batteries 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.079
 alone 400 kilos on the scales bring in the end the question 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.819
 when this e-tron in series experience, walk at Audi 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.030
 Do not go to a museum but find your way to the dealers 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.260
 the hit rate of Joe Kaeser to the series is relatively high with us that is 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.110
 right 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.220
 but we are in no hurry 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.410
 PrÃ¶ll we work off the program piece by piece 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.070
 small as well as out of place were battery technology 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.480
 These batteries are still in their infancy in the coming years 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.330
 but much easier and forget to forget piech cheaper 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.460
 but also anticipation is always the best pleasure
