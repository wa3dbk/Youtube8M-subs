00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:26.390
 so in general, hello to all today I will show 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.770
 how to change pads on the basin 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:36.500
 what will come of it actually collecting 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:40.970
 summer donkrats need clamp pliers 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:49.809
 key to remove the wheels but also actually 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:01:11.360
 start pads need to be set to drive 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:01:14.740
 the car is like its not up to the end 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.100
 it is better not to lift but to immediately pop the bolts 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.100
 on the wheel 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.240
 under think 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.890
 key to the end 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.120
 In general, the pad recommends changing if 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.850
 they are not directly inhibitory 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.710
 part here is this pad 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.959
 not up when it reaches less 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.010
 four millimeters recommended 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.090
 replace pads 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.150
 here I have as we see even more 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.520
 less there is a millimeter 2 3 you can on 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.040
 one left here it is generally already reached 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.900
 to iron that is, it is clear that 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.209
 there is no lining between the pad itself and 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.790
 brake disc that is already on the gland 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.060
 rubs 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.390
 so actually it's time to change 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.390
 coupon 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.239
 so we need first 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:16.010
 We shoot here such here type something interesting 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.010
 such locking clips 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:31.690
 Now that's necessary to remove the fingers 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:31.690
 for dirt I have a little vodka site therefore 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:41.870
 I recommend to use vedeshkoy I 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.420
 The actual exposure is over and new 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:04:01.040
 For some reason, I forgot to buy a little 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:04:03.830
 it turned out and there is still 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.980
 crimping elements pads very 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.980
 jumping shoot carefully 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:23.919
 until the end you can pull them out 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:27.039
 now need for such clips a little 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.970
 pressed down here this caliper here 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:34.840
 went back 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:39.509
 brake here so it happens here 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.370
 same here 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.949
 drawn here these pads that's how you 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:51.419
 see almost completely erased 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:51.419
 here 01 somewhere millimeter lining left 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.430
 but there is something else but less 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:05.740
 four millimeters recommended 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:10.539
 therefore also need to be replaced here 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:13.750
 set as above 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:16.620
 Here that is, here is the way lining 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.620
 brake disc 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:25.780
 need a little more to press but my 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:31.560
 a thicker pad for such a 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:33.830
 in the same way the second so 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.010
 sold out 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:44.720
 and put a new shoe on the main ones too 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:06:03.860
 drive everything now shove go away 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:06:07.940
 fingers back so you need to crank 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:12.250
 so that this is the hairpin 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:15.250
 here it is climbed here it is kampeche 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.250
 holes 

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:23.679
 will be this way here principle exactly 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.679
 also 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:56.430
 here is more comfortable here is quickly left 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:56.430
 the object here goes the area mode there 

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:29.039
 that's all, in principle, all thanks to all 

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:33.019
 view subscribe to the channel put 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:33.019
