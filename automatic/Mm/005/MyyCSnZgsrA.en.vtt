00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.130
 they have come up with a prototype airplane a diesel engine a motor 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.280
 simply car 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.220
 said high school was fully created I open the theophilic engine 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.220
 nata christian paul 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.900
 the gestures are simple 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.510
 master how to imagine that between driving these cars and driving 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.069
 of these questions there is the same engine 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:31.549
 a turbodiesel engine anne istres 5 which develops 70 horses 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.140
 many had dreamed him 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.650
 he did it it's the smallest dedicated b alone 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.540
 compressed turbo over the market 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.940
 well we know him well we have a good experience of this engine he is reliable 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.730
 to avoid extra costs 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.980
 mistresses to make as few changes as possible 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.420
 a little adaptation between the lists and the engine there is there a stop of the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.640
 heart to court 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.090
 the toothed belt something good the latest technology 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.730
 the modern day dp that passionates the most at the cost of 800 years in little 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.630
 width 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.670
 and which are very reliable result the plane of more than 350 kilos 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.420
 engine understood more is thrifty 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.950
 25 francs the price of their tickets zeal against 150 francs minimum for others 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.960
 fuels 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.530
 the man who managed this feat by using recovered materials 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.159
 to give it's aerodynamics is naval architect 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.610
 if a design completes the one that has been done then you have to take into account 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.910
 the power 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.460
 power is central and then that construction difficulties that 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.900
 are all in the construction 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.900
 are you happy with your baby 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.510
 because it happened to me at the end 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.190
 so yes the most requested cantons 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.560
 tax revenues 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.909
 achieve to fly what places with an industrial engine built in 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.700
 series he holds in Paris 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.240
 in the united states nasa is funding research to develop 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.520
 diesel motor 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.590
 that would work on kerosene 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.880
 enthusiast amateur ratings 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.520
 a year of advanced
