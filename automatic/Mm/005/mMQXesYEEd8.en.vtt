nine different sectors and that is

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.090 
nine different sectors and that is
definitely<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.750> shake<00:01:03.930> up<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> GC<00:01:04.589> for

very<00:01:21.869> interesting<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.560> only<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:23.009> individual

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
very interesting is only one individual

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.550 
very interesting is only one individual
TT<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.600> year<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.990> that's<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
TT this year and that's on the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.320 
TT this year and that's on the
penultimate<00:01:25.860> stage<00:01:26.369> before<00:01:26.640> they<00:01:26.850> hit<00:01:26.939> Paris

penultimate stage before they hit Paris

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.719 
penultimate stage before they hit Paris
over<00:01:27.840> 53<00:01:28.380> kilometers<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.280> think<00:01:29.640> we're

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
over 53 kilometers so I think we're

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.280 
over 53 kilometers so I think we're
going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> lot<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.299> action<00:01:30.720> prior<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
going to see a lot of action prior to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.020 
going to see a lot of action prior to
that<00:01:31.409> stage<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:31.979> quite<00:01:32.220> clearly<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.850> going

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
that stage but quite clearly it's going

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.730 
that stage but quite clearly it's going
to<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.150> absolutely<00:01:33.240> crucial<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.020> difficult

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
to be absolutely crucial and difficult

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.289
