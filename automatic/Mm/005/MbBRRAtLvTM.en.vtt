hello everybody welcome to another
bucket<00:00:03.090> tutorial<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.320> this<00:00:04.410> tutorial<00:00:04.470> we're

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
bucket tutorial and this tutorial we're

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.340 
bucket tutorial and this tutorial we're
gonna<00:00:05.310> be<00:00:05.460> putting<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.970> makers<00:00:06.240> on<00:00:06.360> maps<00:00:06.600> so

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
gonna be putting the makers on maps so

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.890 
gonna be putting the makers on maps so
to<00:00:07.410> start<00:00:07.920> the<00:00:08.129> tutorial<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.879> we're<00:00:09.480> going<00:00:09.719> to

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
to start the tutorial we we're going to

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.009 
to start the tutorial we we're going to
define<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.379> people<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.009> boost<00:00:11.249> out<00:00:11.549> cell<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.629> I've

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
define a people a boost out cell so I've

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.329 
define a people a boost out cell so I've
got<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.530> map<00:00:13.740> function<00:00:14.160> which

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:14.339 
got this on map function which

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.020 
got this on map function which
implements<00:00:14.999> the<00:00:15.030> map<00:00:15.329> initialize<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:17.550> map

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
implements the map initialize and so map

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.720 
implements the map initialize and so map
u<00:00:18.270> equals<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.960> don't<00:00:19.170> get<00:00:19.320> back<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:20.040> if<00:00:20.490> you

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
u equals you don't get back it if you

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.820 
u equals you don't get back it if you
haven't<00:00:21.060> seen<00:00:21.240> my<00:00:21.270> first<00:00:21.390> tutorial<00:00:21.830> that

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
haven't seen my first tutorial that

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.280 
haven't seen my first tutorial that
there's<00:00:23.190> a<00:00:23.250> link<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.550> description<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.420> will

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.290 
there's a link in description and will

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.380 
there's a link in description and will
show<00:00:25.470> basic<00:00:25.890> text<00:00:26.220> rendering<00:00:26.370> on<00:00:26.700> this<00:00:26.850> map<00:00:27.060> so

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
show basic text rendering on this map so

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:37.819 
show basic text rendering on this map so
we<00:00:27.780> need<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.230> remove<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.680> gunk<00:00:28.830> vendors<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:36.829> we

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
we need to remove the gunk vendors so we

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.919 
we need to remove the gunk vendors so we
need<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> wilkinson<00:00:42.089> portlets<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.749> mouse

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
need to so wilkinson portlets and mouse

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.739 
need to so wilkinson portlets and mouse
X<00:00:43.230> hours<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.309> then<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.030> need<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.449> it<00:00:45.629> is

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:45.749 
X hours so then what we need to do it is

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.610 
X hours so then what we need to do it is
enemy<00:00:46.739> printer<00:00:47.280> Oh<00:00:47.929> remove<00:00:48.929> all<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.319> render

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
enemy printer Oh remove all the render

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.469 
enemy printer Oh remove all the render
it<00:00:49.739> now<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.370> need<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.909> our<00:00:51.089> custom

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
it now we need to have our custom

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:52.969 
it now we need to have our custom
renderer<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.140> we're<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.440> call<00:00:52.710> art

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979 
renderer so we're going call art

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.590 
renderer so we're going call art
renderer<00:00:53.249> a<00:00:55.039> new<00:00:56.039> renderer<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:57.179> will<00:00:57.449> make

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
renderer a new renderer which will make

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.629 
renderer a new renderer which will make
in<00:00:57.749> a<00:00:57.870> second<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.829> render<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.159> tall<00:00:59.429> face

00:00:59.629 --> 00:00:59.639 
in a second we can render a tall face

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:02.509 
in a second we can render a tall face
because<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.329> simple<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.379> strong<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.399> we

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
because it's simple and it strong so we

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:03.979 
because it's simple and it strong so we
need<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> create<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.179> class<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.690> could

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
need to create the class and this could

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.840 
need to create the class and this could
implement<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.890> map<00:01:05.430> renderer<00:01:05.899> us<00:01:07.850> Phoenicia

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
implement the map renderer us Phoenicia

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.160 
implement the map renderer us Phoenicia
and<00:01:09.740> we<00:01:10.740> custom<00:01:11.130> rename<00:01:11.579> some<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.000> these

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
and we custom rename some of these

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.840 
and we custom rename some of these
variables<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:18.530> okay<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.340> wanna<00:01:20.579> do<00:01:20.789> is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
variables so okay so what we wanna do is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.850 
variables so okay so what we wanna do is
will<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.420> an<00:01:21.570> image<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.960> minute<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.829> I

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
will not get an image a minute so I

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.179 
will not get an image a minute so I
found<00:01:23.219> this<00:01:23.369> 100<00:01:23.789> by<00:01:23.969> 100<00:01:24.240> image<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.860> troll

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
found this 100 by 100 image of a troll

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.920 
found this 100 by 100 image of a troll
face<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.729> I'll<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.000> copy<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.329> link<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
face and I'll just copy that link to the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.800 
face and I'll just copy that link to the
clipboard<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:29.119> basically<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.270> map<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.659> about

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
clipboard and basically a map is about

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.069 
clipboard and basically a map is about
150<00:01:31.740> pixels<00:01:31.979> wide<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:33.119> not<00:01:33.390> sure<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.810> deafen

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
150 pixels wide I'm not sure to deafen

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.069 
150 pixels wide I'm not sure to deafen
ever<00:01:34.200> most<00:01:34.469> see<00:01:34.649> any<00:01:34.770> minute<00:01:35.039> and<00:01:35.549> but<00:01:36.210> we

ever most see any minute and but we
found<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.590> start

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
found the start

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.770 
found the start
draw<00:01:38.430> image<00:01:39.170> then<00:01:40.170> we'll<00:01:40.350> T<00:01:40.500> 25<00:01:41.119> 25<00:01:42.119> which'll

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
draw image then we'll T 25 25 which'll

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.810 
draw image then we'll T 25 25 which'll
means<00:01:42.960> they'll<00:01:43.200> leave<00:01:43.409> 25<00:01:43.950> faithfulness<00:01:44.579> like

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
means they'll leave 25 faithfulness like

that with them so what we'll do is we'll
finish<00:02:24.300> okay<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:34.300> here<00:02:34.600> we<00:02:34.690> are

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.990

okay<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.470> probably<00:02:51.980> racket<00:02:52.340> two<00:02:52.520> maps<00:02:52.760> are

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
okay so I probably racket two maps are

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.860 
okay so I probably racket two maps are
probably<00:02:53.560> 128<00:02:54.560> 128<00:02:55.490> given<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.060> fact<00:02:56.330> that's

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
probably 128 128 given the fact that's

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.130 
probably 128 128 given the fact that's
on<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.200> answer<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:59.030> know<00:02:59.180> now<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.450> map<00:02:59.870> site

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:13.270 
I'll show you that they probably are up
to<00:03:03.410> half<00:03:03.770> 20<00:03:04.220> years<00:03:04.430> oh<00:03:11.530> by<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.560> way<00:03:12.710> you<00:03:12.830> cop

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
to half 20 years oh by the way you cop

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.230 
to half 20 years oh by the way you cop
you<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:14.810> tell<00:03:15.110> me<00:03:15.260> sister<00:03:15.770> eyes<00:03:17.230> eat<00:03:18.880> it<00:03:19.880> can

you to tell me sister eyes eat it can

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.630 
you to tell me sister eyes eat it can
crash<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:21.260> think<00:03:21.470> it's<00:03:21.980> probably<00:03:22.220> because<00:03:22.370> I've

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
crash I think it's probably because I've

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:43.240 
crash I think it's probably because I've
got<00:03:22.820> so<00:03:23.120> much<00:03:23.300> testing<00:03:26.350> close<00:03:27.350> out<00:03:27.560> that

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.290 

so<00:03:43.820> then<00:03:44.150> when<00:03:44.420> we<00:03:44.450> create<00:03:44.900> any<00:03:45.020> map
