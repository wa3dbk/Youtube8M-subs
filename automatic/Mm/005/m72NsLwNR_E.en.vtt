00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
cancers on his face that we needed to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.799 
cancers on his face that we needed to
remove<00:00:31.790> so<00:00:32.790> we're<00:00:33.090> doing<00:00:33.360> photodynamic

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
remove so we're doing photodynamic

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.540 
remove so we're doing photodynamic

therapy on him to treat all these
precancerous<00:00:36.270> lesions<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.680> hopefully

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
precancerous lesions to hopefully

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.890 
precancerous lesions to hopefully
prevent<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.760> need<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:38.970> any<00:00:39.240> more<00:00:39.420> surgical

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
prevent the need for any more surgical

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.430 
prevent the need for any more surgical
excision<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.620> future<00:00:41.130> skin<00:00:41.400> cancers<00:00:42.440> right

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
excision of future skin cancers right

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.410 
excision of future skin cancers right

now the amino level avec acids that

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.170 
now the amino level avec acids that
Danielle<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.930> applying<00:00:46.460> we<00:00:47.460> put<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.910> this

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
Danielle is applying we put it on this

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.069 
Danielle is applying we put it on this
is<00:00:48.240> a<00:00:48.330> naturally<00:00:48.810> occurring

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
is a naturally occurring

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.260 
is a naturally occurring
acid<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.040> your<00:00:50.130> body<00:00:50.310> that<00:00:50.790> is<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> much

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
acid that is in your body that is a much

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.569 
acid that is in your body that is a much
higher<00:00:51.480> concentration<00:00:51.890> we<00:00:52.890> put<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.310> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
higher concentration we put it on and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.479 
higher concentration we put it on and
leave<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.000> about<00:00:54.240> three<00:00:54.420> hours<00:00:54.750> and

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
leave it on for about three hours and

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.860 
leave it on for about three hours and
then<00:00:56.489> we're<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:56.790> to<00:00:56.850> put<00:00:57.030> him<00:00:57.210> under<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.510> red

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
then we're going to put him under a red

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.750 
then we're going to put him under a red
light<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.100> red<00:00:59.250> light<00:00:59.310> will

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
light and the red light will

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.569 
light and the red light will
photoactivatable<00:01:00.829> idiotic<00:01:01.829> acid<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
photoactivatable idiotic acid and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.240 
photoactivatable idiotic acid and
actually<00:01:03.239> kill<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.660> cells<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.259> it<00:01:04.409> has<00:01:04.619> been

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
actually kill the cells that it has been

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.609 
actually kill the cells that it has been
absorbed<00:01:05.579> into<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.780> cool<00:01:07.020> thing<00:01:07.229> about<00:01:07.350> this

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
absorbed into the cool thing about this

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.010 
absorbed into the cool thing about this
is<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> abnormal<00:01:08.880> cells<00:01:09.020> actually

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
is that the abnormal cells actually

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.270 
is that the abnormal cells actually
absorb<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> chemical<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> higher

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
absorb the chemical at a higher

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.700 
absorb the chemical at a higher
concentration<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> those<00:01:12.870> are<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> ones<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
concentration so those are the ones the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.320 
concentration so those are the ones the
precancerous<00:01:14.070> cells<00:01:14.580> are<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.940> ones<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.150> get

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
precancerous cells are the ones that get

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.240 
precancerous cells are the ones that get
targeted<00:01:15.600> by<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> light<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.500> get<00:01:16.979> cooked

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
targeted by the light and get cooked

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.580 
targeted by the light and get cooked
basically<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:18.690> he's<00:01:18.870> done<00:01:19.080> he'll<00:01:19.440> look

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
basically so when he's done he'll look

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.399 
basically so when he's done he'll look
like<00:01:19.799> he<00:01:19.950> had<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> pretty<00:01:20.370> good<00:01:20.490> sunburn<00:01:21.409> he

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
like he had a pretty good sunburn he

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.260 
like he had a pretty good sunburn he
needs<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> stay<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> Sun<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.880> even

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
needs to stay out of the Sun and even

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.270 
needs to stay out of the Sun and even
from<00:01:24.479> away<00:01:24.840> from<00:01:25.020> windows<00:01:25.229> for<00:01:25.710> 48<00:01:26.100> hours

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
from away from windows for 48 hours

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.570 
from away from windows for 48 hours
afterwards<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:27.900> he's<00:01:28.049> done<00:01:28.260> so<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
afterwards and then he's done so this is

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.610 
afterwards and then he's done so this is
this<00:01:29.940> procedure<00:01:30.360> basically<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:31.170> done<00:01:31.409> in

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
this procedure basically is done in

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.280 
this procedure basically is done in
place<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.360> some<00:01:33.360> creams<00:01:33.690> that<00:01:33.930> are<00:01:34.110> called

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
place of some creams that are called

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.600 
place of some creams that are called
Kara<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.950> Fe<00:01:35.220> Dex

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
Kara or Fe Dex

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.880 
Kara or Fe Dex
which<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.600> 5-fluorouracil<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.830> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
which is 5-fluorouracil it's a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.980 
which is 5-fluorouracil it's a
chemotherapy<00:01:38.220> drug<00:01:38.790> that's<00:01:38.940> used<00:01:39.180> for<00:01:39.360> colon

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
chemotherapy drug that's used for colon

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.620 
chemotherapy drug that's used for colon
cancers<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.710> things<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.240> in<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.330> cream

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
cancers and things like that in a cream

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.660 
cancers and things like that in a cream
so<00:01:43.020> instead<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.409> doing<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.310> put<00:01:44.520> this

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
so instead of doing that we can put this

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.289 
so instead of doing that we can put this
non<00:01:45.540> chemotherapy<00:01:46.229> drug<00:01:46.440> on<00:01:46.650> their<00:01:46.770> face<00:01:47.299> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
non chemotherapy drug on their face and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.030 
non chemotherapy drug on their face and
treat<00:01:48.840> them<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.290> they<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.890> put

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
treat them so they don't have to be put
