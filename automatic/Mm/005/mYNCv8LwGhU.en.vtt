00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.020 
it upside down for that and then I'll
see<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.649> second<00:00:43.920> when<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.040> come<00:00:44.250> back<00:00:44.280> up<00:00:44.579> so

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
see in a second when I come back up so

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.690 
see in a second when I come back up so
all<00:00:48.030> over<00:00:48.860> underneath<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.070> layers<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
all over underneath the layers at the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.250 
all over underneath the layers at the
roots<00:00:53.719> already<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.870> making<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.230> difference

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
roots already it's making a difference

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.400 
roots already it's making a difference
but<00:00:55.829> then<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.460> get<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> extra<00:00:56.879> effect<00:00:57.410> can

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
but then to get the extra effect can

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.529 
but then to get the extra effect can
take<00:00:58.620> your<00:00:58.770> hair<00:00:59.100> dryer<00:00:59.340> put<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.760> on<00:00:59.850> high<00:01:00.180> heat

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
take your hair dryer put it on high heat

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.619 
take your hair dryer put it on high heat
and<00:01:00.780> blast<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.770> again<00:01:02.309> hair<00:01:02.910> upside<00:01:03.059> down<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
and blast it again hair upside down and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:14.420 
and blast it again hair upside down and
just<00:01:03.690> smash<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.569 

don't<00:01:15.430> need<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.640> do<00:01:15.759> it<00:01:15.850> for<00:01:15.969> long<00:01:16.710> done<00:01:17.710> no<00:01:18.070> you

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
don't need to do it for long done no you

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.249 
don't need to do it for long done no you
don't<00:01:18.729> need<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.880> do<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.149> for<00:01:19.270> long<00:01:19.450> but<00:01:20.020> it

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
don't need to do it for long but it

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.179 
don't need to do it for long but it
really<00:01:20.920> helps<00:01:21.219> that<00:01:21.340> sea<00:01:21.520> salt<00:01:21.789> spray<00:01:21.909> to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
really helps that sea salt spray to

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.340 
really helps that sea salt spray to
create<00:01:24.189> some<00:01:24.399> texture<00:01:24.929> already<00:01:25.929> looks<00:01:26.140> like

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
create some texture already looks like

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.490 
create some texture already looks like
more<00:01:27.009> interesting<00:01:27.700> then<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.869> final<00:01:29.049> trick<00:01:29.380> is

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
more interesting then the final trick is

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.139 
more interesting then the final trick is
a<00:01:29.530> little<00:01:29.740> bit<00:01:29.829> of<00:01:29.890> magic<00:01:30.100> dust<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:30.850> what<00:01:31.060> this

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
a little bit of magic dust so what this

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.059 
a little bit of magic dust so what this
is<00:01:31.299> is<00:01:31.360> like<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.630> wet<00:01:31.869> powder<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.470> lot<00:01:32.679> of<00:01:32.770> stylist

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
is is like a wet powder a lot of stylist

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.429 
is is like a wet powder a lot of stylist
use<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:34.360> can<00:01:34.509> go<00:01:34.659> straight<00:01:34.960> onto<00:01:35.170> the

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
use it you can go straight onto the

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.080 
use it you can go straight onto the
scalp<00:01:35.770> I<00:01:35.920> would<00:01:36.100> never<00:01:36.310> put<00:01:36.399> it<00:01:36.640> directly<00:01:36.880> on

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
scalp I would never put it directly on

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.499 
scalp I would never put it directly on
my<00:01:37.390> hairline<00:01:37.840> hide<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.740> underneath<00:01:39.009> and<00:01:39.579> you

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
my hairline hide it underneath and you

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.760 
my hairline hide it underneath and you
just<00:01:40.659> tap<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:40.929> little<00:01:41.259> bit<00:01:41.350> of<00:01:41.439> the<00:01:41.530> powder

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
just tap a little bit of the powder

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:50.279 
just tap a little bit of the powder
along<00:01:42.069> there<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:44.610> again<00:01:45.610> upside<00:01:46.209> down<00:01:49.289> you

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
along there and again upside down you

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.050 
along there and again upside down you
can<00:01:50.439> also<00:01:50.619> if<00:01:51.130> that's<00:01:51.399> a<00:01:51.490> bit<00:01:51.610> scary<00:01:51.939> because

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
can also if that's a bit scary because

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.609 
can also if that's a bit scary because
it<00:01:52.299> can<00:01:52.509> build<00:01:52.720> up<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.049> then<00:01:53.140> it's<00:01:53.259> a<00:01:53.319> bit<00:01:53.470> hard

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
it can build up and then it's a bit hard

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.889 
it can build up and then it's a bit hard
to<00:01:53.679> go<00:01:53.860> back<00:01:53.890> from<00:01:54.399> just<00:01:55.179> put<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.450> little<00:01:55.509> bit

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
to go back from just put a little bit

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:04.550 
to go back from just put a little bit
into<00:01:56.409> your<00:01:56.560> hand<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.209> then<00:01:58.840> just

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.210 

really<00:02:05.560> getting<00:02:05.829> there<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.280> muss<00:02:06.459> it<00:02:06.670> up<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
really getting there and muss it up and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.229 
really getting there and muss it up and
then<00:02:12.340> again<00:02:12.579> you<00:02:12.700> can<00:02:12.849> just<00:02:13.000> spray<00:02:13.920> throughout

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
then again you can just spray throughout

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.880 
then again you can just spray throughout
and<00:02:16.239> this<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.810> great<00:02:17.019> trick<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.349> learnt<00:02:17.560> which

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
and this is great trick I learnt which

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.720 
and this is great trick I learnt which
is<00:02:18.299> to<00:02:19.299> get<00:02:19.510> bits<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.810> hair<00:02:20.019> twister<00:02:21.010> like

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
is to get bits of the hair twister like

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.990 
is to get bits of the hair twister like
this<00:02:22.000> well<00:02:22.829> and<00:02:23.829> then<00:02:24.130> just<00:02:24.340> tase<00:02:24.639> a<00:02:24.670> little
