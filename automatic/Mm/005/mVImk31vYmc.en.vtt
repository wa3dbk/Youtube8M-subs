00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.290
 we love to see 1000 ps 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.469
 here at the fair in milan 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.269
 already at the booth of the company serco 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.400
 next to me is the berner works berger 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.039
 bernhard is an importer for schenker in 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.080
 Austria already to the box is already one 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.300
 very nice sign year 2015 that gives 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.460
 it for it at the sub-sector for novelties 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.429
 but what has they got like that? 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.009
 models changed the models they have 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.550
 actually needed completely changed 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.190
 We have now assumed again 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.120
 the plastic parts around it prevents from 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.329
 The technology is the new outbreak 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.480
 winning pot 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.440
 and because the engine tuning practicals 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.239
 engines we have now indeed elsewhere in the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.710
 quality house in the next few years 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.500
 There is a lot of improvement anyway 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.550
 now in which variants 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.320
 Huberter variants have 125 for the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.850
 Teenagers though 50 21 and 300 like 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.590
 follows we have already talked about it 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:17.100
 around the 2300 it makes sense that we are there 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.920
 it was even clear it was once for 300 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:26.720
 mark chances because the 241 only 272 and 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.860
 300 were real 300 and it is real 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.450
 presentable 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.760
 for hilton driver knows we have 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.780
 talked about it 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:44.510
 the topic is preparation 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.610
 injection there is something new 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.390
 is it something electronic? 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:54.320
 Injection electronic injection 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.990
 issued 25 28 and 300 200 are there 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.899
 alarm and probably only one 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.509
 a bit later and the trial is too 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.330
 been in preparation 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.490
 Why was not really that only now 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.810
 rash over the precursors really 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.750
 very very good and never touch a running 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.310
 system 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.780
 We wish you a lot of fun on the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.780
 Mass and said for the interview
