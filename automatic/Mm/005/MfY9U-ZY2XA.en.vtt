00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.090
 to avoid friends from handheld computing and 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.460
 I bring a new revised for you 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.680
 and also from packaging what is 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.990
 this case survivors a case very 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.119
 popular for what is the ipad the new 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.570
 ipad and the second generation ipad and 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.730
 It is a case anti anti k dayz te 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.679
 It protects a lot very much what is your 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.539
 iPad and it's perfect if you have 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.939
 children or people who do not take much care 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.089
 things that are a bit heavier like 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.890
 we tell you and this effect for 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.379
 this kind of people since if you fall 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.730
 absolutely nothing happens to him in the 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.250
 description I'll leave you some 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.019
 test videos of what this is 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.730
 toxic survivor 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.070
 in case you want to go see it so that 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.079
 go and see them because it 's very, very, very 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.239
 resistant and also comes for what 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.120
 is the iphone is perfect for what it is 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.219
 to lend it to small children and 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.929
 of those children who do not know how to manipulate very 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.660
 okay things and they fall by mistake 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:02.109
 then excellent this case then 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.780
 well here says new ipad ipad 2 and says 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.340
 which is tested militarily and here it says 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.189
 the reference to survivor 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:15.380
 on this side survivor and the brand that is 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.450
 wifi here more 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.450
 here the cover that more specifications 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.759
 techniques and we're going to move on to what 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.759
 is the open and the revised 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.150
 happiness we have this let's leave the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.300
 I listened to the side we're going to remove this 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.479
 pasta and we're also going to give unit 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.550
 good comes with a base comes with the 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.770
 option to have it as a base because 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.410
 this case is difficult to put on and 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.030
 remove then it comes with the base 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.820
 so we do not have to buy another 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 that another one that is coming with another base 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.400
 base apart but that comes with the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.740
 base that inhabits the will adapt list in 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.350
 the part here says wifi and makes a 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.810
 material a little rough and not rubber 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.510
 It seems to be resistant but according to what 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.910
 they show us the videos I think it seems 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.840
 be very, very resistant what I did 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.510
 here the wifi logo and good 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.959
 from the other holes that we are going to 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.090
 enter to see now ready have manuals 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.200
 and let's remove what is this this 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.989
 top part 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.610
 and this pulls or what is coating the 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:40.440
 screen we will not leave aside 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.850
 and well they want what is the manual and 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.610
 something more than griffin but let's read 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.550
 we are going to show since we are going to see 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.500
 what is done in the part here is 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.800
 very soft I do not know if you have to listen to a 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.800
 little bit 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.810
 It seems as if I feijÃ³o for what is going 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.390
 to help keep our 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.870
 ipad and soft so you do not suffer scratches 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.810
 or anything that makes us ugly our ipad 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.400
 here in this soft and good part I am 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.230
 here to follow what is like rubber 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.270
 inks we're going to make the rubber so that 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.570
 you see just how it is for you to see 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.280
 if it is a resistance that we already have what 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.280
 what is the coating on the rubber 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.600
 It seems to be very resistant to pasta and 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.240
 good the rubber is for knee so that 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.470
 be but good comes with this rubber for 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.570
 have it in a much more way 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.310
 comfortable and the pasta was pasta not 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.440
 to help have it much more 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.660
 resistant just like what is going to 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.510
 follow what this rubber will serve us 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.340
 then we will proceed to place the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.360
 third generation ipad in what it is 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.360
 the base 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.260
 here we have the third iphone 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.440
 generation and let's proceed to what 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.720
 is the bet as we see here gives us the 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.709
 hole for what is the port of 305 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.239
 millimeters 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.000
 acquires the hole for what is the 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.040
 slide button here to remove and 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.830
 place the volume or 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.310
 the rotation options and so for 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.700
 raise and decrease volume in the lack 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.090
 here we have what it is here I do not know I do not know 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.000
 can see well but here comes what is 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.560
 then if you sound it will sound if 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.350
 it does not do anything good to you, let's take this out 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.930
 here and good we see there the holes for 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.270
 what is the sound and can we move it 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.070
 in this way to be pressuring and 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.050
 we can put it back so that we 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.430
 be completely protected 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.669
 here the hole for what is the dock 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.160
 and in the part here for what is the 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.670
 camera 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.070
 we are going to withdraw this and well we can 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.310
 move this the same way to be able to take 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.680
 a picture with what is ours 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.900
 football we will proceed to place the 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.090
 rubber but it's not going to fall on waitresses that 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.310
 it's a bit difficult to get on this 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.110
 remove we have what you have placed the 100 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.510
 percent in the base alternately of the 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.610
 top on the top 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.040
 to protect what is the screen of 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.430
 scratches and bumps here in the hole 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.300
 for what is quite wrong 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.120
 let's see if it is achieved from the camera 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.379
 and we will proceed to put the list 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.539
 so here we already have what it is 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:20.009
 our third generation ipad 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.740
 completely protected from blows 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.270
 absolutely every fall scratches and 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.000
 let's proceed to place what is 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.569
 I was doing is trying to place it 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.740
 how are we going to take here 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:36.639
 and we stay here as it does 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.499
 we had it here 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.659
 and we put it like us 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:44.979
 we want and ready we have it as well 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.680
 we feel and we already see that it works 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:50.469
 as he does for it we are going to change 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.569
 is ready then here we already have what 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.759
 than the ipad with the base and let's go to 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.710
 the camera application to test what 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:59.969
 what are the cameras with this case 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:03.219
 as we see in the part here comes with 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:05.259
 the broken for what is the hole for 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:08.199
 what the feinstein camera and good 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.610
 this part here as we see the plastic 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.770
 the paste that comes to coat the 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.710
 screen does not affect us anything what is the 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.529
 tactical movement let's change to the 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.879
 front to the camera fruit and good 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:20.469
 we see that it works perfectly 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.770
 what is this camera are we going to take a 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.770
 Photo 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:30.759
 and that the touch control is very perfect 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:34.199
 this part here and we are going to withdraw the 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.199
 hole of what the camera is 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:42.430
 yesterday as we see we already have completely 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.170
 our camera and our ipad 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.670
 completely protected and we take advantage 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.580
 what is the stand that offers us 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.590
 creeping to be able to take photos or take 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.800
 video in this way so that we stay 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.950
 much more stable and this framework to all and 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:00.280
 similarly much better we take a 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:02.860
 photo and well there we have the option and 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.660
 we see that the camera and then we have 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.190
 data so that we are protected 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.250
 completely and we also have the 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:12.190
 option to remove to be able to take 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.110
 a photo and cover it in the case that already 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.750
 we want to protect it, we give the button of the 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.580
 grid 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:21.140
 there we see that if it worked so much is 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.140
 free volume controls 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.280
 ready then here we have an ipad of 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:30.849
 third generation completely 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:34.599
 protected with its respective base and we 

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:36.099
 it will help much if we have children and 

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:38.110
 we have there is a tone takes great care 

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:42.250
 good things because we already have this base 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:43.659
 perfect for falls for rations of 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.509
 everything is going to serve us what I did this 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:48.460
 very resistant base do not forget to go 

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:51.069
 down to what are the links that in the 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.409
 description of the tests for what 

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:54.699
 that are already survivor for ipad and 

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:56.289
 they will also leave one for it 

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:58.780
 to stay resistant that is this 

00:07:56.289 --> 00:08:00.430
 study you can fall can not you 

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.080
 spend nothing but here we will not have 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.240
 the tests remember if you can 

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.729
