like it's a Ford which I really like I

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.229 
like it's a Ford which I really like I
don't<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.469> fact<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:50.239> just

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
don't like the fact that you know just

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:00.180 
don't like the fact that you know just
my<00:00:51.510> opinion

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:50.290 

I<00:01:16.509> am<00:01:36.220> pretty<00:01:37.220> much<00:01:46.569> cymbal<00:01:47.569> which<00:01:47.690> is<00:01:47.840> cool

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.320 

I<00:01:50.590> honestly<00:01:51.590> think<00:01:52.130> like<00:01:52.460> this<00:01:52.940> car<00:01:53.300> this<00:01:54.310> like

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
I honestly think like this car this like

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.749 
I honestly think like this car this like
screen<00:01:56.330> size<00:01:56.600> there's<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.409> little<00:01:57.800> too<00:01:58.069> small

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
screen size there's a little too small

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.550 
screen size there's a little too small
why<00:01:59.270> would<00:01:59.450> they<00:01:59.539> put<00:01:59.720> a<00:01:59.780> screen<00:02:00.110> size<00:02:00.289> this

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
why would they put a screen size this

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.380 
why would they put a screen size this
much<00:02:00.830> just<00:02:01.069> doesn't<00:02:01.369> make<00:02:01.460> sense<00:02:01.520> on<00:02:02.030> top<00:02:02.240> of

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
much just doesn't make sense on top of

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.280 
much just doesn't make sense on top of
that<00:02:02.509> you<00:02:03.350> really<00:02:03.680> cannot<00:02:04.450> hear<00:02:05.450> anything<00:02:05.659> as

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
that you really cannot hear anything as

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.609 
that you really cannot hear anything as
far<00:02:06.530> as<00:02:06.619> for<00:02:07.390> beeps

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
far as for beeps

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.380 
far as for beeps
when<00:02:10.129> you're<00:02:10.280> vacuuming<00:02:10.489> -<00:02:11.000> that's<00:02:11.180> like<00:02:11.360> a

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
when you're vacuuming - that's like a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.589 
when you're vacuuming - that's like a
downer<00:02:11.870> what<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.290> like<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.830> fact<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.599> it

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
downer what you like is the fact that it

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.229 
downer what you like is the fact that it
comes<00:02:14.780> with<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.140> USB<00:02:15.500> port<00:02:15.920> which<00:02:16.819> is<00:02:16.849> cool

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
comes with a USB port which is cool

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.210 
comes with a USB port which is cool
enough<00:02:17.360> about<00:02:17.720> time<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.860> mean<00:02:19.069> obviously

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
enough about time and I mean obviously

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.550 
enough about time and I mean obviously
the<00:02:19.670> start

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.140 

and<00:02:23.560> then<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.860> vaccines<00:02:29.640> it's<00:02:30.640> fabric

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
and then the vaccines it's fabric

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.490 
and then the vaccines it's fabric
material<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:33.370> forgot<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.239> mention<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:35.470> most

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
material I forgot to mention the most

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.319 
material I forgot to mention the most
important<00:02:36.840> feature<00:02:38.099> which<00:02:39.099> gives<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:40.090> the

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
important feature which gives it the

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.399 
important feature which gives it the
actual<00:02:41.079> title<00:02:41.549> on<00:02:42.549> this<00:02:42.760> car<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.870> style

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
actual title on this car is the style

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.680 
actual title on this car is the style
the<00:02:45.310> design<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.060> headlights<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:49.180> check

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
the design of the headlights so check

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.220 
the design of the headlights so check

talk<00:02:51.800> about<00:02:52.420> sexina

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.340 

so<00:02:56.709> what<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.400> also<00:02:57.670> like<00:02:58.030> about<00:02:58.060> this<00:02:58.569> make<00:02:59.020> is

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
so what I also like about this make is

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.180 
so what I also like about this make is
that<00:03:00.069> they<00:03:00.400> put<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:01.440> signals<00:03:02.440> this<00:03:02.709> way<00:03:02.920> which

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
that they put the signals this way which

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.590 
that they put the signals this way which
is<00:03:03.370> kind<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.730> neat<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.330> know<00:03:04.360> it's<00:03:04.569> a

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
is kind of neat you know it's a

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.020 
is kind of neat you know it's a
different<00:03:04.780> design<00:03:05.520> it's<00:03:06.520> not<00:03:06.610> like<00:03:06.850> your

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
different design it's not like your

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.340 
different design it's not like your
usual<00:03:07.240> you<00:03:07.900> know<00:03:07.930> blinker<00:03:09.330> but<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.360> don't<00:03:11.050> like

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
usual you know blinker but I don't like

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.430 
usual you know blinker but I don't like
that<00:03:11.770> they<00:03:12.610> did<00:03:12.910> not<00:03:15.660> hear<00:03:16.660> on<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.020> mirrors

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
that they did not hear on the mirrors

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.360 
that they did not hear on the mirrors
you<00:03:17.680> know<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:19.030> was<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.209> little<00:03:20.069> throw<00:03:21.069> me<00:03:21.250> off

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
you know that was a little throw me off

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.400 
you know that was a little throw me off
but<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:22.150> guess<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:23.410> make<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:25.000> like<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.480> so

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
but I guess this make is like that so

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.199 
but I guess this make is like that so
