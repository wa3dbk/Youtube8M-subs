00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
one because it's got a lot going on it

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.290 
one because it's got a lot going on it
that<00:00:25.770> I<00:00:25.800> especially<00:00:26.250> enjoyed<00:00:26.820> working<00:00:27.030> on

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
that I especially enjoyed working on

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.220 
that I especially enjoyed working on
let's<00:00:28.200> start<00:00:28.440> off<00:00:28.619> with<00:00:29.130> lip<00:00:29.400> flaps<00:00:29.750> now<00:00:30.750> this

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
let's start off with lip flaps now this

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.200 
let's start off with lip flaps now this
part<00:00:31.470> actually<00:00:31.650> made<00:00:32.040> me<00:00:32.190> wonder<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:32.760> I<00:00:32.879> put<00:00:33.120> it

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
part actually made me wonder if I put it

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.720 
part actually made me wonder if I put it
here<00:00:33.449> or<00:00:33.690> under<00:00:33.930> visual<00:00:34.410> effects<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.430> it's

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
here or under visual effects but it's

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.170 
here or under visual effects but it's
tentacley<00:00:36.210> lip<00:00:36.480> flap<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.170> here<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.180> cell

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
tentacley lip flap so here it is cell

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.170 
tentacley lip flap so here it is cell
motorboating<00:00:39.900> with<00:00:40.050> his<00:00:40.199> lips<00:00:40.470> and<00:00:41.400> I<00:00:41.699> think

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
motorboating with his lips and I think

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.250 
motorboating with his lips and I think
that's<00:00:42.390> what<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.750> called

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that's what it's called

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.430 
that's what it's called
anyway<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.400> basically<00:00:45.059> cut<00:00:45.449> out<00:00:45.570> his<00:00:45.720> lips<00:00:45.930> he

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
anyway I basically cut out his lips he

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.590 
anyway I basically cut out his lips he
pasted<00:00:46.860> them<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:47.250> then<00:00:47.580> added<00:00:47.909> a<00:00:48.000> small<00:00:48.059> blur

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
pasted them and then added a small blur

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.840 
pasted them and then added a small blur
I<00:00:48.870> also<00:00:49.379> made<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> frame<00:00:50.129> right<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.640> one

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
I also made the frame right one for one

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.689 
I also made the frame right one for one
to<00:00:51.239> keep<00:00:51.540> it<00:00:51.690> movin<00:00:51.960> abnormally<00:00:52.470> fast<00:00:52.699> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
to keep it movin abnormally fast the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.270 
to keep it movin abnormally fast the
next<00:00:54.059> scene<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.269> Android<00:00:54.809> 18<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:55.470> I<00:00:55.650> copied

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
next scene is Android 18 here I copied

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.250 
next scene is Android 18 here I copied
and<00:00:56.370> pasted<00:00:56.760> these<00:00:56.970> flaps<00:00:57.360> from<00:00:57.540> another<00:00:57.930> shot

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and pasted these flaps from another shot

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.560 
and pasted these flaps from another shot
actually<00:00:58.830> as<00:00:59.129> she<00:00:59.460> doesn't<00:00:59.820> originally<00:01:00.239> speak

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
actually as she doesn't originally speak

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
shot of cell is one of my favorites in

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.730 
shot of cell is one of my favorites in
the<00:01:09.030> episode<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.320> was<00:01:10.440> a<00:01:10.470> little

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the episode but it was a little

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.410 
the episode but it was a little
difficult<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.220> create<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:11.850> he<00:01:12.119> doesn't

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
difficult to create because he doesn't

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.930 
difficult to create because he doesn't
actually<00:01:12.630> talk<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.470> shot<00:01:13.650> proper<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.460> had

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
actually talk in this shot proper I had

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.700 
actually talk in this shot proper I had
to<00:01:15.030> borrow<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> from<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.810> shot<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.380> where

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950 
to borrow it from this shot here where
he<00:01:16.890> does<00:01:17.130> actually<00:01:17.370> speak<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.360> pasted<00:01:18.840> it

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
he does actually speak then pasted it

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.680 
he does actually speak then pasted it
here<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:20.190> following<00:01:20.580> shot<00:01:20.820> tension<00:01:21.570> on

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
here the following shot tension on

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.110 
here the following shot tension on
doesn't<00:01:22.050> actually<00:01:22.290> speak<00:01:23.130> he<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.760> breathes

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
doesn't actually speak he just breathes

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.870 
doesn't actually speak he just breathes
heavily<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.620> took<00:01:25.680> these<00:01:26.040> flaps<00:01:26.340> available

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
heavily so I took these flaps available

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.670 
heavily so I took these flaps available
to<00:01:26.970> me<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.300> edited<00:01:27.780> them<00:01:27.870> appropriately<00:01:28.410> into

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
to me and edited them appropriately into

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.430 
to me and edited them appropriately into
place<00:01:28.940> Goku's<00:01:29.940> flaps<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.450> take<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.290> from

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
place Goku's flaps here take in from

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.800 
place Goku's flaps here take in from
another<00:01:31.710> scene<00:01:31.950> entirely<00:01:32.240> same<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.540> shot

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
another scene entirely same in this shot

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.270 
another scene entirely same in this shot
and<00:01:34.130> finally

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and finally

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.220 
and finally
Vegeta's<00:01:35.820> flaps<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.480> are<00:01:36.660> from<00:01:36.810> an<00:01:36.900> entirely

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.830 
Vegeta's flaps here are from an entirely
different<00:01:37.380> scene<00:01:37.920> as<00:01:38.070> well<00:01:38.330> then<00:01:39.330> that's<00:01:39.660> lip

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
different scene as well then that's lip

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.990 
different scene as well then that's lip
lapse<00:01:40.130> relatively<00:01:41.130> simple<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.640> time<00:01:41.790> around

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
lapse relatively simple this time around

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.040 
lapse relatively simple this time around
but<00:01:42.270> don't<00:01:42.570> worry

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
but don't worry

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.640 
but don't worry
visual<00:01:43.830> effects<00:01:44.160> have<00:01:44.550> a<00:01:44.580> lot<00:01:44.940> going<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.650> this

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650

easy edit to make for me despite the
