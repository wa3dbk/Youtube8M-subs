keep the weight on the tail lean back a
little<00:01:16.110> bit<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> slide<00:01:16.950> don't<00:01:17.159> lean<00:01:17.430> too

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
little bit so you slide don't lean too

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.130 
little bit so you slide don't lean too
far<00:01:17.820> forward<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:19.170> stick<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.619> fly<00:01:19.829> forward

continue to slide when you get to the

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.090 
continue to slide when you get to the
end<00:01:23.399> there's<00:01:23.609> two<00:01:23.789> options<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.539> coming<00:01:24.930> out

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
end there's two options for coming out

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.010 
end there's two options for coming out
we<00:01:26.100> go<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:27.390> regular<00:01:27.780> right<00:01:28.259> away<00:01:28.439> straight<00:01:28.850> or

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
we go to regular right away straight or

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.740 
we go to regular right away straight or
which<00:01:31.700> fakie<00:01:32.700> which<00:01:32.880> comes<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.179> little<00:01:33.270> easier

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
which fakie which comes a little easier

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.569 
which fakie which comes a little easier
because<00:01:34.409> you're<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.920> continuing<00:01:35.460> your

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
because you're just continuing your

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.639 
because you're just continuing your
rotation<00:01:36.289> so<00:01:37.289> you'll<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.820> tailslide<00:01:38.820> fakie

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
rotation so you'll just tailslide fakie

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.859 
rotation so you'll just tailslide fakie
and<00:01:40.649> you'll<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.890> riding<00:01:41.100> away<00:01:41.429> switch<00:01:41.969> before

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
and you'll be riding away switch before

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.340 
and you'll be riding away switch before
fakie<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:46.159> keep<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.310> mind<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.999> want<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.210> have

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
fakie so keep in mind you want to have

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.870 
fakie so keep in mind you want to have
Ollie's<00:01:49.350> solid<00:01:50.329> front<00:01:51.329> side<00:01:51.539> 180s<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.880> maybe

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
Ollie's solid front side 180s and maybe

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.639 
Ollie's solid front side 180s and maybe
you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.210> even<00:01:54.329> start<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.810> run<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.469> on<00:01:55.590> a

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
you can even start out just run up on a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.289 
you can even start out just run up on a
curb<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:55.979> know<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.609> up<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.880> curb<00:01:57.149> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
curb you know just going up to curb and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.599 
curb you know just going up to curb and
practicing<00:01:57.780> your<00:01:57.810> tail<00:01:58.079> stalls<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.679> stall

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
practicing your tail stalls just stall

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.289 
practicing your tail stalls just stall
on<00:01:59.789> there<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.179> a<00:02:00.210> second

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
on there for a second

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.419 
on there for a second
so<00:02:01.960> let's<00:02:02.109> go<00:02:02.229> ahead<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.409> try<00:02:02.560> some<00:02:02.799> front

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
so let's go ahead and try some front

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:11.140 
so let's go ahead and try some front
side

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150
