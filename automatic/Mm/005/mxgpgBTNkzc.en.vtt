 to solve the last photshop 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.449
 we must insult for more 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.569
 this small species 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:31.669
 dl 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:32.850

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.330
 to the right 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
 it is important to turn right 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.810
 not like that 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.810

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.360
 well 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.050
 we must also form here 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.010
 a cross 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.329
 this time ciolla 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.450
 to do this 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.489
 we bring 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.080
 left 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.080

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.820
 rustling venezuela 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.700
 It is formed 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.830
 now we have to check 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.820
 central documents 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.970
 are 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.630
 in their correct opposition or the combal shop color 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.010

 so we have to wear blue 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.500

 I immediately why pirlo it 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.660
 move the cintioli cubes 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.660
 you must make this monster 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.900
 cube pendulum 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.900
 with the or the last do high 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.459
 and knowing that with flies 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.609
 I will do too much or the cube in front of us remains still 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.749
 and therefore these federica rotate 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.709
 or this cube but here 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.809
 this 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.969
 here and this here 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.319
 let's try to see 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.319
 how can we do when first 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.649

 to the left 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.819
 port support right 2 rotations then wav o 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.989

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.989
