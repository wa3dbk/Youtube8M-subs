them<00:00:11.580> up<00:00:11.610> yourself<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.150> started<00:00:12.480> off<00:00:12.599> with

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
them up yourself so I started off with

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.320 
them up yourself so I started off with
the<00:00:12.900> orange<00:00:13.110> color<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.429> fear<00:00:14.820> desire

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
the orange color this is fear desire

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.810 
the orange color this is fear desire
which<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> really<00:00:16.590> pretty<00:00:17.190> light<00:00:17.550> orange

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
which is a really pretty light orange

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.320 
which is a really pretty light orange
color<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.600> think<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.650> oranges<00:00:20.310> can<00:00:20.730> look<00:00:21.000> a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
color I think that oranges can look a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.890 
color I think that oranges can look a
little<00:00:21.630> tacky<00:00:22.500> if<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.699> not<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.480> right<00:00:24.510> color

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
little tacky if it's not the right color

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.589 
little tacky if it's not the right color
like<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.529> can<00:00:26.010> look<00:00:26.130> borderline<00:00:26.670> Halloween<00:00:27.359> is

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599

like I can look borderline Halloween is
looking<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.260> think<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> think<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.670> is

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
looking I think but I think that this is

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.359 
looking I think but I think that this is
a<00:00:29.849> really<00:00:30.359> really<00:00:30.570> classy<00:00:31.230> orange<00:00:31.710> color<00:00:32.009> and

a really really classy orange color and
it's<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.329> good<00:00:33.570> pop<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.110> color<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.710> your<00:00:34.800> nails

on<00:01:04.830> camera<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.549> i<00:01:05.850> think<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.740> name

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
on camera but i think that the name

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.340 
on camera but i think that the name
suits<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.549> very<00:01:08.790> well<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.689> very<00:01:09.900> cool

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
suits it very well it's a very cool

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.130 
suits it very well it's a very cool
color<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:12.180> not<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.570> my<00:01:12.750> favorites

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
color and it's not one of my favorites

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
color and it's not one of my favorites
but<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:14.159> still<00:01:14.430> really<00:01:14.490> sick<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> next

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
but it's still really sick in the next

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.219 
but it's still really sick in the next
color<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.619> all<00:01:16.920> tied<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.930> it<00:01:18.930> doesn't

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
color this is all tied up and it doesn't

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.649 
color this is all tied up and it doesn't
look<00:01:19.320> very<00:01:19.380> appealing<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:20.100> first<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:21.060> you

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
look very appealing at first but if you

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.660 
look very appealing at first but if you
look<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> bottle<00:01:22.710> which<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.100> can't<00:01:23.400> show

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
look at the bottle which I can't show

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.670 
look at the bottle which I can't show
you<00:01:23.700> close-up<00:01:24.540> because<00:01:24.659> my<00:01:25.020> camera<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.470> not

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you close-up because my camera is not

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.219 
you close-up because my camera is not
that<00:01:25.830> good<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:27.210> kind<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.720> nude<00:01:27.960> color

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that good but it's kind of a nude color

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.850 
that good but it's kind of a nude color
with<00:01:28.770> red<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.939> purple<00:01:30.450> e<00:01:30.810> undertones<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
with red and purple e undertones and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.690 
with red and purple e undertones and
then<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.490> has<00:01:32.700> gold<00:01:33.030> reflex<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.520> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
then it has gold reflex so it's just a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.300 
then it has gold reflex so it's just a
really<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:36.540> unique<00:01:37.020> color<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.650> I've

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
really really unique color and I've

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.340 
really really unique color and I've
looked<00:01:38.490> at<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.759> up<00:01:38.939> close<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:40.020> kind<00:01:40.320> of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
looked at it up close and it kind of

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.140 
looked at it up close and it kind of
reminds<00:01:40.710> me<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.040> sunset<00:01:41.340> when<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.850> put<00:01:42.060> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
reminds me of a sunset when you put it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.289 
reminds me of a sunset when you put it
on<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:44.100> had<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> grab<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:44.970> it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
on so I just had to grab it because it

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.420 
on so I just had to grab it because it
was<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.810> eye-catching<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.220> look

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
was just so eye-catching if you look

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.660 
was just so eye-catching if you look
closely<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> bottle<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.250> fairy

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
closely at the bottle so this is a fairy

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.999
