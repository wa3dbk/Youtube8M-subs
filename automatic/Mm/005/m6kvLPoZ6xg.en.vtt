00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.050
 two preliminary comments 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.079
 want to turn your size very precisely 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.959
 then you use the measure clock to control the movement of the farc members 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.769
 set 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.419
 a displacement of one hundredth of a millimeter according to the clock 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.549
 delivers in the decrease of the diameter of two hundredth millimeters 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.179
 decreased in jet and you want to measure 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.140
 let it be second alone 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.130
 stop the machine 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.130
 and only move past members to the right 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.040
 as an example, we use jonas of 8 millimeters, part of which has a diameter 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.450
 from 5 kombat 3 must get 2 millimeters 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.970
 the pole in advance two adjacent 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.100
 one that is approximately 3 10 millimeters larger than the desired size 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.140
 an animal is about ten millimeters larger 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.560
 so in this case choose five comma 6 millimeters, but come four millimeters 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.550
 Many small diameter steps of about a millimeter until you get in the 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.550
 Nearly five came six millimeters 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.300
 metris left the slider a third time 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.520
 when used, do as much as possible ten distripark on terschelling for it 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.520
 setting the farc members 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.470
 now a nice job 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.630
 remember that you have this farc members skin left alone 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.410
 one third filed the lengthy lawsuit 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.410
 so high that it is still free of the workpiece 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.940
 imagine the blow with the dumbbell one was open somewhere between 0 and 3 meters and two 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.759
 millimeter 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.959
 fixed transverse members until the presence of the measuring clock on the next 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.959
 clean ship 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.319
 note the clock's rejection 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.199
 have the slider measure micrometer to the size of the workpiece 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.819
 and note this degree 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:57.619
 calculate how much the director of the paper should be smaller to counter 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.619
 dvs came from 4 millimeters 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.149
 move the foolish members 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.149
 that says a school says van der measure clock 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.779
 turns 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:27.979
 then note the position of the measuring clock and the rejection of the micrometer 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:37.569
 calculate how much the four meters should be smaller to you eventually 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:38.929
 desired size 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:42.349
 five come 3 2 millimeters so to reach 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:48.129
 calculate associated at least scale parts on the measuring clock 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.669
 imagine using the metro to win the sleepers as precisely as possible 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.109
 to turn 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.359
 to participate 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.469
 succeeded 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:28.439
 Finally 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.039
 you no longer need the most clock 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.489
 Then slide the supporters until the cas is free 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.870
 then the clock turns around
