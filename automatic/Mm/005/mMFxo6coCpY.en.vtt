slash chord it's an E minor chord with B
in<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> base<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.869> we're<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.679> play<00:01:49.770> E

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
in the base so we're not going to play E

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.410 
in the base so we're not going to play E
minor<00:01:50.190> with<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> six<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.940> bottom

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
minor with the six in the bottom

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.380 
minor with the six in the bottom
a<00:01:52.450> play<00:01:53.050> from<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.470> fifth<00:01:53.680> in<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.830> bottom<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
a play from the fifth in the bottom the

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.370 
a play from the fifth in the bottom the
reason<00:01:55.630> we're<00:01:55.750> doing<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.260> the<00:01:56.320> reason

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
reason we're doing that and the reason

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.010 
reason we're doing that and the reason
that<00:01:56.710> most<00:01:57.310> likely<00:01:57.600> they<00:01:58.600> did<00:01:58.780> this<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:58.990> the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
that most likely they did this in the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.750 
that most likely they did this in the
song<00:01:59.230> it<00:01:59.380> creates<00:01:59.680> a<00:01:59.740> descending<00:02:00.340> melodic

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
song it creates a descending melodic

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.350 
song it creates a descending melodic
baseline<00:02:01.210> so<00:02:01.420> instead<00:02:01.690> of<00:02:01.750> C<00:02:02.290> to<00:02:02.590> e<00:02:02.910> it<00:02:03.910> goes<00:02:03.970> C

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
baseline so instead of C to e it goes C

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.870 
baseline so instead of C to e it goes C
down<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.870> be<00:02:05.080> down<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:05.950> that's<00:02:06.580> going<00:02:06.760> to<00:02:06.820> be

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
down to be down to a that's going to be
