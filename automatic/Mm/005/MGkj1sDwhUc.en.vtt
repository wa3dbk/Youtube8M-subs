00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.509
 what happened to them and if it does not show what we will do with the video 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.029
 geek insurance should have been revealed playing his south audio tab 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.939

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.869
 Now that I see it, I'm going to leave the mother for not paying attention to her 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.869
 channel and talk about something for it but you may be looking for something to 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.729
 re-operate on the 'planet science' 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:33.370

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.129

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:38.200
 nothing happened 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.850
 guillemo say it but I think that this time we will not talk about anything in the ink and 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.780
 that probably put some stupid stuffing like in the previous video 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.180
 they may be right but I will continue saying that you have something prepared for 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.290

 How nice would it be that the fuck I'm going to leave the mother to see you 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
 bullshit instead of looking for a topic to clarify 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.440
 and who says that I do not have a subject to speak it 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.530

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.280
 sources of it but there are some pages like yahoo and some 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.750
 newspapers like the one in my country mexico the universal and the miviot post in states 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.300
 united that have already confirmed this topic 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.750

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.390

 well I think everything is ready so let's start 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.490
 Hello Youtube friends 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.630
 I am receive with x 0 89 bringing here as I had promised a topic to 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.189
 speak it in this video 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.819
 alright so I'll start with the subject 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.209
 is with a statement from the editor editor of marvel comics 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.509
 axel alonso 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:25.729
 On Wednesday, June 22, an edition of Spain and Berman came out of the series 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:30.679
 ultimaimes which is already the 160th comic of this one where you can 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:34.079
 see the death of piter parker is the same spider man 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.429
 rafa 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:38.459
 you do not have 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.479
 it's true this fucking geek 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:42.269
 spider man dies 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.200
 so is 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.510
 one of the most beloved heroes of the marvel comics company dies in the comic 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.040
 number 160 in the hands of the best-known villain of this hero the green goblin 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:57.409
 before dying in the arms of his beloved merideño he dedicates his last 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.409
 words to your aunt month which I will quote verbatim for you 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.189
 I could not save Uncle Ben 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.099
 it did not matter what he did 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.739
 but I saved you 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:07.969
 I did it 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.400
 these are his last words before dying according to previous appointments 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.139
 that were distributed by the same publisher 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.729
 it can not be true and you already know through britain this has to be a 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:20.759
 mind 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.279
 we can say that it is true that nothing 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:27.339
 and according to some words of the scriptwriter brought toast who had already eleven 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:31.549
 years working on the argument of the death of piter parker said that this 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.589
 they made it happen the same as with other superheroes like superman who have 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:39.219
 dead to come back to life in popularity and to see the stories that 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.489
 they would originate from his death 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.469
 this said with these words that I will quote now 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.409
 is the end point this has a meaning and it will not work if we do not keep 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:49.859
 firm 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.820
 and for those who did not understand the final 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.829
 unit of this I will explain to you 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.949
 apparently the death of piter parker does not mean the disappearance of 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.370
 Spiderman has been a first step for a new character to claim 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:04.079
 his arachnid alter ego in autumn 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.570
 we are going to have some new countries brothers in 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.769
 Bogota 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.279
 this said by himself the thorax the alonso without having given more details 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:15.659
 about his new protagonist who will make his debut in August of this year within 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.309
 the saga ultimaimes 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:21.779
 good if you wonder what is the saga ultimaimes is a series started to 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.379
 published in the year 2000 with the aim of attracting young people with 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:28.659
 the alternative and updated stories of their superheroes more 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.639
 famous as the sones country german the fantastic four or the x men 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.280
 got damn 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.070
 poor piter then significance will no longer be the spiderman of now in 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.219
 ahead 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:43.999
 it never means simply that pinter parker disappears definitively 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:48.730
 of the saga ultimates but spider-man fans like ginatta exist 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.030
 you can continue watching the adventures of piter parker in the classic diamé series 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.160
 and ends brother country 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.880
 that the publishing house continues publishing since it was launched in 1962 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.370
 for birds verbal strength 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.289
 outside its borders the third phase 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.099
 yes after more than 100 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.710
 efe the chief of codelco the dt 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.900
 and when you go that will go on sale on Monday the two sister countries 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.560
 the official launch 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.900
 It was this Wednesday, June 22, 2011, but only for New York 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.480
 unknown the release date on this number in the rest of the world 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.990
 but so while I can say that although this hero so loved by 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.250
 many die in history does not mean that it will disappear since this will cause 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.440
 spiderman fans get the above stories apart 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.160
 of the latter to be able to see and enjoy the latest adventures that 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.820
 had his favorite hero and that this will be what will make him never die from 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.370
 the mind 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.779
 nor the hearts of his followers 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:50.909
 how pretty that thought and yes 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.439
 i was very poetic hehe 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.500
 but what the fuck 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.710
 I think you heard quite gay requires shit plus you did not have 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.110
 said that only the last saga dies etc and now goes out with those moms can 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.009
 Shut up, damn the fourth son of a bitch 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.129
 Do not look for this emotional moment together 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.129
 how can piece of shit be so insensitive 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.939
 in this time as they were to hopkins 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:19.330
 damn the lower house this Thursday do until 4 will leave as there is 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.830

00:06:23.829 --> 00:06:27.379
 that tour will bring from those saints who were never seen saying bad words 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.250

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.050

 regardless of the death of spiderman in comic book 160 of the 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.440
 series ultimaimes the only thing I can tell you about this is that he was and 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.840
 is one of the heroes of the greatest comics that have existed 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.750
 and that many generations enjoyed during their childhood and adolescence with 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.390
