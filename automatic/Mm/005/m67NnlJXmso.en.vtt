00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.819
 hello extras are super super 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.740
 well I'm loop and in this video you 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.810
 teach how to make this heart of photos 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.140
 It's super easy and I think you've 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:14.960
 seen everywhere is in tumblr 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.820
 this interest in all these pages of 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.980
 photos but these ways when I had 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.530
 I want to teach you how to do it 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.930
 The first thing you will need is going to be 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.980
 photographs tape and double tape 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.270
 face 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.789
 The first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.949
 accommodate your photos on the floor or in a 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.360
 surface so you know more or less 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.730
 how do you want them to stay in the 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.730
 order and then the size of the heart 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.880
 no no no 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.560
 after you have it settled that 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.690
 you know how you're going to want to do it 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.250
 start to stick it on your wall you 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.890
 I recommend that this part be first 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.380
 with adhesive tape so that after 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.380
 you can move the coetzee 7-8 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.030
 the kids 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.930
 ah 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 i 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.970
 you're going to take your double-sided tape and what 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.560
 you are going to paste in your photograph and then 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.310
 on the wall is the simplest thing in the world 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.310
 very well 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.420
 finally estimated it will be your 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.120
 heart but I'm really cool 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.120
 but I recommend you permission
