make a good selection of them but these

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.179 
make a good selection of them but these
two<00:00:26.099> here's<00:00:26.430> many<00:00:26.699> ways<00:00:26.910> all<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.150> them<00:00:27.390> carry

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
two here's many ways all of them carry

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.929 
two here's many ways all of them carry
excellent<00:00:29.189> construction<00:00:29.699> they<00:00:29.820> have

an aluminum frame the aluminum frame

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.510 
an aluminum frame the aluminum frame
makes<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> lighter<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.860> kids<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.219> pedal

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
able to adults and that matches up with

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.290 
able to adults and that matches up with
a<00:00:45.840> better<00:00:46.110> gear<00:00:46.559> system<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.610> there<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:47.969> smaller

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
a better gear system on there so smaller

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.389 
a better gear system on there so smaller
smaller<00:00:48.780> gear<00:00:49.050> system<00:00:49.469> shorter<00:00:49.980> cranks

they're going to learn to ride and be

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.959 
they're going to learn to ride and be
easier<00:00:52.289> from<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> pedal<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> bike<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.340> couple

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
easier from the pedal the bike a couple

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.549 
easier from the pedal the bike a couple
that<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.390> an<00:00:54.510> aluminum<00:00:54.870> frame<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.320> makes<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
that with an aluminum frame it makes it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.410 
that with an aluminum frame it makes it
lighter<00:00:55.770> weight<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.670> bike<00:00:56.910> actually<00:00:57.120> has<00:00:57.390> a

at this level we're going to teach them

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.520 
at this level we're going to teach them
to<00:01:02.879> use<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> hand<00:01:03.719> brakes<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.199> used<00:01:04.379> to

to use the hand brakes you get used to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
to use the hand brakes you get used to
that<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.010> also<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> safety<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.000> that

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that but also have the safety of that
