00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
probably sip on it just fine second
you're<00:01:59.759> going<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.149> put<00:02:00.509> in

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
you're going to put in

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:13.220 
you're going to put in
half<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.080> shot<00:02:02.320> or<00:02:04.410> 3/4<00:02:05.410> of<00:02:05.560> an<00:02:05.710> ounce<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:06.790> kahlúa

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.410 

so<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.410> will<00:02:14.560> give<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.710> a<00:02:14.860> bit<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.420> sweetness

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
so this will give it a bit of sweetness

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.560 
so this will give it a bit of sweetness
and<00:02:18.060> coffee<00:02:19.060> flavoring<00:02:20.850> now<00:02:21.850> lastly<00:02:22.240> we're

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
going to fill with the Ruby you'll get

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.090 
going to fill with the Ruby you'll get
probably<00:02:27.040> about<00:02:27.400> half<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:28.680> bottle<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.950> root

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
probably about half a bottle of root

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.600 
probably about half a bottle of root

of<00:03:23.580> some<00:03:23.820> spice<00:03:24.090> too<00:03:24.390> from<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.930> Jagermeister

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
of some spice too from the Jagermeister

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.920 
of some spice too from the Jagermeister
spice<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.340> actually<00:03:27.030> like<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.450> Jagermeister

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
spice I actually like the Jagermeister

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.020 
spice I actually like the Jagermeister
spice<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.200> lot<00:03:28.470> it's<00:03:29.010> weaker<00:03:29.820> than<00:03:29.970> normal

spice a lot it's weaker than normal

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.850 
spice a lot it's weaker than normal
Jagermeister<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.140> doesn't<00:03:31.380> overpower<00:03:31.590> a

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
Jagermeister and it doesn't overpower a

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.160 
Jagermeister and it doesn't overpower a
drink<00:03:32.100> as<00:03:32.220> much<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.180> could<00:03:33.600> actually<00:03:33.720> just

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
drink as much so you could actually just

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.670 
drink as much so you could actually just
sip<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:34.860> on<00:03:35.190> ice<00:03:35.700> but<00:03:36.270> um<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:37.050> really<00:03:37.200> brings

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
sip it on ice but um it really brings

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.890 
sip it on ice but um it really brings
out<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.920> spicy<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:38.820> vanilla<00:03:39.210> flavor<00:03:39.480> when<00:03:39.810> you

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900

add<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.520> anything<00:03:41.520> else<00:03:42.020> you<00:03:43.020> can<00:03:43.140> taste<00:03:43.350> it

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
aftertaste but you really taste the

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.850 
aftertaste but you really taste the
sweetness<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.840> directly<00:03:49.290> when<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.650> try<00:03:49.830> to
