00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
time easier so I'm gonna start by doing

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.610 
time easier so I'm gonna start by doing
that<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.890> all<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:59.540> knobs<00:02:59.750> I<00:03:02.110> think<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.200> can<00:03:03.440> see

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
that to all the knobs I think I can see

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.270 
that to all the knobs I think I can see
it's<00:03:03.980> sanded<00:03:04.790> on<00:03:05.030> all<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.450> surfaces<00:03:06.020> and<00:03:06.680> I'm

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
it's sanded on all the surfaces and I'm

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.870 
it's sanded on all the surfaces and I'm
going<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.550> give<00:03:07.700> my<00:03:07.940> paint<00:03:08.810> shake<00:03:12.490> and<00:03:13.490> what<00:03:13.850> I

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
going to give my paint shake and what I

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.870 
going to give my paint shake and what I
start<00:03:14.450> by<00:03:14.630> doing<00:03:14.810> is<00:03:15.260> actually<00:03:15.680> on<00:03:16.040> on<00:03:16.400> these

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
start by doing is actually on on these

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.600 
start by doing is actually on on these
with<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:18.470> what<00:03:18.950> would<00:03:19.100> be<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.400> male

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
with the this is what would be the male

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.410 
with the this is what would be the male
part<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.300> the<00:03:20.360> door<00:03:21.230> knob<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:22.040> think<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:23.000> anyway

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
part of the door knob I think so anyway

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.870 
part of the door knob I think so anyway
I<00:03:23.720> hold<00:03:24.020> down<00:03:24.230> here<00:03:24.710> and<00:03:25.010> I'm<00:03:25.310> going<00:03:25.550> to<00:03:25.580> spray

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
I hold down here and I'm going to spray

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.810 
I hold down here and I'm going to spray
around<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.570> base<00:03:26.720> first<00:03:27.110> because<00:03:27.680> once<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.580> put

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
around the base first because once I put

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.480 
around the base first because once I put
it<00:03:28.940> in<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.630> styrofoam<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.650> part<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.160> kind<00:03:31.400> of

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
it in the styrofoam that part is kind of

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.150 
it in the styrofoam that part is kind of
hard<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:31.760> get<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:32.390> I'm<00:03:32.930> as<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.740> trick<00:03:33.980> with

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
hard to get so I'm as the trick with

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.920 
hard to get so I'm as the trick with
spray<00:03:34.400> painting<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.060> I've<00:03:35.150> done<00:03:35.360> videos<00:03:35.750> on

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
spray painting and I've done videos on

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.480 
spray painting and I've done videos on
spray<00:03:36.230> painting<00:03:36.620> before<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.130> this<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.280> an

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
spray painting before and this is an

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.870 
spray painting before and this is an
important<00:03:38.030> tip<00:03:38.650> it's<00:03:39.650> an<00:03:39.770> important<00:03:40.130> step<00:03:40.370> but

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
important tip it's an important step but

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.600 
important tip it's an important step but
when<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:41.960> spray<00:03:42.140> paint<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:43.130> impress<00:03:43.430> your

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
when you spray paint you impress your

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.940 
when you spray paint you impress your
nozzle<00:03:44.120> over<00:03:44.330> starting<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.470> left<00:03:45.680> side

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
nozzle over starting on the left side

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.250

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
to do one pass you don't want to get too

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.630
