00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.950
 hello this is a new video in this video 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.570
 I will once again and finally fight with 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.070
 hunters and this time he won't be able 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.080
 jump off my rashka 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.390
 tell you a little about hunters 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.970
 currently they are one of the best 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.060
 classes for duels did you know that 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.710
 hunters can kill the magician in a duel 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.930
 did you think that he is one of 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.899
 the best classes of duels no hunters can 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.430
 kill them and that's impressive right now 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.040
 the only classes with which 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.290
 the hunter will have problems it probably 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.580
 retro paladin and feral druid and and war 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.070
 hunter with whom I will fight name 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.710
 ayk and he plays branches shooting 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.810
 now one more thing and which should 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.120
 know this is what a hunter can leave in 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.220
 invisibility but almost guaranteed something 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.760
 that they will come out of it now I will show 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.200
 what hunters can do rude reception 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.520
 lightens for 4 seconds 1 minute cooldown 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.460
 disorienting arrow in 30 seconds 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.320
 cool down will disorient for 4 seconds 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.479
 trap 28 seconds to 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.600
 immobilize for 4 seconds slows down 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.689
 50 percent deterrence reflects everything 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.399
 abilities with a hundred percent probability 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.159
 break 60 seconds cool down 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.439
 hunter jump back to pretend 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.460
 dead 25 seconds where is the hunter 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.810
 ceases to be the target shot chimera 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.119
 cures a hunter by 5 percent off 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.119
 his full health 10 seconds cool down 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.880
 because of the ability camouflage is very difficult 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.980
 to find the discoveries 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.660
 the hunter is invisible and you are not 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.610
 can highlight it in purpose therefore 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.950
 in most cases the hunter will open on 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.600
 I prefer you first at the beginning of the battle 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.760
 send hunters fear so he won't 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.500
 could open up if he open on 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.750
 you first you must immobilize him 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.970
 either go to the defensive stance I 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.920
 I use a bunch of recklessness in a whirlwind 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.560
 blades knocking down again will not light up 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.000
 tendons if the hunter runs away from you 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.910
 you must go in defensive 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.310
 rack protection the longer the fight lasts 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.120
 the less chance you have of winning the same 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.460
 as in the battle with the magician, I hope you 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.500
 liked the duel against the hunters with 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.500
 behave with you thanks for watching
