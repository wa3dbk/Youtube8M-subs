00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
 daniel lives today as like a mushroom 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.870
 between performance a Christmas 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.719
 me that my ideal Christmas is to spend in 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.660
 family we have a custom since 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.600
 many years ago leaving the country 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.869
 normally we go to the USA we travel in 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.840
 car we look for a place this environment 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.850
 this snowy and what we do is to be 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.890
 everyone with this family a cabin and 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.350
 and just enjoy our 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.220
 company know a little bit the city or 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.090
 the small town where we can be 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.840
 Hosted a time of approximately 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.980
 I think we travel what is 20 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.790
 return the first or second on the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.710
 next year then the best is almost 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.780
 almost the since it starts from that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.030
 we pack since we see the car 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.449
 from there they begin 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.690
 my christmas of something the new year ideal 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.699
 the same goes for my people brothers 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.659
 that really estimates a lot left 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.820
 a lot and well this year we have the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.580
 fortune and the opportunity to return to 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.750
 repeat that Christmas that really 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.530
 fascinates we have had years that do not 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.509
 we can leave for competitions this or 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.440
 by concentrations by commitments 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.140
 within my goals as a gymnast but 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.880
 this year, thank God we are given 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.820
 the opportunity to be in the family of 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.830
 new have some family ritual something 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.190
 that will make night something that you like 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.310
 eat and that day they do it to you 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.470
 we try to do something every year 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.600
 different this we do not really have a 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.700
 ritual is what the ritual would be the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.070
 be in family that is the most 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.140
 important to us what I can 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.310
 to say is that we prepare the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.170
 nochebuena food before it's that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.460
 law not that we prepare the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.979
 food 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.440
 and then every year we eat something 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.210
 different then I think that that's 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.110
 also what gives you a little bit more of 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.260
 flavors can be said to Christmas 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.190
 what we do exciting and also more 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.230
 warm 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.440
 Be with the family 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.099
 it's black that my best moments and the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.400
 most awaited moment to the whole year be 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:28.519
 in the cabin with my family I'm watching 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.860
 TV or just enjoying from 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.780
 certain talks that the one campfire of 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.100
 a chimney 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.290
 I think it would be like what we do 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.430
 when we went out for Christmas we passed the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.430
 Christmas with my uncles 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.200
 so if we have the tradition of 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.560
 trample the baby 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.379
 we sing to him we develop not 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.879
 practically sometimes we had it between 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.879
 between the cousins ​​also 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.880
 for example this pleasure that yes is payment 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.470
 of law in the case of us sometimes 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.380
 we would impress 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.780
 I think that the most important thing in the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.660
 Christmas word for my family is 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.480
 simply living together does not enjoy 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.390
 First of all, because we are 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.700
 together thank God that we are 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.470
 together and we can enjoy our 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.950
 company and then 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.620
 just live a moment 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.300
 hello record friends still the corral 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.459
 and some political world runner-up 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.819
 receive my best wishes for this 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.819
 Christmas
