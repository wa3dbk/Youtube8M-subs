00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.140 

say<00:01:14.760> about<00:01:14.970> three<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> half<00:01:16.290> months<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
say about three and a half months and

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.960 
say about three and a half months and
then<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> offense<00:01:19.259> broke<00:01:19.970> after

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
then one of the offense broke after

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.390 
then one of the offense broke after
three<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.360> half<00:01:21.479> months<00:01:21.960> she<00:01:22.950> wasn't<00:01:23.369> very

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
three and a half months she wasn't very

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.429 
three and a half months she wasn't very
happy<00:01:23.640> about<00:01:25.189> and<00:01:29.329> so<00:01:30.329> basically<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.170> got

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
happy about and so basically then I got

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.050 
happy about and so basically then I got
these<00:01:31.560> ones<00:01:32.299> which<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.229> say<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:35.000> lot<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
these ones which I have to say a lot a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.280 
these ones which I have to say a lot a
lot<00:01:36.329> better<00:01:36.659> than<00:01:37.619> Skullcandy<00:01:38.810> one<00:01:39.810> because<00:01:40.200> I

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
lot better than Skullcandy one because I

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.609 
lot better than Skullcandy one because I
don't<00:01:40.470> think<00:01:40.530> they'll<00:01:40.740> break<00:01:40.950> as<00:01:41.159> easily<00:01:42.619> to

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
don't think they'll break as easily to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.840 
don't think they'll break as easily to
the<00:01:44.159> sound<00:01:44.490> quality's<00:01:44.970> better<00:01:46.490> three<00:01:47.490> they

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the sound quality's better three they

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.550 
the sound quality's better three they
were<00:01:47.909> actually<00:01:48.329> cheaper<00:01:48.840> than<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> school

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
were actually cheaper than the school

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.270 
were actually cheaper than the school
candies<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:54.380> thing<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> only<00:01:56.130> thing

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
candies and I thing is the only thing

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.459 
candies and I thing is the only thing
that<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> wish<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:58.049> sin<00:01:58.649> has<00:01:59.040> had<00:01:59.360> is<00:02:00.469> they

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that I wish this sin has had is they

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.760 
that I wish this sin has had is they
don't<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.920> like<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.909> slider<00:02:03.530> going<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
don't have like a slider going on the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.359 
don't have like a slider going on the
wires<00:02:04.979> at<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.219> end<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:06.270> they<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.630> stay<00:02:06.930> out

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
wires at the end so they just stay out

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.170 
wires at the end so they just stay out
and<00:02:08.369> they<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.580> get<00:02:08.849> tangled<00:02:09.950> quite<00:02:10.950> easily

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and they do get tangled quite easily

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.569 
and they do get tangled quite easily
but<00:02:13.019> they<00:02:13.140> don't<00:02:13.260> take<00:02:13.470> long<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> entangle<00:02:14.099> so

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
but they don't take long to entangle so

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.819 
but they don't take long to entangle so
that's<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.689> they<00:02:15.840> only<00:02:15.989> bad<00:02:16.260> point<00:02:16.470> by<00:02:16.680> these

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
that's like they only bad point by these

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:23.119
