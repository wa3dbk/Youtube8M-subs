00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.199
 with the foot a dad 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.669
 the new total coverage irrigation system is a semi system 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:23.580
 laptop 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.890
 designed by a platform of interest for irrigation applications of the girl 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.390
 in low volume 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.520
 this system of girls pressure called full coverage 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.150
 unfortunately 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.940
 passed on that the application sheet 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.450
 must not exceed the infiltration rate of the soil 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.720
 avoiding with this an enclosure 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.820
 and runoff translated into compacted soil and with low oxygenation that 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.820
 edits its time that the good development of the tuber 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.050
 apply the risk taking into account the concept of low volume 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.270
 allows greater coordination and an appropriate merit in the profile of the 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.030
 ground 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.600
 in the case of the potato the first 30 to 40 centimeters deep 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.380
 the system and risk and hernÃ¡n sell designed to irrigate him 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.659
 the reason for this raptor 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.990
 for its boots stores simulates the effect of light rain 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.370
 and consists of the ends of polyethylene hoses 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.770
 tubinga quick connector 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.020
 and in people of low volume 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.250
 which in the case of Mexico are mainly used 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.310
 the super 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.250
 10 511 like this 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.250
 of the naandanjain range 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.200
 the main advantages of the Kyrgyzstan theme of naandanjain 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.860
 low precipitation rate 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.469
 high efficiency and uniformity of distribution 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.119
 optimal availability of nutrients for the root system 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.090
 increase in yields up to 40 to 70 tons per hectare 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.570
 according to the different types of species and the station 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:15.969
 thanks to potato farmers who have been for generations 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.379
 open to try new technologies that allow them to make their 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.939
 resources for greater profits 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.679
 the system serves is so demanding 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:29.999
 is demonstrating the benefits it offers in terms of the production of 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.999
 potato in the different production areas of the country 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.979
 allows to moisten the ground without creating puddles 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.780
 prevents soil compaction 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.780
 due to the low volume of precipitation 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.289
 3 points 2 to three points 9 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.229
 millimeters per hour that are handled 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.139
 by avoiding compaction 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:57.089
 air action is allowed inside the ground giving a feeling of soil 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:03:02.339
 ozone and therefore allowing a better assimilation of nutrients the 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:04.629
 tuber development 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.849
 due to its full coverage 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.390
 allows some greater uniformity in the explanation of the risk sheet 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:18.229
 The system allows applications of foliar substances and fertilizers 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:19.739
 uniform way 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.969
 as a consequence they also have dad's size with better reports 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:25.449
 commercial value 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.859
 because no clods are created 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.579
 At the time of harvest a potato is obtained without major physical damage and very 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.539
 cute 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:37.689
 can respond faster to extreme heat situations 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:38.540
 or cold 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.279
 in case of frost 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:46.849
 the performance has increased bats from 45 to 70 tons per 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.359
 hectare 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.909
 It is a team that will last for more than 10 years so the investment only 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.499
 it will be once 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.949
 in the first season he won three races 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:59.520
 production costs 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.569
 at least they have been the same 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.890
 but the performance 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.890
 It has increased
