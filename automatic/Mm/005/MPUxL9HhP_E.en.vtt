about<00:02:33.600> many<00:02:33.870> GDI<00:02:34.470> systems<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.700> low

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
about many GDI systems is that the low

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.730 
about many GDI systems is that the low
pressure<00:02:36.060> pump<00:02:36.540> may<00:02:36.720> also<00:02:36.930> run<00:02:37.350> when<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
pressure pump may also run when the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.620
