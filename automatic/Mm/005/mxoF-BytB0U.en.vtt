over there and that's just about that so

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.860 
over there and that's just about that so
now<00:02:12.950> I'm<00:02:13.010> gonna<00:02:13.130> look<00:02:13.790> at<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.180> rock<00:02:14.360> formation

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
now I'm gonna look at the rock formation

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.210 
now I'm gonna look at the rock formation
this<00:02:14.960> is<00:02:15.050> my<00:02:15.140> first<00:02:15.350> ever<00:02:15.470> rock<00:02:15.680> formation

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
this is my first ever rock formation

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.070 
this is my first ever rock formation
it's<00:02:16.430> really<00:02:16.640> small<00:02:16.850> edge<00:02:17.000> 1/2

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
it's really small edge 1/2

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.550 
it's really small edge 1/2
see<00:02:18.590> what<00:02:18.800> I<00:02:18.830> could<00:02:19.040> do<00:02:19.250> with<00:02:20.060> rocks<00:02:20.500> let<00:02:21.500> me

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
see what I could do with rocks let me

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.260 
see what I could do with rocks let me
see<00:02:21.710> some<00:02:21.860> sand<00:02:22.100> down<00:02:22.340> there<00:02:22.640> nice<00:02:22.970> little

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
see some sand down there nice little

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.700 
see some sand down there nice little
detail<00:02:24.700> come<00:02:25.700> around<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:27.050> other<00:02:27.110> side<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.590> the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
detail come around the other side of the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.360 
detail come around the other side of the
rock<00:02:28.310> formation<00:02:30.040> that's<00:02:31.040> what<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.250> looks

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
rock formation that's what that looks

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.240 
rock formation that's what that looks
like<00:02:31.840> kind<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.900> small<00:02:33.140> kind<00:02:33.320> of<00:02:33.350> cute<00:02:33.620> I'm

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
like kind of small kind of cute I'm

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.820 
like kind of small kind of cute I'm
proud<00:02:34.490> of<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:34.750> looks<00:02:35.750> pretty<00:02:36.020> neat<00:02:36.200> for<00:02:36.800> a

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
proud of it looks pretty neat for a

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.870 
proud of it looks pretty neat for a
first-timer<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:39.440> here's<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.950> tree<00:02:40.190> looks

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
first-timer and here's the tree looks

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.490 
first-timer and here's the tree looks
sort<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.180> like<00:02:41.240> my<00:02:41.420> last<00:02:41.600> tree<00:02:41.930> because<00:02:42.350> I

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
sort of like my last tree because I

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.040 
sort of like my last tree because I
don't<00:02:42.650> have<00:02:42.770> many<00:02:43.150> good<00:02:44.150> tree<00:02:44.450> pieces<00:02:44.870> but

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
don't have many good tree pieces but

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.830 
don't have many good tree pieces but
this<00:02:45.230> is<00:02:45.290> sort<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.650> neat<00:02:45.830> way<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:46.550> did<00:02:46.820> this<00:02:47.000> one

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.930 

so<00:02:53.840> yeah<00:02:54.050> that's<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.410> tree<00:02:54.710> and<00:02:55.640> here's<00:02:55.880> a

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
so yeah that's the tree and here's a

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.740 
so yeah that's the tree and here's a
little<00:02:56.210> bit<00:02:56.300> of<00:02:56.450> filling<00:02:56.690> uh<00:02:56.990> I<00:02:57.290> did<00:02:58.280> over<00:02:58.490> here

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
little bit of filling uh I did over here

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.410 
little bit of filling uh I did over here
just<00:02:59.750> a<00:03:00.010> little<00:03:01.010> mound<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.370> dirt<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:02.180> can't

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
just a little mound of dirt you can't

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.070 
just a little mound of dirt you can't
see<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.660> too<00:03:02.900> -<00:03:03.110> well<00:03:04.540> but<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.630> sort<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.900> goes

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
see that too - well but it sort of goes

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.820 
see that too - well but it sort of goes
up<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.500> little<00:03:06.740> bit<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.070> goes<00:03:07.550> down<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.060> up

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
up a little bit and goes down and up

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.930 
up a little bit and goes down and up
what<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:09.860> really<00:03:10.070> like<00:03:10.220> most<00:03:10.250> about<00:03:10.580> this<00:03:10.730> mock

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
what I really like most about this mock

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.210 
what I really like most about this mock
and<00:03:11.060> what<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.180> really<00:03:11.420> wanted<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.750> do<00:03:11.900> was<00:03:12.860> the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
and what I really wanted to do was the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.970 
and what I really wanted to do was the
fact<00:03:13.460> that<00:03:13.550> all<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.940> plants<00:03:14.300> are<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:14.630> tall<00:03:14.990> you

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
fact that all the plants are so tall you

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.620 
fact that all the plants are so tall you
can<00:03:16.190> even<00:03:16.310> see<00:03:16.490> the<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.880> troopers<00:03:17.210> over<00:03:17.450> there

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
can even see the the troopers over there

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.190 
can even see the the troopers over there
and<00:03:17.870> if<00:03:18.880> if<00:03:19.880> there<00:03:20.120> was<00:03:20.240> a<00:03:20.270> chondroitin<00:03:21.080> or

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
and if if there was a chondroitin or

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.900 
and if if there was a chondroitin or
something<00:03:21.590> or<00:03:21.800> like<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:21.980> droid<00:03:22.459> ship<00:03:22.760> they

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
something or like a droid ship they

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.800 
something or like a droid ship they
wouldn't<00:03:23.120> be<00:03:23.180> able<00:03:23.240> to<00:03:23.330> see<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.630> troops

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
wouldn't be able to see the troops

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.120 
wouldn't be able to see the troops
because<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.110> know<00:03:24.200> they<00:03:24.320> have<00:03:24.440> their<00:03:24.560> camo<00:03:24.830> on

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
because you know they have their camo on

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.610 
because you know they have their camo on
and<00:03:25.540> all<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.660> can<00:03:26.810> see<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:26.959> pretty<00:03:27.050> coming<00:03:27.500> out

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
and all you can see is pretty coming out

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.380 
and all you can see is pretty coming out
of<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.950> forest<00:03:28.280> right<00:03:28.400> there<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:28.940> there's

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
of the forest right there and there's

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.040 
of the forest right there and there's
more<00:03:29.540> troops<00:03:29.780> on<00:03:29.930> bringing<00:03:30.440> up<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.740> rear<00:03:32.050> with

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
more troops on bringing up the rear with

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.690 
more troops on bringing up the rear with
lots<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.320> nice<00:03:33.530> little<00:03:33.860> plant<00:03:34.040> detailing

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
lots of nice little plant detailing

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.310 
lots of nice little plant detailing
along<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.720> top<00:03:35.959> over<00:03:36.230> there<00:03:38.050> so<00:03:39.050> that's<00:03:39.200> just

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
along the top over there so that's just

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.820 
along the top over there so that's just
about<00:03:39.500> it

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
about it

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.090

for<00:03:40.490> this<00:03:40.640> small<00:03:41.120> little<00:03:41.270> mock<00:03:41.950> didn't<00:03:42.950> take

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
for this small little mock didn't take

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.620 
for this small little mock didn't take
me<00:03:43.220> too<00:03:43.430> too<00:03:43.610> long<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.970> build<00:03:44.090> but<00:03:44.360> at<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.480> same

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
me too too long to build but at the same

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.220 
me too too long to build but at the same
time<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:45.400> took<00:03:46.400> me<00:03:46.580> a<00:03:46.610> while<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:46.790> obviously<00:03:47.390> get
