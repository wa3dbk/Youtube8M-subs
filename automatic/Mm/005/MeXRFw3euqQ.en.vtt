00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.250
 thing I put my oven to preheated to 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.199
 180 Â° and I will empty this jar of yoghurt 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.189
 wash it and wipe it in order to 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.189
 serve as a bern to the arts 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:15.170
 I add 1/2 jar of yoghurt of the ticket 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:17.509
 I add two jars of sugar via the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.210
 now 3 little flour as well as the 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.159
 yeast and sheers blend well together 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.479
 from the center to the edge well 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.369

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.369
 it's around them to go on the track 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.479
 I only have to perfume the dough 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.070

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.719

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.899
 use it 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.439
 go I poured my dough into a mold 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.340
 I took a hinged mold because 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.750
 that it's a lot easier to 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.439
 unmold but a mold will miss 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.289
 perfectly 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:00.210

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.210
 he put a greaseproof paper at the bottom 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.970
