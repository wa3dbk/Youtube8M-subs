you should know that by now yeah there
we<00:00:11.280> go<00:00:11.310> it's<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.330> imagine<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:13.080> know

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
we go it's just to imagine you know

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.990 
we go it's just to imagine you know
having<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.830> set<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.100> cojones<00:00:14.400> big<00:00:14.700> enough<00:00:14.880> to

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
having a set of cojones big enough to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.849 
having a set of cojones big enough to
fit<00:00:15.180> on<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.420> bike<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.780> think<00:00:15.810> probably<00:00:16.410> takes
