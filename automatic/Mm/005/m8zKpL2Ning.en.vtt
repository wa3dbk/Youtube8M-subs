you download it so anyway one thing that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.869 
you download it so anyway one thing that
adds<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.449> moon<00:00:54.980> in<00:00:55.980> order<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.309> make<00:00:56.640> the

rocket a brain in order to make the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.600 
rocket a brain in order to make the
portal<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.019> go<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:04.019> moon<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.369> need

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
portal to go to the of the moon you need

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.270 
portal to go to the of the moon you need
to<00:01:05.880> make<00:01:06.149> a<00:01:06.360> rocket<00:01:06.990> frame<00:01:07.320> which<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.800> a<00:01:07.830> block

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
to make a rocket frame which is a block

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.230 
to make a rocket frame which is a block
that<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.729> use<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.920> make<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.280> pole<00:01:11.670> which<00:01:12.000> you

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that you use to make the pole which you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.590 
that you use to make the pole which you
craft<00:01:12.570> using<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.229> recipe<00:01:13.770> right<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:15.210> if

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
craft using this recipe right here so if

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.350 
craft using this recipe right here so if
I<00:01:15.780> put<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.050> in<00:01:16.440> there<00:01:17.119> might<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.149> wondering

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
I put this in there might be wondering

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.180 
I put this in there might be wondering
what's<00:01:18.690> moonstone<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.740> does<00:01:19.920> look<00:01:20.159> like

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
what's moonstone it does look like

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.400 
what's moonstone it does look like
diamonds<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:21.239> don't<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.899> if<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.229> use

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
diamonds I don't know if you can use

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.600 
diamonds I don't know if you can use
diamonds<00:01:22.979> or<00:01:23.099> not<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:25.310> because<00:01:26.310> diamonds

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
diamonds or not but because diamonds

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.370 
diamonds or not but because diamonds
also<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.209> the<00:01:27.330> name<00:01:27.479> moonstone<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.289> think

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
also have the name moonstone so I think

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.650 
also have the name moonstone so I think
later<00:01:28.890> he<00:01:29.160> will<00:01:29.280> make<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.789> its<00:01:30.000> own<00:01:30.239> block

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
later he will make this its own block

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.660 
later he will make this its own block
because<00:01:30.899> there<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.289> a<00:01:31.319> moonstone<00:01:32.099> or<00:01:32.429> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
because there is a moonstone or the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.089 
because there is a moonstone or the
spots<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.209> ground<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.929> anyway<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.590> get<00:01:34.739> the

00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:35.099 
spots on the ground so anyway to get the

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:38.059 
spots on the ground so anyway to get the
rocket<00:01:35.700> frame<00:01:36.149> and<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:37.080> build<00:01:37.709> a

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
rocket frame and then we can build a

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.990 
rocket frame and then we can build a
rocket<00:01:38.759> frame<00:01:39.030> right<00:01:39.300> here<00:01:39.360> oh<00:01:40.429> it's<00:01:41.429> me<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.849> do

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
rocket frame right here oh it's me to do

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.650 
rocket frame right here oh it's me to do
that<00:01:42.890> alright<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.130> pretty<00:01:44.729> much<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.479> be

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
that alright so pretty much it can be

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.419 
that alright so pretty much it can be
made<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:45.899> uh<00:01:47.209> 10<00:01:48.209> with<00:01:48.690> just<00:01:49.349> 10<00:01:49.709> blocks<00:01:50.009> I

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
made with uh 10 with just 10 blocks I

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.510 
made with uh 10 with just 10 blocks I
believe<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.920> doesn't<00:01:53.039> need<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.369> have

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
believe so like it doesn't need to have

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.219 
believe so like it doesn't need to have
like<00:01:53.670> these<00:01:53.849> four<00:01:54.119> corners<00:01:54.569> on<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.929> do<00:01:54.989> not

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
like these four corners on it I do not

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.080 
like these four corners on it I do not
believe<00:01:55.379> so<00:01:55.800> no<00:01:56.250> you're<00:01:56.459> probably<00:01:56.700> wondering

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
believe so no you're probably wondering

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.210 
believe so no you're probably wondering
how<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.780> activate<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.530> portal<00:01:58.950> well<00:01:59.099> in

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
how do you activate this portal well in

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.680 
how do you activate this portal well in
order<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.940> you<00:02:00.000> need<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.660> a

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
order to do that you need to have a

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.949 
order to do that you need to have a
rocket<00:02:01.410> which<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.860> make<00:02:02.190> using<00:02:02.959> this

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
rocket which you make using this

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.930 
rocket which you make using this

in<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.769> crafting<00:02:10.160> bench<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:11.569> should<00:02:11.870> get<00:02:12.349> the

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
in the crafting bench you should get the

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.380 
in the crafting bench you should get the
rocket<00:02:13.459> so<00:02:14.239> if<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:14.989> right<00:02:15.230> click<00:02:15.260> here<00:02:15.739> you

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
rocket so if you right click here you

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
rocket so if you right click here you
activate<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.840> portal<00:02:18.140> you're<00:02:18.260> probably

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
activate the portal you're probably

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.710 
activate the portal you're probably
wondering<00:02:18.769> why<00:02:18.860> there's<00:02:19.129> no<00:02:19.250> sounds<00:02:19.700> I'll<00:02:20.239> get

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
wondering why there's no sounds I'll get

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.860 
wondering why there's no sounds I'll get
to<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:20.870> later<00:02:21.220> anyway<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.700> this<00:02:23.569> is<00:02:23.660> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
to that later anyway so this is the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.530 
to that later anyway so this is the
rocket<00:02:24.260> frame<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:24.709> if<00:02:24.799> we<00:02:24.890> go<00:02:25.069> in<00:02:25.250> should<00:02:26.120> spawn

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
rocket frame so if we go in should spawn

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.640 
rocket frame so if we go in should spawn
us<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:27.879> the<00:02:28.879> moon<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.900> which<00:02:30.110> right<00:02:30.379> now<00:02:30.410> is

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
us in the moon of which right now is

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.809 
us in the moon of which right now is
just<00:02:32.019> right<00:02:33.019> now<00:02:33.170> it's<00:02:33.349> just<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.799> bunch<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.129> dirt

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
just right now it's just a bunch of dirt

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.410 
just right now it's just a bunch of dirt
but<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:35.959> is<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> work<00:02:36.830> in<00:02:37.010> progress<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:37.760> there

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
but this is a work in progress so there

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.990 
but this is a work in progress so there
is<00:02:38.599> moon<00:02:38.900> rock<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:40.099> bunch<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.430> dirt<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.790> think

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
is moon rock and a bunch of dirt I think

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.490 
is moon rock and a bunch of dirt I think
so<00:02:41.120> you'll<00:02:41.329> change<00:02:41.599> this<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.079> a<00:02:42.110> different

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
so you'll change this to a different

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.819 
so you'll change this to a different
block<00:02:42.680> but<00:02:42.890> I'm<00:02:42.980> not<00:02:43.130> sure<00:02:43.340> another<00:02:44.650> part<00:02:45.650> of

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
block but I'm not sure another part of

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.400 
block but I'm not sure another part of
this<00:02:46.010> mod<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.579> they<00:02:46.940> added<00:02:47.360> new<00:02:47.540> weapons<00:02:48.019> of

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
this mod is they added new weapons of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.089 
this mod is they added new weapons of
which<00:02:49.069> is<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:50.630> three<00:02:50.959> new<00:02:51.140> guns<00:02:51.440> one<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:51.980> them

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
which is the three new guns one of them

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.850 
which is the three new guns one of them
is<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.459> m9<00:02:53.000> which<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.900> crap<00:02:54.200> using<00:02:54.560> an<00:02:54.680> iron

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
is the m9 which you crap using an iron

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.140 
is the m9 which you crap using an iron
ingot<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.640> bow<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:57.319> coal<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.610> get<00:02:58.849> the

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
ingot a bow and a coal and you get the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.270 
ingot a bow and a coal and you get the
m9<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:01.069> m16<00:03:01.700> is<00:03:01.989> just<00:03:02.989> get<00:03:03.230> one<00:03:03.709> iron<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.130> get<00:03:04.250> a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
m9 the m16 is just get one iron to get a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.369 
m9 the m16 is just get one iron to get a
bow<00:03:04.489> in<00:03:04.519> obsidian<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:05.660> pretty<00:03:05.900> much<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.170> same

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
bow in obsidian so pretty much the same

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.250 
bow in obsidian so pretty much the same
thing<00:03:06.440> as<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:06.950> m9<00:03:07.340> except<00:03:08.299> with<00:03:08.540> obsidian<00:03:08.930> and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
thing as the m9 except with obsidian and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.240 
thing as the m9 except with obsidian and
then<00:03:09.769> bullet<00:03:10.549> they<00:03:10.760> are<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:12.200> M<00:03:12.350> ammunition

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
then bullet they are the M ammunition

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.150 
then bullet they are the M ammunition
for<00:03:13.459> these<00:03:13.609> guns<00:03:14.060> are<00:03:14.329> bullets<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.109> you<00:03:15.739> use

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
for these guns are bullets so you use

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.539 
for these guns are bullets so you use
gunpowder<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.690> all<00:03:18.620> picking<00:03:18.829> that<00:03:18.980> up<00:03:19.040> use

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
gunpowder and all picking that up use

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.729 
gunpowder and all picking that up use
gunpowder<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.299> iron<00:03:20.480> in<00:03:20.690> this<00:03:20.810> fashion<00:03:21.019> and

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
gunpowder and iron in this fashion and

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.509 
gunpowder and iron in this fashion and
crafting<00:03:22.100> menu<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.850> get<00:03:23.120> bullets<00:03:23.799> so<00:03:24.799> another

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
crafting menu to get bullets so another

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.849 
crafting menu to get bullets so another
type<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.150> gun<00:03:26.600> is<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.989> flamethrower<00:03:27.590> which

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
type of gun is the flamethrower which

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.449 
type of gun is the flamethrower which
you<00:03:28.010> make<00:03:28.370> with<00:03:29.180> glass<00:03:29.989> flint<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:30.889> steel<00:03:31.040> and

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
you make with glass flint and steel and

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.920 
you make with glass flint and steel and
iron<00:03:31.670> in<00:03:31.850> this<00:03:32.180> fashion<00:03:32.359> which<00:03:32.720> the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
iron in this fashion which the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.849 
iron in this fashion which the
flamethrower<00:03:33.500> is<00:03:33.680> just<00:03:33.980> another<00:03:34.790> gun<00:03:35.859> which

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
flamethrower is just another gun which

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.240 
flamethrower is just another gun which
is<00:03:37.160> instead<00:03:38.120> of<00:03:38.299> being<00:03:38.829> instead<00:03:39.829> of<00:03:39.920> having

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
is instead of being instead of having

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.390 
is instead of being instead of having
bullets<00:03:41.060> as<00:03:41.269> ammunition<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:42.470> has<00:03:42.769> something

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
bullets as ammunition it has something

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.530 
bullets as ammunition it has something
called<00:03:43.430> for<00:03:44.359> pain<00:03:44.569> right<00:03:45.230> here<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:46.540> propane

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
called for pain right here so propane

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.500 
called for pain right here so propane
you<00:03:47.810> make<00:03:48.139> using<00:03:48.739> flint<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.459> steel<00:03:49.639> and<00:03:50.030> lava

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
you make using flint and steel and lava

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.690 
you make using flint and steel and lava
bucket<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:51.109> then<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.620> get<00:03:51.739> four<00:03:51.980> panes<00:03:52.280> of

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
bucket and then you get four panes of

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.319 
bucket and then you get four panes of
which<00:03:53.299> if<00:03:53.599> you<00:03:53.930> craft<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.410> like<00:03:54.560> this<00:03:54.829> you<00:03:55.669> get

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
which if you craft it like this you get

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.280 
which if you craft it like this you get
a<00:03:56.359> bullet<00:03:56.720> up<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:57.169> bucket<00:03:57.590> back<00:03:57.769> so<00:03:58.130> that's<00:03:58.880> good

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
a bullet up a bucket back so that's good

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.800 
a bullet up a bucket back so that's good
so<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.829> get<00:04:00.950> propane<00:04:01.370> for<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.810> flamethrowers

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
so you get propane for the flamethrowers

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.270 
so you get propane for the flamethrowers
and<00:04:03.019> you<00:04:03.739> get<00:04:03.980> bullets<00:04:04.489> for<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:05.120> other<00:04:05.480> guns

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
and you get bullets for the other guns

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.800 
and you get bullets for the other guns
alright<00:04:07.280> so<00:04:07.519> now<00:04:07.790> you're<00:04:08.060> probably<00:04:08.239> wondering

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
alright so now you're probably wondering

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.990 
alright so now you're probably wondering
what<00:04:09.019> I'm<00:04:09.049> going<00:04:09.380> to<00:04:09.410> do<00:04:09.680> with<00:04:10.310> these<00:04:10.489> hundred

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
what I'm going to do with these hundred

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.599 
what I'm going to do with these hundred
skeletons<00:04:11.630> and<00:04:11.959> I'm<00:04:12.709> going<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.040> test<00:04:13.430> the

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
skeletons and I'm going to test the

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:14.900 
skeletons and I'm going to test the
strength<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.359> the

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
strength of the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.970 
strength of the
guns<00:04:15.210> by<00:04:15.870> shooting<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.470> crap<00:04:16.590> out<00:04:16.800> of<00:04:16.830> these

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
guns by shooting the crap out of these

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.350 
guns by shooting the crap out of these
guys<00:04:17.190> who<00:04:17.340> are<00:04:17.459> already<00:04:17.610> shooting<00:04:17.910> crap<00:04:18.209> out

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.360 
guys who are already shooting crap out

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.699 
guys who are already shooting crap out
of<00:04:18.390> each<00:04:18.510> other<00:04:18.660> so<00:04:18.810> we're<00:04:19.050> gonna<00:04:19.140> see<00:04:19.410> how

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
of each other so we're gonna see how

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.030 
of each other so we're gonna see how
long<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:20.340> takes<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.700> kill<00:04:21.000> them<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:22.530> hopefully

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
long it takes to kill them so hopefully

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.920 
long it takes to kill them so hopefully
they<00:04:23.310> don't<00:04:23.430> just<00:04:23.670> go<00:04:23.850> ahead<00:04:24.000> kill<00:04:24.600> each<00:04:24.750> other

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
they don't just go ahead kill each other

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.190 
they don't just go ahead kill each other
so<00:04:25.800> oh<00:04:26.010> crap<00:04:27.440> somebody<00:04:28.440> had<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.710> power<00:04:30.200> punch

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
so oh crap somebody had a power punch

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.330 
so oh crap somebody had a power punch
but<00:04:31.910> whoa<00:04:33.140> yeah<00:04:34.140> this<00:04:34.350> is<00:04:34.500> really<00:04:34.680> laggy<00:04:34.980> can

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
but whoa yeah this is really laggy can

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.010 
but whoa yeah this is really laggy can
do<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:35.640> many<00:04:35.730> skeletons<00:04:36.030> alright<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:36.930> we're

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
do so many skeletons alright so we're

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.750 
do so many skeletons alright so we're
gonna<00:04:37.110> see<00:04:37.350> how<00:04:37.470> long<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:37.950> takes<00:04:38.220> because

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
gonna see how long this takes because

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.070 
gonna see how long this takes because
this<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.510> guns<00:04:39.810> are<00:04:40.110> said<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.770> be<00:04:40.940> overpowered

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
this the guns are said to be overpowered

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.800 
this the guns are said to be overpowered
slightly<00:04:43.080> in<00:04:43.350> quotations<00:04:44.070> so<00:04:44.730> I<00:04:45.090> actually

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
slightly in quotations so I actually

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.110 
slightly in quotations so I actually
have<00:04:46.320> tested<00:04:46.860> out<00:04:47.040> these<00:04:47.340> guns<00:04:47.760> off<00:04:48.350> camera

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
have tested out these guns off camera

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.900 
have tested out these guns off camera
but<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.390> did<00:04:51.630> kind<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:52.110> seem<00:04:52.410> overpowered<00:04:53.160> to

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
but it did kind of seem overpowered to

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.950 
but it did kind of seem overpowered to
me<00:04:54.090> because<00:04:54.300> it's<00:04:54.570> like<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.840> one<00:04:55.500> shot<00:04:55.530> kills

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
me because it's like it one shot kills

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.310 
me because it's like it one shot kills
practically<00:04:57.960> every<00:04:58.320> mod<00:04:58.560> or<00:04:59.520> not<00:04:59.670> much<00:04:59.850> mob

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
practically every mod or not much mob

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.380 
practically every mod or not much mob
that<00:05:01.320> exists<00:05:01.950> like<00:05:02.160> I<00:05:02.370> i<00:05:02.610> spawned<00:05:03.060> a<00:05:03.150> bunch<00:05:03.300> of

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
that exists like I i spawned a bunch of

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.030 
that exists like I i spawned a bunch of
gas<00:05:03.600> I<00:05:03.870> shot<00:05:04.050> them<00:05:04.140> all<00:05:04.260> down<00:05:04.440> with<00:05:04.590> one<00:05:04.770> shot

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
gas I shot them all down with one shot

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.140 
gas I shot them all down with one shot
so<00:05:05.820> it<00:05:05.970> is<00:05:06.000> it's<00:05:06.480> like<00:05:06.690> rapid<00:05:07.140> fire<00:05:07.350> arrows

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
so it is it's like rapid fire arrows

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.940 
so it is it's like rapid fire arrows
except<00:05:09.150> it<00:05:11.300> actually<00:05:12.300> kills<00:05:12.990> mobs<00:05:13.350> in<00:05:13.530> one<00:05:13.740> hit

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
except it actually kills mobs in one hit

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.340 
except it actually kills mobs in one hit
so<00:05:14.190> they<00:05:14.310> are<00:05:14.460> overpowered<00:05:15.210> because<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.200> mean

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
so they are overpowered because I mean

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.840 
so they are overpowered because I mean
like<00:05:16.500> it<00:05:16.650> but<00:05:16.740> if<00:05:16.890> a<00:05:16.950> creeper<00:05:17.250> shows<00:05:17.400> up<00:05:17.640> boom

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
like it but if a creeper shows up boom

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.490 
like it but if a creeper shows up boom
dead<00:05:18.240> like<00:05:18.690> it<00:05:18.870> it's<00:05:19.080> like<00:05:20.040> bows<00:05:20.340> are<00:05:20.810> way<00:05:21.810> down

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
dead like it it's like bows are way down

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.740 
dead like it it's like bows are way down
the<00:05:22.740> list<00:05:23.430> like<00:05:23.880> if<00:05:24.060> you<00:05:24.150> were<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.360> put<00:05:24.510> it<00:05:24.630> on<00:05:24.720> a

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
the list like if you were to put it on a

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.830 
the list like if you were to put it on a
scale<00:05:25.140> of<00:05:25.170> 1<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:25.620> 10<00:05:25.760> all<00:05:26.760> these<00:05:27.030> guns<00:05:27.360> would<00:05:27.660> be

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
scale of 1 to 10 all these guns would be

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.159 
scale of 1 to 10 all these guns would be
10<00:05:28.730> yeah<00:05:29.730> pretty<00:05:29.880> much<00:05:30.030> they<00:05:30.300> all<00:05:30.450> are<00:05:30.780> the

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
10 yeah pretty much they all are the

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.200 
10 yeah pretty much they all are the
same<00:05:31.200> the<00:05:31.800> flamethrowers<00:05:32.490> pretty<00:05:32.790> much<00:05:32.970> just

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
same the flamethrowers pretty much just

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.130 
same the flamethrowers pretty much just
the<00:05:33.390> other<00:05:33.510> two<00:05:33.750> guns<00:05:34.020> except<00:05:34.980> for<00:05:35.310> it<00:05:36.140> sets

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
the other two guns except for it sets

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.900 
the other two guns except for it sets
the<00:05:37.260> mobs<00:05:37.650> on<00:05:37.860> fire<00:05:38.360> the<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:40.140> m16<00:05:41.070> and<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.490> m9

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
the mobs on fire the the m16 and the m9

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.430 
the mobs on fire the the m16 and the m9
actually<00:05:42.390> shoot<00:05:42.600> at<00:05:42.690> the<00:05:42.810> same<00:05:43.020> speed<00:05:43.410> I

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
actually shoot at the same speed I

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.310 
actually shoot at the same speed I
believe<00:05:44.030> okay<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.300> just<00:05:45.690> killed<00:05:45.960> them<00:05:46.080> all

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
believe okay I just killed them all

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.700 
believe okay I just killed them all
anyway<00:05:47.250> so<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.700> m9<00:05:48.390> and<00:05:48.660> the<00:05:48.720> m16<00:05:49.290> actually

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
anyway so the m9 and the m16 actually

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.750 
anyway so the m9 and the m16 actually
shoot<00:05:49.950> with<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.190> same<00:05:50.460> speed<00:05:50.940> holy<00:05:51.270> crap<00:05:51.720> a

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
shoot with the same speed holy crap a

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.380 
shoot with the same speed holy crap a
lot<00:05:53.760> of<00:05:53.790> arrows<00:05:54.030> there

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
lot of arrows there

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.830 
lot of arrows there
so<00:05:57.090> pretty<00:05:58.090> much<00:05:58.180> they're<00:05:58.510> both<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.780> same

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
so pretty much they're both the same

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.760 
so pretty much they're both the same
except<00:05:59.680> m9<00:06:00.130> take<00:06:00.400> coal<00:06:00.790> and<00:06:01.600> then<00:06:01.720> 16<00:06:02.170> takes

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
except m9 take coal and then 16 takes

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.710 
except m9 take coal and then 16 takes
sitting<00:06:03.370> I<00:06:03.460> think<00:06:03.670> I'm<00:06:03.760> 16<00:06:04.150> actually<00:06:04.450> last

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
sitting I think I'm 16 actually last

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.480 
sitting I think I'm 16 actually last
longer<00:06:05.230> so<00:06:05.260> they<00:06:05.770> both<00:06:06.160> have<00:06:06.220> the<00:06:06.460> same

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
longer so they both have the same

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.670 
longer so they both have the same
strength<00:06:07.090> sip<00:06:07.390> and<00:06:07.660> knives<00:06:07.870> don't<00:06:08.170> last<00:06:08.410> as

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
strength sip and knives don't last as

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.950 
strength sip and knives don't last as
long<00:06:08.710> and<00:06:09.160> then<00:06:09.280> the<00:06:09.370> flamethrowers<00:06:09.940> just<00:06:10.750> set

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
long and then the flamethrowers just set

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.170 
long and then the flamethrowers just set
them<00:06:11.110> on<00:06:11.200> fire<00:06:11.500> so<00:06:12.400> pretty<00:06:12.670> much<00:06:12.760> those<00:06:13.150> are

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
them on fire so pretty much those are

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.100 
them on fire so pretty much those are
the<00:06:13.450> guns<00:06:13.780> and<00:06:14.200> that's<00:06:15.070> the<00:06:15.400> moon<00:06:15.870> this<00:06:16.870> is<00:06:17.080> a

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
the guns and that's the moon this is a

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.220 
the guns and that's the moon this is a
work<00:06:17.530> in<00:06:17.650> progress<00:06:17.890> mod<00:06:18.340> so<00:06:19.150> that<00:06:19.630> he<00:06:19.840> will<00:06:20.020> be
