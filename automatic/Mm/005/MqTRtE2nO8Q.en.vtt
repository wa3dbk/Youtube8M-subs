put thickeners in it and that's okay

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.540

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
because I like putting tomatoes in my

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.370 
because I like putting tomatoes in my
beef<00:03:53.550> stew<00:03:53.850> just<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:54.150> little<00:03:54.360> bit<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:54.720> when<00:03:55.350> I

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
beef stew just a little bit so when I

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.710 
beef stew just a little bit so when I
open<00:03:55.800> up<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:56.010> jar<00:03:56.280> after<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:56.850> make<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.360> you<00:03:57.630> know

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
open up a jar after I make it you know

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.880 
open up a jar after I make it you know
I'm<00:03:57.810> doing<00:03:58.140> pork<00:03:58.500> jars

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
I'm doing pork jars

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.160 
I'm doing pork jars
I'm<00:03:59.370> gonna<00:03:59.550> add<00:03:59.790> some<00:04:00.180> things<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:00.959> then

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
I'm gonna add some things to it and then

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.960 
I'm gonna add some things to it and then
I'll<00:04:01.290> thicken<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:01.830> up<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.280> do<00:04:02.400> all<00:04:02.550> of<00:04:02.580> that

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
I'll thicken it up and do all of that

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.350 
I'll thicken it up and do all of that
but<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.390> figured<00:04:03.750> I'd<00:04:03.900> do<00:04:04.050> pork<00:04:04.500> jars<00:04:05.360> because

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
but I figured I'd do pork jars because

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.479 
but I figured I'd do pork jars because
you<00:04:06.810> can't<00:04:07.110> just<00:04:07.320> have<00:04:07.530> one<00:04:07.800> little<00:04:07.980> bowl<00:04:08.310> of

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
you can't just have one little bowl of

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.479 
you can't just have one little bowl of
stew<00:04:08.900> so<00:04:11.090> that's<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.450> going<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.290> then<00:04:13.739> we

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
stew so that's this going and then we

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.190 
stew so that's this going and then we
will<00:04:14.640> go<00:04:14.760> ahead<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.030> process<00:04:15.300> them<00:04:15.690> out<00:04:15.840> I

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
will go ahead and process them out I

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.130 
will go ahead and process them out I
ended<00:04:16.950> up<00:04:17.010> having<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.400> get<00:04:17.609> another<00:04:17.840> package<00:04:18.840> I

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
ended up having to get another package I

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.620 
ended up having to get another package I
only<00:04:19.290> got<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.590> smaller<00:04:20.010> package<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:21.350> meat

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
only got a smaller package of the meat

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.659 
only got a smaller package of the meat
so<00:04:24.630> when<00:04:24.990> I'm<00:04:25.110> done<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.380> think<00:04:25.560> what<00:04:25.890> else<00:04:25.979> if<00:04:26.520> I

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
so when I'm done I think what else if I

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.700 
so when I'm done I think what else if I
remember<00:04:27.120> I'll<00:04:27.330> cost<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.900> out<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.290> see<00:04:28.560> how

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
remember I'll cost it out and see how

00:04:28.710 --> 00:05:17.090 
remember I'll cost it out and see how
much<00:04:28.860> this<00:04:29.130> all<00:04:29.310> cost<00:04:29.580> okay<00:04:30.510> I'll<00:04:30.870> be<00:04:30.990> back

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.670 

look<00:05:18.100> at<00:05:18.310> these<00:05:18.550> pickled<00:05:19.120> beets<00:05:19.360> they're<00:05:20.050> so

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
look at these pickled beets they're so

and get a little bit more meat I'm gonna
just<00:06:16.960> round<00:06:17.200> it<00:06:17.380> off<00:06:17.530> so<00:06:18.070> I've<00:06:18.550> got<00:06:19.060> 1<00:06:19.630> 2<00:06:19.960> 3<00:06:19.990> 4<00:06:20.830> 5

6<00:06:21.780> 7<00:06:22.780> 8<00:06:23.170> 9<00:06:23.890> quarts<00:06:24.550> I'll<00:06:24.880> do<00:06:25.000> it<00:06:25.120> that<00:06:25.330> way<00:06:25.480> so<00:06:26.200> 9

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
6 7 8 9 quarts I'll do it that way so 9

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.140 
6 7 8 9 quarts I'll do it that way so 9
quarts<00:06:27.180> came<00:06:28.180> out<00:06:28.330> too<00:06:29.430> with<00:06:30.430> the<00:06:30.580> cost<00:06:30.790> of<00:06:31.060> the

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
quarts came out too with the cost of the

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.510 
quarts came out too with the cost of the
meat<00:06:31.360> and<00:06:31.510> the<00:06:31.870> vegetables<00:06:31.900> and<00:06:32.440> everything

meat and the vegetables and everything

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.450 
meat and the vegetables and everything
roughly<00:06:33.520> 30<00:06:34.000> bucks<00:06:34.270> so<00:06:35.230> it's<00:06:35.770> three<00:06:36.340> dollars

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
roughly 30 bucks so it's three dollars

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.570 
roughly 30 bucks so it's three dollars
and<00:06:36.880> 33<00:06:37.180> cents<00:06:37.600> Court<00:06:38.050> so<00:06:38.710> that's<00:06:39.160> pretty<00:06:39.370> good

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
and 33 cents Court so that's pretty good

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.360 
and 33 cents Court so that's pretty good
and<00:06:39.880> again<00:06:40.720> I'm<00:06:40.930> really<00:06:41.170> just<00:06:41.920> rapidly<00:06:44.370> I'm

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
and again I'm really just rapidly I'm

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.650 
and again I'm really just rapidly I'm
really<00:06:45.820> just<00:06:46.000> roughly<00:06:47.010> estimating<00:06:48.010> so<00:06:48.660> about

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
really just roughly estimating so about

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.710 
really just roughly estimating so about
three<00:06:49.900> dollars<00:06:49.990> and<00:06:50.320> 30<00:06:50.500> cents<00:06:50.800> a<00:06:50.920> quart<00:06:51.720> not

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
three dollars and 30 cents a quart not

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.550 
three dollars and 30 cents a quart not
bad<00:06:53.670> that'll<00:06:54.670> get<00:06:54.820> me<00:06:54.940> a<00:06:54.970> couple<00:06:55.180> meals<00:06:55.560> and

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
bad that'll get me a couple meals and

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.260 
bad that'll get me a couple meals and
then<00:06:56.860> I'll<00:06:56.980> probably<00:06:57.220> put<00:06:57.730> a<00:06:57.790> little<00:06:58.000> bit<00:06:58.150> of

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
then I'll probably put a little bit of

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.110 
then I'll probably put a little bit of
tomatoes<00:06:58.780> and<00:06:58.810> you<00:06:59.560> know<00:07:00.220> thicken<00:07:00.850> it<00:07:01.000> up

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
tomatoes and you know thicken it up

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.480 
tomatoes and you know thicken it up
because<00:07:02.110> it<00:07:02.380> looks<00:07:02.410> more<00:07:02.680> like<00:07:02.950> beef<00:07:03.160> soup

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
because it looks more like beef soup

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.770 
because it looks more like beef soup
than<00:07:03.880> beef<00:07:04.060> stew

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
than beef stew

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:10.350 
than beef stew
I<00:07:04.810> like<00:07:05.470> stew<00:07:05.940> okay<00:07:06.940> thank<00:07:07.810> you<00:07:07.870> bye
