of<00:03:40.800> them<00:03:40.890> they<00:03:41.010> can<00:03:41.160> deal<00:03:41.280> with<00:03:41.340> that

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
of them they can deal with that

it's whatever that's actually gonna

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.060 
it's whatever that's actually gonna
lower<00:03:42.989> their<00:03:43.200> DPS<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.650> know<00:03:43.739> we're<00:03:43.920> saying

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.650 
lower their DPS you know we're saying
about<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.370> second<00:03:44.670> option<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.630> a

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
about the second option so this is a

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.880 
about the second option so this is a
really<00:03:45.810> good<00:03:45.989> way<00:03:46.140> of<00:03:46.170> taking<00:03:46.500> advantage<00:03:46.830> of

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
really good way of taking advantage of

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.290 
really good way of taking advantage of
that<00:03:47.010> now<00:03:47.400> look<00:03:47.550> at<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.700> look<00:03:47.910> who's<00:03:48.060> top

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
was ranked 2 for warriors but this

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.400 
was ranked 2 for warriors but this
actually<00:03:56.910> isn't<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.239> clip<00:03:57.480> because<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.260> that

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
actually isn't that clip because of that

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.260 
actually isn't that clip because of that
clip<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.830> had<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.070> little<00:03:59.220> bit<00:03:59.400> more<00:03:59.430> gear<00:04:00.150> and

but you really only get one shot for
that<00:04:29.610> number<00:04:29.850> one<00:04:29.970> spot<00:04:30.120> at<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.990> parsing<00:04:31.440> and

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
that number one spot at the parsing and

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.590 
that number one spot at the parsing and
so<00:04:31.710> make<00:04:31.950> sure<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:32.460> make<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.760> count<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.360> I

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
mean like if you're gonna do a bad parse

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.340 
mean like if you're gonna do a bad parse
just<00:04:36.030> kill<00:04:36.240> yourself<00:04:36.630> just<00:04:36.660> walk<00:04:36.960> off<00:04:37.200> the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
just kill yourself just walk off the

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.170 
just kill yourself just walk off the
edge<00:04:37.380> that<00:04:37.950> way<00:04:38.100> whenever<00:04:38.340> people<00:04:38.730> look<00:04:38.910> at<00:04:39.060> it

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
edge that way whenever people look at it

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.030

what<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:52.800> should<00:04:52.980> have<00:04:53.100> done<00:04:53.280> is<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:53.640> should<00:04:53.790> have

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
what I should have done is I should have

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.850 
what I should have done is I should have
actually<00:04:54.150> stood<00:04:54.360> on<00:04:54.540> his<00:04:54.720> room<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.320> then<00:04:55.710> make

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
actually stood on his room and then make

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.500 
actually stood on his room and then make
it<00:04:55.890> to<00:04:56.070> where<00:04:56.130> I<00:04:56.340> was<00:04:56.520> grabbed<00:04:56.850> instead<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.360> him

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
it to where I was grabbed instead of him

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.640 
it to where I was grabbed instead of him
and<00:04:57.720> he<00:04:57.870> would<00:04:57.960> have<00:04:58.050> got<00:04:58.170> knocked<00:04:58.350> up<00:04:58.500> and

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
and he would have got knocked up and

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.900 
and he would have got knocked up and
killed<00:04:58.890> and<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.340> would<00:04:59.430> have<00:04:59.520> had<00:04:59.640> no<00:04:59.880> problem

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
killed and I would have had no problem

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.630 
killed and I would have had no problem
doing<00:05:00.480> even<00:05:00.930> more<00:05:00.960> damage<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:01.800> so<00:05:02.220> again<00:05:02.490> like

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
doing even more damage and so again like

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.910 
doing even more damage and so again like
if<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:03.000> miss<00:05:03.240> your<00:05:03.480> room<00:05:03.750> like<00:05:04.290> don't<00:05:04.590> call

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
if you miss your room like don't call

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.550 
if you miss your room like don't call
for<00:05:04.950> a<00:05:05.220> bomb<00:05:05.430> don't<00:05:06.000> call<00:05:06.270> for<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.540> Bop<00:05:06.780> just<00:05:07.350> alt

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
for a bomb don't call for a Bop just alt

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.980 
for a bomb don't call for a Bop just alt
f4<00:05:07.770> closed<00:05:08.400> your<00:05:08.640> game<00:05:08.850> and<00:05:09.150> pretend<00:05:09.720> like<00:05:09.780> you

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
f4 closed your game and pretend like you

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.380 
f4 closed your game and pretend like you
lagged<00:05:10.200> out<00:05:10.380> again<00:05:10.890> as<00:05:11.310> I<00:05:11.550> said<00:05:11.730> you<00:05:12.210> do<00:05:12.360> not

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
lagged out again as I said you do not

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.350 
lagged out again as I said you do not
want<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:12.870> have<00:05:12.990> any<00:05:13.230> sort<00:05:13.560> of<00:05:13.710> evidence<00:05:14.700> that

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
want to have any sort of evidence that

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.180 
want to have any sort of evidence that
you<00:05:15.480> did<00:05:15.510> bad<00:05:15.840> on<00:05:16.020> this<00:05:16.200> fight<00:05:16.410> now<00:05:16.860> really

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
you did bad on this fight now really

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.910 
you did bad on this fight now really
doing<00:05:17.670> bad<00:05:17.850> on<00:05:18.090> this<00:05:18.270> fight<00:05:18.540> is<00:05:18.750> actually<00:05:19.290> like

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
doing bad on this fight is actually like

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.860 
doing bad on this fight is actually like
very<00:05:19.950> correlated<00:05:20.820> to<00:05:20.850> doing<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.450> mechanics

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
very correlated to doing the mechanics

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.720 
very correlated to doing the mechanics
correctly<00:05:22.290> and<00:05:22.470> doing<00:05:23.010> really<00:05:23.190> role<00:05:23.460> in<00:05:23.610> this

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
correctly and doing really role in this

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.130 
correctly and doing really role in this
fight<00:05:23.940> is<00:05:24.150> actually<00:05:24.330> correlated<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:24.900> doing

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
fight is actually correlated to doing

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.870 
fight is actually correlated to doing
the<00:05:25.230> mechanics<00:05:25.560> very<00:05:25.740> badly<00:05:25.980> and<00:05:26.340> so<00:05:26.730> I<00:05:26.760> don't

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
the mechanics very badly and so I don't

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.070 
the mechanics very badly and so I don't
really<00:05:27.300> think<00:05:27.390> that<00:05:27.600> we<00:05:27.690> need<00:05:27.810> to<00:05:27.840> talk<00:05:28.050> about

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
really think that we need to talk about

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.930 
really think that we need to talk about
what's<00:05:28.440> more<00:05:28.650> important<00:05:29.070> here<00:05:29.220> now<00:05:29.640> the<00:05:29.700> third

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
what's more important here now the third

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.220 
what's more important here now the third
hand<00:05:30.150> phase<00:05:30.390> really<00:05:30.720> you're<00:05:30.870> not<00:05:30.900> going<00:05:31.110> to

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
hand phase really you're not going to

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.660 
hand phase really you're not going to
have<00:05:31.320> replicas<00:05:31.800> up<00:05:31.950> but<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:32.400> want<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.610> go

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
have replicas up but you want to go

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.280 
have replicas up but you want to go
ahead<00:05:32.790> and<00:05:32.910> use<00:05:33.090> your<00:05:33.120> trinket<00:05:33.600> again<00:05:33.870> because

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
ahead and use your trinket again because

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.420 
ahead and use your trinket again because
I<00:05:34.320> mean<00:05:34.590> this<00:05:34.710> is<00:05:34.800> gonna<00:05:34.920> be<00:05:35.040> pretty<00:05:35.130> much<00:05:35.220> your

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
I mean this is gonna be pretty much your

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.890 
I mean this is gonna be pretty much your
only<00:05:35.460> time<00:05:35.760> now<00:05:36.210> really<00:05:36.540> you<00:05:36.660> should<00:05:36.810> have

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
only time now really you should have

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.540 
only time now really you should have
used<00:05:37.050> your<00:05:37.170> second<00:05:37.560> potion<00:05:37.860> on<00:05:38.010> the<00:05:38.130> second

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
used your second potion on the second

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.640 
used your second potion on the second
set<00:05:39.390> of<00:05:39.420> the<00:05:39.540> grasping<00:05:40.020> Earth's<00:05:40.200> the<00:05:40.350> hands

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
set of the grasping Earth's the hands

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.990 
set of the grasping Earth's the hands
and<00:05:40.830> the<00:05:40.920> reason<00:05:41.130> for<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.310> is<00:05:41.700> of<00:05:41.880> course

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
and the reason for that is of course

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.220 
and the reason for that is of course
you've<00:05:42.180> got<00:05:42.210> rack<00:05:42.570> up<00:05:42.780> and<00:05:42.960> pretty<00:05:43.110> much

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
you've got rack up and pretty much

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.140 
you've got rack up and pretty much
everything<00:05:43.710> else<00:05:43.830> but<00:05:44.430> if<00:05:44.670> you<00:05:44.760> haven't<00:05:45.060> used

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
everything else but if you haven't used

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.400 
everything else but if you haven't used
it<00:05:45.300> by<00:05:45.390> now<00:05:45.420> you<00:05:45.600> want<00:05:45.870> to<00:05:45.930> go<00:05:45.990> ahead<00:05:46.170> and<00:05:46.290> do

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
it by now you want to go ahead and do

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.080 
it by now you want to go ahead and do
that<00:05:46.560> now<00:05:46.980> see<00:05:47.190> again<00:05:47.460> I<00:05:47.490> think<00:05:47.640> I<00:05:47.850> might<00:05:48.030> have

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
that now see again I think I might have

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.340 
that now see again I think I might have
killed<00:05:48.270> somebody<00:05:48.450> there<00:05:48.660> know<00:05:48.810> afflicted<00:05:49.110> got

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
killed somebody there know afflicted got

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.930 
killed somebody there know afflicted got
himself<00:05:49.470> killed<00:05:49.770> beforehand<00:05:50.250> but<00:05:50.640> you<00:05:50.790> want

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
himself killed beforehand but you want

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.190 
himself killed beforehand but you want
to<00:05:50.970> make<00:05:51.090> sure<00:05:51.120> that<00:05:51.420> you<00:05:51.510> definitely<00:05:52.020> like

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
to make sure that you definitely like

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.720 
to make sure that you definitely like
here<00:05:52.470> I<00:05:52.620> just<00:05:52.650> didn't<00:05:53.070> want<00:05:53.220> a<00:05:53.250> wife<00:05:53.370> because<00:05:53.670> I

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
here I just didn't want a wife because I

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.310 
here I just didn't want a wife because I
was<00:05:53.820> doing<00:05:54.000> really<00:05:54.150> well<00:05:54.330> so<00:05:54.570> again<00:05:55.080> it's<00:05:55.230> like

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
was doing really well so again it's like

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.350 
was doing really well so again it's like
always<00:05:55.530> like<00:05:55.800> kind<00:05:56.040> of<00:05:56.100> a<00:05:56.250> I'm<00:05:57.060> trying<00:05:57.300> to

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
always like kind of a I'm trying to

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.330 
always like kind of a I'm trying to
think<00:05:57.480> of<00:05:57.540> like<00:05:57.570> a<00:05:57.660> word<00:05:57.900> for<00:05:58.080> this<00:05:58.250> like<00:05:59.250> you

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
think of like a word for this like you

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.010 
think of like a word for this like you
want<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.580> manage<00:05:59.880> like<00:06:00.000> risks<00:06:00.420> with<00:06:00.570> reward

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
want to manage like risks with reward

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.690 
want to manage like risks with reward
and<00:06:01.230> so<00:06:01.320> sometimes<00:06:01.620> because<00:06:02.220> like<00:06:02.340> also

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
and so sometimes because like also

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.280 
and so sometimes because like also
you're<00:06:02.880> not<00:06:03.060> going<00:06:03.270> to<00:06:03.330> parse<00:06:03.540> listen<00:06:03.990> you're

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
you're not going to parse listen you're

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.100 
you're not going to parse listen you're
not<00:06:04.410> going<00:06:04.560> to<00:06:04.650> parse<00:06:04.860> if<00:06:05.160> the<00:06:05.340> boss<00:06:05.550> if<00:06:06.330> you

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
not going to parse if the boss if you

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.390 
not going to parse if the boss if you
don't<00:06:07.290> if<00:06:07.500> you<00:06:07.590> don't<00:06:07.770> actually<00:06:07.890> kill<00:06:08.130> a<00:06:08.160> boss

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
don't if you don't actually kill a boss

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.890 
don't if you don't actually kill a boss
and<00:06:08.670> so<00:06:08.760> sometimes<00:06:09.000> it's<00:06:09.330> good<00:06:09.480> to<00:06:09.510> actually
