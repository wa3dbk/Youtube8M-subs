00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.750
 mysteries has discovered a world is a 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.180
 search of the sun the mysteries and enigmas 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.400
 and conspiracies on the border between the 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.010
 fantasy and reality in a search 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.199
 tireless mysteries uncovered 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.199
 where the mystery of the sciences 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.379
 very good friends how are you welcome 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.420
 here to dress bare point is 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.010
 good today change the scenario I think 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.600
 that a change of scenery is fine 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.460
 some say that my green screen 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.010
 to see a lot of hope it produces 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.469
 I would be, but well I do not do it 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.390
 them although it is good 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.309
 change change a little bit of d 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.540
 of stage I'm here good and 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.900
 I take advantage of what I had to do 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:13.180
 food purchases of course there is no 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.560
 for more but it is a reflection or a 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.840
 reflection I think they will understand me 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.929
 they will understand me 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.200
 and I think they're going to understand me 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:26.859
 I was talking about the reptilians and 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.020
 I was talking about those who maybe and 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.800
 I say maybe 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.880
 they created us and created the human race 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:41.890
 but they have not realized they have not thought 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:46.780
 you are that they them if it is like this to 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:51.830
 these these antidiluvian and anti beings 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:54.180
 and for me cause these these beings 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.930
 what belief did they have? 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:02.160
 because I do not explain a race 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.980
 and thinking and a race with feelings and 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.020
 even if they are bad feelings 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.340
 not out of the ordinary those 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.340
 Uncommon feelings 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.020
 that they do not have one because it is a belief 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.510
 a belief in someone superior always 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.390
 all races I think all in their 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.640
 principles and in their own prejudices and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.920
 his own dogmas be of the race that 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.970
 be it extraterrestrial be intra 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.420
 land 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.080
 everyone has to have a belief one 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.040
 belief that because it is very good 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.340
 think that we are a combination 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.280
 genetics an an experiment 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.550
 Well, genetic transfer and good 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.450
 that's plausible and we've talked about that 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.450
 many times but 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:07.020
 many times the theory of evolution 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.020
 of life 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:15.520
 I think it's good that we should 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.760
 to think is like the one that says good what 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.150
 I can tell you with whom you created 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.200
 god I believe that if beyond the proper 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.560
 I think that of the speculation itself 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.610
 Well maybe we can think like that 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.850
 entities you believe or do not believe or study that 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.420
 I have it very clear that we are 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:44.540
 created that we are creatures created be 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.239
 by whoever but and the creators 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.269
 and the creators have to think that 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.530
 the creators who swims in this scenario 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.549
 that is a little park that is 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.500
 close to home once is very nice 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.980
 I have given you this reflection and I hope 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.739
 that you put me in the comments 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.450
 what do you think you share this video and 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.780
 well see you in the next one 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.780
 hug
