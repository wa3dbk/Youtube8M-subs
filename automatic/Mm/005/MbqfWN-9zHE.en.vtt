00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.010
Welcome to the know. I'm Ashley Jenkins and if you asked me this morning about the most impressive 3D printed thing

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.319
[I'd] ever seen I would have pointed you to that car

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.310
We reported on back in September, and I hope it enjoyed its run because it's just lost its crown China has 3D printed two

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:28.649
Enormous buildings the project was completed by Winston decoration design engineering company and consists of both the world's tallest 3D

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.880
Printed building and a mansion the apartment building is five stories [tall] [and] a mansion spends 1,100 square meters

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.229
That's roughly eleven thousand eight hundred and forty square feet from a fellow yanks both buildings were created using a 6.6

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.459
Metre tall by 10 meter wide by 150 meter long printer which builds layers made from a mixture of glass fiber steel cement

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.009
hardening agents and recycled construction waste

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.689
Sections of the building are then printed out and assembled together into the final structure?

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.109
The buildings are [on] display in [susu] industrial park in Jiangsu province to demonstrate the potential for Mainstream

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.899
developers to use 3D printing for commercial building

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.250
The company indicates that this method saves between 30 and 60% of building materials and comm produce a building 50 to 70%

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.309
faster while decreasing labor costs by 50 to 80 percent

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.720
chief engineer of China construction number [eight] engineering Bureau [Mehran] quan spoke about the new buildings in a press conference saying

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.579
These two houses are in full compliance with the relevant national standards. It is safe reliable and features a good integration of architecture and decoration

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.769
But as there is no specific national standard for 3D printing architecture. We need to revise and improve such a standard for the future a

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.610
Taiwanese Owned real estate

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.209
Company has already ordered 10 of the mansions in which each cost about one hundred and sixty one thousand dollars [u.s.]

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.909
To manufacture and the egyptian government has ordered

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.409
20,000 houses over the next three years the company will establish factories in more than 26 countries including the u.s.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.289
To popularize 3D printing of homes particularly with an eye to creating affordable housing for Low-income families

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:11.909
Would you live in a 3D printed house would you trust it let us know in the comments you get the best in videogames?
