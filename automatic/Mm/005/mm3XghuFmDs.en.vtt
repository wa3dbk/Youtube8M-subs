or our self expression sort of freshness

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.870 
or our self expression sort of freshness
about<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.800> that<00:00:34.800> conjunction<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.790> know

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
about that and that conjunction you know

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.520 
about that and that conjunction you know
associating<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.750> lion's<00:00:37.140> head<00:00:37.350> in

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
associating with the lion's head in

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.160 
associating with the lion's head in
particular<00:00:38.059> it's<00:00:39.059> very<00:00:39.329> much<00:00:39.690> about<00:00:39.960> that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
particular it's very much about that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.110 
particular it's very much about that
expression<00:00:40.530> very<00:00:40.890> much<00:00:41.160> about<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.610> lion's

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
expression very much about that lion's

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.990 
expression very much about that lion's
roar<00:00:42.350> now<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.770> quite<00:00:43.980> obvious<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.820> head

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
roar now as it's quite obvious the head

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.630 
roar now as it's quite obvious the head
of<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> lion<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.690> very<00:00:45.960> powerful<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.460> will

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
of the lion is very powerful so it will

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.819 
of the lion is very powerful so it will
be<00:00:47.670> very<00:00:48.000> important<00:00:48.510> under<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.989> new<00:00:49.649> moon

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
be very important under this new moon

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.470 
be very important under this new moon
and<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> next<00:00:50.309> 30<00:00:50.640> days<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.149> remain

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and for the next 30 days to remain

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.139 
and for the next 30 days to remain
connected<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.110> our<00:00:52.230> heart<00:00:52.500> center<00:00:53.149> otherwise

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
connected to our heart center otherwise

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.479 
connected to our heart center otherwise
you<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.899> self-expression<00:00:55.829> can

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
you know that self-expression can

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.520 
you know that self-expression can
sometimes<00:00:56.940> become<00:00:57.180> heartless<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:58.289> become

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
sometimes become heartless can become

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.319 
sometimes become heartless can become
cruel<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.340> all<00:00:59.520> we're<00:00:59.699> concerned<00:01:00.059> with

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
cruel if that's all we're concerned with

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.119 
cruel if that's all we're concerned with
it's<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.840> self-oriented<00:01:01.500> energy

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
it's just that self-oriented energy

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.700 
it's just that self-oriented energy
there<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.350> pool<00:01:04.559> from

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
there so with that the pool from

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.950 
there so with that the pool from
Aquarius<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.580> reminding<00:01:06.210> us<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> always<00:01:06.810> is

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
Aquarius is reminding us as it always is

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.370 
Aquarius is reminding us as it always is
that<00:01:07.409> balancing<00:01:08.010> point<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.820> give<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.780> that's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that balancing point to give and that's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.350 
that balancing point to give and that's
what<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:10.710> balances<00:01:11.340> Leo<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.820> general<00:01:12.210> when

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
what really balances Leo in general when

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.850 
what really balances Leo in general when
we're<00:01:12.510> other<00:01:12.689> oriented<00:01:13.409> when<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:13.740> we

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
we're other oriented when what we

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.640 
we're other oriented when what we
express<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> what<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.760> create<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.960> oriented

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
express and what we create is oriented

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.830 
express and what we create is oriented
towards<00:01:17.009> giving<00:01:17.600> oriented<00:01:18.600> towards

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
towards giving oriented towards

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.260 
towards giving oriented towards
contributing<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.890> visions<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.610> ideals<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
contributing to visions and ideals and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.890 
contributing to visions and ideals and
just<00:01:21.450> things<00:01:22.320> larger<00:01:22.650> than<00:01:22.950> self<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.490> general

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
just things larger than self in general

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.120 
just things larger than self in general
so<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> think<00:01:25.170> that'll<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.590> an<00:01:25.680> important

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
so I think that'll be an important

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.859 
so I think that'll be an important
balancing<00:01:26.909> point<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.509> have<00:01:27.689> some

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
balancing point we do have some

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.359 
balancing point we do have some
opposition's<00:01:28.500> which<00:01:28.680> I'll<00:01:28.829> talk<00:01:29.009> about<00:01:29.070> in

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
opposition's which I'll talk about in

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.969 
opposition's which I'll talk about in
Aquarius<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.380> head<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> lion

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
Aquarius and on this head of the lion

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.190 
Aquarius and on this head of the lion
very<00:01:32.549> powerful<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.240> self-expression<00:01:33.630> now

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
very powerful for self-expression now

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.550 
very powerful for self-expression now
there<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.619> new<00:01:34.829> freshness<00:01:35.340> about<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
there is this new freshness about it and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.230 
there is this new freshness about it and
then<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.000> you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
then you know with that with this you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.640 
then you know with that with this you
know<00:01:39.390> particular<00:01:39.750> configuration<00:01:40.140> just

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
know particular configuration just

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.770 
know particular configuration just

ting up to Venus so here we have been
perhaps<00:01:50.040> reassessing<00:01:50.939> or<00:01:51.119> reflecting<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.869> our

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
perhaps reassessing or reflecting on our

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.620 
perhaps reassessing or reflecting on our
values<00:01:52.649> who<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.220> value<00:01:53.640> what<00:01:53.670> we<00:01:53.880> value<00:01:54.210> that

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
values who we value what we value that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.289 
values who we value what we value that
kind<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.960> thing<00:01:55.969> reassessing<00:01:56.969> that

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
kind of thing reassessing that

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.420 
kind of thing reassessing that
reflecting<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.920> maybe<00:01:59.100> there<00:01:59.310> are

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
reflecting on that so maybe there are

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.249 
reflecting on that so maybe there are
some<00:01:59.460> new<00:01:59.850> beginnings<00:02:00.299> now<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.719> regards<00:02:01.140> to

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
some new beginnings now in regards to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.469 
some new beginnings now in regards to
those<00:02:01.380> things<00:02:01.680> maybe<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.479> relationship

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
those things maybe in the relationship

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.929 
those things maybe in the relationship
side<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.899> things<00:02:04.049> maybe<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:04.729> finances<00:02:05.729> maybe

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
side of things maybe with finances maybe

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.580 
side of things maybe with finances maybe
with<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> simple<00:02:06.630> pleasures<00:02:07.079> maybe<00:02:07.350> with

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
with the simple pleasures maybe with

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.400 
with the simple pleasures maybe with
just<00:02:07.829> simply<00:02:08.220> enjoying<00:02:08.700> life<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.840> whatever<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
just simply enjoying life so whatever it

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.040 
just simply enjoying life so whatever it
is

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
is

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.750 
is
you<00:02:11.260> know<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.800> during<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.160> New<00:02:12.310> Moon<00:02:12.340> it's<00:02:12.670> a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
you know that during the New Moon it's a

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.460 
you know that during the New Moon it's a
time<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.090> reflect<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:13.810> but<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.140> can<00:02:14.320> be

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
time to reflect on that but it can be

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.080 
time to reflect on that but it can be
some<00:02:14.830> new<00:02:14.950> beginnings<00:02:15.370> with<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.640> Venusian

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
some new beginnings with the Venusian

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.820 
some new beginnings with the Venusian
side<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.540> things<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.930> very<00:02:17.140> creative

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
side of things a very creative

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.610 
side of things a very creative
self-expression<00:02:18.550> as<00:02:19.150> well<00:02:19.390> now<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.260> trend

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
self-expression as well now the trend

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.440 
self-expression as well now the trend
from<00:02:20.830> uranus<00:02:21.340> does<00:02:21.610> mean<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.240> be<00:02:22.390> an

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
from uranus does mean it can be an

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.540 
from uranus does mean it can be an
exciting<00:02:22.840> new<00:02:23.380> moon<00:02:23.560> actually<00:02:23.830> maybe<00:02:24.280> there

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
exciting new moon actually maybe there

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.400 
exciting new moon actually maybe there
are<00:02:24.670> literally<00:02:25.150> some<00:02:25.450> new<00:02:25.600> things<00:02:25.870> coming<00:02:26.170> in

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
are literally some new things coming in

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.770 
are literally some new things coming in
and<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:26.830> important<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:28.000> be<00:02:28.210> open<00:02:28.240> to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
and so it is important to be open to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.170 
and so it is important to be open to
newness<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:30.010> know<00:02:30.100> be<00:02:30.250> open<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.850> things

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
newness you know be open to things

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.420 
newness you know be open to things
changing<00:02:31.840> because<00:02:32.620> all<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.040> slow-moving

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
changing because all the slow-moving

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.390 
changing because all the slow-moving
planets<00:02:34.030> especially<00:02:34.570> Uranus<00:02:35.050> are<00:02:35.680> creating

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
planets especially Uranus are creating

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.340 
planets especially Uranus are creating
new<00:02:36.730> things<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.450> from<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.720> try<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.230> can

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
new things and from a try and it can

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.050 
new things and from a try and it can
actually<00:02:38.680> come<00:02:38.860> across<00:02:39.160> as<00:02:39.340> quite<00:02:39.520> nice<00:02:39.790> so

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
actually come across as quite nice so

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.450 
actually come across as quite nice so
see<00:02:40.720> those<00:02:40.900> opportunities<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.010> think<00:02:42.250> just

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
see those opportunities and I think just

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.540 
see those opportunities and I think just
being<00:02:42.640> open<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:43.380> new<00:02:44.380> things<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.890> excitements

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
being open to new things and excitements

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.370 
being open to new things and excitements
maybe<00:02:45.760> even<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.300> new<00:02:46.450> perspective<00:02:46.750> on<00:02:47.230> our

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
maybe even just a new perspective on our

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.560 
maybe even just a new perspective on our
self<00:02:47.620> expression<00:02:48.220> will<00:02:49.030> be<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.180> good<00:02:49.390> way<00:02:49.540> of

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
self expression will be a good way of

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.630 
self expression will be a good way of
allowing<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:50.110> energy<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.470> come<00:02:50.770> in<00:02:50.950> now

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
allowing that energy to come in now

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.700 
allowing that energy to come in now
Square<00:02:52.060> from<00:02:52.210> Saturn<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.050> reminder<00:02:53.470> that

it's not an exact it sits within or but
certainly<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.290> square<00:03:32.680> but<00:03:32.860> it's<00:03:32.980> not<00:03:33.160> very

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
certainly a square but it's not very

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.670 
certainly a square but it's not very
close<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.050> point<00:03:35.290> where<00:03:35.440> i<00:03:35.470> don't<00:03:35.530> think

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
close to the point where i don't think

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.560 
close to the point where i don't think
that'll<00:03:35.980> be<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.130> high<00:03:36.310> point<00:03:36.340> i<00:03:36.850> think<00:03:37.510> the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
that'll be the high point i think the

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.850 
that'll be the high point i think the
high<00:03:37.720> point<00:03:37.989> will<00:03:38.170> certainly<00:03:38.470> be<00:03:38.680> this

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
high point will certainly be this

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.220 
high point will certainly be this
conjunction<00:03:39.220> up<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.580> venus<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.480> star<00:03:40.840> in<00:03:41.020> leo

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
conjunction up to venus that star in leo

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.830 
conjunction up to venus that star in leo
and<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.680> trine<00:03:41.980> up<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.280> uranus<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.540> let's<00:03:43.720> go

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
and that trine up to uranus so let's go

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.080 
and that trine up to uranus so let's go
and<00:03:43.989> look<00:03:44.110> at<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.709> weekend<00:03:45.130> in<00:03:45.340> relation<00:03:45.880> to

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
and look at the weekend in relation to

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.090 
and look at the weekend in relation to
this<00:03:46.300> so<00:03:46.540> friday<00:03:46.900> is<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:47.470> new<00:03:47.680> moon<00:03:47.890> there's

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
this so friday is that new moon there's

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.070 
this so friday is that new moon there's
no<00:03:48.250> other<00:03:48.370> major<00:03:48.700> aspects<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.540> Sun<00:03:49.750> will<00:03:49.959> be

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
no other major aspects the Sun will be

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.840 
no other major aspects the Sun will be
coming<00:03:50.110> off<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.530> train<00:03:50.980> up<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.160> Uranus<00:03:51.670> but

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
coming off that train up to Uranus but

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.300 
coming off that train up to Uranus but
that<00:03:51.970> new<00:03:52.150> moon<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:53.410> training<00:03:53.830> Uranus<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:54.280> I

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
that new moon is training Uranus so I

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.400 
that new moon is training Uranus so I
think<00:03:54.550> that<00:03:54.730> will<00:03:54.940> still<00:03:55.300> make<00:03:55.510> that<00:03:55.750> on

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
think that will still make that on

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.010 
think that will still make that on
excitement<00:03:56.800> highlighted<00:03:57.610> but<00:03:58.300> again<00:03:58.570> it's<00:03:58.900> a

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
excitement highlighted but again it's a

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.010 
excitement highlighted but again it's a
reflective<00:03:59.590> time<00:03:59.830> I<00:04:00.190> think<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:01.510> know<00:04:01.630> setting

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
reflective time I think you know setting

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.750 
reflective time I think you know setting
intentions<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.739> good<00:04:02.980> way<00:04:03.130> of<00:04:03.160> working<00:04:03.459> with

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
intentions is a good way of working with

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.160 
intentions is a good way of working with
this<00:04:03.880> energy<00:04:04.060> on<00:04:04.360> Friday<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:04.959> with<00:04:05.080> that

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
this energy on Friday and with that

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.259 
this energy on Friday and with that
freshness<00:04:05.560> perhaps<00:04:06.220> starting<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.090> think

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
freshness perhaps starting to think

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.000 
freshness perhaps starting to think
about<00:04:07.540> where<00:04:07.780> we<00:04:07.810> want<00:04:08.080> to<00:04:08.140> continue<00:04:08.470> now<00:04:08.769> for

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
about where we want to continue now for

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.030 
about where we want to continue now for
this<00:04:09.100> next<00:04:09.160> 30<00:04:10.030> day<00:04:10.209> lunar<00:04:10.540> cycle<00:04:11.050> because

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
this next 30 day lunar cycle because

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.680 
this next 30 day lunar cycle because
once<00:04:12.280> we<00:04:12.370> go<00:04:12.519> into<00:04:12.670> next<00:04:12.760> week<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.480> moon<00:04:13.630> will

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
once we go into next week the moon will

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.750 
once we go into next week the moon will
start<00:04:14.019> to<00:04:14.140> fill<00:04:14.350> up<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:14.890> through<00:04:15.580> that

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
start to fill up and through that

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.340 
start to fill up and through that
filling<00:04:16.120> up<00:04:16.209> of<00:04:16.299> energy<00:04:16.480> will<00:04:16.840> have<00:04:17.019> more

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
filling up of energy will have more

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.650 
filling up of energy will have more
energy<00:04:17.470> to<00:04:17.890> put<00:04:18.340> towards<00:04:18.730> these<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.539> these

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
energy to put towards these to these

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.290 
energy to put towards these to these
intentions<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:21.100> that's<00:04:21.310> Friday<00:04:21.640> mostly<00:04:21.940> that

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
intentions so that's Friday mostly that

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.090 
intentions so that's Friday mostly that
new<00:04:22.450> moon<00:04:22.630> energy<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.260> then<00:04:23.380> on

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
new moon energy and then on

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.450 
new moon energy and then on
we<00:04:24.490> have<00:04:24.730> some<00:04:25.390> nice<00:04:26.250> configurations<00:04:27.250> here

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
we have some nice configurations here

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.010 
we have some nice configurations here
the<00:04:27.640> sun<00:04:27.850> will<00:04:28.030> be<00:04:28.060> conjunctive<00:04:28.660> up<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.900> that

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
the sun will be conjunctive up to that

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.860 
the sun will be conjunctive up to that
retrograde<00:04:29.500> venus<00:04:29.860> exact<00:04:30.480> so<00:04:31.480> here<00:04:31.750> in<00:04:31.840> this

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
retrograde venus exact so here in this

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.230 
retrograde venus exact so here in this
sense<00:04:32.200> venus<00:04:32.590> will<00:04:32.740> be<00:04:32.830> eclipsing<00:04:33.400> in<00:04:33.550> front

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
sense venus will be eclipsing in front

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.570 
sense venus will be eclipsing in front
of<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.450> Sun<00:04:34.720> so<00:04:34.990> like<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:35.920> was<00:04:35.950> saying<00:04:36.100> you<00:04:36.460> know

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
of the Sun so like I was saying you know

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.390 
of the Sun so like I was saying you know
there<00:04:36.790> is<00:04:36.820> this<00:04:37.500> reassessments<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.770> but<00:04:39.250> with

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
there is this reassessments and but with

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.160 
there is this reassessments and but with
this<00:04:39.520> in<00:04:39.760> particular<00:04:40.090> this<00:04:40.480> can<00:04:40.750> be<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:40.960> good

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
this in particular this can be a good

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.680 
this in particular this can be a good
time<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:41.380> certainly<00:04:41.980> enjoy<00:04:42.460> on<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:43.360> creative

time to certainly enjoy on the creative
pursuits<00:04:44.400> even<00:04:45.400> you<00:04:45.730> may<00:04:45.940> be<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.120> romantic

respect so some things to remember there

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.140 
respect so some things to remember there
with<00:04:56.290> that<00:04:56.500> because<00:04:56.680> Venus<00:04:56.980> is<00:04:57.310> retrograde

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
with that because Venus is retrograde

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.180 
with that because Venus is retrograde
traditionally<00:04:58.990> these<00:04:59.140> are<00:04:59.320> enemies<00:04:59.740> actually

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
traditionally these are enemies actually

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.040 
traditionally these are enemies actually
in<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.430> Vedic<00:05:00.760> system<00:05:01.000> although<00:05:01.660> their

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
in the Vedic system although their

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.630 
in the Vedic system although their
conjunction<00:05:02.620> doesn't<00:05:03.130> usually<00:05:03.280> produce

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
conjunction doesn't usually produce

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.760 
conjunction doesn't usually produce
negative<00:05:04.420> results<00:05:04.990> depending<00:05:05.350> on<00:05:05.470> where<00:05:05.650> it's

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
negative results depending on where it's

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.310 
negative results depending on where it's
aspected<00:05:06.370> but<00:05:06.520> in<00:05:06.670> Leo<00:05:07.120> this<00:05:07.750> energy<00:05:08.170> is

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
aspected but in Leo this energy is

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.830 
aspected but in Leo this energy is
actually<00:05:08.740> quite<00:05:08.890> uplifted<00:05:09.670> with<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.480> Sun<00:05:10.630> and

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
actually quite uplifted with the Sun and

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.410 
actually quite uplifted with the Sun and
dignity<00:05:11.290> here<00:05:11.560> so<00:05:11.800> I<00:05:12.280> think<00:05:12.910> just<00:05:13.210> staying

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
dignity here so I think just staying

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.740 
dignity here so I think just staying
balanced<00:05:14.020> when<00:05:14.560> it<00:05:14.680> comes<00:05:14.920> to<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:16.150> values

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
balanced when it comes to the values

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.570 
balanced when it comes to the values
when<00:05:16.930> it<00:05:17.020> comes<00:05:17.230> to<00:05:17.380> finances<00:05:18.040> when<00:05:18.220> it<00:05:18.340> comes

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
to relationships in general I think will

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.970 
to relationships in general I think will
be<00:05:22.030> a<00:05:22.060> good<00:05:22.300> way<00:05:22.450> to<00:05:22.480> really<00:05:22.840> enjoy<00:05:22.960> them<00:05:23.440> to

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
be a good way to really enjoy them to

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.310 
be a good way to really enjoy them to
see<00:05:24.190> that<00:05:24.220> passion<00:05:24.910> and<00:05:25.090> excitement<00:05:25.900> come

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
see that passion and excitement come

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.760 
see that passion and excitement come
through<00:05:26.700> those<00:05:27.700> areas<00:05:28.060> of<00:05:28.090> life<00:05:28.420> so<00:05:29.260> with<00:05:29.530> that

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
through those areas of life so with that

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.070 
through those areas of life so with that
we've<00:05:29.980> got<00:05:30.190> mercury<00:05:30.460> trining<00:05:31.090> up<00:05:31.210> to<00:05:31.360> Pluto<00:05:31.810> so

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
we've got mercury trining up to Pluto so

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.530 
we've got mercury trining up to Pluto so
there<00:05:32.230> is<00:05:32.350> a<00:05:32.380> very<00:05:33.100> strong<00:05:33.460> power<00:05:33.910> when<00:05:34.510> it

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
there is a very strong power when it

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.420 
there is a very strong power when it
comes<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:35.200> that<00:05:35.530> self-expression<00:05:36.010> because

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
comes to that self-expression because

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.250 
comes to that self-expression because
mercury<00:05:36.790> is<00:05:36.940> speech<00:05:37.390> Mercury's<00:05:37.930> you<00:05:38.170> know

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
mercury is speech Mercury's you know

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.010 
mercury is speech Mercury's you know
communication<00:05:39.010> so<00:05:39.790> the<00:05:40.210> good<00:05:40.390> news<00:05:40.450> is<00:05:40.810> the

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
communication so the good news is the

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.350 
communication so the good news is the
trine<00:05:41.380> is<00:05:42.070> that<00:05:42.250> we're<00:05:42.400> open<00:05:42.790> to<00:05:42.940> seeing<00:05:43.210> the

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
trine is that we're open to seeing the

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.320 
trine is that we're open to seeing the
truth<00:05:43.660> we're<00:05:44.230> open<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:45.150> restructuring<00:05:46.150> our

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
truth we're open to restructuring our

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.240 
truth we're open to restructuring our
ideas<00:05:47.020> and<00:05:47.050> that's<00:05:47.320> why<00:05:47.470> I<00:05:47.500> think<00:05:47.650> not<00:05:48.010> only<00:05:48.040> is

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
ideas and that's why I think not only is

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.100 
ideas and that's why I think not only is
there<00:05:48.340> going<00:05:48.430> to<00:05:48.490> be<00:05:48.580> a<00:05:48.640> freshness<00:05:49.000> about<00:05:49.360> who

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
there going to be a freshness about who

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.260 
there going to be a freshness about who
we<00:05:50.290> are<00:05:50.320> in<00:05:50.590> expressing<00:05:51.130> ourselves<00:05:51.250> but<00:05:52.240> also

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
we are in expressing ourselves but also

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.070 
we are in expressing ourselves but also
of<00:05:52.780> ideas<00:05:53.560> of<00:05:53.880> concepts<00:05:54.880> of<00:05:55.180> just<00:05:55.480> the<00:05:55.600> mind<00:05:55.870> in

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
of ideas of concepts of just the mind in

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.760 
of ideas of concepts of just the mind in
general<00:05:56.470> so<00:05:56.680> as<00:05:56.830> we<00:05:57.040> lead<00:05:57.220> into<00:05:57.520> Saturday<00:05:58.060> a

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
general so as we lead into Saturday a

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.530 
general so as we lead into Saturday a
restructuring<00:05:59.770> of<00:05:59.950> our<00:06:00.130> mind<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:00.640> and<00:06:01.240> it'll

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
restructuring of our mind and and it'll

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.540 
restructuring of our mind and and it'll
be<00:06:01.690> from<00:06:02.020> wanting<00:06:02.470> to<00:06:02.500> see<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:02.890> truth<00:06:03.100> and<00:06:03.430> so

there in the morning time period that

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.460 
there in the morning time period that
that<00:06:54.490> activation<00:06:55.450> of<00:06:55.810> that<00:06:55.990> mercury<00:06:56.230> and

that activation of that mercury and

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.800 
that activation of that mercury and
Pluto<00:06:56.860> so<00:06:57.070> very<00:06:57.310> sharp<00:06:57.760> energy<00:06:58.210> again<00:06:58.570> with

the<00:07:04.900> way<00:07:05.050> we<00:07:05.230> are<00:07:05.380> thinking<00:07:05.740> about<00:07:05.980> things<00:07:06.220> are

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
the way we are thinking about things are

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.850 
the way we are thinking about things are
doing<00:07:06.670> things<00:07:06.910> on<00:07:07.090> a<00:07:07.120> day-to-day<00:07:07.360> level<00:07:07.860> so

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860 
doing things on a day-to-day level so

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.680 
doing things on a day-to-day level so
good<00:07:09.100> mix<00:07:09.340> of<00:07:09.460> the<00:07:09.580> routine<00:07:09.910> there<00:07:10.120> perhaps<00:07:10.330> on

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
good mix of the routine there perhaps on

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.600 
good mix of the routine there perhaps on
sunday<00:07:10.720> and<00:07:11.380> then<00:07:11.890> in<00:07:12.010> the<00:07:12.070> evening<00:07:12.460> time

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
sunday and then in the evening time

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.610 
sunday and then in the evening time
again<00:07:13.060> opposing<00:07:13.540> up<00:07:13.630> to<00:07:13.750> chyron<00:07:14.170> who<00:07:14.320> is<00:07:14.470> in

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:14.620 
again opposing up to chyron who is in

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.430 
again opposing up to chyron who is in
Pisces<00:07:15.070> to<00:07:15.100> have<00:07:15.490> faith<00:07:16.330> and<00:07:16.360> to<00:07:16.750> let<00:07:16.930> go<00:07:17.170> and

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
Pisces to have faith and to let go and

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.780 
Pisces to have faith and to let go and
it's<00:07:17.620> through<00:07:17.920> that<00:07:18.130> will<00:07:18.370> find<00:07:18.610> not<00:07:18.760> only

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:18.790 
it's through that will find not only

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.510 
it's through that will find not only
that<00:07:19.120> liberation<00:07:19.870> which<00:07:20.230> is<00:07:20.350> Uranus<00:07:20.830> but<00:07:21.400> also

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 
that liberation which is Uranus but also

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.850 
that liberation which is Uranus but also
that's<00:07:21.940> a<00:07:22.120> healing<00:07:22.600> which<00:07:22.990> is<00:07:23.110> Chiron<00:07:23.500> as<00:07:23.650> well

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
that's a healing which is Chiron as well

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.860 
that's a healing which is Chiron as well
so<00:07:24.580> while<00:07:24.700> in<00:07:24.820> all<00:07:24.970> the<00:07:25.120> gist<00:07:25.360> is<00:07:25.540> certainly

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870 
so while in all the gist is certainly

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.260 
so while in all the gist is certainly
this<00:07:26.110> new<00:07:26.350> moon<00:07:26.560> activated<00:07:27.310> on<00:07:27.430> Friday<00:07:27.820> and

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
this new moon activated on Friday and

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.410 
this new moon activated on Friday and
then<00:07:28.510> Saturday<00:07:29.320> in<00:07:29.410> particular<00:07:30.420> enjoyments

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.420 
then Saturday in particular enjoyments

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.080 
then Saturday in particular enjoyments
of<00:07:31.480> self-expression<00:07:32.050> very<00:07:32.470> powerful

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.090 
of self-expression very powerful

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.670 
of self-expression very powerful
communications<00:07:34.090> and<00:07:34.480> exchanges<00:07:35.140> can<00:07:35.200> be<00:07:35.530> the

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 
communications and exchanges can be the

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.040 
communications and exchanges can be the
case<00:07:35.890> if<00:07:36.730> we<00:07:36.880> are<00:07:37.000> open<00:07:37.300> to<00:07:37.330> that<00:07:37.570> and<00:07:37.630> that

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.050 
case if we are open to that and that

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.620 
case if we are open to that and that
will<00:07:38.290> be<00:07:38.440> leading<00:07:38.800> into<00:07:39.100> Sunday<00:07:39.460> as<00:07:39.550> well<00:07:39.790> but

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:40.630 
will be leading into Sunday as well but

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.570 
will be leading into Sunday as well but
yeah<00:07:41.290> with<00:07:41.560> the<00:07:41.680> new<00:07:41.860> moon<00:07:42.040> it's<00:07:42.280> certainly

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.580 
yeah with the new moon it's certainly

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.220 
yeah with the new moon it's certainly
about<00:07:42.820> that<00:07:43.000> self-expression<00:07:43.420> with<00:07:43.990> the<00:07:44.080> head

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:44.230 
about that self-expression with the head

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.140 
about that self-expression with the head
of<00:07:44.410> the<00:07:44.620> lion<00:07:45.040> staying<00:07:45.460> grounded<00:07:45.700> with<00:07:46.030> our

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:46.150 
of the lion staying grounded with our

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.700 
of the lion staying grounded with our
heart<00:07:46.420> center<00:07:46.810> staying<00:07:47.140> grounded<00:07:47.350> with

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:47.710 
heart center staying grounded with

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.430 
heart center staying grounded with
Saturn<00:07:48.190> new<00:07:49.060> beginnings<00:07:49.510> with<00:07:49.690> values<00:07:50.200> and

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:50.440 
Saturn new beginnings with values and

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.710 
Saturn new beginnings with values and
maybe<00:07:50.620> some<00:07:50.980> new<00:07:51.490> things<00:07:51.790> coming<00:07:52.060> in<00:07:52.330> from

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 
maybe some new things coming in from

maybe some new things coming in from
uranus<00:07:53.170> of<00:07:53.410> new<00:07:53.770> ideas<00:07:54.070> new<00:07:54.780> experiences

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:55.780
