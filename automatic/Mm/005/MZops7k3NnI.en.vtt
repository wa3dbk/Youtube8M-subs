00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
actually using edges and slightly wrong

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.890 
actually using edges and slightly wrong
and<00:00:30.920> mostly<00:00:31.550> when<00:00:31.940> they<00:00:32.059> do<00:00:32.210> it<00:00:32.360> do<00:00:32.540> this<00:00:34.900> they

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
and mostly when they do it do this they

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.189 
and mostly when they do it do this they
call<00:00:36.050> both<00:00:36.290> open<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.449> they<00:00:38.449> close<00:00:38.809> them<00:00:39.020> both

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
call both open and they close them both

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.880 
call both open and they close them both
together<00:00:40.360> what<00:00:41.360> they<00:00:41.449> should<00:00:41.629> be<00:00:41.780> doing<00:00:41.890> if

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
together what they should be doing if

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.210 
together what they should be doing if
you're<00:00:43.100> right-handed<00:00:43.309> like<00:00:43.730> I<00:00:43.879> am<00:00:45.220> the

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
you're right-handed like I am the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.420 
you're right-handed like I am the
forward<00:00:46.940> arm<00:00:47.390> has<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.440> flat<00:00:48.680> edge<00:00:48.860> to<00:00:49.100> it

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
forward arm has the flat edge to it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.139 
forward arm has the flat edge to it
see<00:00:49.940> along<00:00:50.810> here<00:00:50.870> there's<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.380> flat<00:00:51.590> bottom

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
see along here there's the flat bottom

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.510 
see along here there's the flat bottom
that<00:00:53.149> should<00:00:53.390> stay<00:00:53.600> flat<00:00:53.899> all<00:00:54.079> the<00:00:54.260> time<00:00:54.530> and

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
that should stay flat all the time and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.040 
that should stay flat all the time and
you<00:00:55.640> should<00:00:55.670> only<00:00:55.910> move<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.480> trailing<00:00:56.809> arm

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
you should only move the trailing arm

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.350 
you should only move the trailing arm
which<00:00:57.320> is<00:00:57.470> this<00:00:57.590> one<00:00:57.800> which<00:00:57.829> cuts<00:00:58.309> down<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:59.270> the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
which is this one which cuts down so the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.090 
which is this one which cuts down so the
bottom<00:00:59.630> stays<00:00:59.840> flat<00:01:00.140> now<00:01:00.590> it's<00:01:00.710> not<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:00.980> much

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
bottom stays flat now it's not so much

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.990 
bottom stays flat now it's not so much
of<00:01:01.190> a<00:01:01.250> problem<00:01:01.399> with<00:01:01.579> this<00:01:01.670> because<00:01:01.820> I've

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
of a problem with this because I've

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.819 
of a problem with this because I've
actually<00:01:02.090> got<00:01:02.360> this<00:01:02.510> border<00:01:03.079> cut<00:01:03.290> quite<00:01:03.559> deep

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
actually got this border cut quite deep

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.260 
actually got this border cut quite deep
when<00:01:04.430> it's<00:01:04.550> shallow<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:05.239> makes<00:01:05.540> a<00:01:05.630> difference

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
when it's shallow it makes a difference

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.950 
when it's shallow it makes a difference
so<00:01:08.270> front<00:01:08.840> arm<00:01:09.080> stays<00:01:09.410> float<00:01:09.770> straight<00:01:10.960> and

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
so front arm stays float straight and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.960 
so front arm stays float straight and
you<00:01:12.050> just<00:01:12.380> move<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.240> back<00:01:14.240> end

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.249 

there's<00:01:19.970> much<00:01:20.299> much<00:01:20.509> easier<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.900> go<00:01:21.020> around

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
there's much much easier to go around

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.880 
there's much much easier to go around
now<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:21.650> may<00:01:21.920> notice<00:01:22.159> that<00:01:23.259> my<00:01:24.259> Lord<00:01:24.500> has<00:01:24.590> got

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
now you may notice that my Lord has got

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.490 
now you may notice that my Lord has got
mental<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:25.610> they<00:01:26.420> brought<00:01:26.659> out<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:27.140> hose

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
mental and they brought out the hose

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.039 
mental and they brought out the hose
