00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.379
 to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.310
 now now hard and savers that so 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.890
 I'm in the upper part of the building 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.510
 where these days I'm using them 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.560
 little bit of office is that I said to 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.779
 I have to be between four 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.099
 walls if he does is that I'm so good if 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.720
 We are at the end of October and it makes a 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.640
 heat that to create short sleeves we're going 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.820
 of everything 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.279
 at least I wanted to tell you that the 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.050
 office is a little shabby the chairs and 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.360
 that already has in its age but I have my 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.890
 professional touch look at what sign 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.750
 more professional than I have I can 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.950
 put there hung with zeal and all that 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.110
 I think I like the idea 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.950
 what I wanted to discuss from the month 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.170
 February 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.690
 I have pending good since I made a 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.280
 recipe video of nutella or starlets 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.530
 complaint that I recommend you see the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.990
 video because they are super good here the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.880
 link so that you have it by hand I have 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.550
 Pending to tell you what I do with the 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.440
 mold bread crust and it's one thing 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.090
 that I invented myself one day and for 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.130
 take advantage of it because we do not have to throw 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.010
 nothing you already know and it's a recipe 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.780
 easy if you want that showed down 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.980
 down the kitchen and right now he prepares it 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.720
 just a moment 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.640
 we will have the crusts of the bread of death 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.340
 carrying and keeping in this bag and the 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.770
 more or less well what would be half 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.180
 of a package of bread then mold 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.990
 we will open 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.300
 and on this bag we are going to take the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.380
 beaten egg I have five eggs 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.380
 shakes for this amount 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.050
 I did not want to put less because the bread is 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.690
 for many and you do not need to 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.600
 we will add more we can also put 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.130
 here the egg and dipping the bread but 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.130
 it would be too complicated 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.750
 now 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.250
 It is easy 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.300
 the bread is already wet bark and as 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.670
 we do not want what 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.650
 that is too liquid I think that 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.660
 it is ideal if we look that there is too much 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.729
 egg for the amount of bread that 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.920
 we have we could use this only 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.190
 we would make the egg we can make a 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.190
 tortilla 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.040
 and on the baking sheet now 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.250
 has perfectly proposed a role of 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.250
 oven 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.310
 what we see we will distinguish 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.500
 we 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.630
 actually one recipe from another is not 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.530
 because then we have to go buying 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.209
 more ingredients that are the ones 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.310
 we will put here to the taste of each one 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.390
 I'll tell you how but I know 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.610
 which is a recipe to reuse 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.720
 to use it bread mold and good 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.209
 ingredients that we have in the fridge 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.530
 now what we are going to add in my case 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.090
 as I tell you what I like to put 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:55.020
 they would be grated or powdered cheese to me 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.020
 like a strong flavor 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.040
 the buyer is everyone we put 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.040
 that you like 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.270
 I certainly want to say hello to all the 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.850
 people who follow the channel of savers 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.700
 and especially good all the people of 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.380
 Spain is the majority and also the 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.550
 followers and followers of Latin America 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.680
 that makes a lot of illusion that 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.210
 follow from so far especially the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.650
 the country that follows us is Mexico so 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.000
 a kiss for everyone for everyone 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.300
 followers and followers of any 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.300
 part 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.920
 now let's put a little ham 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.270
 not much because as the cheese is strong 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.270
 we do not want it to be too salty 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.300
 it's how we're changing the look 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.650
 to the crusts that maybe a lot 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.950
 people pull liana and we do not have to 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.069
 throw 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.800
 destination a dinner is prepared as well 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.670
 in a salad this chopping 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.390
 It is not very good either 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.390
 they eat too much 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.930
 some black olives if you like them 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.430
 and now 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.430
 the tomato is fulfilled 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.690
 you have to give a very annoying release 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.440
 noise from 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.440
 of the spoon 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.299
 and now is when we are going to put the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.030
 aromatic herbs to the taste of each 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.500
 also the basil are very good 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.880
 oregano also a mixture of all 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.780
 also what you have at home in 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.210
 your pot or what you like 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.990
 of the supermarket in this case is a 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.990
 Provencal herbs mix 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.059
 Well now we could put it like that 

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:41.689
 in the oven or if you want we could 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:44.989
 put a splash of oil 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:48.199
 as well as bring some fat in ham 

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:50.089
 and also the cheese we are going to put 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.980
 we put it in the oven and now I'm going to 

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:55.170
 teach the result 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.320
 and now let it out of the oven 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.810
 we have had about 20 more minutes or 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.400
 less first fire to fire the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.660
 highest temperature and then we have 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.730
 gone down 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.610
 from the ship I assure you that apart from 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.870
 good smells great during all the 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.790
 mint time that is in the oven all the 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.410
 super good house especially for the 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.080
 Provencal herbs now let's 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.900
 prepare it to put it on a plate myself 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.730
 I put it on plates of these 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.290
 blackboard are some that I bought at home and 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.420
 they are very good for putting things like that 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.130
 appetizer this as I said you can 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.920
 serve for dinner or also to nibble at 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.760
 half late I put these 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.310
 cutting what they were all 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.470
 let's call him pizza is cut with the 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.160
 scissors to squares then it goes in two 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.830
 pieces 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.870
 this is all one and this is another but 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.490
 also what we can do is cut 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.320
 the sticks with sticks is a little 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.480
 more entertaining but good will also be 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.970
 easier to eat what you 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.729
 you want to put it in a cup or in 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.650
 some other type of container 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.210
 I've tried half was not cutting and 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.559
 I think I was missing a bit of cheese 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.870
 so if you put more than that 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:03.520
 better but it's super good for babies 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.960
 I have already prepared here the drink that you 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.879
 you remember that I told you that I was very 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.949
 good that they had sent me with the 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.509
 the box of like box I think not so 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.370
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.259
