00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.760 
really tiny it has bloomed a couple
times<00:00:57.539> before<00:00:57.719> there's<00:00:58.199> some<00:00:58.350> mold<00:00:58.530> bloom

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
times before there's some mold bloom

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.340 
times before there's some mold bloom
spikes<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.719> but<00:01:00.719> let's<00:01:00.840> actually<00:01:01.079> talk

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
spikes on it but let's actually talk

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.990 
spikes on it but let's actually talk
about<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.739> plant<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.489> bit<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:02.789> this

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
about this plant a little bit here this

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.670 
about this plant a little bit here this
orchid<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.409> orchid<00:01:05.869> does<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.439> any

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
orchid so this orchid does not have any

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.219 
orchid so this orchid does not have any
leaves<00:01:08.000> nor<00:01:09.000> will<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> ever<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.840> any<00:01:09.960> leaves

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
leaves nor will it ever have any leaves

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.950 
leaves nor will it ever have any leaves
this<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.100> completely<00:01:11.640> leafless<00:01:12.360> orchid<00:01:12.750> it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this is a completely leafless orchid it

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960 
this is a completely leafless orchid it
is<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.799> roots<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.310> sometimes<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
is going to have roots and sometimes the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.800 
is going to have roots and sometimes the
blooms<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
blooms on it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
blooms on it
their<00:01:16.290> roots<00:01:16.470> themself<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:17.310> they

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
their roots themself you can see they

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.249 
their roots themself you can see they
have<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> greenest<00:01:18.119> tinge<00:01:18.390> especially<00:01:19.140> when

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
have a greenest tinge especially when

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.429 
have a greenest tinge especially when
wet<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.770> they<00:01:20.610> are<00:01:20.790> capable<00:01:21.240> of

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
wet and they are capable of

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:22.999 
wet and they are capable of
photosynthesizing<00:01:22.439> right<00:01:22.650> through<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
photosynthesizing right through the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.160 
photosynthesizing right through the
roots<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:24.060> grows<00:01:24.439> on<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> side<00:01:25.770> trees<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
roots this grows on the side trees and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.490 
roots this grows on the side trees and
naturally<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.409> has<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:29.540> warm<00:01:30.540> wet<00:01:30.869> summer<00:01:31.229> and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
naturally it has a warm wet summer and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.069 
naturally it has a warm wet summer and
it's<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:31.829> bit<00:01:32.009> drier<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.820> winter<00:01:33.210> so

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
it's a little bit drier in the winter so

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.140 
it's a little bit drier in the winter so
I'm<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.040> hang<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.280> guy<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:35.729> really

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
I'm going to hang this guy up really

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.149 
I'm going to hang this guy up really
high<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.810> with<00:01:37.079> my<00:01:37.259> cat<00:01:37.500> Leigh<00:01:37.680> as<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.040> my

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
high in with my cat Leigh as in my

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.270 
high in with my cat Leigh as in my
vanda's<00:01:38.700> up<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.750> 6<00:01:40.380> 7<00:01:40.650> foot<00:01:40.799> mark<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
vanda's up on the 6 7 foot mark in the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.460 
vanda's up on the 6 7 foot mark in the
greenhouse<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:41.909> give<00:01:42.720> him<00:01:42.869> lots<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.259> water

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
greenhouse here give him lots of water

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.350 
greenhouse here give him lots of water
for<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> summer<00:01:44.040> time<00:01:44.310> hopefully<00:01:45.000> we'll<00:01:45.270> get

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
for the summer time hopefully we'll get

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.940 
for the summer time hopefully we'll get
some<00:01:45.509> new<00:01:45.689> growth<00:01:45.899> out<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.259> them<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.470> don't<00:01:46.710> know

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
some new growth out of them I don't know

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.219 
some new growth out of them I don't know
what<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.490> assume<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.390> growth<00:01:48.750> tip<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.110> actually

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
what I assume the growth tip is actually

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139 
what I assume the growth tip is actually
there<00:01:49.649> there's<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.430> dead<00:01:50.759> piece<00:01:50.970> on

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
there there's a little dead piece on

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.429 
there there's a little dead piece on
this<00:01:51.329> end<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.630> I'm<00:01:51.810> assuming<00:01:52.020> he's<00:01:52.200> growing

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
this end so I'm assuming he's growing

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.020 
this end so I'm assuming he's growing
that<00:01:52.710> way<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.310> facing<00:01:53.520> into<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that way so I have it facing into the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.639 
that way so I have it facing into the
basket<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.790> yeah<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.649> photosynthesizes

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
basket and yeah so it photosynthesizes

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.380 
basket and yeah so it photosynthesizes
through<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> leaves<00:01:59.310> or<00:01:59.790> through<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.180> roots

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
through the leaves or through the roots

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.230 
through the leaves or through the roots
and<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.829> produces<00:02:01.950> nice<00:02:02.490> little<00:02:02.820> yellow

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
and then it produces nice little yellow
