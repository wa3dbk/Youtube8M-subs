00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hello and this is Nikita Kwan from the clan 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.120
 ninth shaft 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.389
 and in this video I want to show you how 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.870
 to attack with dragons on those a8 in my 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.460
 camp nine dragons 12 archers and two 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.060
 magician 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.590
 dragons level 3 as well as above echo 8 and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.270
 from my sticks 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.789
 rage and eat but i will use 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.760
 only 3 links 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.650
 that is, three ridges in the cusley you yourself 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.990
 you see that I have better clan spit 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.780
 pick the balls of either another dragon and 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.210
 so let's start the fight right away and first 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.420
 the battle will be on t during the ball of misyur 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.489
 level pumping texas and always when 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.590
 attack dragons check if 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.789
 buildings in the corner because exactly when 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.520
 you are attacking dragons 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.500
 they can cost you 1 star that is 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.469
 maybe you're going 99 percent and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.840
 get only two stars look at 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.149
 base circle is not particularly needed to clean masonry 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.120
 Sau lure when attacking the dragons do not 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.190
 necessarily from the corner of the teeth just planted 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.189
 viciousness so the dragons don't fly 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.110
 to the right also dry magicians and not only 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.299
 for cleaning the circle they are for you monkey 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.330
 kwang ass and in order to destroy 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.100
 buildings from the corner of the king land with 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.229
 the other side to the dragons flew 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.409
 I donâ€™t like a bit when dragons 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.570
 flies wide as the rage must 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.049
 act on all dragons in perfect 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.049
 case 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.240
 I wait until the king dies in no hurry better 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.610
 for they are used as on m x 8 and and 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.070
 still no as soon as the king die i 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.070
 ruler land no point namely 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.329
 ruler land all my dragons and 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.000
 I throw a rage where most of all 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.590
 dragons and throw and rage need about 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.780
 the moment they got to 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.320
 the first fence that is, I throwing two at once 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.500
 always the case when attacking mx 8 and 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.149
 3 reyj do not throw hill 3 speeches and throw on 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.970
 tx roughly so they are faster than him 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.100
 destroyed and pushed forward the meaning 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.320
 throw raid at the end of the battle no because 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.899
 that if you throw a flight at the beginning then you 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.380
 grab all 9-10 dragons if you 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.899
 are attacking 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.280
 using 10 dragons if you do 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.009
 this is the end at best you 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.929
 Mode 5 will be taken at the dragons and the meaning 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.810
 dragon attacks this as quickly as possible 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.800
 penetrate the center 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.690
 in all allowed banks I will throw more 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.910
 I can not throw because at t x 8 can be 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.060
 throw so many three cans in one battle and 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.640
 just waiting for the dragon to finish it all 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.920
 buildings and look at it already all 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.120
 all demolished by 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.459
 only those left their tower archers 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.709
 ears that can kill someone drac 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.700
 from someone from dragons but dragons to me 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.099
 three more left 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.010
 which means I'm in a game, but of course it was 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:43.430
 bazaar ball the next battles the base will be by 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.330
 harder and everything left me 3 percent 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.299
 it's gun and tesla and let's just 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.840
 wait for another air bomb hit by 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.489
 my dragon and everything at any moment 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.260
 end the battle look me still 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.739
 forty seconds left until the end of the battle then 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.330
 I got it in 2 minutes 20 seconds 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.420
 the next attack on this one is x8 and 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.069
 see here from the bottom corner there is one 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.480
 free cell where you can land 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.970
 dragons but you can't do that 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.310
 it is absolutely impossible to land dragons 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.170
 at one single point because they 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.450
 just scatter in different directions and how 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.010
 the rule will fly even past t.kh. 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.870
 and you will collect a maximum of 1-2 stars in general 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.150
 I have long wanted to show you how to clean 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.100
 circle here look here a good example i 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.920
 would tell the corner I land my paladin 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.930
 archers and magicians that is it is 20 units 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.500
 approximately that is equal to one 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.569
 dragon meaning you live circle not 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.220
 poke it, that is, don't do one 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.319
 hole in the middle of the base because 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.079
 the dragon will then scatter in any way 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.720
 baku apa tear it from both sides as well 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.420
 i use the king and then land 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.459
 also the line of the remaining dragons 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.069
 as usual after the landing of dragons waiting 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.319
 until you reach 1 fence and then immediately 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.380
 I throw two cans before, see all 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.450
 dragons have come under these regs waiting until 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.630
 will fly to the middle and then I will throw 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.030
 and already the third bank of ridge I also wanted 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.799
 would mention that attack with dragons 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.109
 using three cans reggie much 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.959
 more efficient than taking instead 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:17.709
 ridge one can of hilo hill i never 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.970
 I will take and will not take when attacking the dragons 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.440
 by the way when you attack dragons 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.380
 always attack from where 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.020
 located 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.810
 2nd because approximately to the middle 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.300
 base dragon still go strictly ruler and 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.300
 they knock down all the buildings in their path 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.900
 also they are padre john therefore 2 by will 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.600
 demolished 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.660
 much faster than if you attacked 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.100
 only one see about the center and 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.730
 dragon divided into two groups 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.600
 right and left and if there were two 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.420
 leash 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.740
 dragon damage would be much more then 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.050
 have they not flown 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.400
 and did not break it as a rule 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.800
 dragons after the middle 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.270
 go to the sides and on the side again to attack 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.000
 base center 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.850
 I'm also foolishly cinema kwan cashier because 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.720
 that i'm in a panic because two dragons are not 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.110
 will be able to tear down 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.480
 on level 5 in the clan Kasley by the way should 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.580
 be either balls or another dragon but i 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.610
 did not ask specifically for the attack yet 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.740
 balls or dragon clan and even the most 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.230
 ineffective dragon attack strategies 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.420
 take it three cans of lightning 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.840
 wear one reason that is it 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.090
 wrong and that's all for today 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.860
 video thank you so much for watching 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.120
 it was Nikita all good weekend 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.740
 successful farm 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.740
 until next video bye
