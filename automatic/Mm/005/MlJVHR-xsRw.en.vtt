00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.159 
and then it like stood in my mouth for
about<00:05:36.860> a<00:05:36.889> second<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:38.169> it<00:05:40.599> it<00:05:41.599> just<00:05:41.630> tasted

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
about a second and it it just tasted

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:48.159 
about a second and it it just tasted
like<00:05:42.349> it<00:05:44.470> tasted<00:05:45.470> like<00:05:45.530> yeah<00:05:46.510> but<00:05:47.510> it<00:05:47.630> probably

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
like it tasted like yeah but it probably

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.379 
like it tasted like yeah but it probably
is<00:05:48.530> what<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:49.130> scrapings<00:05:49.820> like<00:05:49.970> the<00:05:50.090> black

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
is what the scrapings like the black

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.029 
is what the scrapings like the black
scrapings<00:05:51.080> that<00:05:51.260> you<00:05:51.380> get<00:05:51.680> when<00:05:51.919> you're

cooking<00:05:52.220> bacon<00:05:52.849> it's<00:05:53.330> probably<00:05:53.660> about<00:05:54.139> what

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
cooking bacon it's probably about what

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.189 
cooking bacon it's probably about what
