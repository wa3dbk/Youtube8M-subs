the void changes the worker changes the
mineral<00:02:09.890> changes<00:02:10.490> how<00:02:10.910> do<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.090> feel<00:02:11.330> about

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
mineral changes how do you feel about

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.620 
mineral changes how do you feel about
these<00:02:11.690> changes<00:02:11.990> are<00:02:12.080> they<00:02:12.200> good<00:02:12.440> are<00:02:12.710> they<00:02:12.830> bad

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
these changes are they good are they bad

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.960 
these changes are they good are they bad
yeah<00:02:14.630> all<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.290> players<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:16.100> they<00:02:16.580> became

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
yeah all of the players and they became

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.120 
yeah all of the players and they became
talked<00:02:17.330> about<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.840> lot<00:02:18.140> because<00:02:18.710> they

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
talked about that a lot because they

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.280 
talked about that a lot because they
they<00:02:19.580> became<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.210> balance<00:02:20.660> they<00:02:20.810> wanted<00:02:21.140> to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
they became and balance they wanted to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.800 
they became and balance they wanted to
hear<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:22.070> pro<00:02:22.550> players<00:02:22.880> opinion<00:02:23.540> and

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
hear the pro players opinion and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.650 
hear the pro players opinion and
propellers<00:02:24.650> wanna<00:02:25.280> hear<00:02:25.520> why<00:02:25.820> they<00:02:26.120> made<00:02:26.420> that

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
propellers wanna hear why they made that

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.760 
propellers wanna hear why they made that
changes<00:02:27.290> and

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
changes and

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.230 
changes and
so<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:29.000> conclusion<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:30.640> basically<00:02:31.640> most<00:02:31.970> of

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
so the conclusion is basically most of

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.530 
so the conclusion is basically most of
people<00:02:32.570> think<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:34.150> beginning<00:02:35.150> with<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.300> game

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
people think the beginning with the game

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.130 
people think the beginning with the game
is<00:02:35.780> kind<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.230> boring<00:02:36.500> because<00:02:36.890> uh<00:02:37.100> oh<00:02:37.520> if<00:02:38.300> one

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
is kind of boring because uh oh if one

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.520 
is kind of boring because uh oh if one
player<00:02:39.410> doesn't<00:02:39.920> do<00:02:40.010> something<00:02:40.280> proxy<00:02:41.030> then

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
player doesn't do something proxy then

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.890 
player doesn't do something proxy then
basically<00:02:42.530> same<00:02:43.100> this<00:02:43.760> is<00:02:43.910> my<00:02:44.150> mirrors<00:02:44.600> and

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
basically same this is my mirrors and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.890 
basically same this is my mirrors and
guess<00:02:45.140> make<00:02:45.440> build<00:02:45.950> workers<00:02:46.490> expand<00:02:47.360> that's

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
guess make build workers expand that's

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.110 
guess make build workers expand that's
pretty<00:02:48.440> much<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.590> same<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:48.860> it's<00:02:49.700> kind<00:02:50.000> of

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
pretty much the same so it's kind of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.910 
pretty much the same so it's kind of
boring<00:02:50.300> they<00:02:50.660> wanted<00:02:50.990> to<00:02:51.080> delete<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.590> part

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
boring they wanted to delete the part

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.240 
boring they wanted to delete the part
just<00:02:52.460> want<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.090> want<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.020> jump<00:02:54.230> into<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.950> next

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
just want to want to jump into the next

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.620 
just want to want to jump into the next
part<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.690> mineral<00:02:57.110> change<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:58.510> there<00:02:59.510> is

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
part and the mineral change is there is

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.860 
part and the mineral change is there is
like<00:02:59.930> produce<00:03:00.560> or<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:00.920> terror<00:03:01.400> just<00:03:02.180> defend

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
like produce or a terror just defend

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.640 
like produce or a terror just defend
different<00:03:03.710> defend<00:03:04.490> and<00:03:04.910> make<00:03:05.750> build<00:03:06.170> up<00:03:06.380> like

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
different defend and make build up like

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.150 
different defend and make build up like
200<00:03:07.220> army<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.820> go<00:03:07.970> out<00:03:08.120> that's<00:03:08.450> kind<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:09.160> not

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
200 army and go out that's kind of not

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.900 
200 army and go out that's kind of not
the<00:03:10.190> situation<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:11.240> dance<00:03:11.960> team<00:03:12.260> on<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.910> so

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
the situation the dance team on it so

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.690 
the situation the dance team on it so
they<00:03:14.360> want<00:03:14.570> to<00:03:14.660> change<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.740> like<00:03:16.310> you

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
they want to change that so like you

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.570 
they want to change that so like you
know<00:03:16.730> since<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.420> winner<00:03:17.720> patch<00:03:17.960> is<00:03:18.580> reduced

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
know since the winner patch is reduced

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.800 
know since the winner patch is reduced
to<00:03:19.970> one<00:03:20.450> thousand<00:03:21.880> players<00:03:22.880> need<00:03:23.210> to<00:03:23.390> expend

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
to one thousand players need to expend

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.500 
to one thousand players need to expend
more<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:24.290> more<00:03:24.560> so<00:03:25.460> that<00:03:25.880> makes<00:03:26.150> more

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
more and more so that makes more

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.440 
more and more so that makes more
engagements<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.680> happen<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:28.450> possibly

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
engagements to happen and possibly

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.860 
engagements to happen and possibly
nothing<00:03:30.380> like<00:03:30.620> just<00:03:31.040> making<00:03:31.520> slow<00:03:32.209> most<00:03:32.510> and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
nothing like just making slow most and

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.890 
nothing like just making slow most and
defending<00:03:33.640> just<00:03:34.640> going<00:03:34.940> back<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.150> defending

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
defending just going back and defending

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.110 
defending just going back and defending
that's<00:03:36.080> not<00:03:36.290> going<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.530> happen<00:03:36.590> in<00:03:37.000> legacy<00:03:38.000> of

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
that's not going to happen in legacy of

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.260 
that's not going to happen in legacy of
the<00:03:38.150> void<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:39.340> see<00:03:40.340> thank<00:03:40.610> you<00:03:40.700> very<00:03:40.880> much<00:03:41.000> poop

think is the strongest race which race
do<00:03:51.050> you<00:03:51.170> think<00:03:51.350> is<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.650> weakest<00:03:52.010> race<00:03:52.190> which

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
do you think is the weakest race which

do you think is the weakest race which
race<00:03:52.640> do<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:52.880> think<00:03:53.120> got<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.590> most<00:03:54.800> benefit

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
race do you think got the most benefit

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.600 
race do you think got the most benefit
out<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:55.850> all<00:03:56.150> these<00:03:56.330> changes<00:03:56.630> that<00:03:56.990> occurred

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
out of all these changes that occurred

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.780 
out of all these changes that occurred
it's<00:03:58.610> very<00:03:58.940> difficult<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.690> say<00:04:00.050> because<00:04:00.790> we're

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
it's very difficult to say because we're

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.970 
it's very difficult to say because we're
we're<00:04:02.240> not<00:04:02.480> used<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.870> play<00:04:03.110> that<00:04:03.410> game<00:04:03.650> it's

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
we're not used to play that game it's

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.699 
we're not used to play that game it's
totally<00:04:04.670> new<00:04:04.970> we<00:04:05.330> just<00:04:05.570> played<00:04:05.780> like<00:04:06.200> a<00:04:06.230> few

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
totally new we just played like a few

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.220 
totally new we just played like a few
games<00:04:07.010> maybe<00:04:07.820> more<00:04:08.120> than<00:04:08.150> ten<00:04:08.480> games<00:04:08.690> but<00:04:08.959> it's

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
games maybe more than ten games but it's

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.730 
games maybe more than ten games but it's
not<00:04:09.500> enough<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.160> get<00:04:11.090> into<00:04:11.360> that<00:04:11.510> game<00:04:11.780> so<00:04:12.760> but

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
not enough to get into that game so but

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.860 
not enough to get into that game so but
as<00:04:15.190> far<00:04:15.730> as<00:04:15.760> we<00:04:16.720> talked<00:04:17.110> about<00:04:17.290> that<00:04:18.390> we<00:04:19.390> pretty

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
as far as we talked about that we pretty

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.470 
as far as we talked about that we pretty
much<00:04:19.959> concluded<00:04:20.860> I<00:04:21.160> mean<00:04:21.700> the<00:04:21.970> order<00:04:22.300> of<00:04:22.360> the

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
much concluded I mean the order of the
