alright<00:01:53.369> I'm<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.670> loosen<00:01:54.030> these<00:01:54.329> bolts

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
alright I'm going to loosen these bolts

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.569 
alright I'm going to loosen these bolts
and<00:01:55.079> now<00:01:55.259> according<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.799> what<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:55.979> read<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
and now according to what I read on the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.029 
and now according to what I read on the
Internet<00:01:57.119> these<00:01:57.450> are<00:01:57.689> torqued<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.289> 23<00:01:58.740> Newton

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
Internet these are torqued to 23 Newton

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.099 
Internet these are torqued to 23 Newton
meters<00:01:59.689> so<00:02:00.689> I'm<00:02:01.049> going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.289> use<00:02:01.469> my<00:02:01.799> old<00:02:03.109> torque

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
meters so I'm going to use my old torque

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.770 
meters so I'm going to use my old torque
wrench<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.590> read<00:02:04.740> both<00:02:04.950> directions

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
wrench that can read both directions

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.290 
wrench that can read both directions
and<00:02:07.160> see<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.340> get<00:02:08.399> an<00:02:08.610> idea<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.940> what<00:02:09.119> they

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and see if I get an idea of what they

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.980 
and see if I get an idea of what they
are<00:02:09.330> torque<00:02:09.690> -<00:02:10.820> yeah<00:02:11.820> broke<00:02:12.450> loose<00:02:12.630> at<00:02:12.780> about

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
are torque - yeah broke loose at about

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.070 
are torque - yeah broke loose at about
23<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.360> I'm<00:02:15.450> going<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.630> go<00:02:15.690> ahead<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.960> take

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
23 so I'm going to go ahead and take

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.610 
23 so I'm going to go ahead and take
them<00:02:16.230> loose<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.740> then<00:02:17.340> I'll<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:18.060> right<00:02:18.240> back

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
them loose and then I'll be right back

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.350 
them loose and then I'll be right back
okay<00:02:19.620> I've<00:02:19.830> taken<00:02:20.010> off<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.430> one<00:02:20.640> clamp<00:02:21.000> left

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
okay I've taken off just one clamp left

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.050 
okay I've taken off just one clamp left
the<00:02:21.480> other<00:02:21.570> one<00:02:21.690> on<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:22.080> just<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.440> moment<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.060> I

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the other one on for just a moment and I

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.360 
the other one on for just a moment and I
want<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.540> see<00:02:24.720> how<00:02:24.930> far<00:02:25.230> these<00:02:25.470> bolts<00:02:25.890> extend

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
want to see how far these bolts extend

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.960 
want to see how far these bolts extend
so<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.910> looks<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.120> me<00:02:27.270> like<00:02:27.300> they<00:02:27.600> extend<00:02:27.930> 15

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
so it looks to me like they extend 15

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.380 
so it looks to me like they extend 15
millimeters<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:31.170> what<00:02:31.320> I'm<00:02:31.380> going<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.709> is

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
millimeters so what I'm going to do is

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.060 
millimeters so what I'm going to do is
put<00:02:33.390> one<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.630> these<00:02:33.750> with<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.380> even<00:02:35.040> though

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
put one of these with this even though

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.310 
put one of these with this even though
it<00:02:35.220> goes<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.700> other<00:02:35.820> side<00:02:36.120> actually<00:02:36.630> but

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
it goes on the other side actually but

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.290 
it goes on the other side actually but
put<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.740> with<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.190> try<00:02:38.790> different<00:02:38.850> bolt

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
put it with it and try different bolt

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.420 
put it with it and try different bolt
size<00:02:39.480> sizes<00:02:40.320> until<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.620> get<00:02:40.770> one<00:02:40.920> that's<00:02:41.040> 15

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
size sizes until I get one that's 15

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.310 
size sizes until I get one that's 15
millimeters<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.120> length<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.959> came<00:02:43.170> with

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
millimeters in length it came with

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.770 
millimeters in length it came with
different<00:02:44.100> sizes<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.610> kit<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.150> we're

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
different sizes in the kit so we're

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.000 
different sizes in the kit so we're
going<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> do<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.140> I'll<00:02:46.350> be<00:02:46.440> right<00:02:46.560> back

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
going to do that I'll be right back

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.229 
going to do that I'll be right back
alright<00:02:47.430> my<00:02:47.550> kit<00:02:47.760> came<00:02:47.910> with<00:02:47.970> two<00:02:48.209> different

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
alright my kit came with two different

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.820 
alright my kit came with two different
bolt<00:02:48.660> sizes<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:51.230> chosen<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.320> shorter<00:02:52.620> size

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
bolt sizes so I chosen the shorter size

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.890 
bolt sizes so I chosen the shorter size
I<00:02:53.160> need<00:02:53.370> four<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.670> them<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.090> they're<00:02:54.450> all<00:02:54.480> here

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
I need four of them so they're all here

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.050 
I need four of them so they're all here
and<00:02:55.200> just<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.920> be<00:02:56.040> sure<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:56.580> wasn't<00:02:56.880> going<00:02:57.000> to

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
and just to be sure it wasn't going to

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.050 
and just to be sure it wasn't going to
bottom<00:02:57.390> out<00:02:57.480> too<00:02:57.750> early<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:58.080> went<00:02:58.350> ahead<00:02:58.440> and

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
bottom out too early I went ahead and

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.680 
bottom out too early I went ahead and
put<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.180> in<00:03:00.300> here<00:03:00.570> so<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:01.170> could<00:03:01.350> measure<00:03:01.560> it

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
put it in here so I could measure it

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.890 
put it in here so I could measure it
against<00:03:03.690> this<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.880> it<00:03:05.880> should<00:03:06.060> easily<00:03:06.300> have

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
against this and it should easily have

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.510 
against this and it should easily have
plenty<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.290> room<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.860> go<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.130> there<00:03:08.340> and

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
plenty of room to go in there and

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.680 
plenty of room to go in there and
tighten<00:03:09.060> up<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.500> wanted<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.920> do<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.160> first

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
tighten up so I wanted to do that first

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.699 
tighten up so I wanted to do that first
so<00:03:12.690> now<00:03:12.870> I'll<00:03:13.049> go<00:03:13.260> ahead<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.500> loosen<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
so now I'll go ahead and loosen the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.190 
so now I'll go ahead and loosen the
other<00:03:13.890> side<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.519> I'll<00:03:14.760> put<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.620> risers<00:03:16.620> on

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
other side and I'll put the risers on

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.130 
other side and I'll put the risers on
they'll<00:03:19.200> be<00:03:19.230> actually<00:03:19.620> like<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:21.140> then

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
they'll be actually like this and then

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.690 
they'll be actually like this and then
we'll<00:03:22.350> attach<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.769> handlebars<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.430> we'll

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
we'll attach the handlebars and we'll

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.340 
we'll attach the handlebars and we'll
see<00:03:23.880> how<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.090> works<00:03:24.269> out<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:24.959> I'll<00:03:25.140> be<00:03:25.260> right

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
see how that works out so I'll be right

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.190 
see how that works out so I'll be right
back<00:03:25.560> okay<00:03:26.340> I've<00:03:26.459> put<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.880> risers<00:03:27.660> on<00:03:27.870> and

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
back okay I've put the risers on and

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.440 
back okay I've put the risers on and
they're<00:03:28.350> not<00:03:28.470> even<00:03:28.650> really<00:03:28.980> snug<00:03:29.280> yet<00:03:29.489> made

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
they're not even really snug yet made

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.380 
they're not even really snug yet made
sure<00:03:30.600> my<00:03:30.750> alignment<00:03:31.019> marks<00:03:31.500> are<00:03:31.680> all<00:03:31.830> set<00:03:32.390> so

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
sure my alignment marks are all set so

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.720 
sure my alignment marks are all set so
that's<00:03:33.540> good<00:03:33.900> sat<00:03:34.530> on<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.950> make<00:03:35.100> sure<00:03:35.130> that

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
that's good sat on it to make sure that

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.690 
that's good sat on it to make sure that
it's<00:03:36.720> in<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.959> right<00:03:37.079> position<00:03:37.920> as<00:03:38.370> much<00:03:38.519> as

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
it's in the right position as much as

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.180 
it's in the right position as much as
possible<00:03:38.959> I've<00:03:39.959> checked<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.530> play<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.950> all

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
possible I've checked the play of all

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.860 
possible I've checked the play of all
the<00:03:41.370> cables<00:03:41.760> everything<00:03:42.150> seems<00:03:42.540> fine<00:03:42.630> with

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
the cables everything seems fine with

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.979 
the cables everything seems fine with
this<00:03:43.200> small<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.250> riser<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:45.510> now<00:03:45.690> I'm<00:03:45.840> going

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
this small of a riser so now I'm going

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.220 
this small of a riser so now I'm going
to<00:03:46.079> start<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.380> snug<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.769> up<00:03:47.690> torque<00:03:48.690> spec<00:03:48.989> I

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
to start to snug it up torque spec I

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.500 
to start to snug it up torque spec I
read<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.769> 23<00:03:50.250> Newton<00:03:50.549> meters<00:03:50.850> to<00:03:51.239> me<00:03:51.329> that

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
read is 23 Newton meters to me that

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.750 
read is 23 Newton meters to me that
seems<00:03:51.750> high<00:03:52.160> although<00:03:53.160> they<00:03:53.280> were<00:03:53.340> on<00:03:53.610> there

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
seems high although they were on there

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.900 
seems high although they were on there
very<00:03:53.790> tight<00:03:54.860> so<00:03:55.860> I'm<00:03:56.160> probably<00:03:56.519> going<00:03:56.850> to

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
very tight so I'm probably going to

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.430 
very tight so I'm probably going to
start<00:03:57.090> out<00:03:57.239> just<00:03:57.269> torquing<00:03:57.780> them<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.019> like<00:03:58.170> 12

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
start out just torquing them to like 12

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.259 
start out just torquing them to like 12
Newton<00:03:58.799> meters<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.340> see<00:03:59.549> how<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.850> feels

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
Newton meters and see how it feels

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.870 
Newton meters and see how it feels
and<00:04:00.420> if<00:04:01.320> it's<00:04:01.470> nice<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.890> tight<00:04:02.040> may<00:04:02.640> just

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
and if it's nice and tight may just

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.690 
and if it's nice and tight may just
leave<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.209> way<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.950> I'll<00:04:05.190> be<00:04:05.310> right<00:04:05.459> back

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
leave it that way so I'll be right back

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.289 
leave it that way so I'll be right back
okay<00:04:06.570> I've<00:04:06.660> set<00:04:06.840> my<00:04:06.989> torque<00:04:07.920> wrench<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:09.060> 12

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
okay I've set my torque wrench to 12

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.490 
okay I've set my torque wrench to 12
Newton<00:04:09.630> meters<00:04:09.870> because<00:04:09.989> that's<00:04:10.200> where<00:04:10.380> I'm

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
Newton meters because that's where I'm

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
going to start at what I've done is I've

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.070 
going to start at what I've done is I've
Snug<00:04:13.829> these<00:04:14.040> up

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
Snug these up

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.370 
Snug these up
and<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:16.040> want<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.430> tighten<00:04:17.330> up<00:04:17.390> in<00:04:17.690> a<00:04:18.140> pattern

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
and I want to tighten up in a pattern

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.410 
and I want to tighten up in a pattern
crisscross<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:21.730> snug<00:04:22.730> them<00:04:22.850> up<00:04:22.940> a<00:04:23.060> little<00:04:23.210> bit

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
crisscross and snug them up a little bit

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.230 
crisscross and snug them up a little bit
at<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.660> time<00:04:23.750> until<00:04:24.520> they<00:04:25.520> get<00:04:25.670> to<00:04:25.760> like<00:04:25.940> 12

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
at a time until they get to like 12

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.740 
at a time until they get to like 12
Newton<00:04:26.840> meters<00:04:27.170> of<00:04:27.430> torque<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:29.120> then<00:04:29.480> I'll

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
Newton meters of torque and then I'll

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.410 
Newton meters of torque and then I'll
see<00:04:30.050> how<00:04:30.200> it<00:04:30.290> feels<00:04:30.530> I<00:04:30.800> did<00:04:31.430> write<00:04:31.670> two<00:04:31.880> LS<00:04:32.210> l

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
see how it feels I did write two LS l

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.730 
see how it feels I did write two LS l
and<00:04:32.630> ask<00:04:32.750> them<00:04:33.040> what<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.160> torque<00:04:34.430> spec<00:04:34.700> is<00:04:34.910> so

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
and ask them what the torque spec is so

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.780 
and ask them what the torque spec is so
hopefully<00:04:36.740> they'll<00:04:36.920> answer<00:04:37.100> me<00:04:37.340> back<00:04:37.520> with

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
hopefully they'll answer me back with

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.420 
hopefully they'll answer me back with
the<00:04:37.970> correct<00:04:38.540> torque<00:04:38.780> spec<00:04:41.260> so<00:04:42.260> there's<00:04:43.100> 12

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
the correct torque spec so there's 12

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.580 
the correct torque spec so there's 12
right<00:04:43.700> there<00:04:44.140> it<00:04:45.140> probably<00:04:45.500> really<00:04:45.620> is<00:04:45.830> 23<00:04:46.520> but

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
right there it probably really is 23 but

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.230 
right there it probably really is 23 but
we'll<00:04:48.590> check<00:04:49.040> it<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:49.370> I'll<00:04:49.640> put<00:04:49.850> something<00:04:50.150> in

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
we'll check it and I'll put something in

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.930 
we'll check it and I'll put something in
the<00:04:50.300> comment<00:04:50.660> section<00:04:51.050> so<00:04:52.040> thanks<00:04:52.760> for

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
the comment section so thanks for

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.360 
the comment section so thanks for
