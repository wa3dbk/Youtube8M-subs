00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.410
 storing personal data of their 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.090
 users on china servers like 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.830
 part of an agreement with china telecom 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.349
 as reported by the prestigious 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.929
 financial times the company of the 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.460
 apple denies that his decision compromises 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.670
 the security and privacy of their 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.290
 customers to Paul has ensured that the 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.480
 data they store on Chinese servers 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.390
 they are encrypted and they do not put in 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.430
 danger the privacy of its users the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.350
 Cupertino company ensures that this 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.000
 The purpose of the decision is to increase 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.010
 speed and reliability of service to 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.300
 your customers at the same time you have 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.150
 denied that there is a problem of 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.920
 privacy to paul takes security and 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.020
 the user's privacy very seriously 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.850
 He has told by financial time 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.500
 We have incorporated china telecom to 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.450
 our list of providers of the center 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.189
 of data to increase the width of 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.930
 band and improve performance for 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.880
 our customers in china 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.220
 all the stored data are 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.070
 Chinese telecom encryption does not have access 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.870
 to the content has explained to Paul 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.520
 store data in China does not only suppose 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.800
 that they are subject to Chinese law 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.330
 but apple would be forced to 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.450
 deliver information from your clients to 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.800
 the authorities if it is required to 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.060
 He did not want to specify the type 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.040
 of data that are collected in the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.840
 china telecom servers but it is given 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.020
 for granted that there are copies of 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.210
 iCloud security 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.439
 a source that has knowledge about 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.259
 the situation but he has not wanted 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.670
 reveal your identity has affirmed that 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.920
 the encryption keys of the servers 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.810
 they are not stored in an accessible place 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.270
 and that not even China itself 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.159
 Telecom has access to them for another 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.319
 part apple has claimed that it has 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.390
 encryption systems developed 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.430
 they do not allow them to access 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.770
 the data of the users 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.200
 initially the personal data of 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.490
 users should be safe but 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.830
 it seems that several security experts 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.500
 have clarified that in the event that 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.030
 authorities give access to paul should 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.890
 grant us without any problem 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.600
 and other technology companies like 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.850
 google according to the financial times 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.770
 they have stopped keeping you information in 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.290
 the Asian country after the worries 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.360
 emerged about privacy and 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.180
 need to comply with the laws of 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.890
 Chinese censorship because let's be clear on 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.870
 fact of having to save data from the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.580
 Chinese server clients is a 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.260
 bet on a tray to the authorities of 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.300
 that country of all the information 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.530
 compiled by apple no matter how much they 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.760
 tell me I'm very worried about everything 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.400
 begins to start within the empire to 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.959
 Paul to make business break 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.360
 certain barriers can make 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.820
 let's move on from a company that boasted of 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.560
 an almost invulnerable hermetism to 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.970
 become one more with all the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.280
 problems that the others take years 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.959
 supporting a currency change 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.110
 china to be able to do business in your 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.760
 country if you realize each time they are more 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.459
 the decisions of a because they have as 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.319
 backdrop the Chinese territory and 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.610
 while that stays there because it will be a 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.040
 local problem that will have to solve 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.410
 in that country but if the rules of the game 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.300
 they break once who says they do not know 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.910
 can do more in more places 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.190
 says that whoever proves the emotion of 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.200
 do something not too ethical is left 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.930
 hooked and loses the fear of doing it 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.630
 more times we talk about privacy and 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.610
 security and apple has always been a 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.680
 standard-bearer of both terms and that's why 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.360
 himself has hooked us to a lot and 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.480
 convinced of the need to enjoy 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.750
 of your products to be sure but 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.460
 if this breaks that can happen it's worth 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.190
 more business than the image of the 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.700
 sincerely and in my humble company 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.110
 opinion I really think that I do not support 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.030
 insists that you do not have to worry 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.640
 that everything is safe and the Chinese users 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.670
 You can be calm but if I were 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.740
 Chinese would not be to Paul to broken by 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.870
 first time that veto that always struck at 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.940
 your safety conditions nor the so 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.690
 criticized google has inflated by the long 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.420
 of the Chinese government 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.210
 for now we pray that this decision 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.400
 do not go through the Chinese wall and jump to 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.190
 our continent because he already knows 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.820
 Mr. Wood we are watching up 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.820
 in a few days
