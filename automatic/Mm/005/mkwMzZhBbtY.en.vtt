 hello guys today exceeded 2 and we're 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.860
 in a video tutorial today I will teach you 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.940
 how to activate the commands in your world of 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.669
 survival without gas and without bots 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.570
 well first they get into their world in 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:21.950
 this case make this map and they want 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.830
 activate the receipt something so that's how 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:32.290
 then we enter and I am here 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:35.080
 I want to get in the way of one go 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.989
 will leave me that you do not have permission to 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.620
 use this command because here what 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:46.090
 you can do would be to go to 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:49.150

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.909
 this trick is very useful and that many do not 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.909
 I knew it here 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.800
 for example here I can use the group 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.800
 of the thousand hearts 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.159
 and I already have 500 hearts now we are going to 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.509
