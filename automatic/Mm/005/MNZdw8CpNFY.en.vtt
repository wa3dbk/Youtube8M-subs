00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
private kind of embarrassing but you

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.870 
private kind of embarrassing but you
have<00:00:39.260> 70<00:00:39.620> pounds<00:00:40.070> during<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.370> pregnancy<00:00:40.550> and

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
pregnancy weight so I think maybe the

pregnancy weight so I think maybe the
fact<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:45.950> I<00:00:46.100> lost<00:00:46.490> 100<00:00:47.030> over<00:00:47.330> 150<00:00:47.930> pounds<00:00:48.260> to

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
fact that I lost 100 over 150 pounds to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.350 
fact that I lost 100 over 150 pounds to
that<00:00:48.470> other<00:00:48.590> patients<00:00:49.340> understanding<00:00:49.820> that<00:00:50.300> I

kind of get what they're where they're

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.000 
kind of get what they're where they're
coming<00:00:52.790> from<00:00:52.910> when<00:00:53.720> they<00:00:53.870> have<00:00:54.590> concerns

the most important part is that patients

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.779 
the most important part is that patients
just<00:02:04.710> relax<00:02:05.710> take<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.039> deep<00:02:06.100> breath<00:02:06.460> and
