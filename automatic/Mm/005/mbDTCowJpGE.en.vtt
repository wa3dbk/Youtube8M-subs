help diagnose blue screen events on your
Windows<00:00:17.540> computer<00:00:17.650> by<00:00:18.650> using<00:00:18.830> a<00:00:18.980> program

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
Windows computer by using a program

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.920 
Windows computer by using a program
called<00:00:19.340> blue<00:00:19.790> screen<00:00:19.910> view<00:00:20.270> from<00:00:20.600> a<00:00:20.690> company

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
called blue screen view from a company

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.340 
called blue screen view from a company
called<00:00:20.990> Nair<00:00:21.290> soft<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.910> the<00:00:23.390> company<00:00:24.230> nurse

called Nair soft the the company nurse
off<00:00:24.590> actually<00:00:24.800> has<00:00:25.100> quite<00:00:25.310> a<00:00:25.400> few<00:00:25.550> utilities

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
off actually has quite a few utilities

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.290 
off actually has quite a few utilities
that<00:00:27.290> are<00:00:27.800> very<00:00:28.010> useful<00:00:28.400> for<00:00:28.430> Windows<00:00:28.970> systems

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
that are very useful for Windows systems

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.840 
that are very useful for Windows systems
but<00:00:29.720> I'm<00:00:29.870> gonna<00:00:29.960> basically<00:00:30.490> talk<00:00:31.490> about<00:00:31.730> the

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
but I'm gonna basically talk about the

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.180 
but I'm gonna basically talk about the
one<00:00:31.970> called<00:00:32.180> blue<00:00:32.390> screen<00:00:32.540> view<00:00:32.989> so<00:00:33.800> if<00:00:34.100> you

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
one called blue screen view so if you

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.710 
one called blue screen view so if you
basically<00:00:34.400> go<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:34.760> google<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:35.239> type<00:00:35.270> in<00:00:35.480> blue

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
basically go to google and type in blue

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.500 
basically go to google and type in blue
screen<00:00:35.989> view<00:00:36.309> the<00:00:37.309> top<00:00:37.550> result<00:00:38.059> here<00:00:38.300> should

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
screen view the top result here should

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.049 
screen view the top result here should
be<00:00:38.629> from<00:00:38.930> their<00:00:39.440> website<00:00:39.830> so<00:00:40.670> you<00:00:40.760> click<00:00:40.910> on

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
be from their website so you click on

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.260 
be from their website so you click on
that<00:00:41.949> and<00:00:42.949> this<00:00:43.430> gives<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:43.790> description<00:00:44.120> of

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
that and this gives you a description of

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.790 
that and this gives you a description of
how<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.449> use<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.080> this<00:00:45.199> is<00:00:45.350> compatible

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
how to use it and this is compatible

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.520 
how to use it and this is compatible
with<00:00:46.040> XP<00:00:46.670> through<00:00:46.970> Windows<00:00:47.269> 8

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
with XP through Windows 8

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.689 
with XP through Windows 8
basically<00:00:49.100> it<00:00:49.610> relies<00:00:49.909> and<00:00:50.390> reads<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.890> new

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
basically it relies and reads the new

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.360 
basically it relies and reads the new
screen<00:00:52.909> event<00:00:53.210> files<00:00:53.750> from<00:00:54.350> folder<00:00:55.190> called

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
screen event files from folder called

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.360 
screen event files from folder called
mini<00:00:55.550> dump<00:00:55.790> on<00:00:56.570> your<00:00:56.750> computer

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
mini dump on your computer

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.680 
mini dump on your computer
most<00:00:58.370> Windows<00:00:58.519> systems<00:00:58.970> will<00:00:59.150> create<00:00:59.390> this<00:00:59.540> if

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
most Windows systems will create this if

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.079 
most Windows systems will create this if
you<00:00:59.780> happen<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.019> have<00:01:00.140> a<00:01:00.199> blue<00:01:00.409> screen<00:01:01.089> which

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
you happen to have a blue screen which

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.530 
you happen to have a blue screen which
looks<00:01:02.269> like<00:01:02.390> this<00:01:03.820> it's<00:01:04.820> basically<00:01:05.000> you<00:01:05.360> down

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
looks like this it's basically you down

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.600 
looks like this it's basically you down
go<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.380> just<00:01:07.100> about<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.280> bottom<00:01:07.400> of<00:01:07.549> the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
go to the just about the bottom of the

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.940 
go to the just about the bottom of the
page<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.180> you'll<00:01:08.270> see<00:01:08.479> three<00:01:08.720> different

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
page and you'll see three different

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.100 
page and you'll see three different
download<00:01:09.950> files<00:01:10.220> I<00:01:10.610> usually<00:01:11.479> choose<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.990> one

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
download files I usually choose the one

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.750 
download files I usually choose the one
that<00:01:12.229> says<00:01:12.380> full<00:01:12.590> install<00:01:12.920> uninstall<00:01:13.159> support

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
that says full install uninstall support

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.100 
that says full install uninstall support
so<00:01:14.510> you<00:01:14.570> click<00:01:14.810> on<00:01:14.930> that<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:16.930> save<00:01:17.930> it<00:01:18.049> to

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
so you click on that and save it to

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.760 
so you click on that and save it to
someplace<00:01:18.350> on<00:01:18.560> your<00:01:18.649> computer<00:01:20.619> and<00:01:21.619> you

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
someplace on your computer and you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.550 
someplace on your computer and you
basically<00:01:21.950> run<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.369> setup<00:01:22.640> program<00:01:26.560> just

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
basically run the setup program just

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.139 
basically run the setup program just
keep<00:01:27.710> on<00:01:27.829> clicking<00:01:28.130> next<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:30.969> then<00:01:31.969> once

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
keep on clicking next and then once

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.389 
keep on clicking next and then once
you're<00:01:32.240> finished<00:01:32.390> with<00:01:32.719> it<00:01:33.039> you<00:01:34.039> can<00:01:34.189> let<00:01:34.280> it

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
you're finished with it you can let it

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.099 
you're finished with it you can let it
run<00:01:34.579> now<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:37.090> haven't<00:01:38.090> had<00:01:38.270> any<00:01:38.420> blue<00:01:38.780> screens

certain files see system files caused a

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.800 
certain files see system files caused a
crash<00:02:02.420> say<00:02:03.170> like<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.590> video<00:02:04.869> card<00:02:05.869> driver

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810

network card driver anything like that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.260 
network card driver anything like that
and<00:02:11.930> then<00:02:12.890> that'll<00:02:13.280> help<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.640> diagnose

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
and then that'll help you diagnose

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.809 
and then that'll help you diagnose
what's<00:02:14.750> actually<00:02:14.900> causing<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.380> issue<00:02:15.819> so

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
what's actually causing the issue so

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.309 
what's actually causing the issue so
again<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.300> very<00:02:17.450> handy<00:02:17.660> program<00:02:18.110> it

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
again this is a very handy program it

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.660 
again this is a very handy program it
will<00:02:18.410> work<00:02:18.530> through<00:02:18.740> Windows<00:02:18.980> XP<00:02:19.370> all<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.610> way

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
will work through Windows XP all the way

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.270 
will work through Windows XP all the way
