considering this charger that being said
I<00:02:13.349> think

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I think

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.090 
I think
cases<00:02:14.610> like<00:02:14.640> otterbox<00:02:15.330> may<00:02:15.690> give<00:02:15.900> you

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
cases like otterbox may give you

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.230 
cases like otterbox may give you

charging problems although i don't know

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.970 
charging problems although i don't know
because<00:02:18.600> i<00:02:18.630> haven't<00:02:18.840> tested<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:19.560> how<00:02:19.800> long

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
because i haven't tested it so how long

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.950 
because i haven't tested it so how long
does<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.220> take<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.730> charge<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.180> phone<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.720> says

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
does it take to charge a phone it says

charge<00:02:26.220> time<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.640> think<00:02:26.730> LG<00:02:27.330> was<00:02:27.570> being

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
charge time I think LG was being

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.360 
charge time I think LG was being
extremely<00:02:28.440> conservative<00:02:28.860> with<00:02:29.220> this

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
extremely conservative with this

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.070 
extremely conservative with this

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
statement as they probably calculated

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.030

different<00:02:31.380> times<00:02:31.560> under<00:02:31.860> different

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
conditions and that was the average I'm

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.900 
conditions and that was the average I'm
here<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.140> tell<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.440> drained<00:02:34.800> my<00:02:34.950> Nexus<00:02:35.400> 5's

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.130 
case on the phone at the time of this
test<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.790> phone<00:02:45.060> was<00:02:45.270> essentially<00:02:45.720> naked<00:02:46.050> I

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
test the phone was essentially naked I

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.020 
test the phone was essentially naked I
was<00:02:46.350> pleasantly<00:02:46.740> surprised<00:02:47.190> as<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.850> phone

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
was pleasantly surprised as the phone

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.300 
was pleasantly surprised as the phone
was<00:02:48.240> completely<00:02:48.690> charged<00:02:49.080> in<00:02:49.230> under<00:02:49.650> 3<00:02:49.950> hours

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
was completely charged in under 3 hours

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.070 
was completely charged in under 3 hours
and<00:02:50.550> 10<00:02:50.760> minutes<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.420> should<00:02:51.630> expect<00:02:51.960> the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
and 10 minutes you should expect the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.810 
and 10 minutes you should expect the
same<00:02:52.140> results<00:02:52.320> without<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> case<00:02:53.220> as<00:02:53.400> well<00:02:53.580> I've

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
same results without a case as well I've

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.160 
same results without a case as well I've
noticed<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.270> case<00:02:54.420> doesn't<00:02:54.690> adversely

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
noticed the case doesn't adversely

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.500 
noticed the case doesn't adversely
affect<00:02:55.770> charging<00:02:56.280> time<00:02:56.490> but<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:57.030> did<00:02:57.180> notice

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
affect charging time but I did notice

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.120 
affect charging time but I did notice
that<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.780> does<00:02:57.930> slow<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.200> down<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.410> bit<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.800> if<00:02:59.010> I

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
that it does slow it down a bit so if I

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.530 
that it does slow it down a bit so if I
were<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.400> make<00:02:59.490> an<00:02:59.640> educated<00:03:00.030> guess<00:03:00.150> on

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
were to make an educated guess on

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.180 
were to make an educated guess on
charging<00:03:01.080> time<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.290> would<00:03:01.560> say<00:03:01.800> that<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.070> would

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
charging time I would say that it would

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.830 
charging time I would say that it would
take<00:03:02.280> around<00:03:02.460> 3<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:03.000> half<00:03:03.090> hours<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.690> fully

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
take around 3 and a half hours to fully

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.020 
take around 3 and a half hours to fully
charge<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.500> same<00:03:04.770> 2300<00:03:05.550> milliamp<00:03:05.880> hour

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
charge that same 2300 milliamp hour

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.090 
charge that same 2300 milliamp hour
