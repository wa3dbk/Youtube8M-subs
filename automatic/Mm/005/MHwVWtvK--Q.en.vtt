00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.790
 Bergmann and others what is your name then you 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.540
 as a spectator you probably look 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:18.000
 watching this video because it is at mr 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.380
 Bergmann and I do it all 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.619
 unprofessional that some mean 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:30.359
 youtube videos also do not advertise 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:32.430
 just not in any case you look 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.380
 the video grad because I'm at the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:41.600
 Mr. Bergmann posted in the comments 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:43.520
 when he was an inspiration for that 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.820
 mine 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.640
 This is a small mountain from Queenston 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.199
 I thought so because a stone is 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:59.489
 kbc has infinite and with wood 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.840
 you can easily do that for 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.290
 burn and that's why I'm there 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.100
 we have to say outside right away 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.570
 I apologize as one 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.130
 thunderstorm noises are not 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.380
 Intended is outside thunderstorm 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.790
 In any case, we have the entrance 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.590
 decorated with leaves and jan when the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.130
 Scissors should be broken somehow 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.259
 so you had herrenberg man to simon 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.140
 he has everything I have pumping 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.750
 Seen in the last one has something 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.860
 hazards 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.200
 leaflets and wine for years for 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.780
 his tree house then we have here 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.970
 So be the one wing where 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.170
 dransteht old mine shaft 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.990
 Danger of death when entering so naturally 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.149
 not the main entrance because you will yes 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.439
 die if you be there that is of 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.600
 therefore you go through the main entrance 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.060
 who has so buttress stop here 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.070
 torches on the wall and here it is 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.950
 exit like a small window 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.960
 I thought I set the house 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.640
 not yet because the diner 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.720
 artistic freedom salary 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.940
 should correspond 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.230
 would have also wanted these greens 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.620
 element I do not know how in here 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.820
 grown but is does not matter 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.530
 then one has to keep checking here and 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.120
 workbench if that so much that caro me 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.430
 let out, I thought it we adapt 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.390
 Well, here's just a small one 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.400
 lounge in the hedge you just have to look 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.010
 whose taste that is so one should 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.380
 taste and is actually about the 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.060
 interior stop and that stops here 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.520
 the mine from the inside you can still 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.959
 expand nicely 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.209
 but just for the small place had 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.290
 I thought that's something 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:56.250
 fine so the whole stop looks from the beginning 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:00.900
 I'm not a big mountain now either 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.430
 completely eroded everything and is 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.650
 was hollowed out already built 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.390
 mr right that looked a the 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.330
 a little bit unfair makes me like one from 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.100
 probably looks white up here 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.290
 not exactly what to save the mars me 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:24.090
 just have 15 times 20 carlsson 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:25.440
 were moved about just work under stand 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.829
 is here so that everyone knows who here 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.400
 lives herberg mainz small mountain who 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:35.040
 you can see then then yes in 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.340
 aura then the ground so off and then here 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:48.120
 can you as an input halt 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:50.850
 inadvertently uninstall in any case 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.790
 I hope you like my little one 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.120
 mine and I hope you considered 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.120
 that
