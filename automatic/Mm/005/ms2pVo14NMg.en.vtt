can<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.360> little<00:01:39.360> hole<00:01:39.540> punch<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.500> that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
can see the little hole punch here that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.469 
can see the little hole punch here that
hasn't<00:01:40.890> even<00:01:41.009> been<00:01:41.280> conscious<00:01:41.970> look<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
hasn't even been conscious look out that

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.920 
hasn't even been conscious look out that
little<00:01:42.689> piece<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.079> cardboard<00:01:44.630> where<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> did

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
little piece of cardboard where it did

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.810 
little piece of cardboard where it did
probably<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.700> originally

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
probably one this one was originally

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.569 
probably one this one was originally
purchased<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:49.350> does<00:01:49.470> not<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> year<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.399> it

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
purchased it does not have a year on it

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.490 
purchased it does not have a year on it
but<00:01:50.729> I'm<00:01:50.820> fairly<00:01:51.180> certain<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.229> from

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
but I'm fairly certain that it is from

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.700 
but I'm fairly certain that it is from
1985<00:01:53.360> because<00:01:54.360> I'm<00:01:54.479> fairly<00:01:54.930> certain<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.409> was

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
1985 because I'm fairly certain that was

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.429 
1985 because I'm fairly certain that was
the<00:01:55.829> year<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.219> pope<00:01:56.520> had<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.909> license<00:01:57.439> so

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
the year that a pope had the license so

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.069 
the year that a pope had the license so
it<00:01:58.530> comes<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:58.920> little<00:01:59.040> Goku<00:01:59.549> here<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.930> his

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
it comes with little Goku here and his

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.899 
it comes with little Goku here and his

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
particular one has that I just kind of

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.220 
particular one has that I just kind of
got<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.120> kick<00:02:15.330> out<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.870> still<00:02:16.200> has

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
got a kick out of is that it still has

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.480 
got a kick out of is that it still has
the<00:02:16.650> original<00:02:18.170> price<00:02:19.170> tag<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.740> think<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.340> is

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
the original price tag I think this is

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.100 
the original price tag I think this is
I'm<00:02:20.670> pretty<00:02:21.090> sure<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.390> simple<00:02:21.750> for<00:02:21.840> yen

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
I'm pretty sure this is simple for yen

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.210 
I'm pretty sure this is simple for yen
so<00:02:23.100> this<00:02:23.190> cost<00:02:23.430> 800<00:02:23.970> yen<00:02:24.090> back<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:25.100> in<00:02:26.150> 1985<00:02:28.220> and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
so this cost 800 yen back in in 1985 and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.890 
so this cost 800 yen back in in 1985 and
on<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.400> back<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.760> has<00:02:29.910> some<00:02:30.060> really<00:02:30.450> hilarious

and<00:03:11.310> as<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.880> can<00:03:12.000> see<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.360> comes<00:03:12.570> with<00:03:12.750> a

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
and as you can see it comes with a

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.770 
and as you can see it comes with a
little<00:03:13.460> pad<00:03:14.460> on<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.850> bottom<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.240> says<00:03:15.270> dragon

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
little pad on the bottom it says dragon

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
I think allows Goku to do some sort of a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.600 
I think allows Goku to do some sort of a
little<00:03:20.580> bit<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:21.950> racist<00:03:22.950> foot<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.250> little<00:03:23.430> bit

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
ends up getting in the way so let's see

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.950 
ends up getting in the way so let's see
if<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.320> can<00:03:34.440> get<00:03:34.530> him<00:03:34.620> over<00:03:34.770> here

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.600 

honestly<00:03:39.960> I<00:03:40.050> can't<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.130> don't<00:03:41.190> want

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
honestly I can't and I and I don't want

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:49.800 
honestly I can't and I and I don't want
to<00:03:41.670> force<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.920> one<00:03:43.920> more<00:03:44.070> time

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.890 

now<00:03:50.350> actually<00:03:50.890> it's<00:03:51.280> uh<00:03:51.430> well<00:03:51.850> he<00:03:52.120> cannot<00:03:52.600> stay

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
now actually it's uh well he cannot stay

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.440 
now actually it's uh well he cannot stay
about<00:03:53.080> it<00:03:53.260> I<00:03:53.440> think<00:03:54.220> if<00:03:54.340> he<00:03:54.459> could<00:03:54.670> stand<00:03:55.030> on<00:03:55.240> it

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
about it I think if he could stand on it

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.870 
about it I think if he could stand on it
it<00:03:55.720> would<00:03:55.990> when<00:03:56.410> I<00:03:56.440> press<00:03:56.709> this<00:03:56.890> it<00:03:57.069> allows<00:03:57.310> his

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
it would when I press this it allows his

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.150 
it would when I press this it allows his
his<00:03:58.360> his<00:03:58.810> back<00:03:59.050> foot<00:03:59.410> to<00:03:59.530> come<00:03:59.680> up<00:03:59.860> a<00:03:59.890> little
