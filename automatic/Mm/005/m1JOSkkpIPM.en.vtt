better understand this let's take a look
at<00:01:19.170> one<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.410> these<00:01:19.560> numbers

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
at one of these numbers

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.750 
at one of these numbers
here<00:01:22.450> is<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.780> number<00:01:22.930> 14<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.490> number

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
here is the number 14 and in the number

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.990 
here is the number 14 and in the number
14<00:01:25.270> we<00:01:25.479> have<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.690> 1<00:01:26.049> in<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.350> tens<00:01:26.560> place<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.670> 4
