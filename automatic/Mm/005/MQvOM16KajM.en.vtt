00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.290
 Tell me the beauty, have you got it? 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.599
 speaking the toy then the subject that I will 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.000
 comment on this video is about the process 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.160
 2.0 he talks about what I found in 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.260
 my opinion 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 I separated topics for you beauty 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.619
 so come on, my house will clean the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.660
 first topic system was created since 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.789
 start talking about the ranked system 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.010
 because it's something I'm seeing here 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.689
 A lot of people are playing and I'm serious. 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.540
 I played that vicious stop. 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.440
 I picked up platinum and stopped I just want one 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.540
 bad team 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.700
 I was very angry but I did not like it 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.739
 of that system is torn if you ask 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.870
 and that is at the end of the match you do not 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.579
 lose point and something else that left me 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.410
 very shaken was if you take in the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.239
 activity you lose point 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.399
 even going back to the room at least 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.829
 happened to me i was already in the final 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.140
 of gold 6 and on the page and also in 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.820
 because it was attending the gate and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.820
 when I got back I was at the beginning of the year 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.280
 six weeks seriously I'm complaining 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.049
 this noise of losing point but I 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.810
 I also did 60 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.060
 everybody is doing and not funny 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.180
 If so, you ask that you are at the end. 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.830
 can be one loses point I made myself face but 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.110
 I did it because it was the only way I 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.030
 I was looking for shit but I could not 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.200
 I knew that I was going to know about this stop 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.880
 when it was 6k gold and this can walk 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.340
 very fast because the guy is there to 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.979
 fuck your team's team loses net 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.710
 no lose point will only end the game is 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.310
 This is a fuck, but it's a cool system. 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.619
 dj playing and crossfire invested well and only 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.820
 You have to fix this for my books. 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.549
 clean house 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.390
 The second topic is the motivation of what 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.460
 motivation 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.710
 I think they liked the 40 did 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.259
 many people who had to play 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.140
 and I have seen many people who 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.479
 had stopped playing afterwards 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.820
 this update and I think sometimes 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.409
 hit perfectly in updating the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.020
 The first time I played and I went to play. 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.659
 a widow 2.0 tfsi was sending today 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.700
 I had been very shaken but it took 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.679
 15 because I had forgotten about myself 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.789
 that room effect stop then 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.619
 was no fun 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.110
 After you have it, I get Joseph. 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.590
 now play normal to classes 2010 the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.720
 quiet my face the third 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.150
 topic is about the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.430
 so when I said I was going to make a 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.080
 update 2.0-based video 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.940
 notice the comments you had 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.970
 some people complaining that they did not 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.239
 got more play than getting a screen 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.360
 black that it does not know of talking people 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.739
 that the game was not catching anymore then 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.900
 almost nothing with me thought I had 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.370
 I ran away in a game too but then I went 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.489
 so I was playing more with 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.140
 rooms 80 in my case the fpf but later 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.319
 I noticed that I had to put the room in the 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.930
 between quotation marks since this is the case 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.590
 You, but notice and about the noble game. 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.690
 the hottest is to install it again or 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.840
 format your computer if you did not know 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.739
 know how to speak with me who knows or seeks 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.380
 a technician in the area who will help you 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.910
 should be around $ 100 here where 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.880
 I live in trouble with real works for 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.700
 put all my house clean 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.049
 The fifth topic is general I will start 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.000
 talking about something that seems 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.160
 idiot but it's not right 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.130
 I thought the site would get me that 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.959
 tattoo in arm the site belle 0 found 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.980
 very promptly I also expected one of 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.470
 22 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.459
 I really think it is that the light 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.530
 for the game 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.700
 I think it's too little just a widow. 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.680
 ship egypt 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.090
 I do not know if these three but at least I 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.859
 I played your stars. 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.810
 I have not particularly played said yet 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.389
 and I'm not playing 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.250
 the widow on a ship and am using a 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.700
 character leaves the old one this character 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.620
 2.0 I'm very godon at last the beautiful 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.250
 Are you playing with six points? 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.790
 is solving the nba 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.290
 It's a guy on the edge of the conppac there. 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.060
 be understood as the first curve with 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.420
 the businessman points hand 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.400
 Thank you and I did not even notice that I was 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.210
 playing with 62 points 0 has been fixed 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.350
 after the ceiling I am editing a video 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:13.360
 and there were also people committed in the 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.420
 widow considers going-will enchant and 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.910
 said 'no guy will not worth 5 in the field 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.250
 and I'm sure I had in China 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.620

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.150
 enter the Chinese channel crossfire that there 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.720

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.120
 announce and that's right there they go 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.780
 continue an ancient tradition and we 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.970
 Let's follow my house clean and 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.620
 topic is know that marx 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.660
 I do not know if it's true but for what? 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.040
 I'm knowing if you change brands. 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.740
 now you were so good 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.740
 permanent you know I liked it 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.419
 much to see the ace more prepared and 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.730
 I just do not like it and I do not know if it is either. 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:56.200
 But I was not going to risk it and 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.640
 if you know something is there that would comment on 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.760
 check the comments 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.160

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.110

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.660
 Leave it here, your life, a whore, and if you 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.260
