00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
the Lich to logic offski definitely just

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.300 
the Lich to logic offski definitely just
because<00:03:34.240> of<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.630> dribbling<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:36.070> fact

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
because of the dribbling and the fact

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.470 
because of the dribbling and the fact
that<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.520> actually<00:03:36.700> managed<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.060> get<00:03:37.240> a<00:03:37.300> goal

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
I think it's a fairly decent goal when

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.040 
I think it's a fairly decent goal when
the<00:03:48.940> goal<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.180> actually<00:03:49.330> comes<00:03:49.630> up<00:03:49.780> this<00:03:49.900> is

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050

another assist he's really good at
passing<00:03:52.090> he's<00:03:52.660> dribbling<00:03:52.870> seemed<00:03:53.260> pretty

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470
