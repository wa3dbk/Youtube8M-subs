plug than me mcclure station good
so<00:01:33.220> it's<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:35.410> they<00:01:36.410> can<00:01:36.620> work<00:01:37.010> without

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
so it's so that they can work without

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.660 
so it's so that they can work without
having<00:01:38.030> an<00:01:38.090> internal<00:01:38.480> power<00:01:38.660> supply<00:01:38.870> which<00:01:39.320> is

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
one of obviously one of the reasons why

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.110 
one of obviously one of the reasons why
it's<00:01:42.650> a<00:01:42.710> lot<00:01:42.890> smaller<00:01:45.400> you<00:01:46.400> know<00:01:46.490> this<00:01:46.730> console
