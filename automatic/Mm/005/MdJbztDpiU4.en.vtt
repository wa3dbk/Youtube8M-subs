00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.450
 I wrote it. I think there are people who do not like to gather people. 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:17.640
 Well, actually , it's a good festival. 4 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:21.359
 I hate meeting them and I can not. Ah ah ah ah I know what you mean. 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.789
 But at some point, 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:29.170
 Yes. 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.119
 I think that's a bit frankly 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.180
 There was a lot of discussion. 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.150
 I 'd like to have a reply. 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.940
 Ahn Chul Su 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:44.290
 It's good to start with the popularity 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:48.580
 I never heard ever we meet Uncle Beta 8 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.960
 Uh, this is a debate. Ah ah ah. Ballet belief in the moment. 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.330
 I know 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.330
 I 'll rush you there. 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.049
 You will need you tell us what is the purpose 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.040
 Oh, I heard you. 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:09.280
 But I never said I was going to do politics . 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.610
 And I never thought about it again. 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.229
 4 I got the approval rating 4 So then 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.780
 The approval rating for me is different from the approval rating of those who said they would stay 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:24.400
 So I got the idea this 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.659
 If you misunderstand that it is the approval rate to write down politics , 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.640
 I have an idea. 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:34.360
 But for example, who exactly easy to raise its September 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.040
 The market left running Srinagar 4 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.240
 I'll ask you. 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.240
 But you saw him run. 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:54.010
 Oh , I do not think so, so let's actually run for the market . 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.240
 I think it's about 10% . The Arthur Youth Concert is now over in September. 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.410
 It was . 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.520
 After that, I was keen to think twice about it. 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:07.810
 But suddenly it was like a newspaper article. 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:14.080
 It's the last step. I decided to leave it alone. 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.370
 In fact , the fact is now that the confusion is over. 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.230
 Well 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:24.310
 So no going syeotdeon no idea Yes. So now I have reported that, 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.459
 The next day was another youth concert at Seodaemun Ward. 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.989
 So, of course, there are a lot of reporters now . 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:36.310
 The first time I saw him after the flash is so much popping in front of my whole life 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.519
 During long time coming, and now that catch ooo 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.519
 4 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:50.790
 Oh, but the market had a question about the role. 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:56.430
 Yes, so I have to be objective 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.930
 The market was high and I think many geuraetdeoni change ah this is the decision 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.310
 I already finished it. 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:08.930
 Oh , now you have to interpret the unit price that you step on. 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:11.129
 So, uh me to think that indeed wotdeon not remember then fell 10% 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.549
 You thought of running . 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:18.989
 4 10% Received Progress Has Come Out 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.980
 The article comes out like this. If you do not get it 12 times 14 times several times a day 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.099
 In charge of 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.240
 Did you say that very much in Chapter 1 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:29.810
 Because he was the one who read the book, 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.920
 * The only province tidal bonder 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.620
 U 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:41.060
 It's not what I know. It's going to be faster on the stairs . 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:45.770
 But just how do malyijyo had been talking about him, I think you say Yes 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:53.569
 Because the person who did the business , the businessman can not succeed if it is indecisive. 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:58.010
 Uh than as executive Egg time as a professor, I teach students at the university 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:02.690
 Time is quiet much longer and, as well as the fact that the Institute should grow Perth 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:07.910
 Even the chairman of the board of the big company is very long if you take it all at once. 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:11.000
 During the period, Kim is now able to quickly make decisions that not only he hit 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:16.489
 So where were you at 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.639
 I think the expression " milk tart" is a phrase that is far from my life . 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.600
 The Park Won-soon, then mayor approval rating was a huge gap malyijyo 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:29.360
 At that time, I wrote a phrase such as giving up fullness. 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:32.419
 As a quick choice now that you're done as a fait accompli in the press 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.680
 I thought I'd have to make up my mind quickly. 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.000
 I had to do it for the 17th minute, 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.560
 I did not. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.390
 I do not know if she said she was 17 . 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.430
 Terakan think the word came out about 20 minutes 17 recall giving different doelteya 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.600
 He 's been talking for ten more minutes. 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.930
 Yes. I'm curious . I gave you a splitter. 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.550
 Word that 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:07.860
 I thought I had to listen to my thoughts . 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.860
 Now it was that before knew minutes, then at that time, so now replaced
