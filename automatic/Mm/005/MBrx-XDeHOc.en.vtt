00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.190 
there's two things that the 911 hybrid
can<00:02:01.460> do<00:02:01.640> while<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.479> can<00:02:02.510> go<00:02:02.720> out<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:02.869> prove<00:02:03.050> the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
can do while it can go out and prove the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.780 
can do while it can go out and prove the
technology<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.860> improve<00:02:04.159> it<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.400> second

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
technology and improve it the second

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.190 
technology and improve it the second
thing<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.119> possibly<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.570> most<00:02:05.690> important

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
thing and possibly the most important

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.840 
thing and possibly the most important
thing<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.500> change<00:02:06.830> attitudes<00:02:07.369> it's<00:02:07.610> fast

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
thing is to change attitudes it's fast

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.120 
thing is to change attitudes it's fast
it's<00:02:08.060> sexy<00:02:08.390> it's<00:02:08.780> drivable<00:02:09.319> it<00:02:09.770> has<00:02:09.979> an

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
it's sexy it's drivable it has an

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.770 
it's sexy it's drivable it has an
advantage<00:02:10.399> over<00:02:10.610> other<00:02:11.150> cars<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.660> are

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
advantage over other cars that are

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.199 
advantage over other cars that are
similar<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:13.130> huge<00:02:13.670> what<00:02:14.030> we've<00:02:14.180> got

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
similar to it it's huge what we've got

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.600 
similar to it it's huge what we've got
to<00:02:14.450> do<00:02:14.569> here<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.989> put<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.830> car<00:02:16.069> forward<00:02:16.489> and

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
to do here is put that car forward and

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.850 
to do here is put that car forward and
say<00:02:16.819> here's<00:02:17.480> part<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.080> solution<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.680> may

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
say here's part of the solution it may

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.440 
say here's part of the solution it may
not<00:02:19.010> be<00:02:19.069> all<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.610> solution<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.180> certainly

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
not be all of the solution and certainly

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.850 
not be all of the solution and certainly
not<00:02:20.569> all<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.959> solution<00:02:21.350> for<00:02:21.470> all<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.770> the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
not all of the solution for all of the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.070 
not all of the solution for all of the
people<00:02:22.040> but<00:02:22.610> hybrid<00:02:22.940> technology<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.660> coming

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
people but hybrid technology is coming

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.990 
people but hybrid technology is coming
particularly<00:02:24.680> with<00:02:24.890> petrol<00:02:25.250> engines<00:02:25.610> the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
particularly with petrol engines the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.850 
particularly with petrol engines the
door<00:02:26.209> look<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:26.570> milk<00:02:26.840> floats<00:02:27.110> they<00:02:27.650> don't

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
door look like milk floats they don't

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.890 
door look like milk floats they don't
look<00:02:27.980> like<00:02:28.040> golf<00:02:28.459> carts<00:02:28.880> they're<00:02:29.269> not<00:02:29.510> slow

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
look like golf carts they're not slow

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.190 
look like golf carts they're not slow
this<00:02:30.709> is<00:02:31.150> performance<00:02:32.150> hybrid<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.019> same

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
this is performance hybrid in the same

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.509 
this is performance hybrid in the same
way<00:02:33.260> as<00:02:33.560> other<00:02:33.590> manufacturers<00:02:34.250> have<00:02:34.370> done

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
way as other manufacturers have done

00:02:34.519 --> 00:03:17.620 
way as other manufacturers have done
with<00:02:34.670> diesel

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.270 

what<00:03:18.050> we're<00:03:18.230> learning<00:03:18.380> is<00:03:18.740> how<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:18.920> harness

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
what we're learning is how to harness

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.790 
what we're learning is how to harness
this<00:03:19.610> power<00:03:19.670> how<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.510> make<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.810> usable<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.680> it

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
this power how to make it usable and it

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.110 
this power how to make it usable and it
goodness<00:03:22.220> me<00:03:22.400> if<00:03:22.550> we<00:03:22.640> can<00:03:22.790> make<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:22.970> happen

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
goodness me if we can make that happen

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.060 
goodness me if we can make that happen
in<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.510> race<00:03:23.690> car<00:03:23.990> then<00:03:24.530> it's<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.800> damn<00:03:25.040> sight

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
in a race car then it's a damn sight

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.910 
in a race car then it's a damn sight
easier<00:03:25.340> when<00:03:25.880> we<00:03:25.970> come<00:03:26.150> back<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.920> retrofitting

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
easier when we come back to retrofitting

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.550 
easier when we come back to retrofitting
it<00:03:28.010> into<00:03:28.460> a<00:03:28.790> road<00:03:29.300> car<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:29.870> making<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:30.380> work

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
it into a road car and making that work

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.950 
it into a road car and making that work
on<00:03:30.740> the<00:03:30.860> street

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.150 

it's<00:03:39.960> a<00:03:40.050> little<00:03:40.200> bit<00:03:40.290> like<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.410> race<00:03:40.620> lab<00:03:40.950> you

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
it's a little bit like a race lab you

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.250 
it's a little bit like a race lab you
know<00:03:41.280> for<00:03:41.520> us<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.270> for<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.660> engineers<00:03:43.050> you

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
know for us to to for the engineers you

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.350 
know for us to to for the engineers you
don't<00:03:43.410> develop<00:03:43.650> further<00:03:44.370> their<00:03:44.730> technology

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
don't develop further their technology

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.420 
don't develop further their technology
to<00:03:45.780> bring<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.080> hybrid<00:03:46.380> technology<00:03:46.920> also<00:03:47.100> over

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
to bring the hybrid technology also over

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.400 
to bring the hybrid technology also over
to<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.670> US<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.210> to<00:03:48.600> show<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.990> to<00:03:49.020> the<00:03:49.260> people

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
to the US and to show it to the people

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.370 
to the US and to show it to the people
and<00:03:50.010> also<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.370> learn<00:03:50.610> more

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.230 

the<00:03:54.860> engine<00:03:55.160> is<00:03:55.220> like<00:03:55.460> this<00:03:55.640> also<00:03:55.910> learn

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
the engine is like this also learn

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.090 
the engine is like this also learn
something<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:56.930> know<00:03:57.050> probably<00:03:57.470> for<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:57.890> road

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
something you know probably for the road

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.010 
something you know probably for the road
castles<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:58.790> think<00:03:59.180> it's<00:03:59.300> a<00:03:59.360> good<00:03:59.480> step<00:03:59.720> forward

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
castles I think it's a good step forward

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.470 
castles I think it's a good step forward
and<00:04:00.200> I'm<00:04:00.470> really<00:04:01.100> a<00:04:01.250> little<00:04:01.970> bit<00:04:02.060> on<00:04:02.210> earth<00:04:02.360> as

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
and I'm really a little bit on earth as

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.140 
and I'm really a little bit on earth as
well<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.840> know<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.050> be<00:04:03.140> part<00:04:03.440> of<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:04.090> for<00:04:05.090> the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
well you know to be part of that for the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.760 
well you know to be part of that for the
first<00:04:05.360> time<00:04:05.510> racing<00:04:05.720> over<00:04:06.080> here<00:04:06.320> in<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.500> US

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
first time racing over here in the US

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.980 
first time racing over here in the US
and<00:04:07.160> I<00:04:07.280> think<00:04:07.490> the<00:04:07.580> fans<00:04:07.850> they<00:04:08.540> will<00:04:08.720> love<00:04:08.840> this

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
and I think the fans they will love this

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:26.990 
and I think the fans they will love this
car<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.380> see

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.060 

well<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.030> mean<00:04:28.270> at<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.570> beginning<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.110> was<00:04:30.040> a

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
well I mean at the beginning is was a

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.190 
well I mean at the beginning is was a
rough<00:04:30.250> start<00:04:30.430> for<00:04:30.550> us<00:04:30.760> 42<00:04:31.450> and<00:04:31.630> scheduled<00:04:32.080> pit

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
rough start for us 42 and scheduled pit

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.620 
rough start for us 42 and scheduled pit
stops<00:04:32.470> we<00:04:33.040> had<00:04:33.160> waited<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:33.850> very<00:04:34.150> good<00:04:34.480> team

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
stops we had waited a very good team

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.600 
stops we had waited a very good team
together<00:04:34.780> with<00:04:35.140> remind<00:04:35.470> mike<00:04:35.680> also<00:04:36.370> we're

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
together with remind mike also we're

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.310 
together with remind mike also we're
very<00:04:36.640> happy<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.330> drive<00:04:37.600> with<00:04:37.750> him<00:04:37.870> again<00:04:38.140> after

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
very happy to drive with him again after

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.130 
very happy to drive with him again after
the<00:04:38.620> morn<00:04:38.830> after<00:04:39.040> spotted<00:04:39.670> we<00:04:39.790> did<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.210> as<00:04:40.720> I

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
the morn after spotted we did and as I

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.830 
the morn after spotted we did and as I
think<00:04:41.530> we<00:04:41.590> had<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.740> good<00:04:41.830> time<00:04:42.040> here<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:42.600> what<00:04:43.600> I

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
think we had a good time here and what I

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.110 
think we had a good time here and what I
think<00:04:44.560> at<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.680> bottom<00:04:44.950> line<00:04:45.130> we<00:04:45.850> did<00:04:45.970> a<00:04:46.000> good

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
think at the bottom line we did a good

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.240 
think at the bottom line we did a good
job<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.450> guess<00:04:47.880> now<00:04:48.880> we<00:04:48.940> had<00:04:49.180> our<00:04:49.330> difficulties

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
job I guess now we had our difficulties

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.640 
job I guess now we had our difficulties
definitely<00:04:51.250> we<00:04:51.520> are<00:04:51.550> I<00:04:51.990> would<00:04:52.990> say<00:04:53.140> not<00:04:53.290> happy

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
definitely we are I would say not happy

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.310 
definitely we are I would say not happy
with<00:04:53.860> which<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.610> position<00:04:55.060> we<00:04:55.210> are<00:04:55.240> in<00:04:55.419> but

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
with which the position we are in but

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.409 
with which the position we are in but
overall<00:04:57.010> I<00:04:57.220> would<00:04:57.460> say<00:04:57.610> it's<00:04:57.880> good<00:04:58.060> to<00:04:58.240> finish

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
overall I would say it's good to finish

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.659 
overall I would say it's good to finish
we<00:04:59.230> learned<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.590> lot<00:04:59.740> you<00:04:59.950> know<00:05:00.070> about<00:05:00.490> the

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
we learned a lot you know about the

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.200 
we learned a lot you know about the
hybrid<00:05:01.030> again<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:03.460> know<00:05:03.610> for<00:05:03.790> the<00:05:03.820> team<00:05:04.030> it

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
hybrid again you know for the team it

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.880 
hybrid again you know for the team it
was<00:05:04.390> good<00:05:04.630> for<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.900> mechanics<00:05:05.440> you<00:05:05.710> know<00:05:05.830> to

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
was good for the mechanics you know to

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.590 
was good for the mechanics you know to
get<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:06.310> experience<00:05:06.700> I<00:05:08.970> was<00:05:09.970> right<00:05:10.180> not

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
get that experience I was right not

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.240 
get that experience I was right not
surprised<00:05:10.990> but<00:05:11.260> I<00:05:11.320> was<00:05:11.470> quite<00:05:11.650> happy<00:05:11.680> to<00:05:11.950> see

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
surprised but I was quite happy to see

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.370 
surprised but I was quite happy to see
how<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.730> audience<00:05:13.030> here<00:05:13.480> the<00:05:13.600> fans<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:14.140> the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
how the audience here the fans and the
